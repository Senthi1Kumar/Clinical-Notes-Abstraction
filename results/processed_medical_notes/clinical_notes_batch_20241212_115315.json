Two years later he had a cutaneous recurrence confirmed to be carcinoma in situ. In October 2014, right axillary adenopathy was noted demonstrating poorly differentiated metastatic SCC. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed bulky right axillary and retropectoral lymphadenopathy. Lymph node dissection in November 2014 confirmed 7 of 22 positive nodes for metastatic disease. Postoperative PET scan demonstrated mildly FDG-avid right pectoral lymph nodes believed to be reactive and a small area of increased uptake in the transverse colon of uncertain significance.

This therapy was completed in February 2015, and subsequent imagining including PET/CT scans in August 2015 and February 2016 demonstrated low-grade metabolic uptake in the region of the right shoulder and axilla, consistent with posttreatment changes without any evidence of active disease, including no evidence of increased colonic uptake. On February 22, 2016 the patient underwent a routine screening colonoscopy, which did not demonstrate any lesion in the transverse colon, but a small area of nodular polypoid tissue within a diverticulum of the sigmoid colon was identified (Fig ).

These findings were confirmed on histology and immunohistochemical stains (pancytokeratin AW1/AE3 and p63 positive, CK20 negative).

His prior repair consisted of a Bentall with hemiarch without need for total arch replacement, and there was no evidence of residual arch dissection at presentation. The anatomy of the type B dissection was as follows: a large proximal entry tear distal to the left subclavian artery (, A), a distal re-entry tear proximal to the celiac axis (, B), and a maximum aneurysm diameter of 6.2 cm. The dissection extended through the visceral segment into the right common and left external iliac arteries, with the superior mesenteric, renal, and inferior mesenteric arteries arising off of the true lumen and the celiac artery arising off of the false lumen. The aneurysm was limited to the descending thoracic aorta, with adequate access vessels and a proximal seal zone in native, nondissected aorta of at least 20 mm in length. The proximity of the distal re-entry tear to the origin of the celiac artery (<5 mm) raised concern about the risk of a stent-induced new entry tear as well as possible dissection into the celiac artery. Therefore, the decision was made to land the endograft in the true lumen cephalad to the distal re-entry tear. In the midthoracic aorta, the true lumen appeared to be either severely compressed or occluded on preoperative computed tomography angiography (, C).

    "original_text": "A 15-year-old obese boy visited our clinic with a painful hip on the left side. The complaints arose one year earlier after he had fallen on his hip. At that time a mild epiphysiolysis was diagnosed on presentation in the emergency room. He was admitted with bed rest and three days later an in situ fixation was performed with one cannulated screw (Figure ). The postoperative recovery was without complications and he was pain free after a few weeks. As it was thought that the fracture had consolidated, the screw was removed 11 weeks after initial placement. After this procedure had been performed his hip became increasingly painful and he experienced reduced mobility. Ten weeks after the screw removal, he fell again, complaining once again of severe pain in his hip.

She had previously visited a nearby hospital and had been conservatively treated with intra-articular injection of a mixture of local anesthetic and corticosteroid. Radiography of her left shoulder at that time looked normal (). However, some collapse of the humeral head was found 5 months after symptom onset (). Despite the radiological findings, she desired conservative treatment. However, her pain persisted, even at night, and she was referred to our hospital for further treatment, 2 years after symptom onset. A physical examination conducted at our hospital revealed that her left shoulder was not swollen, with an active range of motion of 170\u00b0 in flexion and 10\u00b0 in external rotation; the internal rotation level was at L5. Neurological abnormalities were not noted and her blood test results did not show evidence of infectious disease or rheumatoid arthritis. Her synovial fluid was blood-stained but negative for crystals or infection. Additionally, her lumbar spine BMD (%YAM) was 67%.\nRadiography demonstrated that the humeral head was slightly displaced inferiorly, but its shape was maintained at the time of symptom onset (). Subsequent radiographs, taken 5 months later, revealed collapse of the humeral head (). Upon the patient's first visit to our hospital, 2 years after symptom onset, the radiographs demonstrated bone defects of the glenoid (). At symptom onset, oblique coronal MRI showed joint effusion and slight collapse of the humeral head (). An axial T1-weighted MRI showed a subchondral serpiginous pattern of low signal intensity with associated bone marrow edema (). At our hospital, oblique coronal MRI demonstrated the collapse of the humeral head, but the rotator cuff remained intact.

She reported a mild headache however had no change from her baseline mentation per family members with no evidence of obvious injury aside from a small area of ecchymosis near a small forehead laceration. She remained up and ambulatory with no further complaints. Ten hours after her injury the patient presented to the Emergency Department with stridorous and agonal respirations with a profoundly decreased level of consciousness. She was noted to have developed extensive ecchymosis on the anterior portion of her neck and chest. Her symptoms had begun rapidly shortly prior to arrival while lying in bed. Family reported that she had been in the constant company of her husband with no further falls or injuries that had occurred since her fall. The patient was intubated upon hospital arrival due to respiratory extremis with obvious swelling and crepitus noted on neck examination. A noncontrast CT scan of head was unremarkable while there was demonstration of a large retropharyngeal hematoma measuring 3.6 cm by 5.3 cm by 20 cm on a CT of the cervical spine with no evidence of fracture. Her hemoglobin was 9.5 gm/dL and platelets were 1234 per deciliter, with an INR of 3 and a slightly below normal and activated partial thromboplastin time of 23.9 seconds (reference range 25-35 seconds). A CT angiogram of the neck was subsequently obtained demonstrating active bleeding from the anterior ligaments of the vertebral column that was not felt to be amenable to embolization ().

    "original_text": "A 30-year-old African-American male patient presenting to the hospital for trauma injuries to his abdomen. He had sustained a gunshot wound, which necessitated an exploratory laparotomy along with a small bowel resection. The patient had to have an ileocecostomy done. He initially improved but on the third day post operatively he became very short of breath and hypoxic. High flow cannula was initiated and a work up for the possible etiologies of hypoxemia was undertaken. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest with intravenous contrast was performed and was notable for a pulmonary embolism (PE) in third and fourth order segmental branches of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery. Heparin infusion was started for treatment.\nThe usual protocol with aPTT monitoring, for the dose appropriation of heparin infusion, was initiated. During the following period it was found to be difficult to achieve a therapeutic range for anticoagulation based on the aPTT. During this time he had only been therapeutic once following the transfusion of one unit of fresh frozen plasma. The heparin was titrated up with increasing dose of heparin. However, suspicions for heparin infusion became a concern when the dose required approached 50,000 IU/24 h without aPTT being therapeutic. Haematology was consulted for evaluation and guidance.\nAt the time of evaluation patient was in no acute distress without any significant physical findings except for tachycardia and abdominal distention with midline scar closed with mesh. The former was likely explained with the PE the latter was secondary to the surgery. The trend for aPTT was noted to be in a sinusoidal pattern ranging between 51 and 27. Since the patient had multiple factors because of the acute situation, it was decided to check for factor 10 levels. Also factor VIII levels were checked.

His CT scan showed retroperitoneal bleeding (around the pancreas and the dorsal side of the ascending colon). His general condition was stable, but he was admitted to our hospital as a conservative measure. His angiography (6 days after admission) showed an aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal artery without active bleeding.\nOur experience treating MAL syndrome in case 1 enabled us to diagnose the disease accurately in case 2. MAL syndrome was the cause of the aneurysm in this patient too (). We selected laparoscopic surgery based on the MAL syndrome and the benefits of this surgery. The patient's posture for the surgery was the lithotomy position. Intra-abdominal pressure of 12 mmHg was maintained. The points of the trocars were as follows: a 12 mm trocar at the navel for the camera, two 12 mm trocars at the right upper abdomen, and a 12 mm trocar and a 5 mm trocar at the left upper abdomen ().\nFirst, we lifted the liver umbilical ligament by surgical sutures and put in an organ retractor to the crus of the diaphragm in order to improve the field of vision. After opening the omental bursa, we lifted the stomach with a snake retractor and observed the dorsal side of the stomach. We confirmed the left gastric artery and tied it with tape. The tape was taken out from the right outside trocar, and an assistant pulled it to provide traction of the surgical field. Following the celiac artery to the root, the artery was fastened by the MAL.

She had a medical history of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and her partner had a diagnosis of male factor infertility. She had no prior surgical history, no known allergies, and medications included prenatal vitamins. She denied any history of sexually transmitted infections and had a normal hysterosalpingogram and saline sonohysterogram. Her first IVF cycle with an elective single embryo transfer resulted in a negative pregnancy test. Her second IVF cycle used a GnRH antagonist stimulation protocol and she was triggered with Ovidrel on stimulation day 12. Twenty-two oocytes were retrieved. On day five a single fresh blastocyst was transferred using a pass through technique under ultrasound guidance. A stiff outer sheath was introduced through the cervix and past the internal os. A soft tipped catheter containing the embryo was advanced through the outer sheath and the embryo was expelled into the uterine cavity approximately 1.5 cm from the uterine fundus with good visualization. Beta hCG was positive on post-transfer day 9 and serial beta hCG values were monitored and continued to rise appropriately (Table ). On day 28 after embryo transfer, the patient underwent a transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) in the office that did not identify an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) or any abnormal adnexal structures. She was asymptomatic with no vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain. The patient was sent for a more comprehensive ultrasound evaluation at the associated Maternal Fetal Medicine unit and another beta hCG value was obtained. Repeat scan similarly failed to identify an IUP or visualize an ectopic pregnancy. The beta hCG was 12,400 pg/mL.

Computerized tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed wall thickening of the distal descending colon and sigmoid colon concerning for colitis (), Hence, a colonoscopy was performed for further evaluation.\nColonoscopy showed ulcerated mucosa, and punched out ulcers throughout the colon. Pathology results revealed inclusion bodies as shown in the bottom picture of concerning for CMV. Hence, the patient was started on ganciclovir and after improvement, was discharged to a subacute rehabilitation center.\nThe patient was readmitted a few weeks later with altered mental status and significant abdominal pain. Physical exam demonstrated guarding, rigidity and absent bowel sounds concerning for bowel perforation. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis was done which showed extensive air in mesentery and abdominal cavity consistent with perforation with the most likely site being the distal colon.

His visual analog scale score was 9 out of 10. He had terminal pancreatic tail cancer, and comorbidities included diabetes mellitus, bronchial asthma, and hyperlipidemia. It was difficult for him to lie prone because of a surgery on the right hip that he had undergone 15 years ago. Unlike most patients with pancreatic cancer, the patient complained of lower abdomen pain, especially on the left side. He described his pain as achy and crampy and diffusely located in his left lower abdomen. The abdomen was distended slightly, and bowel sounds were significantly decreased. He was taking a lot of narcotic analgesics, which made him drowsy and lethargic and worsened his constipation. Simple abdomen X-ray imaging showed gas and abundant feces in the colon loops. Compared with abdominal CT findings obtained 50 days prior, hepatic metastasis and peritoneal seeding were still present, infiltration to the tissues around the pancreas and retrogastric area was increased, and most of the abdominal aorta was encased. In addition, metastatic lymph nodes were identified in several areas on the left including the left para-aortic area. However, on CT images, we could not identify the lesion that caused the pain. Nevertheless, owing to the patient's condition, we had to find a way to reduce the pain while reducing the dose of narcotic analgesics. Therefore, according to the patient's complaints, we decided to administer an inferior mesenteric plexus block instead of a celiac plexus block. However, the patient could not lie in the prone position at all.\nAt the outset, it was important to reduce the patient's lower abdominal pain by first performing epidural PCA so that the prone position was possible. Epidural PCA was performed under fluoroscopy guidance in the left lateral recumbent position. Fortunately, the patient's pain somehow decreased after epidural PCA, but epidural PCA alone did not control the patient",

He was athletic, self-reliant and had no cognitive impairment. During the last 28 years, he had experienced 8-10 heterogeneous episodes of acute neurological symptoms, such as central facial palsy, hemiparesis, and non-fluent aphasia, lasting from seconds to 3-4 hours. Precerebral duplex and electrocardiography (ECG) were performed several times with normal results, and EEG registration and 24-hour Holter monitoring had been normal. Previous MRI scans showed no abnormal restricted diffusion, as seen in acute cerebral infarcts, but infarct sequelae in the left temporal lobe and both thalami. Several years later, three additional infarct sequelae were detected in the cerebellum. The patient was treated with platelet inhibitors, and medications and dosages were adjusted after new episodes. There was no suspicion of lack of compliance. Except from age, migraine, and previous smoking, with cessation 35 years ago, he had no known risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. On the current admission, he presented with reduced motor speed in his left arm and leg. Electrocardiography and Holter monitoring showed no signs of atrial fibrillation. CT and MRI revealed multiple, cortical infarct sequelae in the anterior and posterior circulation territories of both hemispheres, and MRI also detected two acute embolic infarcts in the right occipital lobe and one in the left parietal lobe (Figure ). CT and MRI angiograms and duplex sonography did not show significant plaques or stenoses, and pre- and intracerebral flow were normal with asymmetrical vertebral arteries, which were considered a normal anatomical variant. Cortical infarcts in several vascular territories strongly suggest cardioembolic etiology, but transthoracic echocardiogram showed no cardiac sources of emboli, and there was no sign of left atrial enlargement, which may be seen in the presence of atrial fibrillation. The patient concurred to further diagnostic tests aiming to determine the cause of recurrent cerebral emboli, although he was informed that the results would not necessarily alter treatment recommendations.",

    "original_text": "This patient is a 37-year-old female who presents to the pain clinic with a chief complaint of right side facial pain and numbness. The patient reports that the pain becomes more and more significant during the day until she feels the pain radiating from the right side of the entire face to the upper neck.\nThe patient has a history of an acoustic neuroma surgery with near total tumor removal. The surgery was performed 10 years ago. She underwent stereotactic radiosurgery for the tumor remnant shortly after surgery. The patient developed right facial palsy immediately after the surgery. She reported that she was having right facial pain and gradually was losing touch feeling on the face area after the stereotactic radiosurgery course was finished. The pain and numbness have persisted ever since. The right face numbness did not improve and the pain intensity did not change during the past nine years.\nThe patient characterizes her pain as a sharp, constant pain and rated it as an 8 out of 10 on numerical pain rating scale (NPR). The pain is occasionally exacerbated with chewing. Recently there was an MRI image performed that showed a small, stable-sized remnant lesion of the prior tumor along the CPA region.

The pain had started 2 weeks prior to his presentation, had gradually worsened, and then became associated with bilateral lower extremity shooting pain and weakness. He denied bowel or bladder incontinence or saddle anaesthesia. He also denied subjective fevers or chills or any other bothersome symptoms. He was found to have normal vital signs, poor dental hygiene, tenderness over the lumbar spinous processes, and normal neurological and prostate exams. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine () showed mild compression fractures, with small lytic lesions throughout the thoracic and lumbar spine, and a large lytic lesion at the L5 vertebral body. The patient had a normal prostate specific antigen (PSA) level and a normal white blood cell count. C-reactive protein was mildly elevated at 30 mg l\u22121 (normal range 0\u201310 mg l\u22121).\nThere was concern for metastatic cancer given the patient's prior history of prostate cancer. His normal PSA level was not reassuring, because his prior prostate cancer had been diagnosed in the setting of a normal PSA level. He was started on intravenous dexamethasone 4 mg every 6 hours given the concern for metastatic spinal lesions and a neurosurgical consult was obtained. The neurosurgery team did not feel that urgent surgical intervention was needed and thus a biopsy of the lesion was obtained by the interventional radiology team for diagnostic purposes. Surprisingly, the vertebral biopsy result showed no evidence of malignancy, but did show findings consistent with osteomyelitis and was sent for culture. Dexamethasone was discontinued and blood cultures were drawn.

The patient refused treatment despite explanation of the prognosis by the local doctors back then and administered some topical traditional Chinese medicine herself. However, the patient recounted that the mass kept growing rapidly. Unfortunately, the details of that care encounter were not available.

On physical examination, large, irregular, ulcerative, and verrucous vegetations were identified, which covered both the perineal and perianal region with malodorous discharge on the surface (Figure ). The anterior vegetation measured 5 cm \u00d7 3.8 cm and the posterior one 13 cm \u00d7 6 cm. We presented the case to the board of multidisciplinary teamwork to discuss the plans for her delivery and the proper sequence of the two procedures, namely the mass removal and the infant delivery. Given the giant vegetation had occupied the vaginal birth canal and that prolonged general anesthesia might increase the neurological risk to the infant, we decided to perform a C-section before the neoplasm resection. Risks and benefits of infant delivery and resection procedure were discussed with the patient. The infant was delivered successfully via C-section at full term. Two weeks later, the perineal and perianal giant tumors were excised en bloc at the pedicles by electric scalpel until healthy tissue",

His CT scan showed retroperitoneal bleeding (around the pancreas and the dorsal side of the ascending colon). His general condition was stable, but he was admitted to our hospital as a conservative measure. His angiography (6 days after admission) showed an aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal artery without active bleeding.\nOur experience treating MAL syndrome in case 1 enabled us to diagnose the disease accurately in case 2. MAL syndrome was the cause of the aneurysm in this patient too (). We selected laparoscopic surgery based on the MAL syndrome and the benefits of this surgery. The patient's posture for the surgery was the lithotomy position. Intra-abdominal pressure of 12 mmHg was maintained. The points of the trocars were as follows: a 12 mm trocar at the navel for the camera, two 12 mm trocars at the right upper abdomen, and a 12 mm trocar and a 5 mm trocar at the left upper abdomen ().\nFirst, we lifted the liver umbilical ligament by surgical sutures and put in an organ retractor to the crus of the diaphragm in order to improve the field of vision. After opening the omental bursa, we lifted the stomach with a snake retractor and observed the dorsal side of the stomach. We confirmed the left gastric artery and tied it with tape. The tape was taken out from the right outside trocar, and an assistant pulled it to provide traction of the surgical field. Following the celiac artery to the root, the artery was fastened by the MAL.

A work-up revealed that the laparoscopic band remained in good position but the patient had oesophagitis and gastritis, causing swelling of the mucosa at the band site. The fluid was removed from the reservoir, and the patient was treated conservatively with anti-reflux medication and a full liquid diet. After 2 weeks of treatment the patient\u2019s symptoms improved. After careful consideration, she wished to undergo revisional surgery converting the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band to a laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy. The patient moved through the appropriate multidisciplinary team approach and was found to be an appropriate candidate for surgery. She underwent laparoscopic removal of the adjustable gastric band and conversion to a laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy without complications. Her post-operative course was uncomplicated and she was discharged on post-operative day 3.\nOn post-operative day 12, the patient was readmitted to an outside tertiary care hospital for lightheadedness and shortness of breath and was found to have leukocytosis, with white blood cell count of 18,000 cells \u03bcl\u20131.

The patient was recommended to have a total rhinectomy with bilateral modified neck dissection with reconstruction of the nasal defect with a nasal prosthesis. The oncological resection was carried out by the head and neck surgical team. Subsequent pathology showed an advanced primary cancer with clear surgical margins and with no pathological involved lymph nodes. As such, no postoperative radiation was recommended. After a discussion of the risks and benefits of treatment, including the course of treatment for surgical and/or prosthetic reconstruction, the patient elected to have her planned nasal defect prosthetically reconstructed. The patient was preoperatively evaluated by the Dental Service, and a nasal moulage was made. The patient was then planned for craniofacial implants to facilitate retention of the nasal prosthesis.\nTotal rhinectomy with bilateral modified neck dissection was performed by the head and neck team. A provisional nasal prosthesis was delivered postoperatively which replicated the patient's nasal contours. The prosthesis was secured with three pieces of medical grade adhesive tape and was removed daily by the patient.\nA postoperative CBCT was completed for craniofacial implant planning. A nasal surgical stent was fabricated to assist in the accurate placement of the craniofacial implants based on the surgical plan. The patient was then brought back to the operating room 2 weeks following rhinectomy for placement of the craniofacial implants. The surgical stent was utilized to identify the planned implant locations intraoperatively. An incision was made on the nasal floor exposing the premaxilla and vertically along the glabellar skin to expose the bone in the glabellar region. Three osteotomies were created, two in the premaxilla region and one in the glabellar region, and three 4 mm craniofacial implants (Vistafix VXI300; Cochlear) were then placed to the proper depth with adequate primary stability.

A status past multiple myeloma was known in his medical history that was in complete remission at the time of presentation. The patient denied dyspnea, dysphagia, pharyngalgia, and fever. Laryngoscopy revealed a diminished mobility of the right vocal cord and a thickening of the right vestibular fold so that a microlaryngoscopy with tissue sampling was performed. The histological examination of specimens obtained from this region revealed fibrosis. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the neck and the thorax were without any pathologic findings. The patient was discharged to outpatient care.\nThree months later, the patient was admitted with progressive dyspnea along with inspiratory stridor. The clinical examination revealed now a complete paralysis of the right vocal cord and a remaining glottic cleft of only 1 mm due to a supraglottic protrusion of the right vestibular fold.

Specifically, he had undergone one previous end-of-service pump replacement and one revision to replace a fractured catheter, and the patient had not experienced any complications with any of his prior pump refills.\nBecause the patient\u2019s baclofen pump could not be palpated in the created pocket and he continued to have signs of spasticity, an X-ray was performed, during his referral appointment at the clinic. The X-ray demonstrated a subcostal location of his baclofen pump, but it wasn\u2019t clear from the X-ray whether the pump had migrated into the peritoneal cavity or not ().\nThe patient was subsequently admitted and taken to the operating room for revision of his baclofen pump. Upon opening the subfascial pump pocket, we saw the pump catheter, but unexpectedly noticed that the pump had migrated. The dissection was extended along the catheter until the peritoneal cavity was entered where the 40-mL baclofen pump was found ().\nWe removed his pump and inspected the bowel to ensure that no perforation had occurred. On further examination, we identified a fascial tear through which the baclofen pump had migrated. This defect in the fascia was in the right lower abdominal quadrant, on the posterior aspect of the subfascial pump pocket. For this reason, a smaller (20 mL) baclofen pump was filled and inserted instead subcutaneously.\nFollowing the removal of his migrated baclofen pump and its replacement with a subcutaneous one, the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 7 only to return on postoperative day 9 with constipation and abdominal pain. Subsequently, he was readmitted and placed on a strict bowel regimen with milk of molasses",

Initially, he had a laparoscopic approach but because of the poor bowel preparation (despite preoperative enemas) and the tumour being unable to be seen with either on-table rigid sigmoidoscopy or with the laparoscope, the operation was converted to an open procedure. During dissection, both ureters were clearly seen and reflected. The patient had a small pelvis with relatively bulky contents. An anastomosis was formed with a covering loop ileostomy. During both laparoscopic and open phases, LigaSure was used for dissection and to secure haemostasis. Postoperatively, he initially progressed well; however, his urinary catheter output gradually dropped, and his peritoneal drainage output increased over the first three days.\nA sample of the peritoneal drain output had a high level of urea and the assumption was made that there has been a ureteric injury. A CT KUB was done which was inconclusive but raised the suspicion of ureteric injury by showing fluid in pelvis with density similar to that of the fluid in urinary bladder.\nThe patient was taken back to theatre where cystoscopy, bilateral retrograde ureterograms and insertion of JJ stent on the right side were done. He was found to have an injury to the right ureter with a defect in the medial portion of its lower third just below the pelvic brim. He was returned to HDU and had problems with fluid overload, type II NSTEMI, CHF, and fast atrial fibrillation over the next few days. Following all of this, he recovered well and was discharged home.\nIt is likely that he sustained a thermal injury to the right ureter from the use of LigaSure with later necrosis and perforation. This could be a result of direct damage to the ureter by holding it between the jaws of LigaSure during dissection but as both ureters were clearly identified and moved away, it is unlikely to be the cause of ureteric damage",

The caesarean scar had a small indentation and the remaining myometrium over the defect was 7.5 mm (Fig. ).\nIn the current pregnancy, she had a dating scan at around 11 weeks with no remarks. She came for a transvaginal ultrasound examination at around 13 weeks as part of our study. This scan revealed a duplex pregnancy with one viable intrauterine fetus with normal anatomy and placenta located high on the anterior wall and a small gestational sac (8 mm) with a yolk sac without embryo was located in the caesarean scar (Fig. ). There was no extensive vascularity surrounding the sac. One corpus luteum was found in each of the two ovaries. She was asymptomatic.\nShe was informed that not enough evidence existed to advise a specific management of this condition.

The fetal heart rate was noted to be persistently between 180 and 190 beats per minute, which is shown in . Fetal ECHO revealed a structurally normal heart, with an isolated pericardial effusion which is demonstrated in . The patient's past medical history was significant for Graves' disease for which she underwent radioactive iodine ablation 2 years earlier. She became hypothyroid soon thereafter and has been maintained on thyroid replacement. Her current dose is 150 mcg daily. She had two prior full term vaginal deliveries without complication and one first trimester elective abortion. Her past surgical history was significant for a laparoscopic appendectomy. She denied tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. On arrival to labor and delivery, the fetal tachycardia was again noted. Laboratory studies revealed a normal metabolic and thyroid profile. Stimulating thyroid antibodies were drawn but not yet available. The patient had a normal EKG. Because of the persistence of the fetal tachycardia and the pericardial effusion, the decision was made to treat the fetal tachycardia with maternally administered digoxin. Although there was suspicion that the tachycardia may be secondary to thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins (TSIs), the decision was made to start with our usual first-line drug for SVT in the absence of confirmatory results. The patient was loaded with IV digoxin and subsequently placed on an oral maintenance dose of 0.375 mg daily. She was discharged home with close follow-up.\nDespite having a maternal digoxin level as high as 2.5 ng/mL, the tachycardia persisted. Over the following week, she complained of increasing nausea. A maternal EKG showed nonspecific changes. The thyroid stimulating antibodies returned significantly elevated at 195% of basal activity. The digoxin was discontinued, and Sotalol 80 mg PO bid was begun. There was no significant improvement over the following few days with the fetal heart rate between 170 and 190 bpm.
