    "original_text": "A 7-year-old female patient has come to the Department of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry with a complaint of pain and food impaction in the lower back teeth on both sides, for a month. The pain was of constant nature and aggravated on mastication.\nRoutine clinical examination revealed dental carious lesions in the mandibular molar teeth on both sides. In addition to the carious teeth, there was an unusual tooth like structure in the left primary first molar region. The typical coronal portion of the tooth is surrounded by a white-colored globule of tooth material circumferentially and extending below the gingival margin. The gingival aspect of this tooth structure extended below the cervical area [Figures and ]. The gingival area under the odontome was inflamed and edematous. The patient revealed a history of a slow growing and slowly erupting tooth-like structure during the past 6 months. Orthopantomogram (OPG) revealed a radiopaque mass overlapping the tooth crown, giving it an irregular shape. The permanent premolar tooth bud appeared normal under the tooth-like mass. Informed consent was taken from the patient and parent of the child, and the positive outcomes of the treatment were explained to the parent before the surgical extraction of odontome.\nThe carious molar teeth were treated by placing resin-based fissure sealants and glass ionomer cement restorations followed by surgical extraction of the odontome-like structure [].

His sentences were not making sense and he had episodes of poor coordination and frequent falls.\nA year after his first symptoms, he had extensive dental surgery; during this time period, he was given amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.

However, this lesion had been growing more rapidly and had become foul smelling over the past 3 weeks. She denied any pain, paresthesias, weight loss, or recent trauma to the foot. She also denied any history of smoking or significant sun exposure. Her only surgical history included a recent total abdominal hysterectomy and left salpingo-ophorectomy.

This mass was insensate to light touch with no surrounding erythema. She had palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses with full range of motion of that foot. The left lower extremity was benign in examination, with no masses or lesions. A thorough dermatologic examination did not reveal any other concerning lesions.

    "original_text": "A 6-year-old white boy presented to our A&E department after a fall on his extended right arm from a height of 1 m. An initial examination revealed a severely displaced right elbow without penetration of the skin. A physical examination was hindered by his anxiety and pain. However, according to Liverpool Upper-limb Fracture Assessment, his neurovascular examination was reported as unremarkable. Palpable radial and ulnar pulses as well as no sensorimotor deficit were obtained. Radiographs in two planes showed a posterolaterally displaced supracondylar fracture of his humerus classified as Gartland type III (Fig. ). Surgical efforts under general anesthesia were initiated immediately. An initial attempt of closed reduction was unsuccessful.

    "original_text": "A 50-year-old woman with a personal history of hypertension and a family history of intracranial aneurysms presented initially to an outside hospital with sudden-onset severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness (Hunt Hess 2, Fisher grade 3). A computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan of the head and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) (Figure ) demonstrated a broad-based right anterior choroidal artery aneurysm measuring approximately 2\u00d78 mm. She was subsequently transferred to our hospital, and a right frontotemporal craniotomy was performed with successful clip reconstruction of the aneurysm with a single fenestrated clip. On hospital day 8, a surveillance DSA demonstrated evidence of complete obliteration of the aneurysm and mild anterior circulation vasospasm, right greater than left, that was treated with an intra-arterial infusion of verapamil (Figure ).\nOn hospital day 14, the patient had an acute worsening of her headache followed by a rapid decline in her neurologic examination until she exhibited only extensor posturing to noxious stimuli (Hunt Hess 5). A follow-up CTA demonstrated concern for recurrence of her aneurysm with evidence of new subarachnoid hemorrhage concerning for repeat aneurysm rupture.

He denied any history of recent trauma or infections; nonetheless, the patient admitted to the self-injection of paraffin oil 58 years before to treat a subcutaneous defect occurring after a large post-traumatic hematoma. Physical examination revealed dark and hard skin, forming firm plaques (27\u00d721 cm) that involved superficial layers of the anterolateral aspect of the knee; small ulcerations and fistulae secreting purulent exudate were also observed (). The patient reported worsening limitation of the flexion and extension of the right knee during the previous 4 months. Radiological examination revealed soft tissue swelling with several dense and streaky calcifications (). Blood test findings were within normal limits. The patient reported type 1 diabetes and was a heavy smoker.\nThe patient underwent a wide surgical resection of the skin overlying the knee, which was firmly adherent to the joint capsule, and a nearly circumferential, full-thickness excision up to the skeletal muscle in the distal third of the thigh and proximal third of the leg (). As the presence of risk factors such as diabetes and smoking advised against the use of microsurgical techniques, a less invasive two-stage reconstruction using bilayer acellular dermal matrix (IntegraLifeSciences, Plainsboro, NJ, USA) () and subsequent split-thickness skin grafts (STSG) after 20 days was performed. Histological examination revealed no evidence of any paraffin; nonetheless, dense and fibrous connective tissue with chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate was observed. Several optically empty vacuolar structures surrounded by foreign-body-type multinucleated giant cells were also detected, suggesting an oleo granulomatous reaction to foreign material.

After her second delivery, no data referring to the clinical history of the patient was available because the patient deferred any preventive or diagnostic medical examination until she presented to our hospital. Her last menstrual period had occurred 28 years ago. Her medical history included hypertension and angina pectoris.\nThe patient was examined in the gynecological oncology outpatient department and was found to have chronic pruritus vulvae and a recent onset palpable inflammatory lesion on the left labium majus. The lesion bled occasionally. During her gynecological examination, a 4 cm \u00d7 5 cm warty lesion with ulcerous and hemorrhagic areas (Figure ) was found in the middle of the left labium majus.\nInitially, multiple biopsies from the center of the lesion and from the lateral margins were obtained, the histological examination of which revealed the presence of squamous cell carcinoma. At the periphery of the lesion, the squamous stratified epithelium exhibited abnormalities consistent with vulvar intra-epithelial neoplasia (vulvar intra-epithelial neoplasia (VIN) grade I/II). Numerous lesional cells showed koilocytic atypia, which is representative of HPV-related infection. However, initial hybrid capture 2 testing for HPV was negative in all the samples tested, which were obtained from either the center or the periphery of the lesion. A pre-operative computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and inguinal areas showed bilaterally enlarged inguinal lymph nodes with central fusion.\nThe patient underwent radical vulvectomy extending centrally to the level of the perineal membrane, as well as bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy.

On examination, there was severe pitting edema of the right leg associated with erythema and warmth.\nDuplex ultrasound examination of the lower extremities revealed a nonocclusive thrombus extending from the right external iliac to the central (cranial) segment of the femoral vein and an occlusive thrombus in the central segment of the deep femoral (profunda femoris) vein. A non-contrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed an increase in the size of a pelvic retroperitoneal nodal mass inseparable from the right common iliac artery and right ureter, with no clear visualization of the right iliac venous system (Fig. ). The patient was placed on therapeutic low molecular weight heparin in preparation for right lower extremity catheter-directed thrombolysis and stenting.\nPre-procedural ultrasound examination of the access site confirmed findings seen on lower extremity Doppler examination and revealed extension of the venous thrombosis into the femoral and deep femoral vein precluding femoral vein access. The patient was then placed in prone position under general anesthesia and the right popliteal vein was accessed.

Of note, he had presented with gallstone cholangitis 4 months prior, during which an ERCP had been performed with successful balloon trawling of a 14 mm gallstone from the distal common bile duct. Physical examination revealed scleral icterus and mild right hypochondrial tenderness. His laboratory workup was notable for raised total bilirubin of 81 \u03bcmol/L, a low serum albumin of 33 g/L, thrombocytopenia, and an elevated serum alphafetoprotein level of 611\u03bcg/L. He had no leukocytosis, and his INR was normal.\nA computed tomography multiphasic scan of his abdomen showed a dilated intra- and extra-hepatic biliary tree with thickening and enhancement of the ductal wall as well as hyperdensities within the proximal left hepatic duct and common hepatic duct suggestive of choledocholithiasis. It also showed a 3 cm segment 3 lesion with faint arterial enhancement and subsequent washout on the delayed phase suggestive of HCC (Fig. ).

He had two fixed voluminous inguinal lymph nodes bilaterally.\nAn abdominal and pelvic computed tomographic (CT) scan, a pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a positron emission tomography (PET) scan were performed.

There was no distant metastasis.\nMany biopsies were taken from the cutaneous inguinal mass and revealed a dense proliferation of atypical epithelial cells in the dermis extending and ulcerating the epidermis. Numerous mitotic figures and apoptotic cells were observed as well as focal squamous and glandular differentiation. Immunohistochemistry was performed and the tumour was diffusely positive for CK5/6 and CK AE1/AE3. It was also positive for p63 except in the cells bordering the lumen of the glands. GATA3 was positive in a proportion of the tumour cells.\nInitially, our differential diagnosis included a malignant adnexal carcinoma and an adenosquamous carcinoma. Moreover, because of GATA3 positivity, a urothelial origin could not be excluded. Although an adnexal malignant carcinoma cannot be entirely excluded since the whole tumour was not examined pathologically for a residual benign component, the clinical history is negative for transformation of a long-standing tumour. Finally, a urothelial origin was less probable in the light of a negative radiology workup.\nThe patient was not immunosuppressed and was seronegative for HIV. The patient\u2019s diagnosis was a primary cutaneous adenosquamous cell carcinoma with regional lymph node metastasis.\nThe initial treatment plan consisted of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 15 cycles of cisplatin 5-FU followed by surgical excision",

There was no history of similar episode or any drug rash in the past. She did not take any medication, including oral contraceptive pills, before the onset of skin rash. She did not respond to antibiotic (amoxicillin + clavulanic acid) and pain killers prescribed by a private practitioner.\nOn general physical examination, she was pale with multiple erythematous, tender, papulo-nodular skin lesions of 8 - 10 mm size over both legs, more on the shins, compatible with erythema nodosum []. The knee and ankle joints of both legs were reddish and tender without any obvious swelling. Her resting pulse rate was 88 / min, blood pressure was 110/72 mm Hg and respiratory rate was 22 / min. Respiratory, cardiovascular, abdominal and central nervous system examination were within normal limits. Routine blood investigations were all normal except erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which was 114 mm 1st hr Westergren. Her mantoux test was strongly positive with 25 mm induration with vesicle formation over the site. Chest radiograph was within normal limits\nRadiographs of bilateral ankle and knee joints were also normal. Ultrasound abdomen was normal without any evidence of lymphadenopathy. Normal Anti Streptococcal O (ASO) titer ruled out any rheumatic process in the body. Rheumatoid Factor (RA), Anti Nuclear Antibody (ANA) and C - Reactive Protein (CRP) were negative. Skin biopsy was done from the right shin and the mantoux site. Histopathological examination showed multiple epitheloid cell granulomas with Langhans giant cell reaction in subcutaneous tissue without any evidence of caseous necrosis []. Ziehl Ne",

He had an indwelling double lumen subclavian catheter and was undergoing dialysis once every three days for chronic renal failure. The patient was on oral prednisolone 10 mg daily for systemic myasthenia gravis since 1981. He had undergone cataract extraction with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in the right eye three years ago.\nHis visual acuity was 20/100, N36 and 20/20, N6 in the right and left eye respectively. The anterior segment evaluation of the right eye showed 2+ cells and a sluggish pupil. The right eye was pseudophakic with a clear posterior capsule. The fundus evaluation showed multiple cotton-ball opacities in the vitreous and few had coalesced to a \u2018string of beads\u201d appearance [].

She was a mother of two children in good health, and had no family history of breast disease. On physical examination, the mass was seen to involve the entire left breast. The central portion of left breast including the nipple was rotted by severe necrosis, and the surrounding skin was erythematous. The tumor tissue was very friable with profuse foul-odored discharge (). Several lymph nodes were palpated in the left axilla.\nA wide incisional biopsy of the mass was performed. The sarcoma was diagnosed, but the specific type could not be established. Chest computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a hypodense mass, 10\u00d78 cm in size, with central necrosis and numerous enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla, but there was no abnormal finding in the lung fields.

Siblings from both previous pregnancies had been delivered by cesarean section. Besides these two surgeries, her medical history was unremarkable. Physical examination showed no abdominal tenderness or rebound. Speculum examination revealed a normal cervix with minimal bleeding and without any cervical dilatation. Her blood pressure (110/70 mmHg) and pulse rate (80 beats/min) were within normal limits; hemoglobin was 13.2 g/dL and hCG was 38067 mIU/mL. A TVUS (Toshiba Aplio, Tokyo, Japan) performed at admission showed that there was no intrauterine gestational sac or fetal pole and that the intrauterine cavity was filled with hemorrhagic fluid. However, a gestational sac of dimensions 36 \u00d7 42 mm diameter and a viable fetus with crown to lump length of 5.3 mm were visualized near the isthmus and at the exact location of the scar from the previous cesarean section (). A color Doppler US demonstrated proliferative growth of the peritrophoblastic vessels around the gestational sac, and a spectral Doppler US showed the fetal heart activity (). There was no free fluid in Douglas pouch and no adnexial pathology was observed. Based on these findings a definitive diagnosis of CSEP was made. The patient was informed of all possible treatment options and complications and adequately counseled. Because of the high hCG level, relatively advanced gestational age, and proximity of the gestational sac and the scar site from the previous cesarean section, medical management was rejected in favor of laparoscopic resection. During laparoscopy, the Fallopian tubes and both ovaries appeared normal, and no free peritoneal fluid or hematoma was observed.

The patient did not report any symptoms during the initial evaluation and showed no evidence of a lump or polyplike lesion in the nasal cavity during the physical examination.\nThe presence of an expansive lump, likely originating from the rear sphenoid sinus, was confirmed on noncontrasted computed tomography (CT) (). We also identified thinning at the base of the sella turcica and the left internal carotid artery, with the clivus entirely diminished. The lump edges were smooth with a uniform internal density, showing a higher density than that of cerebrospinal fluid. Additionally, the presence of a space-occupying lesion at the same location with compression and an expansive growth pattern was confirmed by MRI (). The mucocele was adjacent to the basilar artery secondary to clivus loss, with uniformly dense contents showing a low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, which was a different pattern than that observed for cerebrospinal fluid. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with sphenoid sinus mucocele. The patient denied a history of paranasal sinus surgery or head trauma, indicating a primary lesion.\nWe chose nonsurgical treatment because the patient was asymptomatic and reluctant to undergo surgery. Therefore, we implemented regular follow-up visits and CT scans every 6 months. Subsequently, we did not observe any disease progression during the two clinical follow-ups.

She gave no history of trauma, no family history of lymphatic disorder, and there was no evidence of yellow nail syndrome. She was born in Macedonia, emigrated to Australia at the age of 20, and was a lifelong non-smoker.

There was no pleural thickening, mass, or nodules. Over the next year, she presented on three more occasions for drainage of left-sided chylous pleural effusions. In order to further elucidate the cause of her pathology she underwent a number of imaging investigations. Lower limb lymphoscintogram demonstrated delayed movement on the right and accumulation of tracer in the abnormal soft tissue in the left superior mediastinal area.

They have no more children and no spontaneous abortions. The family history is unremarkable. After an uneventful pregnancy, the patient was born at full term without complications with a birth weight of 4200 g (percentile > 97). The height and the cranial perimeter at birth and the Apgar scores are not known. Newborn hearing screening was normal. Early neuromotor development is referred as normal or lightly slow, walking at 17 months of age. Social interaction is also referred as unremarkable in the first year of life. However, since the age of 2 years a delay in the development of both expressive and receptive language was noted. Otherwise her general health is good; she had only an episode of acute viral bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization for supportive care without further complications at the age of 17 months. At the age of 28 months, she was first assessed in a neuropediatric setting because of the delayed language development. On examination, her weight was at the percentile 97, her height was at the percentile 75 to 90, and her cranial perimeter was at the percentile 90. She showed no dysmorphic features. She had a midline diastema. General examination showed no more anomalies. Neurological examination showed moderate delay in the development of both expressive and receptive language with jargon aphasia, lack of comprehension of verbal commands, and very hyperkinetic behavior with continuous aimless moving and very short attention span. Eye contact was present although very short; she was smiling and tended to imitate motor behaviors.

She had no further relevant past medical history and denied smoking and alcohol use. Her symptoms had started 1 year prior to presentation and occurred once a month. She endorsed history of intermittent dysphagia symptoms while attempting to swallow liquids and rice, as well as a mild loss of appetite. She denied odynophagia, globus sensation, weight loss, abdominal pain, hematochezia, and dyspepsia. Physical exam was unremarkable. Initial clinical differential diagnosis of intermittent dysphagia with solids/liquids would seem most consistent with a motility disorder. Neck radiographs were ordered to rule out foreign body. Double contrast barium esophography, as well as endoscopy, were ordered to evaluate for a possible motility disorder or esophageal compression that could be causing the dysphagia.\nNeck radiographs showed multilevel moderate anterior cervical spine osteophytes without displacement of the anterior prevertebral soft tissues. No radiopaque foreign body was seen (). Double contrast barium esophagography revealed anterior compression on the lower esophageal lumen with smooth margins and well-defined angles that remained during barium ingestion (). No strictures or mucosal defects were seen elsewhere. This appearance was suggestive of submucosal mass extending into the lumen. Additionally, decreased primary peristalsis was noted within the esophagus.\nEndoscopy revealed a non-obstructive Schatzki ring 2 cm proximal to the gastroesophageal junction. The exact measurements of the distal esophageal diameter were not obtained during endoscopy. However, since the endoscope passed into the stomach without difficulty, this indicates that the luminal size was greater than 12 mm, which is the diameter of the endoscope. The Schatzki ring seen endoscopically () demonstrated minimal narrowing of the esophageal lumen and was not apparent on the esophagography.
