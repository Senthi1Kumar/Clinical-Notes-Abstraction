Laboratory analysis and a brain computed tomogram showed no remarkable findings. She was discharged with a diagnosis of migraine after symptom improvement following simple analgesic administration. She returned to the emergency room 6 days after discharge due to horizontal diplopia on right gaze that developed with improvement of the headache. Intraocular examination was normal. She was admitted to the neurology department for further tests. The physical examination revealed limited abduction in the right eye. Other cranial nerves and systemic examinations were unremarkable. A diagnostic spinal puncture showed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure was 6 cmH2O and CSF analysis was normal. In general, the normal range of CSF opening pressure measured at lumbar puncture is 10\u201318 cmH2O, with the patient lying on the side. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without contrast enhancement showed diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement, with thickening and venous sinus engorgement (). Mild obliteration of the basal, prepontine, and suprasellar cistern was also observed. There was no other abnormality on the MRI.

Other than smoking, he denied any concern in terms of the complications from these comorbidities. Urine toxicology screen was negative for any illicit substances. He denied peripheral vascular disease (PVD), cardiovascular or neurological conditions though he did not recall getting tested for PVD or diabetic neuropathy as such.\nHe was also diagnosed with OCD at the age of 26 years but reported compulsive behavior from his adolescence. As an adolescent, he first developed compulsive squeezing of his acne and picking of his facial hair. A few years later, he had to compulsively pick the hair, the acne and skin in his entire body, more so in his legs. At times, he reported severe anxiety associated with these skin-picking episodes and even reported a couple of visits to the emergency room with the symptoms of OCD.

    "original_text": "A 25-year-old single Nigerian man was admitted via the surgical outpatient clinic with a two-year history of scrotal swelling which was initially small in size, non-painful and not associated with fever. The swelling gradually increased in size to the extent of impairing free movement of the patient both because of its weight and size in between the lower limbs. The swelling made sexual intercourse and voiding in the standing position impossible. The skin was intact without associated ulcerations, and there was no difficulty in voiding though the penile shaft was buried in the swelling. There was no history of chronic cough suggestive of pulmonary or disseminated tuberculosis. He had no problems with his eyesight and no other swellings on his body were known.\nHe had a history of surgery to the two inguinal areas about 10 years before presentation; surgical details were not available nor was any histology available. He was from a polygamous home and took neither alcohol nor any other substance of abuse. There was no history of a similar lesion in his relatives or his acquaintances at his place of abode.\nPhysical examination showed a healthy looking young man with a giant scrotal swelling of a size greater than that of his head.

Radiological examination showed an anterior shoulder dislocation with impaction of the humeral head underneath glenoid and associated fracture of the greater tuberosity (Fig. ).

Although the patient developed no symptoms on contact with tap water, an aquagenic urticaria was suspected, but the specific test was negative.

The lesion extended to 3.5 cm in diameter with a central lobular, heterogenous portion surrounded by fat, which demonstrated marked internal vascularity on Doppler study. This was suspicious of liposarcoma, and 3 core biopsies of the lump were taken which revealed extensively necrotic moderately to poorly differentiated carcinoma. There were both glandular and focal squamous differentiation histologically with keratinisation. illustrates histology from the core biopsy obtained from this abdominal wall lesion. The photomicrograph shows part of a malignant epithelial tumour exhibiting both squamous (left side) and glandular (right side) differentiation. Immunohistochemistry showed focal expression of cytokeratin 20 and a rare cell showing cytokeratin 7. TTF1 (a marker of primary thyroid and non-small cell lung carcinoma), oestrogen receptor and neuroendocrine markers was not expressed. At this stage, the differential diagnosis included a primary skin adnexal carcinoma, for example, a sweat gland carcinoma; however, the histology did not show the classical pattern of the best-recognised subtypes. Therefore, the more likely diagnosis was that of metastatic carcinoma with a number of potential primary sites.

She had a medical history of symptomatic cholelithiasis with an episode of acute cholecystitis 6 months before and several other episodes of biliary colic before and after this. The rest of her medical history was unremarkable. No preoperative assessment of patient's biliary anatomy with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) had been performed. The operation started laparoscopically with division of adhesions between the gallbladder and the greater omentum. During the dissection of the cystic duct and the cystic artery in the hepatocystic triangle, a transected bile duct with small caliber was noticed. The operation was converted to open. It proceeded with retrograde dissection of the gallbladder from the liver bed, identification, dissection, ligation and division of the cystic duct and the cystic artery and removal of the gallbladder from the operating field. During the cholecystectomy, it was recognized that the initially transected bile duct, which was 2 mm in diameter, came out of the hepatoduodenal ligament, ran along the common hepatic duct (CHD) and drained into the cystic duct, in proximity to the neck of the gallbladder. In order to identify the exact nature of the injury, an intraoperative cholangiography was performed by injecting an iodine-containing contrast medium through the common bile duct (CBD). The intraoperative cholangiography revealed that the aberrant bile duct was originated from the right posterior sectoral duct (RPSD). The RPSD continued its typical course up to its confluence with the right anterior sectoral duct (RASD) and the formation of the right hepatic duct (RHD) (Fig. ). The small caliber of the aberrant bile duct and the fact that it drained less than a liver segment led to the decision of its ligation (Fig. ). A drain was placed under the surface of the liver. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the third postoperative day and remains free of symptoms",

Her past medical history was a 6-month duration of severe pain, localized on the right knee, exacerbating during the night, making her unable to sleep. She was a normally developing girl, participating in sports activities until the appearance of pain.

Upon arrival, he was in a shock state. Chest roentgenography revealed severe pulmonary congestion; cardiac echogram revealed a large mass in the LA that incarcerated into the mitral valve. Additionally, chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a tumor in the LA; thus, he was diagnosed with acute left heart failure caused by the mass that obstructed cardiac blood flow (Fig. ).\nAn emergency surgery was performed under cardiac arrest with extracorporeal circulation, which was established in the usual manner with bicaval direct cannulation. Because of the dimensions of the tumor and its pedicle attachment, we could approach through both the wall incisions on the right-side LA from the right upper pulmonary vein and atrioseptostomy from the right atrium. The tumor pedicle widely and irregularly originated from the right upper and posterior LA wall and extended to the lateral LA wall, which included the right upper pulmonary vein. The tumor was visibly extirpated and invaded the LA wall (Fig. ). The shape and function of the mitral valve were intact, and the large defect in the LA wall was reconstructed using a bovine pericardial patch. It was 159 min under extracorporeal circulation, and the aortic cross-clamping time was 123 min.\nExtracorporeal circulation weaning and post-operative course were uneventful, and arthralgia in both lower limbs disappeared immediately after surgery. The pathological diagnosis was UPS with clear resection margins (R0 resection), which invaded the atrial muscular layer (Fig. ). Subsequently, as imaging studies soon and 3 months after surgery did not reveal tumor presence, we decided to adopt a more suitable treatment strategy without involving adjuvant therapy after surgery if UPS relapse or metastasis occurred. Specifically, we planned to perform re-surgical resection or proton radiotherapy for recurred or metastatic tumors. In addition, we planned to initiate systemic chemotherapy",

In July 2005, he underwent surgical resection for a tumor in his right lower extremity; pathological examination indicated ASPS. Postoperative care included radiotherapy, although the radiation dose was unclear. In August 2007, follow-up CT scans showed multiple lung metastases, for which the patient received systemic chemotherapy. Despite treatment, the metastases gradually increased and so the patient underwent lung metastasis resection of the left and right lung in June and September 2013, respectively. In June 2014, follow-up CT scans indicated double kidney metastases; the patient consequently underwent right renal tumor resection and, 3 months later, left renal tumor resection. In January 2015, left lung metastases were again found, and the patient underwent cryoablation. In June 2015, metastases were found in the right adrenal gland and pericardium, leading to treatment by CyberKnife. The patient was then admitted to our hospital for further treatment of cardiac metastasis.\nPhysical examination was almost normal. CT examination of the right ventricular wall showed a localized metastasis of about 4.9 \u00d7 3.8 \u00d7 3.4 cm (fig. ) with large amounts of pericardial effusion. Electrocardiogram examination was normal, and there was no detectable valvar abnormality. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a 43 \u00d7 40 mm low echogenic tumor that was invading the myocardium of the apex of the right ventricular wall, and the border of the tumor was poorly defined.\nAlthough we recommended a surgical or transvenous biopsy, the patient did not wish to undergo this procedure and so the metastasis was not histologically confirmed. However, given the echocardiographic and CT features and the patient's past history, we suspected the tumor to be a metastasis from ASPS.

And the referral letter of the regional hospital wrote that there had been postpartum hemorrhage of about 1500 mL (general anesthesia, without telling any other details of the operation). By blood transfusion and the use of uterine contraction medicines, the patient had recovered well and been discharged with her newborn. On the 10th day after delivery when she was at home, there was a sudden heavy vaginal bleeding as mentioned above. On the way to referral, there had been \u223c1500 mL of vaginal bleeding. The regional hospital gave her three units of red cell suspension and some drugs to promote uterine contraction and then transferred her to our hospital by emergency.\nWhen she was a little girl, she limped and her left leg was sweaty. She was diagnosed as \u201cacromegaly\u201d in her childhood without any special treatment. She conceived spontaneously without preconception counseling. She was first diagnosed with KTS by one of the dermatologists of the local hospital at the last trimester of pregnancy. There had been no history of thrombosis. During pregnancy, neither low-weight heparin nor low-dose acetylsalicylic acid had been given to her. Her medical history was otherwise uneventful. She denied family history of KTS or any other familial genetic diseases.\nAt the time of admission, physical examination was remarkable for blood pressure of 89/56 mm Hg, heart rate of 125 per minute, respiratory rate of 22 per minute, and a temperature of 37.3\u00b0C.

Three years later, in February 2017, she was found to have a mass in the right ascending colon. She underwent a right hemicolectomy with lymph node dissection and remained disease-free. In May 2017, a CT scan of the chest showed a large heterogeneous mass centered on the lateral wall of the right atrium communicating with another mass inferiorly.

Her exam was significant for pallor, increased vitiligo on both hands as well as the forearms and persistent right lower extremity lymphedema. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) (Figure ) further characterized the mass as a bilobed mass in the right atrium occupying a significant portion of the chamber. One lobe was attached to the right atrial wall with another component that was mobile in the right atrium cavity. The mural component was a solid, enhancing mass.

Six days prior to admission, the patient was involved in an altercation where he struck an individual in the mouth. Over several days, the patient developed severe, constant pain, limited mobility of the 4th digit, swelling, erythema, and purulent drainage.\nSix days after the injury, the patient presented to the emergency room and had a 2 cm laceration to the dorsum of the right hand at the level of the 4th MCP joint with gross purulence and a foul odor. The patient was unable to extend the 4th and 5th digits from the flexed position. Extensors and flexors of the thumb appeared intact along with the intrinsic muscles of the hand. Sensation to light touch was intact in the distributions of the axillary, radial, ulnar, and median nerves, and all digits had brisk capillary refill.\nThe patient underwent surgery for irrigation and debridement, as well as exploration and potential repair of damaged structures. The traumatic laceration was extended proximally and distally to approximately 7 cm. Once in the 4th MCP joint, purulent fluid was noted and cultures were taken. There was necrotic tissue, and the infection had eroded through the extensor tendon causing rupture in Zone V (). The patient was started on broad spectrum IV antibiotics, and a second surgery was planned in 48 hours.\nAfter further irrigation and debridement, the compromised tissue was resected back to reveal a 10 cm gap in the extensor tendon, which would necessitate reconstruction. Intraoperative cultures grew Streptococcus anginosus and Eikenella corrodens.\nSix days after initial presentation, the patient was taken to the operating room for a third time. At this time, there was no progression of the infection, and the wound bed appeared to be stable with minimal need for debridement. Given the 10 cm gap, the decision was made to use palmaris longus autograft",

Upon arrival, he was in a shock state. Chest roentgenography revealed severe pulmonary congestion; cardiac echogram revealed a large mass in the LA that incarcerated into the mitral valve. Additionally, chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a tumor in the LA; thus, he was diagnosed with acute left heart failure caused by the mass that obstructed cardiac blood flow (Fig. ).\nAn emergency surgery was performed under cardiac arrest with extracorporeal circulation, which was established in the usual manner with bicaval direct cannulation. Because of the dimensions of the tumor and its pedicle attachment, we could approach through both the wall incisions on the right-side LA from the right upper pulmonary vein and atrioseptostomy from the right atrium. The tumor pedicle widely and irregularly originated from the right upper and posterior LA wall and extended to the lateral LA wall, which included the right upper pulmonary vein. The tumor was visibly extirpated and invaded the LA wall (Fig. ). The shape and function of the mitral valve were intact, and the large defect in the LA wall was reconstructed using a bovine pericardial patch. It was 159 min under extracorporeal circulation, and the aortic cross-clamping time was 123 min.\nExtracorporeal circulation weaning and post-operative course were uneventful, and arthralgia in both lower limbs disappeared immediately after surgery. The pathological diagnosis was UPS with clear resection margins (R0 resection), which invaded the atrial muscular layer (Fig. ). Subsequently, as imaging studies soon and 3 months after surgery did not reveal tumor presence, we decided to adopt a more suitable treatment strategy without involving adjuvant therapy after surgery if UPS relapse or metastasis occurred. Specifically, we planned to perform re-surgical resection or proton radiotherapy for recurred or metastatic tumors. In addition, we planned to initiate systemic chemotherapy",

It was recorded as the second premolar of 3 mm and first molar of 3 mm. A hard tissue abrasion defect was also present on these teeth and was measured to be less than 0.5 mm in dimension. Phase 1 therapy was completed with oral hygiene instruction reinforced. The surgical procedure was explained to the patient and informed consent was obtained. The use of an additive membrane was assigned by toss of a coin.\nThe operative site, that is, 15 and 16 was anesthetized using 2% Xylocaine with adrenaline (1:200,000). A coronally positioned flap technique was performed at the surgical site in relation to 15 and 16 []. This was performed by making two horizontal incisions with respect to the distal and mesial interdental papillae of 16 and 15, followed by a crevicular incision, two vertical releasing incisions at the mesial and distal aspects of 16 and 15. A full thickness flap followed by a partial thickness one was reflected []. A horizontal releasing incision was made in the periosteum, at the base of the flap, to facilitate tension-free coronal displacement. The exposed root surfaces were scaled and root planed. Following this, the cervical step at the CEJ was eliminated using an aerator and a diamond bur.\nAfter the recipient site preparation was completed, 5 ml of venous blood was drawn in test tubes without an anticoagulant, and centrifuged immediately.

CT showed a large left upper lobe necrotic soft tissue mass protruding through the chest wall between the first and the second ribs with underlying expansion of the left first rib and extension into the pectoral space and neck (). The chest wall/lung mass was biopsied via core needle in June and showed spindle cells that immunohistochemically (IHC) stained negative for AE1/AE3, S100, desmin, smooth muscle actin, and CAM 5.2. It was classified as undifferentiated spindle cell sarcoma of at least intermediate grade according to FNCLCC (). Neoadjuvant therapy consisting of AIM: adriamycin 75 mg/m2 and ifosfamide 7500 mg/m2 with mesna was started. He received two cycles of AIM in July with side effects of anemia requiring transfusion and neutropenia. CT scan in August showed minimal decrease in the size of the tumor (). After recovery from his side effects, he was given one dose of liposomal doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 with plan for surgical resection.

The patient would snore when laid on his back while sleeping. Detailed examination revealed a 35 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 25-mm mass lesion on the dorsum of the tongue (Figures and ). His medical history showed that although he was being followed up by a local pediatrician for congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the follow-up had been completed at the time of this operation. The patient had no allergies or any family history of diseases, and preoperative examination revealed no particular findings. Under general anesthesia, resection of the mass lesion located at the dorsum of the tongue was planned.\nRegarding anesthesia management, these two concerns were considered: (a) a difficult airway due to the large mass present on the tongue and (b) the risk of airway obstruction associated with a swollen tongue postoperatively.\nBefore anesthetizing the patient, a peripheral intravenous route was secured on the left forearm to prepare for the difficult airway that was expected after the induction of anesthesia. Prior to the induction of anesthesia, oxygenation was administered with 100% oxygen for approximately 3 minutes. Anesthesia was induced with 6 L/min of oxygen and 6% sevoflurane. After the onset of anesthesia, mask ventilation temporarily became difficult due to the tongue mass and glossoptosis; however, mask ventilation was feasible after administering 15 mg of rocuronium and using an oral airway. Decreased peripheral capillary oxygen saturation associated with temporary dyspnea was not observed.

Past medical history was only remarkable for ulcerative colitis and there was no significant past surgical or family history. Around March 2018, she started having increased watery diarrhea with occasional blood (10-12 bowel movements per day from a baseline of 1-2 bowel movements per day) as well as cramping abdominal pain. She went to see her gastroenterologist in clinic. On physical examination, she had diffuse tenderness to palpation of her abdomen. Stool studies including stool cultures, stool ova, and parasites were sent which were negative. ESR and CRP levels were elevated. Therefore, she was thought to be in a moderate to severe ulcerative colitis flare based on the current criteria and was prescribed budesonide multimatrix (MMX) 9 mg once daily. Her abdominal pain improved but the diarrhea persisted. She then received a course of oral prednisone 40 mg daily for one month without any improvement of her symptoms and was subsequently started on infliximab therapy. Prior to initiating infliximab therapy, an interferon gamma release assay, hepatitis panel, varicella zoster antibody, and HIV tests were done which were negative.

Enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a mediastinal mass in the subcarinal space, which compressed the right pulmonary artery and a delayed right pulmonary vein and airway enhancement at the tracheal bifurcation (-A, B). The mass was diagnosed as a mediastinal cyst and bronchoscopy was attempted; however, the patient was unable to be placed in the supine position due to severe respiratory distress.

Signed consent was obtained for all procedures. To ensure that the mass was a simple cyst without septum and mural nodule, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed as the patient\u2019s condition allowed; the image showed a two-layered simple cyst, which indicated an infection or bleeding inside the cyst (-C, D).

He had a positive history of recurrent herpetic keratitis on the same eye and had undergone penetrating keratoplasty six years earlier. However, his corneal graft had failed with total opacity and vascularization due to recurrent herpes simplex keratitis (HSK) in the corneal graft. The right eye was normal.\nHis history revealed that he had suffered from eczematous skin lesions, recurrent skin bursts, and sinopulmonary infections since early childhood and recurrent generalized HSV infection. He had been diagnosed with HIES at the age of three based on elevated serum IgE levels and other clinical features. He did not have a positive family history of HIES or any other immunodeficiency.\nAt the onset of the lesion discussed here, a differential diagnosis of a conjunctival lymphoid tumor, conjunctival papilloma, and ocular surface squamous neoplasia was given. Because the patient was prone to recurrent HSK, recurrent herpetic lesions were not considered in the differential diagnosis because the patient presented a papillomatous mass lesion of the conjunctiva. Thus, the pathogenesis was suspected to be HPV because the dendritic lesion and stromal infiltration had not be seen in the failed graft. For a specific diagnosis, an incisional biopsy was obtained from the conjunctival lesion, and sections were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin using the periodic acid-Schiff technique to observe the sections under light microscopy (Olympus BX43, Tokyo, Japan).

On physical exam, there was evidence of a midline scar, the abdomen was soft with mild tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant and the liver span was approximately 10 cm in the mid-clavicular line by percussion. A complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel were normal; however, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) showed a mild elevation of 66 U/L and 51 U/L, respectively. Serum bilirubin levels and alkaline phosphatase levels were within normal limits. Due to the reported complaint of right upper quadrant pain and the associated abnormal liver function tests, an abdominal ultrasound (US) was ordered. This showed fatty liver disease and a left liver lobe isoechoic liver mass. A computed tomography (CT) triple phase abdomen scan was done demonstrating a 2.5 cm exophytic mass in the liver in segment 2 (Figure ). The next day of admission, the patient\u2019s pain improved with analgesia. As no clear diagnosis was made, he was later discharged with an intention to perform an elective abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This MRI revealed a single mass in segment 2 of the liver, with features of a hepatic adenoma (Figure ). The surgical team was consulted and evaluated the patient and an elective percutaneous liver biopsy was performed. Examination of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections revealed histological evidence of splenic tissue with distinct red and white pulp areas, with evidence of passive congestion (Figure ). The red pulp included thin-walled venous sinusoids that were congested with red blood cells that were positive for CD8 stains (Figure ), with surrounding macrophages and few lymphocytes. The white pulp included thickened meshwork of cords showing arterioles she",

    "original_text": "A 73-year-old white man presented in 2014 with a chronic fistulation of his left mandible. He had a history of primary hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesteremia. Furthermore, in 2010 the diagnosis of a poorly differentiated SCC of his oropharynx was made: tumor stage cT4 cN2 cM0 (TNM, 7th edition, 2010). Clinical findings displayed an exophytic tumor portion, which derived from the right lateral wall of his oropharynx, grew into his right epiglottic vallecula, infiltrated the lingual epiglottis and exceeded the midline in the region of his tongue base. Due to the size of the tumor and at his request a tumor resection was not made. Hence, primary therapy was performed as combined radiochemotherapy. External beam radiation was performed with a fractionation of five times 1.8 Gy per week up to an overall dose of 72 Gy. This was supplemented by a simultaneous chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the first and sixth week of radiotherapy. During the oncological follow up there were no signs of residual tumor or lymph node metastases.\nDue to an increasingly painful restricted mouth opening in 2013 he sought medical help again. At that time an intraoral fistula of the mucosa in his left retromolar region and a pathological fracture of his left mandibular angle on the basis of an osteoradionecrosis were detected. These conditions required a complete resection of his mandible in the retromolar region and the temporary bridging of the bony defect with a reconstruction plate (Fig. ). Despite intensive wound care, wound healing only took place very slowly and remained insufficient with distinctive wound dehiscence.\nAfter this he firstly attended our hospital in 2014 with exposed osteosynthesis material and persisting suppurating fistulation intraorally and extraorally with the desire for a definitive reconstruction of his mandible. A first reconstruction attempt with a microvascular anastomosed graft from his right iliac crest failed due to an insufficient venous anastomosis. The resected bone of his defect-",
