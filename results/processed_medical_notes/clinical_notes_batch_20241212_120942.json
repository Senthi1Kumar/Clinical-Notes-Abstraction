At the beginning of 2016, she presented with epigastric abdominal pain, postprandial vomiting, a 6 kg loss in six months, asthenia, and adynamia. Endoscopic studies were initiated, documenting a tumor mass dependent on the gastric antrum, with a pathology report from August 2016 compatible with a well-differentiated and eroded gastric adenocarcinoma of the intestinal type, without evidence of distant metastases in CT scans. She was taken for an exploratory laparotomy, finding a large antral gastric tumor with the involvement of the pylorus and the first portion of the duodenum, without peritoneal or hepatic seeding. Due to duodenal involvement, it was considered unresectable, so palliative gastrojejunostomy was performed. Palliative chemotherapy with capecitabine and cisplatin was proposed, but the patient did not accept antineoplastic treatment, so she was treated with exclusive support care. During 2017, the disease remained stable by image, and in May 2018, it presented progression due to the increased neoplastic thickening of the stomach, the development of ganglionic metastases to the retroperitoneal space, episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, and the elevation of tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 19.9). Chemotherapy was proposed again, but the patient refused treatment, so palliative radiotherapy was decided for hemostatic purposes at the stomach level. External radiotherapy is performed with the 3D conformal radiation (3DCRT) technique, prior planning, and computer simulation with the linear accelerator with 6 MV of energy in the fractionation of 3 Gy up to a total dose of 30 Gy in planning target volume-one (PTV1) (gastric mass + margin). This treatment was received between August 14 and 29, 2018, with the resolution of digestive bleeding episodes and symptomatic improvement.

Moreover, no diabetic mellitus, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and dyslipidemia were reported in his medical history; he had been abusing 5 methadone tablets per day and taking 2 clonazepam tablets per day since 20 years ago. He reported anorexia and a significant weight loss of 25 kg over the last 4 months. In this present admission, the patient refused to eat for fear of vomiting. Vomiting content was his consumed food; however, after stopping food receiving, it was just water and liquids. The patient reported gas passing though the last time of defecation was 5 days ago. He was conscious and dehydrated and had a cachectic appearance. Temporal muscle atrophy and a scaphoid abdomen were observed. Moreover, significant pulsation under the right last rib and epigastria was detected in both inspection and palpation, which is believed to be an aneurysm that needs an emergency investigation (Video ). Vital signs included respiratory rate = 12 per minute, pulse rate = 102 per minute, blood pressure 90/70 mm Hg, O2 saturation = 95%, and temperature = 36.8\u00b0C.

She reported having a history of chronic left leg sciatic pain that contributed to a fall two days prior to the onset of these symptoms. Her past medical history was significant for colon cancer requiring a low anterior resection, which is eight years ago. The patient was noted to be confused and tachycardic. She was afebrile but had leukocytosis of 14,000. On physical examination, she was noted to have a significant crepitus to the left thigh and knee. Radiographs of the left leg confirmed subcutaneous emphysema consistent with necrotizing fasciitis (). Prior to surgical consultation, the patient also received a pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan to evaluate for hip fractures. This further confirmed the necrotizing fasciitis (Figures and ) but also identified a collection in the presacral space () that communicated to the left leg through the left sciatic notch, which is consistent with an AL. The patient was immediately taken to the operating room for debridement of the thigh and diverting colostomy.\nAn exploratory laparotomy with diverting colostomy was created to control ongoing contamination of the leg. Intra-abdominally, there were no abnormal findings, which is consistent with the extraperitoneal nature of the disease process. The decision, at this point, was to access the extraperitoneal collection through interventional radiology so as to minimize intra-abdominal contamination. After the colostomy was completed, the left thigh and hip were incised revealing a significant amount of feculent and purulent drainage.

On physical examination, the patient had mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. A fixed mass was palpable around the periumbilical region.

Exploratory laparotomy demonstrated a broad-based multiple cystic lymphangioma within the mesentery ranging from the Treitz ligament to the transverse colon (). However, it did not involve the surrounding viscera. The lymphangioma was excised nearly completely saving mesenteric vessels by skeletonization. As a result, a very large-sized mesenteric defect from that of the jejunum to the transverse colon with centrally skeletonized vessels developed.

She had been diagnosed with schizophrenia at the age of 17 years and had taken antipsychotic drugs for 42 years. She had no history of alcohol consumption, drug use, or epileptic seizures. One day, at the age of 55 years, she lay on a road and was unable to move or speak due to a catatonic state. She was immediately admitted to a hospital. However, medicines proved ineffective, despite attempting several types of second-generation antipsychotic drugs and benzodiazepines. Her white blood-cell counts were too low for clozapine use. Thus ECT was recommended, and she was transferred to our hospital, the only hospital in the area to offer ECT.\nShe exhibited severe catatonia as well as many other psychotic symptoms, such as hallucination, delusion, and negative symptoms. She was taking risperidone 9 mg daily without side effects for nearly 10 years. Besides she had been taking magnesium oxide 1.2 g and sennoside 36 mg daily for constipation for many years. The minor tranquilizer was stopped for ECT and was no longer necessary after ECT. We performed ECT, applied three times a week for a total of 14 sessions. Thiopental and ketamine were used to induce anesthesia.\nWe evaluated her symptoms by BPRS and BFCRS (23 items) at 14 and 7 days before ECT and after the course of ECT was complete. On the same days, we measured her sAA activity levels with a colorimetric salivary biosensor (Nipro Co., Japan). In order to eliminate the effects of hospitalization, we measured sAA activity levels again not only immediately after hospitalization but also just before ECT. Thus, we measured her sAA activity levels twice before ECT. The saliva samples were collected in the morning following a 10-min rest on a chair or bed, at least 2 h after the last meal and tooth-brushing.\nECT was extremely successful, and her symptoms considerably improved",

Computed Tomography (CT) demonstrated a compression of the IVC by an AAA moderately developing to the right, with apparent collapse and caudal thrombosis and a nonfunctioning right kidney (urea and creatinine blood levels remained within a normal range) (). Subsequently, an IVC filter was placed infrarenally through transjugular access. Inferior vena cavagram performed before the deployment of the filter, confirmed the collapse of the IVC ().

Most recently, the mass became ulcerated with active serous discharge; however, due to the lack of health insurance, the patient did not seek any medical attention.

There was associated localized breast pain, but no weight loss, fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, back pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, cough, blurry vision, nor headaches.\nShe had no prior personal or family history of skin and breast cancers. She had no history of excessive exposure to sunlight, radiation exposure, arsenic ingestion, or a history of immunosuppression.\nPhysical examination reveals an elderly female in no apparent distress. Vital signs were stable apart from an elevated blood pressure of 164/85 mmHg. Examination of the left breast revealed a large fungating mass of >10 cm in size, occupying most of the mid and outer breast with a distortion of the nipple areolar complex ().

Based on findings of chronic active hepatitis in liver biopsy, autoimmune hepatitis was suspected, and treatment with prednisolone and azathioprine initiated. Seven years later, an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed a stricture in the common bile duct which was interpreted as possible extrahepatic PSC or tentatively an inborn anomaly of the common bile duct. After 20 years with fluctuating transaminases between 100 and 300 U/L and no recorded major clinical events, she developed general edema and thoracic spider nevi. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension with massive ascites. After an initial response to symptomatic treatment, she soon developed uncompensated liver failure with severe hepatic encephalopathy and was transferred to the national transplant unit for work-up and listing for liver transplantation. A few days later, an ABO-identical donor liver was available and LTX was performed with a duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis. The histopathological examination of the liver explant revealed cirrhosis and pathological changes typical for underlying PSC. Cholangiocarcinoma in situ was found in the common hepatic duct, the cystic duct, and the common bile duct, involving the resection margin. It was decided that the patient should be controlled with ERC with brush cytology from the duct-to-duct anastomosis after 6 months due to the histopathological findings. The brush cytology showed mild to moderate epithelial dysplasia in the common bile duct. After discussion in the multidisciplinary team, a pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) was decided due to the risk of development of cholangiocarcinoma. Ten months after LTX, the procedure was performed. Because of a possible increased risk of anastomotic leak due to immunosuppression, an enteropancreatic anastomosis was avoided and the pancreatic duct was occluded. The surgical specimen showed intestinal metaplasia in the common bile duct, but no dysplasia or carcinoma. She was then followed according to standard post-liver transplantation follow-up regimen. The patient developed insulin",

A CT scan showed a pancreatic head mass compressing the common bile duct. For palliation of hyperbilirubinemia, a palliative stent was placed in the common bile duct. A fine needle aspirate obtained through an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. A follow-up CT scan performed on February 13, 2015 revealed a 3.6 \u00d7 2.7 cm pancreatic head mass that abutted the superior mesenteric artery and one of its proximal branches. There were suspicious peripancreatic and retroperitoneal nodes and no evidence of distant disease. At the beginning of March, she began taking 50,000 U vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) daily, ordered directly from the Internet and not under the direction of a healthcare practitioner. Repeat EUS and biopsy on March 3, 2015 again confirmed adenocarcinoma with papillary features. She was referred to an oncologist and surgeon for evaluation. A triple phase CT was done on March 16, 2015 that showed a stable mass without any evidence of involvement of the celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery. Upfront chemotherapy was recommended, with consideration of surgery in the future.\nShe received gemcitabine/protein nanoparticle-bound paclitaxel in March. On day 10 of cycle 1, she developed neutropenic fever complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She was intubated for a brief time who then recovered to her baseline functional status. She was discharged on April 19. Based on her frailty, she was deemed to be a poor candidate for surgery and chemotherapy was not resumed.\nShe was referred to radiation oncology for consideration of stereotactic body radiotherapy, but she decided to first pursue alternative therapies. She visited an alternative care clinic in April and began taking chelodium, curcumin, community mushroom blend, viscosin, and naltrexone. She also continued to take her daily dose of 50,000 U",

Laboratory tests of the clotting system and blood cell count revealed no abnormalities. Haemostasis disorders had not been found during any of surgical procedures. History of bleeding or bleeding tendencies was negative, and family history was unremarkable. From the admission day to the Surgery Department the patient received low molecular weight heparin in a preventive dose, which was continued at home. At admission to the Cardiology Department, the diagnosis of STEMI of the anterior wall was made and angioplasty of the critically stenotic anterior descending artery with implantation of an everolimus-eluting stent was performed. A standard dose of 5000 IU of unfractionated heparin was administered intravenously during the procedure, with no glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor (because of recent abdominal surgery). Aspirin and clopidogrel were introduced in recommended saturating doses and enoxaparin was discontinued. At admission the platelet count was 124 000/\u00b5l. Control blood cell counts performed throughout the hospitalization revealed a gradual reduction of the platelet count to 57,000/\u00b5l on day 4, and to 4,000/\u00b5l on day 8 after the angioplasty (verified in citrate-collected blood). On day 10 dot-like petechiae occurred in the area of the sternum, feet and lower legs.

The patient had an uneventful past medical history and was born via spontaneous vaginal delivery. A rectal temperature showed a fever of 105.1 \u00b0F. Heart rate was 188 bpm and respiratory rate was 54. Physical exam revealed usage of accessory respiratory musculature with retractions, diminished left-sided breath sounds with crackles, and tachycardia. The patient was positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) on a nasopharyngeal swab and negative for a rapid strep test and influenza. A frontal and lateral chest X-ray indicated a slightly hyperinflated left lung with a basilar infiltrate involving the lingula and left lower lobe - lungs were otherwise normal without effusion nor pneumothorax.\nThe outside facility\u2019s emergency department recommended beginning ceftriaxone in the setting of RSV bronchiolitis and possible pneumonia; the mother opted to elope with the child to seek a second opinion at a nearby hospital. The patient appeared at the nearby hospital the next morning and was admitted. Lab work indicated a white blood cell count of 19.8 x 103/\u03bcL and fever had decreased to 103.5 \u00b0F on acetaminophen. The patient received four doses of ceftriaxone over the next four days but demonstrated the development of a worsening pneumothorax on repeat chest X-rays done on day three and day four.

A CT scan showed a pancreatic head mass compressing the common bile duct. For palliation of hyperbilirubinemia, a palliative stent was placed in the common bile duct. A fine needle aspirate obtained through an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. A follow-up CT scan performed on February 13, 2015 revealed a 3.6 \u00d7 2.7 cm pancreatic head mass that abutted the superior mesenteric artery and one of its proximal branches. There were suspicious peripancreatic and retroperitoneal nodes and no evidence of distant disease. At the beginning of March, she began taking 50,000 U vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) daily, ordered directly from the Internet and not under the direction of a healthcare practitioner. Repeat EUS and biopsy on March 3, 2015 again confirmed adenocarcinoma with papillary features. She was referred to an oncologist and surgeon for evaluation. A triple phase CT was done on March 16, 2015 that showed a stable mass without any evidence of involvement of the celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery. Upfront chemotherapy was recommended, with consideration of surgery in the future.\nShe received gemcitabine/protein nanoparticle-bound paclitaxel in March. On day 10 of cycle 1, she developed neutropenic fever complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She was intubated for a brief time who then recovered to her baseline functional status. She was discharged on April 19. Based on her frailty, she was deemed to be a poor candidate for surgery and chemotherapy was not resumed.\nShe was referred to radiation oncology for consideration of stereotactic body radiotherapy, but she decided to first pursue alternative therapies. She visited an alternative care clinic in April and began taking chelodium, curcumin, community mushroom blend, viscosin, and naltrexone. She also continued to take her daily dose of 50,000 U",

His history was significant for the diagnosis of malignant melanoma of the right chest with lymphatic spread to the right axilla 1 year prior.

At the time of our evaluation, he was asymptomatic, and there were no suspicious skin lesions or palpable lymphadenopathy. Vital signs were normal. Complete blood cell count, metabolic panel, and coagulation studies were within normal limits. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (CT) showed increased metabolic activity in the proximal pancreas, with standardized uptake value of 10.36. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen revealed a 1.7 cm focal pancreatic mass and a large left upper retroperitoneal lymph node.

Clinical examination was inconclusive; laboratory investigations showed no sign of acute pancreatitis exacerbation. Serum amylase and lipase were within the normal range.

The size of the mediastinal cyst was 14.5 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 16 cm. It was shown by multiplanar reconstructions that all of the lesions were communicating. The esophagus was partially surrounded by large cysts in the retrocardial and hiatal regions, which compressed the left ventricle (Figure ). A further examination with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed the cystic structure with a small contact area to the pancreatic tissue and a high-grade stenosis of the pancreatic duct with only moderate dilation up to 6 mm of the distal pancreatic duct (Figure ). A dedicated contrast-enhanced MRI examination of the pancreas in the same session showed atrophy and postinflammatory tissue changes. No signs of acute inflammation or neoplasm were evident.\nEndoscopy combined with endosonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography confirmed the pancreatic duct stenosis and dilatation without communication of the ductal system to the pseudocysts.

    "original_text": "A male, 11 years old, suffered from pain in the left ankle joint after trauma and limitation of motion for 10 years, and the symptoms aggravated with claudication for 1 year. Physical examination showed swelling of the left ankle joint, extensive tenderness, normal skin temperature, and limited range of motion for ankle plantar flexion and dorsi flexion. Venous blood test showed no abnormalities in ESR, CRP, and blood routine. Radiograph and MRI suggested hyperplasia of synovial tissue in the articular cavity and epiphyseal injury of the distal tibia. Ankle arthrocentesis was conducted, and a small amount of turbid liquid was drained. No diagnosis of ankle TB was suggested. Preoperative diagnoses were (1) traumatic ankle synovitis and (2) epiphyseal injury of the left distal tibia. We initially planned to perform articular cavity debridement; however, when we conducted the surgery, we saw obvious hyperplasia of synovial tissue and the cartilage was obviously damaged; TB was highly suspected. Considering that the patient was still a child, ankle arthrodesis was not suitable in this case. Therefore, we only performed articular cavity debridement after obtaining the tissue sample for biopsy. Pathological examination confirmed ankle TB, and the result was also positive for TB-PCR. The patient was prevented from weight bearing for 6 weeks postoperatively; anti-TB treatment of rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide were given orally; his nutrition was strengthened. Regular follow-ups were conducted. The swelling of the posterior malleolus was gradually relieved. After the reexamination at 6 months postoperatively, his anti-TB therapy was adjusted and only rifampicin and isoniazid were continued for maintenance treatment of 12 months.

The symptoms first developed 10 yr ago with cough, sputum, wheezing, nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea, which had remained with no change in size for 2 yr. She visited a local clinic due to the enlargement of a mass-like lesion 8 yr ago and then started to take 5 mg of prednisolone every other day. The swelling was temporarily reduced with a systemic steroid; however, the mass lesions were again aggravated whenever the steroid was stopped. She suffered from chronic cough with sputum and recurrent upper respiratory infections recent as of 1 yr; in addition, she was diagnosed with bronchial asthma 6 months ago. Her mass lesions were also aggravated in recent 1 yr; subsequently, she visited our hospital (October 2, 2012) for an evaluation of swelling of eyes and neck as well as recurrent respiratory infections. She experienced neither eye pain nor neck pain, did not complain of any visual problems or show systemic symptoms (such as febrile sensation and general weakness). Her asthmatic symptoms were well-controlled after being prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid. She had no previous history of any drug or food allergies.

Her chief complaint was a slowly growing painless swelling involving the right side of the mandible that had started one year previously. Her past medical history revealed no previous surgeries or diseases. Her vital signs were recorded as 120/80 mmHg blood pressure, a pulse of 103 beats per minute (bpm), 15 respirations per minute, height - 5.1 ft, weight - 165 lb, and a calculated body mass index (BMI) of 23.71. No other medical conditions were identified, and the patient did not report taking any medications. Clinical examination revealed an intraoral swelling involving the posterior part of the body of the mandible and extending to the ramus on the right side. On palpation, the lesion was hard in consistency, except for select areas which exhibited a softer texture.\nThe patient was referred to a private dental imaging center for a CBCT scan to evaluate the extent of the lesion. A board-certified oral and maxillofacial radiologist performed the radiographic interpretation of the CBCT scan. The scan revealed a well-defined radiolucent lesion ranging from the interdental bone in between the second and third right molars and extending to the ramus of the mandible posteriorly in the anteroposterior direction. The lesion extended from the alveolar crest to the inferior border of the mandible in the superior-inferior direction (Figure ).\nOsteolytic changes of the alveolar crest margin distal to the third molar were noted and displaced the roots of the third molar more distally. The sagittal cut showed that the lesion had a multilocular appearance with an incomplete internal septal structure, demonstrating wispy-like septations.

The disease under discussion is a pulmonary atresia associated with interventricular communication and dextrocardia. A complete surgical correction was performed when the patient was three years old. Important ventricular dysfunction ensued during the following years and a severe mitral regurgitation was also diagnosed. He underwent a mitral valvuloplasty when he was nine years old. Despite these efforts, his left ventricular ejection fraction was 30% at the time it was decided by another team of specialists for the implantation of the ICD to perform primary prevention.\nThe device settings at the time of the described events were the following: DDD mode, base rate 50 ppm. Ventricular arrhythmia detection was programmed in three different zones, starting at 330 ms for ventricular tachycardia (VT) 1, 300 ms for VT 2, and 280 ms for ventricular fibrillation (VF). Antitachycardia therapy for VT 1 zone was off. For VT 2, it was two times bursts, then two times ramp, and then sequential 40 Joules shocks. In VF zone, the device would deliver burst while charging, and then sequential 40 Joules shocks. Detection parameters were set for 26 beatings for VT 1, 18 for VT 2, and 10 out of 14 for VF. The onset, stability, and SMART detection algorithms were turned on for VT 1 and VT 2.\nThe patient was admitted at the Emergency Department in June 2018 after receiving eight shocks from the device on the same day, with a prolonged syncope after the third shock. This patient had not received ICD therapy since implantation until that day.
