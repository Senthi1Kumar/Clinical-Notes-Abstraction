Preoperative physical evaluation showed a normal mouth opening and Mallampati score III with limited neck mobility; a sLMA was chosen to maintain the airway preoperatively.

One hour after the injection, he suddenly developed hypertension, tachycardia (Fig. ), and hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio was less than 100 mmHg). Wheezing sounds were heard on chest auscultation and much pinkish foamy secretion was suctioned through his tracheal tube. He showed choking-like signs and his ventilator monitor showed an extremely high airway pressure and significantly decreased tidal volume, which limited its function, and he was transitioned to manual ventilation.

On admission, his blood pressure was 86/55 mmHg, heart rate was 60 b.p.m., and a visible apex beat was present at the 6th left intercostal space just medial to the left mid-clavicular line (, Video S1). Computed tomography revealed a pseudoaneurysm with mild calcification, protruding outside the thorax around the apex of the heart (Figure ). Echocardiogram showed akinesis of the anteroseptal wall and a 40 \u00d7 27-mm pseudoaneurysm around the apex of the heart, moving in synchrony with the heartbeat, and a 17% LV ejection fraction (Figure , , Video S2). The connection was confirmed between the pseudoaneurysm and the left ventricle with a spontaneous echo contrast. An underlying infection could have contributed to the formation of the pseudoaneurysm. We theorize that as the pseudoaneurysm progressed, the tissue along its path of progression was mechanically damaged. This gradual damage could have resulted in impaired structural integrity of the surrounding tissue which ultimately allowed certain segments of the heart to protrude into regions beyond the normal anatomical confines of the heart. Left ventricular ejection fraction slightly improved from 17% to 25%, before and after the operation, respectively. The patient was discharged after a protracted hospital course.

    "original_text": "The recipient was a 60-year-old man with end-stage renal disease related to diabetic nephropathy. The donor was the 63-year-old wife of the recipient. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) revealed a horseshoe kidney with no hydronephrosis or calculi in the donor (). Dynamic CT showed one renal artery and one renal vein on the right side, two renal arteries and one renal vein on the left side, and several accessory arteries and veins distributed to the lower fused parenchyma (). Intravenous urography showed no communicating calyceal system (). Because the renal function of the left kidney was slightly lower than that of the right kidney according to renal scintigraphy, the left kidney was chosen for use as a transplant.\nThe surgery was performed in March 2013. A donor exploration was performed through an abdominal midline incision. The accessory arteries were ligated. The left kidney was procured by clamping and ligation of the left renal artery. To demarcate the boundary, the left renal artery was cannulated for in situ perfusion with perfusion solution. Because the lower vein drained the left and right kidneys, the perfused boundary of the isthmus was unclear. Furthermore, the isthmus was clamped during perfusion, and the boundary of the isthmus was confirmed ().

An ultrasonic dissection device (Sonicision) was used for this procedure. The same device was used during colpotomy. The vagina was closed laparoscopically using a 2\u20130 vicryl running suturing technique with clips. A standard single dose of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was administered. The surgery and postoperative course were uneventful.\nSixteen months later, she presented due to persistent complaints, especially of pain of the vaginal top during sexual intercourse. Her medical history was unremarkable except for surgery for endometriosis mentioned above. She had a normal bodyweight (body mass index 24), and besides a 10-pack year history of cigarette smoking no risk factors for impaired wound healing were identified. She was planned for repeat surgery for endometriosis. Ovariectomy, coagulation of the infundibulopelvic ligament and laparoscopic excision of the vaginal vault were performed. After mobilisation of the bladder, the vaginal vault was excised with an ultrasonic excision system and closed laparoscopically with a vicryl 0 running suture. A standard single dose of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was administered. Histological analysis revealed inflammation of the vagina without evident endometriosis.\nTen weeks after surgery, she presented to our emergency department with severe abdominal pain after sexual intercourse. On examination, vaginal dehiscence was seen with exposure of fat tissue, probably omentum. Since the pain disappeared shortly after hospitalisation and no evisceration was seen, she was planned for a laparoscopic repair with an omental flap.\nDuring laparoscopic repair the omentum was found to be stuck in the 1.5 cm vaginal dehiscence. First, the omentum was easily removed from the dehiscence.

    "original_text": "We present a 47-year-old woman who had balance problems for three months. In January 2015, imaging techniques revealed multiple brain metastases and a right lung malignant lesion with mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes. A supraclavicular biopsy revealed an adenocarcinoma histopathology with thyroid-specific transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and cytokeratin-7 (CK-7) positivity. She had imbalance with gait disorder and no other complaints. She was admitted to our hospital for the treatment of the brain metastases. A cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that she had six metastases. Two of them were large in diameter and one of them was creating pressure on the brainstem with an edematous zone surrounding the core lesion (Figure ). For this reason, she was advised to have WBRT first and robotic radiosurgery boost one month later according to the response. The patient did not agree to undergo WBRT because of concerns and anxiety about potential side effects. Between January 22, 2015 and January 28, 2015, the patient had robotic radiosurgery for her six brain lesions. Two lesions were treated with 25 Gy in five fractions and the remainder were treated with 18 Gy in one fraction. Her imbalance and gait disorder improved rapidly.

At the age of 1 year 2 months against a background of acute respiratory viral infection, there was a regress in development\u2014the boy stopped walking. Subsequently, rachitic skeletal changes, an increase in the volume of the abdomen appeared, and a loss of motor skills progressed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain revealed a mildly expressed leukopathy in white matter of parietal lobes. Proteinuria and glucosuria appeared at the age of 1 year 8 months.\nAt the age of 2 years 2 months, he was admitted to Russian children's clinical hospital with psychomotor retardation and treatment resistance.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 32-year-old Caucasian male who was diagnosed in 2004 with mycosis fungoides after developing a pruritic rash. There was no family history of cancer. He was initially treated with topical nitrogen mustard and later received UVB narrow band therapy. In October 2012, the patient presented with a cough, dyspnea, fever, chills, left pleuritic chest pain and significant weight loss. These symptoms were associated with a flare of his skin lesions. A CT scan of the chest demonstrated extensive left cervical, supraclavicular and mediastinal adenopathy, as well as left upper lobe airspace disease. Review of pathology from a left cervical lymph node biopsy from December 2012 revealed complete effacement of the normal architecture by a diffuse infiltration of large and giant pleomorphic lymphocytes characterized by conspicuous nucleoli and large amounts of cytoplasm (Figure a). Immunohistochemical stains showed weak CD45 and strong CD43 expression (Figure b), with strong CD30 expression in the membrane and Golgi patterns (Figure c). The malignant cells expressed cytoplasmic ALK (Figure d) but lacked expression of CD 3, 4, 5 and 8. A T cell lineage was confirmed in the tumor cells of the initial biopsy sample by clonal T-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement. Identical infiltrates were identified in material from recurrent biopsies of skin and subcutaneous tissue, and from lung and endobronchial biopsies at the time of progression.\nAfter an initial response to four cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy, the disease progressed rapidly while the patient was on therapy. He was started on gemcitabine, dexamethasone and cisplatin (GDP) chemotherapy in preparation for an autologous stem cell transplant but progressed after 3 cycles.

    "cleaned_text": "the patient was a 32-year-old caucasian male who was diagnosed in 2004 with mycosis fungoides after developing a pruritic rash. there was no family history of cancer. he was initially treated with topical nitrogen mustard and later received uvb narrow band therapy. in october 2012, the patient presented with a cough, dyspnea, fever, chills, left pleuritic chest pain and significant weight loss. these symptoms were associated with a flare of his skin lesions. a ct scan of the chest demonstrated extensive left cervical, supraclavicular and mediastinal adenopathy, as well as left upper lobe airspace disease. review of pathology from a left cervical lymph node biopsy from december 2012 revealed complete effacement of the normal architecture by a diffuse infiltration of large and giant pleomorphic lymphocytes characterized by conspicuous nucleoli and large amounts of cytoplasm (figure a). immunohistochemical stains showed weak cd45 and strong cd43 expression (figure b), with strong cd30 expression in the membrane and golgi patterns (figure c). the malignant cells expressed cytoplasmic alk (figure d) but lacked expression of cd 3, 4, 5 and 8. a t cell lineage was confirmed in the tumor cells of the initial biopsy sample by clonal t-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement. identical infiltrates were identified in material from recurrent biopsies of skin and subcutaneous tissue, and from lung and endobronchial biopsies at the time of progression.\nafter an initial response to four cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (chop) chemotherapy, the disease progressed rapidly while the patient was on therapy. he was started on gemcitabine, dexamethasone and cisplatin (gdp) chemotherapy in preparation for an autologous stem cell transplant but progressed after 3 cycles. the patient then received one cycle of the cd30 antibody\u2013drug conjugate brentuximab, with a response but tolerated the treatment poorly. he was subsequently started on the alk small-molecule kinase inhibitor crizotinib and tolerated the therapy well with an improved performance status. a",

She complained of right upper quadrant fullness, and physical examination revealed a remote right subcostal incision. At the age of 12 years, she had first developed decreased appetite, weight loss, fatigue, pruritus, and subsequently became jaundiced. Medical records from that episode revealed that an endoscopic biliary stent was placed with surgical exploration through a right subcostal incision and partial resection/enucleation of a pancreatic mass. In the intervening 12 years, the mass had persisted and enlarged, although the patient was asymptomatic, having neither anorexia, pruritus, nor jaundice.\nRoutine hematology and basic chemistry panels were normal. The tumor marker cancer antigen 19-9 was mildly elevated at 89 U/mL (<35 U/mL). An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast revealed an 8.2 \u00d7 7.6 cm heterogeneous-enhancing lesion, prominently involving the uncinate process of the pancreas (). The pancreatic head and neck were displaced and splayed around the anterior aspect of the tumor. The mass abutted the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) as well as the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). There was no evidence of main pancreatic ductal dilatation and the pancreatic neck, body, and tail were normal. Imaging showed no evidence of metastatic disease to the liver or regional lymph nodes. The mass was believed to be an SPT, based on the previous partial resection and the accompanying pathology report.\nThe patient underwent an open cholecystectomy and a difficult classic pancreaticoduodenectomy. The operative time was 12 h and the estimated intraoperative blood loss was 1500 mL. There was no evidence of metastasis, but the tumor had adhered extensively to the SMV and portal vein and surrounded the SMA. We were able to accomplish the separation of the tumor from the venous structures without incident; however, separating the tumor from the SMA proved challenging",

The patient underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography that revealed thickening of the proximal common bile duct with proximal biliary dilatation and an absence of distant disease. Incidentally noted on the MRI was that the third portion of the duodenum did not cross to the left of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and the majority of the small intestine lies in the patient's right abdomen, whereas the large intestine lies in the left. Also, the SMA lies to the right of the SMV consistent with gastrointestinal malrotation ().

Upon surgical exploration, a mass was identified in the proximal common bile duct (with no evidence of disseminated disease) and gastrointestinal malrotation was confirmed. Oncological resection of the extrahepatic biliary tree was performed from the level of the bifurcation of the right and left hepatic ducts to the intrapancreatic portion of the bile duct, along with a portal lymphadenectomy. A biliary enteric reconstruction was created with a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. To compensate for the malrotation, the proximal jejunum was divided 50 cm distal to where the duodenum exited the retroperitoneum and the 50 cm Roux limb was brought up in a right paracolic position rather easily, as the hepatic flexure of the colon was absent, such that it simply rested over the top of the duodenum.

His physical examination showed a lethargic, confused child with signs of moderate dehydration. His liver and spleen were not palpable. Central nervous system examination revealed normal cranial nerves, and normal upper, and lower limbs. His initial laboratory investigations showed serum ammonia of 135 \u00b5mol/L (normal <50 \u00b5mol/L) with a normal serum lactate and negative urine ketones (). Complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function tests were all normal. His cerebrospinal fluid analysis was negative for viral and bacterial infections. His brain CT was unremarkable.

We diagnosed the tumor as a Bismuth type 1 cholangiocarcinoma, and performed endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage. Biopsies of the tumor revealed adenocarcinoma. The estimated volume of the postoperative liver remnant was less than 35%. Therefore, percutaneous transhepatic portal vein embolization (PTPE) of the right branch of her portal vein was performed (Fig. ). Twenty-one days later, the volume of the left lobe of her liver increased, and we performed right hepatectomy, caudate lobectomy, extrahepatic bile duct resection, and lymph node dissection. Node dissection included resection of hilar and pericholedochal nodes in the hepatoduodenal ligament, common hepatic artery nodes, and those at the celiac trunk, and posterior and anterior pancreaticoduodenal nodes.\nHistological examination of the tumor showed moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma without regional lymph node metastasis, a pathological stage II tumor according to the Union for International Cancer Control classification of malignant tumors, 7th edition (Fig. ). Postoperative blood laboratory tests showed that liver enzymes were slightly elevated, but that total bilirubin was within normal limits. Resumption of diet started on postoperative day (POD) 3. Although the fluid in the abdominal drain had been serous until POD 4, the appearance of the fluid became milky on POD 5, and the amount of the drainage increased",

It was worse with pressure, palpation and movement. Over the same time period, she had worsening headaches, fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. This pain was clearly differentiated by the patient from her 8-year history of IBS which was characterised by postprandial crampy pain, bloating, foul gas and diarrhoea which responded to periodic 2-week courses of the antibiotic rifaximin. Over the course of the year, rifaximin was prescribed but did not help this pain.\nThe patient presented for evaluation in the GI clinic after 4 days of extremely severe, sharp right lower abdominal pain that awoke her from sleep and was associated with a 100oF temperature. The right lower quadrant was markedly tender with guarding. The white blood count was normal. The CT was abnormal (). Despite administration of acetaminophen and ibuprofen, the pain worsened and after 7 days of unremitting pain, laparoscopic surgery was performed. Gross findings included an enlarged area of fat near the normal appendix that had a small amount of superficial focal fat necrosis. After surgical resection of the appendage, the right lower pain immediately abated and she was discharged. Standard H&E stain showed adipose tissue with patchy areas of fat necrosis with repair. The appendectomy specimen was normal.\nColonoscopy was performed 2 weeks after surgery owing to haematochezia.

Two years after her surgery, a 6-month follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan revealed enlargement of the thyroid tumor, but she remained asymptomatic. Blood tests revealed a small increase in CA 19-9 (from 3.5 ng/ml 6 months earlier to 8.9 ng/ml) and in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (from 1.7 ng/ml to 4.6 ng/ml). Her thyroid function tests were normal. Physical examination and laryngoscopy revealed a firm elastic nodule in the thyroid gland and left vocal fold paralyzed in the midline position. The maximum phonation time (MPT) was 10 seconds. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Ultrasonographic examination of the neck revealed a solid tumor in the left thyroid lobe with a diameter of 35 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 20 mm. CT showed spread of this mass to the tracheoesophageal groove, suggesting invasion of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN; ). Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid tumor showed a few clusters of elongated tumor cells with hyperchromatic dark nuclei on a background of benign hepatocytes, and the mass was reported as metastatic adenocarcinoma. Positron emission tomography-CT showed focal uptake in the left thyroid lobe with no evidence of distant metastasis (). Therefore, the diagnosis was metastasis of adenocarcinoma to the left thyroid gland.

    "original_text": "A 29-year-old African-American male was admitted to our hospital because of headache associated with nausea, vomiting, and blurred vision. Intermittent headaches over the preceding 4 years were ascribed to CM1. In the month prior to admission, the patient's headaches had increased in frequency and in severity. He described the headaches as pounding and rated the intensity of the pain as 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, where 10 is the most severe. The pain began in the occipital region and extended to the forehead unrelated to coughing or straining. A few days before admission, nausea, vomiting, and blurred vision accompanied some of the episodes of headache. As the patient's headaches continued to worsen, he was admitted to an outside hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed an 18 mm cerebellar tonsillar herniation and a disproportionately large communicating fourth ventricle with dilated but stable ventricular system, and no change from previous studies []. Cervical spine MRI was normal. In light of the patient's worsening symptoms, he was transferred to the University Hospital of Brooklyn for surgical intervention.

Investigations showed a leukocyte count of 10,000/\u00b5l with thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 117,000/\u00b5l) and elevated C reactive protein (CRP). Urine analysis showed red cells with red cell casts and urine culture was negative. Blood cultures yielded Staphylococci which were resistant to methicillin and sensitive to vancomycin with an MIC of 0.25 \u00b5g/ml. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed two mobile vegetations (10.3 \u00d7 3.7 mm and 12.4 \u00d7 1.3 mm in size) attached to prosthetic mitral valve and further a transoesophageal echocardiogram confirmed these findings. He was started on intravenous vancomycin, gentamicin and oral rifampicin.\nDespite the intravenous antibiotics with adequate vancomycin trough serum levels he remained bacteremic with continuing fever and persistent isolation of MRSA in blood cultures, and high levels of CRP. On the fifth day of admission, patient complained of severe headache and computed tomography (CT) scan of head revealed a subarachnoid haemorrhage and a intracranial haemorrhage possibly following rupture of mycotic aneurysms (Fig. ). At that moment patient was considered for surgical treatment as he had persistent bacteraemia along with multiple embolic events. However, considering the suggestions of the multi-disciplinary team (microbiologist, neurosurgeon and cardiothoracic surgeon) the decision was made to continue the total course of antibiotics while planning for an early surgery since there was no urgent or emergency indication for a surgery. A second surgery at this point would have been more difficult and operating on an infected field carries a high risk of postoperative complications. Moreover since",

The patient also complained of numbness along the distribution of the radial digital nerve of the finger. There was no history of trauma. Examination showed a firm tender mass measuring 3.5 \u00d7 2 cm with an overlying skin erythema. The patient was unable to fully extend or flex the finger because of pain. There was also a flexion contracture of the proximal interphalangeal joint. Static two-point discrimination on the radial side of the ring finger was 10 mm. Plain x-rays showed no bony abnormalities or calcifications. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an iso-intense (similar to intensity of muscle) lesion on T1-weighted images (). T2-weighted images showed high intensity in the center of the lesion and low intensity at the periphery of the lesion ().\nSurgical excision was done under general anesthesia. The mass infiltrated the entire flexor sheath over the proximal phalanx as well as the checkrein ligament of the proximal interphalangeal joint. The common digital artery of the 3rd web space was obliterated by the tumor. The radial digital nerve of the ring finger was stretched and attenuated (). Total excision was done and this required excision of the flexor sheath over the proximal phalanx (including the entire A2 pulley), the checkrein ligament and the common digital artery. The digital nerve was preserved (, ).\nHistology showed the classic 3 histological zones of myositis ossificans: a central cellular / fibroblastic zone, an intermediate zone of osteoid (immature bone) and an outer zone of mature bone ().

Her symptoms initially began at the age of 27 years with a 2-week period of a fever of unknown origin, chills, night sweats, and fatigue. Meanwhile, she was suffering from polyuria, polydipsia, and nocturia. Her mother had a history of melanoma, and the patient was a social drinker and former smoker. She had an extensive workup for infectious disease such as CMV and autoimmune disorders without a definite diagnosis (Table ).\nAs part of her workup, she had an abdominal CT scan, which demonstrated lytic bony lesions in her right femur, neck, and ribs, including a subacute fracture in her right 10th rib. The scan also revealed mild splenomegaly. The patient did not have any bone pain. She was referred to hematology-oncology because of her lytic bone lesions and workup for multiple myeloma. Subsequent imaging showed multiple bony lytic lesions in her humerus, radius, and iliac bones. A biopsy from her iliac bone showed non-Langerhans CD 68+ histiocytosis compatible with ECD.\nHer DI was thought to be the result of pituitary involvement, which was also seen in her brain imaging. In the course of her disease, because of an extensive lytic lesion in the right hip bone, she underwent hip stabilization surgery. She also received DDAVP along with radiation therapy to the pituitary stalk and was treated with systemic chemotherapy (cladribine, IFN alpha, and hydrocortisone). She later developed hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency secondary to intracranial radiation therapy and pituitary dysfunction.\nFive years after the diagnosis, she developed resistant hypertension and was referred to nephrology. Her blood pressures were constantly over 180/120 mm Hg despite treatment with lisinopril 20 mg per day. In the primary workup, her plasma aldosterone and renin activity levels as well as electrolytes were within normal limits (summarized in Table and Table",

Later in his course, but prior to presenting for medical care, he developed additional symptoms of back and abdominal pain. He was immunocompetent, and his medical history was significant for previous myocardial infarction, for which two drug-eluting stents were placed, and a perforated gastric ulcer repaired in 1990. He had no surgical history or family history of aortic aneurysms. His occupation was animal husbandry, and he worked on a farm that sells livestock with many cattle. He described an injury to the inside of his left leg after he slipped on ice and fell into cattle manure several months prior to the onset of his illness. It was a small open wound that was not reported to have clinical signs of infection; therefore, he did not receive antibiotics at that time. He did not smoke and denied past or current intravenous drug use.\nAs an outpatient, the patient previously underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy to investigate his six-week history of abdominal pain and was found to have a gastric ulcer positive for Helicobacter organisms. He was treated with triple therapy of clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and pantoprazole. All of his symptoms improved while on this regimen, but they relapsed thereafter.\nGiven his abdominal and back pain, a non-urgent computed tomography (CT) scan was performed three months after his symptoms developed, which demonstrated a large aneurysm in the infrarenal abdominal aorta measuring 8.2 x 5.8 x 8.5 cm, with retroperitoneal fat stranding surrounding the aneurysm (Figures -). He had never had any previous imaging of his abdomen for comparison. The patient was immediately transferred to vascular surgery at our center for assessment and definitive management.\nOn initial presentation to our facility, after the CT scan, the patient\u2019s physical exam demonstrated a tender pulsatile abdominal mass.

The patient was otherwise fit and well, her reported medical history was free and both she and her parents were not familiar with any cases of scoliosis among members of her family. The patient (initially examined during a school screening study-Visit 1) was considered at first to be suspicious of suffering from scoliosis, due to a highly positive Adam's forward bending test. However, radiographic evaluation revealed the existence of axial vertebral rotation (Grades 1-2 according to the Nash and Moe method of radiographic assessment) [] without any deformity whatsoever in the sagittal and coronal planes (Table ). Her physical (and radiographic) examination failed to reveal the existence of any discrepancy in her limbs' length or any other skeletal abnormality. Due to the unfortunate fact that the patient shortly after her initial examination lost all her radiographs and in order to better evaluate both the structural deformity underlying the vertebral rotation and the possible co-existence of a thoracic cage deformity which could interfere with the interpretation of the Adam's forward bending test, a Computed Tomography (CT)-scan was suggested. Unfortunately, both the patient and her parents refused to consent to it.\nFollowing an observation period of 12 months the patient was re-evaluated (Visit 2). Due to her young age, the recent reported menarche at the age of eleven (between Visits 1 & 2), her skeletal immaturity (Risser stage I-II), the fact that both the patient and her parents reported that the appearance of the patient's trunk worsened and the fact that the measured vertebral rotation deteriorated (Table ) (Figure ), the patient was given a modified Boston brace (fitted with derotational blades) which appeared to have had an immediate positive derotational effect on all but two vertebrae (Figure ).
