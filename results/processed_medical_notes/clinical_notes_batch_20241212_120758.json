Two years prior to her current presentation, she presented to a local hospital with a palpable right chest wall mass close to the same quadrant of right breast and underwent a surgical resection. The histological examination showed a typical picture of an aggressive fibromatosis.\nPhysical examination showed a 15 cm and well-healed surgical scar along the inferior-inner aspect of her right inframammary fold. Plain and contrast-enhanced chest and epigastrium computed tomography (CT) showed a 10\u00d75 cm mass on the right inferior chest wall that appeared to be in continuity with the right pectoralis major muscle and right rectus abdominis muscle (Figure A). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the breast and the chest confirmed a 9\u00d74 cm mass in close proximity to the lower-inner quadrant of the right breast, with contact to the ribs (Figure B).\nAs diagnosis was established, surgery was scheduled.

He was referred to our hospital for treatment of the gallbladder tumor. Ultrasonography revealed a papillary tumor on the peritoneal side of the gallbladder (Figure A). Abdominal multi-detector CT showed mild wall thickening of the lower common bile duct (CBD) (Figure B), in addition to the gallbladder tumor. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) showed multiple small stones and mild irregularity of the mucosa in the lower CBD (Figure C). The CBD stones were removed endoscopically, and the duct wall mucosa was biopsied. Pathological specimen from the lower CBD revealed the presence of adenocarcinoma. Preoperative diagnoses confirmed or estimated from imaging exams were as follows: a cholangiocarcinoma with horizontal extension limited within the lower CBD and with vertical extension confined at most to the muscular layer of the CBD (T1), and a gallbladder cancer localized to the peritoneal side of the gallbladder with vertical extension confined at most to the subserosal layer of the gallbladder (T2). No evidence of lymph node metastasis was shown. No continuity was shown between the two lesions by EUS (Figure A). Moreover, the arterial phase of the abdominal CT revealed a replaced common hepatic artery (CHA) originating from the superior mesenteric artery and coursing along the ventral side of the pancreatic head parenchyma (Figure D). During operative planning, PD with conservation of the replaced CHA was expected to be technically complicated, possibly increasing the risk of postoperative complications, compared with an ordinary PD. Based on detailed preoperative evaluation, PD with arterial resection and reconstruction was also expected to be complex and excessive for resection of the early-stage tumors. Therefore, we decided on a less invasive procedure for this patient, and carried out pancreas-preserving resection of the lower biliary tract adenocarcinoma (Figure ) and cholecystectomy with standardized D2 lymph node dissection.",

Her recent medical history was unusual. Previously healthy and taking no regular medications, she developed a chronic left perineum sinus which was excised 2 years prior to presentation. A CT scan and colonoscopy as part of her workup uncovered asymptomatic sigmoid diverticulosis. A year later she developed a left maxillary sinus mass with a radiographical differential diagnosis including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (final pathology on excision showed only osteomyelitis). Repeat CT scan during this workup now showed new left-sided hydronephrosis overlain with inflammatory changes in keeping with a chronic sigmoid diverticulitis (), despite an otherwise clinically asymptomatic abdomen. Colorectal carcinoma was ruled out by a repeat colonoscopy 8 months prior to presentation. The hydronephrosis was managed by ureteric stenting, and the patient opted for conservative management of her diverticulitis.\nFour weeks prior to presentation, she developed a blistering rash over her left buttock and gluteal fold that did not cross midline. She was treated for 10 days with acyclovir for shingles with good response. Three days prior to presentation, she visited the emergency room again with a new painful induration over her left buttock that was diagnosed as an early abscess and prescribed amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate.\nAt presentation, this induration had enlarged with a 1-day history of serous discharge and chills (). All vital signs were normal, but bloodwork revealed leukocytosis of 22 200 and acute kidney injury with a creatinine of 191 \u03bcmol/L. Non-contrast CT scan showed performed sigmoid diverticulitis with free air tracking inferiorly into the left pelvis with a 5.5 \u00d7 3.3-cm abscess.

    "original_text": "A 59-year-old woman of Chinese Han origin presented with a complaint of a left pulsatile tinnitus. She had been extremely depressed for 10 years because this tinnitus was constant and prevented her from sleeping. She had visited the otological clinics at different hospitals several times. At each presentation, the tympanic membrane was carefully examined otoscopically and was found to be normal. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the temporal bone was also performed 9 years prior to her presentation to our hospital with a negative finding. With the initial diagnosis of venous hum, she received no effective treatment.\nThe patient was referred to us for further evaluation on January 17, 2007, due to the unbearable left tinnitus and a new awareness that her hearing had gradually deteriorated for 2 years. Her medical history was otherwise unremarkable except for hypertension, which was under treatment. On examination, the pulsatile tinnitus could be completely suppressed by digital pressure over the ipsilateral internal jugular vein or when the patient was asked to turn her head towards the side of tinnitus. Cranial, carotid and chest auscultation were negative. Other examinations including carotid ultrasonography, electrocardiography, thyroid function tests, and chest X-ray were normal. Careful otoscopic examination revealed a vague and reddish mass behind the superior-posterior portion of the intact left tympanic membrane.

It was associated with intermittent ipsilateral moderate-intensity frontal headaches radiating to the ipsilateral temporal area. She had been diagnosed with optic neuritis and commenced on methylprednisolone (250 mg intravenously every 6 h) 2 days previously, with minimal improvement. She noted disturbance in colour vision, and pain on eye movement but no diplopia prior to loss of vision. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging had shown pan sinusitis resulting in her referral to the ENT unit. She had chronic rhinosinusitis for which she was on treatment with a steroid spray and nasal douche. She did not have current or recent nasal obstruction, purulent nasal discharge or facial pressure. There was no associated fever, nausea or vomiting, no history of trauma, or preceding acute illness (particularly no recent upper respiratory tract infection), no other neurological symptoms or any periorbital swelling.

A CT scan showed a pancreatic head mass compressing the common bile duct. For palliation of hyperbilirubinemia, a palliative stent was placed in the common bile duct. A fine needle aspirate obtained through an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. A follow-up CT scan performed on February 13, 2015 revealed a 3.6 \u00d7 2.7 cm pancreatic head mass that abutted the superior mesenteric artery and one of its proximal branches. There were suspicious peripancreatic and retroperitoneal nodes and no evidence of distant disease. At the beginning of March, she began taking 50,000 U vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) daily, ordered directly from the Internet and not under the direction of a healthcare practitioner. Repeat EUS and biopsy on March 3, 2015 again confirmed adenocarcinoma with papillary features. She was referred to an oncologist and surgeon for evaluation. A triple phase CT was done on March 16, 2015 that showed a stable mass without any evidence of involvement of the celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery. Upfront chemotherapy was recommended, with consideration of surgery in the future.\nShe received gemcitabine/protein nanoparticle-bound paclitaxel in March.

The patient also reported nasal obstruction and impaired nasal breathing for the previous several months. Rest of the medical history was free. On clinical examination, a polypoid lesion protruding from the right nostril was noted. In addition, asymmetry of the face and projection of the ipsilateral canine fossa were evident.\nComputed tomography of the paranasal sinuses showed an inhomogeneous soft-tissue mass, which completely occupied the right nasal cavity, maxillary sinus, and anterior and posterior ethmoidal cells. The lesion produced extensive bone remodeling of the right maxillary sinus with complete absence of its anterior wall, as well as erosion of the posterior wall and entry of the lesion in the pterygopalatine fossa. There was also erosion of the ipsilateral lower as well as median orbital wall, and entry of the lesion in the orbital cavity. Despite its large size, the lesion seemed to be well defined without invasive characteristics (Figures \u2013).\nRoutine laboratory tests were within normal range. Preoperative maxillofacial consultation excluded pathology of odontogenic origin. The patient underwent a biopsy under local anesthesia, and the findings showed nonspecific inflammation. Open surgery under general anesthesia was undertaken via lateral rhinotomy and medial maxillectomy (). The maxillary sinus mucosa was completely replaced by inflammatory tissue simulating a benign mass. This mass was readily mobilized and dissected free from surrounding tissues within the orbit and pterygopalatine fossa, as no macroscopic invasion of any neighboring structures was noted. Histopathological examination revealed typical nasal polyposis with mixed population of eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages, with no evidence of fungal invasion (Figures \u2013).

The child received two cycles of carboplatin and etoposide following which right adrenalectomy was performed. Histopathology found no viable tumor cells. After a disease-free interval of one year, the child presented at our institution with difficulty in breathing and abdominal distension. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 6-cm necrotic mass in the right supra-renal area with infiltration of the liver, separate liver metastasis in the right hemi-liver (), thrombus in the HV, IVC, and the RA (, ). Ascites and pleural effusion were also present. The child was stabilized and a biopsy performed was suggestive of a yolk sac tumor. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was 54,000 ng/mL. After three cycles of Cisplatin, Etoposide, and Bleomycin (PEB), there was marked symptomatic improvement along with log reductions in AFP level to 376 ng/mL. Radiological reduction in the size of the mass was equally evident along with disappearance of ascites and pleural effusion.

The proximal end of the butterfly fragment was nondisplaced; however, the distal end was displaced approximately 1 cm. A CT scan of the left upper extremity revealed no underlying pathologic process. The history, physical exam, and imaging studies led to the diagnosis of a humeral shaft stress fracture due to repetitive stress. The patient underwent a gentle closed reduction and was placed into a coaptation splint and sling. Immediate postreduction films showed excellent fracture alignment with only a 5-degree anterior bow.\nAt 1-week followup, the patient's physical examination was unchanged.

A fine needle aspirate obtained through an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. A follow-up CT scan performed on February 13, 2015 revealed a 3.6 \u00d7 2.7 cm pancreatic head mass that abutted the superior mesenteric artery and one of its proximal branches. There were suspicious peripancreatic and retroperitoneal nodes and no evidence of distant disease. At the beginning of March, she began taking 50,000 U vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) daily, ordered directly from the Internet and not under the direction of a healthcare practitioner. Repeat EUS and biopsy on March 3, 2015 again confirmed adenocarcinoma with papillary features. She was referred to an oncologist and surgeon for evaluation. A triple phase CT was done on March 16, 2015 that showed a stable mass without any evidence of involvement of the celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery. Upfront chemotherapy was recommended, with consideration of surgery in the future.\nShe received gemcitabine/protein nanoparticle-bound paclitaxel in March.

Based on findings of chronic active hepatitis in liver biopsy, autoimmune hepatitis was suspected, and treatment with prednisolone and azathioprine initiated. Seven years later, an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed a stricture in the common bile duct which was interpreted as possible extrahepatic PSC or tentatively an inborn anomaly of the common bile duct. After 20 years with fluctuating transaminases between 100 and 300 U/L and no recorded major clinical events, she developed general edema and thoracic spider nevi. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension with massive ascites. After an initial response to symptomatic treatment, she soon developed uncompensated liver failure with severe hepatic encephalopathy and was transferred to the national transplant unit for work-up and listing for liver transplantation. A few days later, an ABO-identical donor liver was available and LTX was performed with a duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis. The histopathological examination of the liver explant revealed cirrhosis and pathological changes typical for underlying PSC. Cholangiocarcinoma in situ was found in the common hepatic duct, the cystic duct, and the common bile duct, involving the resection margin. It was decided that the patient should be controlled with ERC with brush cytology from the duct-to-duct anastomosis after 6 months due to the histopathological findings. The brush cytology showed mild to moderate epithelial dysplasia in the common bile duct. After discussion in the multidisciplinary team, a pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) was decided due to the risk of development of cholangiocarcinoma. Ten months after LTX, the procedure was performed. Because of a possible increased risk of anastomotic leak due to immunosuppression, an enteropancreatic anastomosis was avoided and the pancreatic duct was occluded. The surgical specimen showed intestinal metaplasia in the common bile duct, but no dysplasia or carcinoma. She was then followed according to standard post-liver transplantation follow-up regimen.

    "original_text": "A 3.5-months-old girl was admitted to our department with right-sided hemihypertrophy. Screening with abdominal ultrasonography showed an enlarged right kidney with a large hypoechoic region presenting no corticomedullary differentiation as well as multifocal hypoechoic parenchymal foci bilaterally in both kidneys, suggesting PLNB. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed multiple hypodense and nonenhancing cortical masses at both kidneys; the largest with a diameter of 2.65 cm was localized at the enlarged right kidney and presented reduced diffusion and faint enhancing tissue at periphery (Figures and ). As all lesions were homogeneous without enhancement after contrast administration and a lenticular shape the diagnosis of PLNB was further suggested by the MRI findings. Spherical shape, heterogeneous, and enhancing nodules that would be suspicious for a WT were not present in the MRI. A second abdominal ultrasonography 2 months later showed enlargement of the already existing and new foci of NB bilaterally.\nSome years ago we presented the case of a 23-month-old boy, who did not received any treatment for the initial diagnosis of right NB and developed WTs 24 and 42 months later at the left and the right kidney, respectively, despite regression of initial lesions of NB []. Review of the literature on the management of NB revealed one large retrospective study and several case reports describing in most cases adverse outcome in nontreated patients. Thus, our female patient initiated chemotherapy according to SIOP Wilms Tumor/2001 protocol and received vincristine and actinomycin D for 4 weeks. Abdominal ultrasonography at 4 weeks showed decrease of lesion's size (shrinkage of the large right kidney mass volume from 7,56 cm3 to 3,26 cm3) and the patient received further cycles of vincristine and actinomycin D every 14 days for the next 3 months. Follow-up ultrasound at 4 months of treatment showed additional decrease of lesions dimensions ().

These lesions were noticed at birth and expanded in size relative to his growth. The lesions were associated with multiple episodes of bleeding, oozing, ulceration, and secondary impetiginization that required multiple hospital admission and intravenous antibiotics. The patient also reported a limited range of motion in his right upper extremity, mainly of the right elbow joint. The patient also expressed a cosmetic concern as well as the other symptoms mentioned. No similar condition was reported in the family. Moreover, no topical or systemic medication was used before, and there were no surgical interventions.\nA clinical examination of the lesion showed a linear, verrucous, hyperkeratotic plaque extending from the radial aspect of the right hand and dorsal forearm up to the arm and axilla. There were also multiple well-defined, hyperpigmented brownish patches and plaques over the left side of the abdomen and left gluteus (shown in Fig. , b).\nOn his initial clinic visit 3 years ago, an MRI of the right upper extremity was performed. The images showed multiple dilated, superficial, and deep tortuous structures involving the medial and posterior aspects of the right arm, mostly focused around the posterior aspect of the right elbow and the medial and posterior aspects of the right forearm down to the right hand with the involvement of the skin and subcutaneous fat and the sparing of muscle.\nA diagnosis of VVM was made on the basis of clinical, histopathological, and radiological findings.

    "original_text": "An afebrile 39-year-old man was admitted to the University Hospital of Zurich due to a pacemaker pocket infection. This first pacemaker was implanted 22 years ago because of cardiac arrhythmia. A new pacemaker was then implanted on the contralateral side 14 years later because of lead dysfunction of the first pacemaker. The leads of the first inactive pacemaker were left in situ since they could not be removed without causing damage and thus were cut and capped. The batteries were replaced twice, 8 and 2 years prior to the infection.\nUpon admission, the pocket of the inactive first pacemaker was debrided, and the electrodes were trimmed as they could not be completely removed without open-heart surgery. Intraoperatively, turbid fluid was found and sent for microbiological analysis. S. epidermidis grew in multiple tissue samples, and, accordingly, the empirical antibiotic treatment amoxicillin/clavulanate was changed to intravenous vancomycin and rifampicin (Fig. ). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed a methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis, only resistant to ampicillin and erythromycin. Therefore, vancomycin treatment was switched to flucloxacillin and rifampicin treatment was continued. The local infection significantly improved, and, after 12 days, antibiotic treatment was switched to an oral regimen consisting of rifampicin and ciprofloxacin and the patient was discharged from the hospital.\nFourteen weeks later, the patient presented with fever and was readmitted to the hospital. S. epidermidis grew in all four inoculated blood culture bottles, after 29 h under aerobic conditions and after 61 h under anaerobic conditions. A pacemaker-associated endocarditis was diagnosed after an echocardiography revealed two vegetations that were attached to the ventricle and the right atrial electrode, respectively.

A microscopic examination revealed the presence of intraerythrocytic parasites and a subsequent PCR test identified Plasmodium vivax. The patient lived in a city close to where a malaria patient who had travelled to Pakistan had been diagnosed. A molecular comparison confirmed the same strain of P. vivax in both cases. Despite an exhaustive entomological investigation, not a single specimen of the anopheline vector was detected.\nA number of cases which were classified as airport malaria have been reported. The first in 1984 [] was a 76-year-old woman who developed fever with respiratory symptoms, which was initially diagnosed as pneumonia. Following the failure of the antibiotic treatment, the patient was hospitalized with a presumed bacteraemia. Finally, a microscopic analysis revealed P. falciparum gametocytes and numerous trophozoites. Despite treatment with quinine, the patient died a few days later due to respiratory complications. The disease had presented after a trip to visit a family member less than 6 km from Madrid airport.\nIn 2001, a 75-year-old woman who lived close to two international airports (4 and 18 km distance, respectively), was hospitalized with intermittent fever that had lasted a week although without apparent infection []. Microscopic examination of her blood showed the presence of intraerythrocytic rings. A rapid antigen test for P. falciparum and P. vivax was negative, and later tests showed Plasmodium ovale. A course of treatment with chloroquine and primaquine was initiated and the patient recovered.\nTo date five cases of neonatal malaria have been identified in Spain.

She had a history of cervical conization for adenocarcinoma in situ. At 20 weeks of gestation, she visited our hospital with a complaint of abnormal bleeding from her vagina. We found abnormal development of cervical varix by vaginal ultrasound and the bleeding seemed to be caused by varix. We performed vaginal gauze packing for hemostasis and the bleeding was decreased for a week. We performed a cervical pap test at that time and the result was negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM). However, at 21 weeks of gestation, massive bleeding occurred and the amount of bleeding reached almost 800 g. We recommended surgical hemostasis or termination of the pregnancy, but she refused both opinions because of the risks of the surgery, including infection and premature rupture of the membrane, and she wished to have further preservative treatment. Therefore, we added vaginal gauze packing once more and observed her with the administration of blood transfusion. However, the bleeding persisted and the amount of bleeding gradually increased. The total amount of bleeding reached about 2000 g at 22 weeks of gestation. We informed her that the bleeding was becoming life-threatening and that we must perform surgical treatment or termination of the pregnancy.

    "original_text": "A 56-year-old man was referred to our hospital with a 6-month history of abdominal distension and discomfort (A). He had a medical history of schizophrenia. His abdomen was markedly distended, and severe edema was present in both lower limbs. He had no symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction. Neurological examination findings were normal. He had slight anemia (hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dl), and other laboratory data were within normal limits. A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a 30- \u00d7 18- \u00d7 30-cm giant mass located between the stomach and transverse colon. It included a large cyst and solid component that showed enhancement (B). The main feeder artery for the tumor seemed to be the right gastric artery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also showed a huge heterogeneous soft tissue mass. The solid component showed high signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging (C, D). Upper and lower endoscopy was not performed because the patient declined. CT-guided biopsy was not performed to avoid dissemination. Our preoperative differential diagnoses were sarcoma with a mucinous component, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, lymphangioma, and mesenteric cyst. A histological diagnosis was not obtained preoperatively, and the tumor was too large to identify its boundary with the surrounding organs by radiological examination. We expected that the tumor was arising from the stomach, transverse colon, or mesenterium.\nWe decided to perform surgery because the tumor showed the tendency to grow. During laparotomy, we identified a huge encapsulated tumor. The tumor occupied most of the pelvic cavity, but the caudal side of the tumor had no adhesions with pelvic organs. We gradually dissected along the capsule and moved the tumor outside the body (A). Finally, we found that the tumor was adhered to the stomach and transverse colon.

Because of the failure to pass meconium, congenital intestinal dysganglionoses or cystic fibrosis was hypothesized, but at that time, both were ruled out by a rectal biopsy and sweat test, respectively. The patient continued to experience biliary vomiting and failure to thrive; for this reason, she was fed using a nasogastric tube for a long period of time.

On the basis of this test, the patient underwent dilatation of the pylorus but did not achieve any clinical benefit. During gastroscopy, an irregular and small duodenum associated with esophagitis was documented. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an abdominal solid massive and expansive lesion (14 cm at the largest diameter) that extended down to the pubic region and surrounded the urethra and the bladder, without any cleavage plans, thus causing mild hydronephrosis. She underwent laparotomy with debulking of the lesion since it was unresectable. The histology described a ganglioneuroma.

A short time later, she discovered a dark red swelling on her upper right gingival tissues. The swelling in the associated region had been increasing gradually since that time. She did not give any relevant past dental history. The patient's medical history was non-contributory and she did not take any medications. She and her parents stated that, in March 1990 and June 2000, she had a lesion operated and diagnosed as congenital hemangioma on the right of her face.\nDuring physical examination (Figure ), a right-sided hemihypertrophy of the face with congenital hemangioma was observed. Her mouth was deviated toward the left side of her face. No other similar lesions were clinically visible in the head and neck region. Moreover, no lymph nodes were palpable.\nClinical evaluation revealed a mass on the buccal surface of upper right molar region (Figure ). It was firm, pedunculated and red mass, and was located in the attached gingiva in the right maxillary region, covering almost the entire coronal part of the #3 and #4 teeth. On the palatal side the mass extended throughout the marginal and attached gingival of the second premolar and first molar. The mass was painful and bled easily upon palpation. Tooth #4 involved by the mass was mobile and a diastema had formed between #3 and #4 teeth. Periodontal pocket (approximately 10 mm) was detected in the associated region.

She has never been pregnant and is a nonsmoker with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. She has no history of breast surgery and menarche was at 13 years old. On exam, there was a palpable, dominant mass in the right breast at the 12 o'clock position measuring 4 cm by 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The mass was mobile and there was no induration, drainage, fluctuance, erythema skin dimpling, nipple retraction, nipple discharge, peau d'orange, palpable lymphadenopathy in the bilateral axilla(s), lymphedema of the bilateral arm, or palpable masses in the left breast. The ED physician attempted to aspirate and drain the mass, which was unsuccessful.
