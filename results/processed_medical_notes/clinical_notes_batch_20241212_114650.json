A more detailed history revealed that he had been suffering from severe headache of acute onset from 3 days beforehand. Head computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a high-density lesion in the right temporal lobe (Fig. a) with a mean diameter of 40 mm. On the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed on December 9, 2008, the lesion was visualized as mixed intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images, and showed strong enhancement following intravenous administration of gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Fig. b\u2013d). The lesion was surrounded by perifocal cerebral edema. Based on these findings, hemorrhage in the brain tumor was suspected. Cerebral angiography showed that the tumor was supplied by both the internal and external carotid arteries (Fig. a, b). Neurological examination did not reveal any neurological deficit during this admission. We planned the operation for January 9, 2009, and the patient was discharged from the hospital.\nThe patient presented to the hospital again with severe headache on December 26, 2008. Repeat CT revealed another high-density area within the tumor and more extensive peripheral edema, the findings suggestive of recurrence of the intratumoral hemorrhage (Fig. a). The patient was treated conservatively until the operation. During the preoperative period, the patient developed consciousness disturbance. Follow-up CT scans obtained after admission demonstrated another recurrence of the intratumoral hemorrhage (Fig. b\u2013d). On January 7, 2009, the patient fell into a coma, and emergent right temporal craniotomy was performed. Intraoperative findings confirmed that the tumor was attached to the dural membrane of the middle fossa, showing no attachment to the ventricular system. The tumor was clearly demarcated from the surrounding brain tissue and gross total resection was performed.\nHistological examination revealed that the lesion was very cellular and well vascularized. Many blood vessels, hemorrhages, and vascular proliferation were seen, but pseudopalisading necrosis was not seen",

She had undergone previous chemotherapy and wedge resection with lymphadenectomy of the right middle and right lower lobe tumors. The patient also had undergone SRS of the left upper lobe two years prior to presentation. Treatments had been done both at our facility and at an outside institution. Despite these therapies, she was noted to have disease progression around the site of previous stereotactic therapy. After a discussion of the patient\u2019s case at the multidisciplinary tumor board, the decision was made to proceed with resection of the left upper lobe. Preoperatively the patient had undergone CT-guided biopsy to confirm recurrence as shown in Figure .\nIntervention\nThe patient was taken into the operating room and during the thoracoscopic evaluation of the left chest, there was noted extensive adhesion around the left upper lobe. After mobilizing and freeing the lung there was purulent drainage from the chest wall which was cultured and irrigated. Drainage was noted to be originating from a rib fracture and a fragment of the fractured third rib was resected and sent for pathological analysis. Intraoperative image is shown in Figure . We then proceeded with wedge resection of the apical posterior segment and mediastinal lymphadenectomy.\nHospital Course and Follow Up\nThe patient was admitted to the step-down unit. She was maintained on cefazolin given the purulent materials encountered, however, cultures were negative. Pathology of the bone fragment revealed necrosis without evidence of malignancy. The wedge resection was consistent with well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma without lymph node involvement and negative margins.

The pain radiating to bilateral shoulders continuously existed, and occasionally it was accompanied by numbness of the left face. Other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, limb weakness, or defecation dysfunction were not apparent in this patient. In his history, the patient complained of left tinnitus since he was more than 10 years old which was aggravated in the latest 5 years. Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a series of examinations in otorhinolaryngology didn't find the cause of tinnitus. Thoracic scoliosis was noticed when the patient was about 20 years old and it has become more severe in the past 10 years. There was no similar case in the patient's family. Physical examination showed numerous caf\u00e9-au-lait spots and dermal neurofibroma together with severe thoracic scoliosis ().\nChest X-ray confirmed the existence of thoracic scoliosis (). Cervical T2-weighted MRI showed a syringomyelia existed in the spinal cord from C5 to T2 () and a hypointense signal lesion extended from C2 to C4 which was located in the cervical canal and in front of the left cervical spine, compressing the cervical nerve root ().

He consecutively had colon infarction requiring esophagostomy and feeding ileostomy. Four years later he received esophageal reconstruction with left colon interposition, followed by cervical esophagocolojejunostomy, which made his oral feeding possible. He is an ex-smoker, and had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring regular use of anticholinergic inhaler.\nHe initially presented with purulent sputum for several days, and admitted to medical ward for 2-week antibiotic treatment against community-acquired pneumonia. The initial chest computed tomography (CT) scan after the admission showed pneumonic consolidation at right lower lung.

Both pupils were equal and reactive to light. His blood alcohol levels were 383 mcg per litre, which clouded the clinical picture (a serum alcohol level >80 mcg per litre is equivalent to 2 units of alcohol). His vital signs were within normal limits. He had multiple facial abrasions and a soft tissue swelling on the left occipital region and blood was seen emanating from his left ear. Auroscopy revealed haemotympanum. He was commenced on prophylactic intravenous antibiotics. CT brain () demonstrated a haematoma of the left frontal, temporal and parietal lobes superimposed upon a previous haematoma along with subarachnoid extension with slight midline shift to the right and evidence of air in the posterior cranial fossa. The National Neurosurgical Centre recommended supportive therapy and serial clinical assessments. The following morning his GCS deteriorated to 7/15 and he was intubated and ventilated. A right-sided hemiparesis was noted. His pupils and haemodynamic parameters were unchanged. A follow-up CT brain was unchanged. He was transferred to National Neurosurgical Unit in view of this clinical deterioration.

The patient denied specific loss of consciousness or seizure activity. A chest X-ray at his initial evaluation demonstrated a nodule in the left upper lobe. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed a single left frontal lobe mass with vasogenic edema. CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed mediastinal adenopathy, and two lesions in the left upper lobe, consistent with a primary lung disease. A follow-on MRI of the brain demonstrated a single 2.1 cm enhancing lesion in the left precentral gyrus. A CT-guided fine-needle aspirate of the lung lesion demonstrated small cell lung cancer.\nHe met with a medical oncologist who outlined a treatment plan consisting of systemic chemotherapy followed by radiation to the brain and possibly concurrent radiochemotherapy to the chest. Immediately following his first round of systemic chemotherapy, a staging PET/CT demonstrated two hypermetabolic pulmonary lesions, the largest measuring 3.5 cm, extensive bilateral mediastinal and hilar activity, and a PET-avid right adrenal mass. He completed three cycles of a \u201cprogrammatic\u201d, locally defined cisplatin and irinotecan regimen with near complete resolution of his right-sided arm weakness. Restaging brain MRI demonstrated interval shrinkage in his single lesion and no further intracranial progression. A chest CT demonstrated a reduction in size of the lung lesions and resolution of the hilar and mediastinal adenopathy.\nPrior to his next planned cycle of chemotherapy, he was seen in the Radiation Oncology Department.

For her schizoaffective disorder she was on a risperidone depot and escitalopram 20 mg once a day. She was admitted medically in December 2015 to the MMUH with a urinary tract infection, acute renal failure, and deranged international normalized ratio (INR).\nThe Liaison Psychiatry service was consulted shortly after admission. The family gave a collateral history of low mood in our patient since her brother had become ill 2 months earlier and her dose of antidepressant had been increased a month earlier. On review, she was at her baseline mental state, engaging well in conversation and denying low mood, which was confirmed by the community mental health nurse, to whom the patient was well known. No changes were made to her management.\nA week later the neurology service was asked to review the patient due to altered level of consciousness. On examination she presented with waxy flexibility, negativism, new onset increased tone of her left arm, posturing, and catalepsy. Her mobility had deteriorated, with selective speech, mute episodes, and poor oral intake noted by medical staff over the preceding day. The impression was that she was suffering from acute catatonia. An magnet resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain showed no acute changes. Nasogastric (NG) feeding was established to ensure oral intake.\nThe psychiatry service was again consulted, and acute catatonia was confirmed.

Open repair was a poor option given her history of open colon resection with subsequent hernia and mesh complications. Preoperative CTA demonstrated an 80\u00b0 angle at the infrarenal neck and an 80\u00b0 angle in the opposite direction at the suprarenal aorta. The right and left renal arteries both emerged at a 45\u00b0 angle relative to the neck and both were downward going. A Cook Zenith Fenestrated graft (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) with two small fenestrations and a scallop was built using a modified centerline to account for the anticipated graft position after insertion. The insertion of Lunderquist wires bilaterally significantly changed the working angles. Using the subtraction spin protocol, the superior mesenteric and renal artery origins were redefined for the fusion overlay. Significant angle variation was observed at the aortic neck and renal ostia from an \u223c60\u00b0 to 37.5\u00b0 angle (). The gantry angles needed to achieve a perpendicular view of the renal origins according to the new fusion markers also changed significantly from the preoperative measurements by 13\u00b0 to 20\u00b0. After vessel marking and mapping, the Cook fenestrated proximal piece was inserted, and a limited angiogram of the visceral segment revealed marker accuracy; thus, no adjustments were necessary. This significantly aided in graft positioning by facilitating placement slightly superiorly to assist in cannulation of the severe downward going left renal artery and avoiding the need for any additional angiograms through cannulation. The total fluoroscopy time was 80.5 minutes, the total fluoroscopy dose was 3.6 Gy, and the total contrast was 101 mL for this case.

Despite the appropriate chest tube drainage, the patient was still in respiratory distress and tachypneic, indicating a need for intubation.

Considering the high-energy nature of the crash, continued severe air leak, and failure of lung expansion with chest tube insertion, a tracheobronchial injury was suspected; the patient was taken emergently to operating room for bronchoscopic evaluation. Upon arrival to the operating room, the patient's saturation precipitously dropped with hemodynamic compromise; therefore, an anterolateral thoracotomy was performed without prepping and positioning. The right mainstem bronchus was completely detached from the carina and the tip of the endotracheal tube was in the mediastinum.

She had no previous episode of upper respiratory infection. She presented with a wheezing episode a year earlier, which responded well to bronchodilators and did not recur. Otherwise, she had an unremarkable medical, surgical or familial history.\nPhysical examination revealed severe dyspnea (respiratory rate: 52 r/min), central cyanosis (O2 saturation: 87%) and fever of 39. Abdominal examination was normal. Cardiovascular examination showed a heart rate of 160 bpm without any abnormal heart sound. The auscultation revealed diminished breath sounds all over the right chest.\nLaboratory tests showed C-reactive protein levels of 19.1 mg/L, white blood cell count of 10.79/L, haemoglobin levels of 10.2 g/dL and otherwise normal findings.\nA following chest X-ray revealed increased cardiothoracic ratio and areas of increased density in the middle and lower right lobes which raised the suspicion of pneumonia ().\nCardiac ultrasonography revealed clear large-amount pericardial effusion as well as a mass right and above the heart without any connection to the heart.\nSince the chest X-ray and cardiac ultrasonography did not specify any lesion, we ordered a chest computed tomography.

A hard lump with a diameter of 7cm \u00d7 5 cm lump at the medial third of right clavicle was palpated with pain and slightly swelling. No redness and skin lesion around the lump; no muscular atrophy and weakness; no dislocation or deformity of the shoulder joint and no thoracic varicosity were observed.\nThe X-ray film and computed tomography (CT) scan showed the sclerotic bone remodeling of the medial third of the right clavicle (Fig. ). After admitted to the ward, a percutaneous bone biopsy was performed, revealing a suppurative inflammation with bone destruction, without the signs of malignancy (Fig. ). A diagnosis of clavicle osteomyelitis was suggested. Thus, conservative treatments with antibiotic (based on drug sensitivity, clindamycin was given 1.2 g/d for 2 weeks) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were given. The patient was discharged after the pain was relieved.\nIn the next 7 months, the symptom of pain gradually worsened and radiated to her right arm. Despite the intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and treatment with antibiotic, the pain was still obvious. Meanwhile, she started complaining of muscle weakness and limited mobility of the right shoulder. The lump of right clavicle was bigger than before and developing to her right neck. After admitted to the ward, X-ray film and 3D reconstruction of CT scan were carried out. Despite the conservative treatments were given, the pain and swelling of the right clavicle were still not relieved, seriously affecting the patient\ufffd",

He is known to have hypertension, coronary artery disease, with history of CABG. He was declared as a high risk for open repair by cardiologist, so percutaneous elective EVAR under local anesthesia was planned. His family and psychosocial history were unremarkable.\nA low-profile tri-modular device was chosen because of his small iliac arteries and tortuosity. The procedure was performed by a senior vascular surgery consultant with immense experience in endovascular interventions.\nThe EVAR was started with bilateral femoral percutaneous access. The main body of the endograft was deployed successfully (right femoral access) with its both short limbs facing anterioposterior position due to the severe iliac tortuosity. The CLG was cannulated without difficulty and the position inside the main body of the graft was confirmed by twisting the pig tail catheter inside.\nAccording to the fluoroscopy images, the location of the wire seemed to be in the correct place so deployment of both iliac limbs was performed. Completion angiogram revealed maldeployment of both limbs in to the ipsilateral gate ().\nAfter recognition of the problem we proceeded endovascular salvage. Cannulation of the contra lateral gate was achieved via a retrograde access from the left femoral artery. Hydrophilic wire was manipulated between the maldeployed left iliac limb and the native common iliac artery with the help of Vertebral catheter until we accessed the aneurysmal sac. Another wire was passed and crossed over the flow divider from the ipsilateral limb (right femoral artery). This wire was snared from the left femoral access.

The pain was perceived to be 10 out of 10 and was described as an inflated balloon that was squeezing from the inside out. The paramedics found the patient in his house hypotensive and lying in a right lateral decubitus position. The patient was given a bolus of normal saline and his blood pressure responded appropriately. Upon examination, the patient claimed to of had a two-year history of worsening mild midepigastric and left upper quadrant abdominal pain and was seen by his primary care provider whom prescribed him a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) which partially relieved some symptoms. In addition, the patient complained of being nauseated, feeling bloated after meals, having a history of bloody stools one week prior to admission, and increased pain after eating. He denied vomiting or early satiety. Vital signs on admission were stable.\nPast medical history included gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hyperlipidemia and impaired fasting glucose. His medications consisted of a PPI, H2-blocker and simvastatin. The only past surgical history was an appendectomy. The patient was a truck driver for several years.

She underwent genetic counseling but declined further invasive testing. Cell-free DNA screening was performed and results were low risk for Down syndrome, trisomy 13 or 18. Given these abnormalities, however, she underwent further fetal ultrasound at 16 weeks and was noted to have ventriculomegaly with a suspected posterior fossa mass. She presented to our institution at 20 weeks 6 days gestation, and fetal US and brain MRI were performed. Obstetric ultrasound demonstrated symmetric bilateral enlargement of echogenic choroid plexus with associated ventriculomegaly and enlarged extra-axial fluid-filled spaces (Figure ), with differential diagnosis including intraventricular hemorrhage, choroid plexus hyperplasia or choroid plexus papilloma. Head size was larger than expected for gestational age (GA). Biparietal diameter measured 6.7 cm (corresponding with 27 weeks 2 days GA) and head circumference measured 24.2 cm (corresponding with 26 weeks 1 day GA).\nAn MRI scan of the fetal brain performed on the same day demonstrated bilateral ventriculomegaly (Figure ). The lateral ventricles measured up to 14 mm in atrial diameter, with normal morphology of the third and fourth ventricles. There was also marked enlargement of the supratentorial and infratentorial extra-axial subarachnoid spaces. The choroid plexus appeared enlarged bilaterally without definite hemorrhage on echo-planar imaging.

The patient was fit and well with no other medical conditions. She was premenarcheal.

Her bloods revealed an inflammatory response with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 19 x 109/L and C reactive protein of 62 mg/L. The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics. As the patient remained clinically stable overnight, a plan was made to perform an open appendicectomy the following morning.\nIntraoperatively, she was found to have an appendix adhering to the posterior aspect of the caecum, which looked macroscopically normal.

Before presenting at the Codivilla-Putti Hospital in September 2007, his medical records show that, after initial trauma care, he was subjected to immobilization using a cast and that his fracture was reduced and fixated with a plate and screw system (brand unknown) and bone grafts (unknown) in March 2007. Bone grafting was performed because bone loss occurred following the traumatic fracture. His medical records also indicated that in May 2007 he had suffered from a wound dehiscence that was negative for infection (it is not known whether the natient underwent antibiotic therapy). The next month, the plate and screws were removed, and an external fixation system (brand unknown) was placed.\nHe presented at the Codivilla Hospital complaining of pain and presenting a non-suppurating fistula at the scar site of the previous operations. A radiograph was taken and showed a non-union and bone loss (). In November 2007, the patient underwent surgery aimed at completely debriding the site. A cement spacer containing gentamicin and clindamycin (Copal G+C, Heraeus, Hanau, Germany) , alo ng with vancomycin, was placed into the gap (). At this point, the surgical site was positive for Staphylococcus aureus. 3 months later, in February 2008, as a fistula developed again, the spacer was replaced with a new one (same source as the previous surgery). The antibiotic therapy was interrupted 2 weeks before spacer replacement for allowing bacteria strain identification.

Other associated symptoms at the time of presentation were diaphoresis, dizziness, and nausea. An electrocardiogram was performed and demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with ST depression V3-V4 and ST elevation in V5-V6. The patient was subsequently transferred to the emergency department for further evaluation. Minutes later, she became unresponsive and was found to be in pulseless ventricular fibrillation. Advanced cardiovascular life support was initiated providing two doses of epinephrine along with one dose of intravenous amiodarone. After three attempts of defibrillation, we achieved successful return of circulation. Bedside echocardiogram demonstrated lateral akinesis with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 10\u201315%. She was urgently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where she had a recurrence of ventricular fibrillation requiring one successful defibrillation attempt. Her cardiac catheterization [] demonstrated 100% stenosis of a large first obtuse marginal artery consistent with spontaneous dissection. Initially, an attempt at percutaneous coronary intervention was made. However, given the nature of the dissection, the patient was managed medically. Following catheterization, she continued to decompensate into cardiogenic shock with elevated lactate and hypotension requiring epinephrine continuous infusion and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) with 2.5 L/min of support. An echocardiogram performed while on VA-ECMO revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45\u201350% with severe hypokinesis of the mid to distal inferolateral, mid anterolateral, and the mid anterior wall. She improved clinically throughout the rest of her stay. She was successfully weaned off VA-ECMO on the third hospitalization day.\nAfter stabilization, she underwent further evaluation for underlying vascular pathology.

Abdominal radiography showed a distal obstruction (). Suction rectal biopsies demonstrated nerve hypertrophy. Transanal Soave pullthrough was performed and at the intraoperative evaluation the absence of ganglion cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexus of the rectum and sigmoid colon confirmed the length of HD. The aganglionic colon was resected and the normally innervated bowel was brought down and sutured to the area just above the anal sphincter.\nAt the age of 3 years and 2 months, an infectious enterocolitis (C. Difficile) confirmed by the finding of the specific toxin by microbiological laboratory testing occurred and an antibiotic treatment was administered, with resolution of symptoms.\nOne month later, he presented with marked abdominal distension and melena; occasional episodes of vomiting was also reported. Abdominal obstruction was detected at radiography (). Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy were then performed. Stomach and small bowel mucosal biopsies were normal. Full-thickness surgical distal colon biopsies showed the presence of mature ganglion cells and revealed an eosinophilic-predominant inflammatory infiltrate in the myenteric plexus and surrounding tissues of sigmoid colon and rectum (>60 eosinophils/ 10 HPF, X40) (). An EMG was then diagnosed.\nThe patient had peripheral eosinophilia (8%) and an elevated age-related IgE concentration (423kU/l). A panel of specific IgE tests (immuno-CAP system) was then performed, showing sIgE positive for casein, \u03b1-lactalbumin, \u03b2-lactoglobulin, egg white, wheat, and maize.\nAvoidance diet for cow's milk proteins, egg, wheat and maize was then prescribed.
