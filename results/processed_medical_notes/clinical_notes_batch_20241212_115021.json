    "original_text": "A 45-year-old man presented to our attention for a large pulsatile formation on the volatile face of left forearm, which he reported to have enlarged in the last year (Fig. ). At examination, we observed absence of radial pulse and direct flow on the ulnar artery at continuous-wave Doppler, and a large pulsatile formation was evident along the course of the left brachial artery, associated with forearm venous dilatation. Further Doppler ultrasound (DUS) examination showed a fusiform aneurysm of the brachial artery with a maximum diameter of 3.5 cm and longitudinal extension of 5 cm up to the brachial bifurcation, with thrombus formation, which partially occluded the brachial artery lumen and the origin of the radial artery, which was completely occluded. The cephalic vein after AVF was patent and dilated. The patient had a history of chronic renal impairment \u201cfailure\u201d caused by glomerulonephritis in 2000, then AVF for dialysis was realized in other institution, and finally he was addressed to kidney transplantation in left iliac fossa in 2004. In 2011 the AVF was ligated with suture on the radial artery and the dilated cephalic vein was left in place. A DUS examination performed in 2018 showed patency of the brachial artery with a diameter of 3.5 cm and patency of the ulnar and radial artery up to the wrist. He also had a computed tomography scan without media contrast, which confirmed the DUS report.\nConsidering the presence of the diffuse thrombus in the brachial artery and the occlusion of the radial artery occurring in the last year, we decided to remove the brachial aneurysm with a venous bypass on the ulnar artery. The left great saphenous vein (GSV) was studied at DUS and resulted suitable as a graft. The patient was treated under general anesthesia. We first exposed the brachial artery that appeared tenaciously adherent to the surrounding tissues from the midarm to its bifurcation with a bilobed appearance, and satellite brachial veins were collapsed and flattened by the aneurysm.

The only other symptom was cough occurring ten months prior to admission. The patient had no underlying disease, no positive family history, and no drug consumption. Clinical evaluation revealed decreased left-sided lung sounds with no adenopathy and organomegaly and no signs indicative of heart compression. Results of laboratory tests were normal as well as cardiac echocardiography and abdominal sonography.\nChest X-ray () showed a large left-sided mass density with obvious mediastinal shift including trachea and heart displacement with barely visible lung in the apex and no other lesions in contralateral lung or ribs including calcification, cavity, and nodule.\nChest computed tomography (CT) () showed a large heterogeneous fatty mass in the left hemothorax with mediastinal shift, complete collapse of the lung, left hemidiaphragmatic inferior displacement, and no tissue invasion. The huge size of this tumor made it very difficult to have a correct preoperative diagnosis regarding the exact location or origin of the mass. The case was discussed with pulmonologist and oncologist colleagues and the surgical resection of the mass was recommended with no needle biopsy attempt. We decided not to perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) as well as fine needle biopsy aspirate (FNAB) in our patient, as these would not have changed the management plan or the need for surgery in an uncomplicated patient.\nTotal excision of the mass was performed via a left posterolateral thoracotomy, although the tumor was too large to be resected as an encapsulated lesion (). No pleural fluid and no suspicious mediastinal lymph nodes were observed and no metastatic lesion was detected.

In the blood tests before this current operation, there were no abnormal values including coagulation tests: APTT was 27.1 sec, and PTINR was 0.87.

    "original_text": "A two-week-old female was brought in with an initial complaint of multiple masses that failed to regress since birth. She was born from a nonconsanguineous union and the mother\u2019s pregnancy was uneventful. The baby was delivered vaginally at 37 weeks of gestation and multiples masses were found over the body. The treating physician advised follow-ups on discharge. However, the parents decided to seek more medical help for the child and she was admitted for more investigations.\nOn physical exam, the child was alert and active. She was not jaundiced and no pallor was noted on the extremities. Her vitals were all within the normal range and the birth weight and changes in weight corresponded properly. Two masses measuring 26 mm by 19 mm and 19 mm by 17 mm were observed on the forehead and the scalp (Figures -). One smaller mass was seen on the abdomen, measuring 11 mm by 10 mm (Figure ). All three masses were red and non-hemorrhagic. The parents reported that the size of the masses did not change since birth. No similar family history was found and both parents were healthy. Any hepatosplenomegaly was not observed on palpation nor were any other cutaneous lesions detected. She did not present with any other systemic abnormalities. An ultrasound was performed, and it revealed a normal liver, spleen, and kidneys with no masses or lesions.

Pathology of the polyp revealed heterotopic gastric mucosa with benign lobules of gastric glands. He also was found to have chronically active H. pylori gastritis with numerous Helicobacter organisms and atrophic gastritis with patchy areas of intestinal metaplasia. At that time, he was instructed to follow up for a repeat endoscopy for surveillance in two years. As recommended, two years later he presented to our office for surveillance of his duodenal lesion. Due to his history of atrophic gastritis and a large duodenal lesion, we performed an upper endoscopy that showed atrophic gastritis, duodenitis, and a single 10 mm polyp in the second portion of the duodenum. The duodenal polyp was biopsied. Pathology revealed polypoid gastric metaplastic mucosa with focal epithelial atypia including nuclear enlargement, stratification, nucleoli, and few mitoses. The patient was referred for endoscopic ultrasound to further characterize the lesion and complete resection. Several weeks later he underwent an endoscopic ultrasound that revealed a 13-mm pedunculated and sessile polyp on the lateral wall opposite to the major papilla in the second portion of the duodenum (). The polyp was removed en bloc using a hot snare following a 4-mL saline lift. Two endoclips were placed for hemostasis. Pathology revealed a pyloric gland adenoma (Figures , , and ) with predominantly low grade dysplasia (Figures and ) and some small areas of focal high grade dysplasia.

Initially, she was diagnosed with coronary heart disease (CHD) at a local hospital and received standard medical therapy for CHD (including aspirin, atorvastatin, ACE inhibitor and vasodilators). However, subsequent coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis of the coronary arteries. Because coronary spasm and microvascular lesions could not be ruled out, doctors continued to give her routine treatment for CHD. The patient\ufffd\ufffds symptoms persisted after treatment at the local hospital, and she was subsequently referred to our hospital for treatment. TTE showed a left ventricle diastolic diameter of 64 mm and diffuse hypokinesis, with an LVEF of 34%. It is noteworthy that an apical ventricular aneurysm with a wall thickness of 3 mm had formed. Multiple, developed muscle bundles were found in the left ventricle, which also divided the left ventricle into two distinct chambers. Blood entered the apical aneurysm in diastole and was ejected out of it in systole, as it occurs in the normal LV. The diameter of the communication measured 25 mm in diastole. The flow rate from the main chamber to the apical aneurysm was 150 cm/s. The patient also had no family history of heart disease. Subsequent CMR suggested that the myocardial three-layer structure in the left ventricular apex disappeared with ventricular aneurysm formation (Fig. ), which was strikingly similar to case 1. We conducted investigations to find the common causes of ventricular aneurysm, but there were no special findings other than moderate anemia (Hemoglobin: 8 g/dL, normal range: 11\u201315 g/dL) due to thalassemia. The reason for the more obvious decrease in cardiac function in this patient may partially be related to anemia, which would increase cardiac output and is one of the causes of cardiomyopathy [].

Echocardiogram confirmed moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 62 mm Hg and mean gradient of 34 mm Hg across the aortic valve, mild aortic regurgitation, left ventricular hypertrophy and preserved left ventricular function. Left heart catheterization demonstrated a gradient of 30 mm Hg across the aortic valve. Aortic root angiogram showed mild aortic regurgitation and a small and atretic normally arising proximal right coronary artery and a normally arising left coronary artery (Fig ). The selective right coronary angiogram demonstrated the atretic right coronary artery (RCA) supplying the SA nodal, right atrial and the proximal right ventricular branches and petering out thereafter (Fig ). The selective left coronary angiogram showed a normal left main stem (Fig ), ostial and mid vessel stenotic disease in left anterior descending artery (LAD) and a normal circumflex artery (Fig ). LAD continued across the left ventricular apex as posterior descending artery (PDA), running along the posterior interventricular septum up to the atrioventricular groove, where it gave off the left ventricular branch to the inferior surface of left ventricle and thereafter continued as the distal RCA without establishing any communication with the atretic proximal RCA (Fig ). Left ventriculogram confirmed well preserved left ventricular function. At operation, there was moderately severe left ventricular hypertrophy.

The patient described a bilateral heel pain with a gradual onset, beginning approximately 4 months before the referral. The pain was of an undulating intensity, with maxima reaching 81 mm on a visual analog scale while walking upon getting out of bed. As the painful area was located medially on the heel, the patient was forced to put her weight on the lateral rim of the foot while walking.\nThe walking ability was severely reduced, with a maximum uninterrupted walking distance of approximately 100 m. The limiting factor was a pain in the lateral compartment of the left knee, which had become apparent about the same time as the heel pain. However, recurring knee pain had been known for several years before the referral.\nShe was suffering from breast cancer, which was diagnosed in 2014 and had been treated with surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Metastatic bone disease was ascertained at the time of diagnosis and consisted of lesions in the spine, pelvic bones, and several ribs. No recent progression of the underlying disease had been observed.\nIn the clinical examination, the heel pain was localized on both sides along the medial part of the insertion of the plantar aponeurosis on the calcaneus, as well as along the most medial bundle of its central part. Pressure on these areas elicited pain of the same quality and location as experienced during walking.\nA recent bone scintigraphy showed no tracer uptake in the feet.

Therefore, the pathological diagnosis of the tumor was T3N1M0 Stage III according to the TNM classification of the International Union for Cancer classification []. Because the cancer involved tissue near the surgical margin of the cervical esophagus, the patient underwent postoperative CRT.\nFive years later, gastrointestinal fiberscopy and endoscopic ultrasound revealed intra-submucosal gastric tube cancer, which was located on the anterior wall of the antrum (Fig. ). The pathological diagnosis of biopsy specimens was signet ring cell carcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) did not show either enlarged lymph nodes or distant metastasis.\nThe gastric tube cancer was considered a contraindication for endoscopic resection because of the histological type and the fact that it had invaded the deep submucosal layer. Moreover, we considered that surgically removing the gastric tube via the posterior mediastinal route would be extremely difficult, and the patient also preferred to avoid this procedure. Thus, we treated the gastric tube cancer by CRT using docetaxel and S-1 with a concurrent total dose of 60 Gy of radiation.

Preoperative CT and MR scan (Figs. and ) of the liver was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with a tumor in the gallbladder area with a relatively massive infiltration of the S5 and S6 liver segments and extensive regions of necrosis.

The lateral pectoral nerve pierced the clavipectoral fascia and supplied the pectoralis major as usual but during its course it communicated with the medial pectoral nerve (MPN) of medial cord of BP (). The MCN was completely absent. The nerve to the CB was a small motor twig arising directly from the lateral cord which innervated the CB muscle. The lateral and medial root of MN formed the MN proper and descended between the biceps brachii and brachialis muscle. It then crossed the brachial artery from lateral to medial and finally entered the cubital fossa. In the arm, deep in the biceps brachii, the MN gave two branches: a direct branch to the biceps brachii and another long branch which, after supplying the brachialis muscle, continued as the LCNF and supplied the lateral side of the skin of forearm. The medial cord also varied in the origin of medial cutaneous nerve of arm and forearm arising from a single common trunk, which became separated in the middle of the arm ().\nThe lateral cord of BP in the left axilla branched four times: the lateral pectoral nerve; nerve to CB and lateral root of MN and an additional lateral root of MN.

The patient reported several-month right upper quadrant pain and 4-kg weight loss over the past year. There was no laboratory sign of obstructive jaundice at the day of admission. Preoperative CT and MR scan (Figs. and ) of the liver was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with a tumor in the gallbladder area with a relatively massive infiltration of the S5 and S6 liver segments and extensive regions of necrosis. Given the potentially resectable lesion according to preoperative imaging, exploratory laparotomy was indicated to attempt radical resection. During the exploration, a voluminous tumor was found attached to the peritoneum. Intraoperative ultrasound was performed and revealed a tumor originating from the gallbladder bed area and reaching up to the area of the hepatic hilum and extensive involvement of the hepatoduodenal ligament by the tumor through the lymph nodes. The tumor was classified as inoperable due to this finding. But during the exploration, however, a rupture of the fragile tumor occurred with massive eruption of the necrotic mass and the gallbladder content into the abdominal cavity, accompanied by bleeding of the liver parenchyma. We decided that the condition could only be managed by attempting modified resection. We performed cholecystectomy and non-anatomical resection of hepatic segments S5 and S6 and partial resection of S4 without lymphadenectomy as a debulking operation (Fig. ).

On 19 February 2018, a CT scan was performed that showed an infiltrate into the greater omentum and multiple nodules associated with small bowel mesentery. There was no ascites. Masses were present on both the right and left ovaries. On 14 March 2018, she was taken to the operating room where multiple biopsies were taken. Her left ovary and appendix were removed. Pathology showed a mature cystic teratoma and extensive malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. Multiple biopsies from omentum, surface of uterus, peritoneum from the abdominal wall, and peritoneum from the small bowel showed malignant peritoneal mesothelioma.\nRepeat CT on 2 May 2018 showed malignant peritoneal mesothelioma infiltrating the omentum and accumulating as a diffuse mass in the pelvis. The small bowel mesentery showed multiple prominent lymph nodes. For definitive treatment of her malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, the patient was taken back to the operating room on 3 May 2018.

This was positive for mucinous carcinoma, and the patient was referred to our institution for treatment and follow up.\nAt our institution in the biopsy slides revision, we found a tumor composed of mucinous lakes with numerous tumor cells of medium to large size with a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm confirming the presence of pure mucinous carcinoma.

The tumor was classified as a Low grade tumor (G1) based on the Scarff Bloom Richardson scale. We did not observe perineural or vascular invasion. On immunohistochemistry the results were 100% and 90% positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors respectively with high intensity, and HER2 receptors negative.\nOn physical examination a surgical injury was seen. Upon palpation, this zone felt indurated, edematous and presented as a rough irregular texture. No other lesions were found. An ultrasound was performed, showing avascular distortion and a heterogeneous mass with microcysts (white arrows) []. MRI showed a hypointense irregular mass that indicates a mild enhancement in contrast sequences and a hyperintense sequence in SPAIR. The evaluation of the lymph nodes was not suspicious for metastasis.\nWith the radiological suspicious of residual tumor and pathological findings accomplished at our institution a partial mastectomy and a sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. Pathological findings showed a residual mass of 25 mm of pure mucinous carcinoma with negative surgical margins.

No malignancy was associated with the specimens recovered. In December of 2016, the abdominal pain persisted and a mass was palpable on physical examination in the mid-abdomen on the right. Colonoscopy was performed and biopsy showed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the caecum.\nCT was performed in December of 2016 and the primary right colon malignancy along with bilateral ovarian metastases were imaged. Percutaneous biopsy of the right ovarian mass showed well differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with a colonic primary. From December of 2016 through December of 2017, the patient was maintained on chemotherapy. Initially, she was treated with FOLFOX. After four cycles, because of neuropathy, the oxaliplatin was stopped. The patient was maintained on 5-fluorouracil and bevacizumab.\nIn December of 2017, a CT documented marked regression of the primary tumor. It was not visible by CT. However, multiple lymph nodes within the mesentery of the distal small bowel were enlarged. Also by CT a pelvic mass showed that the right ovary had increased in size to 15 cm in greatest diameter despite the fact that the primary caecal malignancy was no longer visible by CT.\nOver approximately one month the patient became rapidly more symptomatic with abdominal distention from ascites and an expanding right ovarian mass. On February 1, 2018 the patient underwent cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC in a specialized center for management of peritoneal metastases. At the time of surgery she underwent a greater omentectomy, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, complete pelvic peritonectomy, right colon resection, and small bowel resection. She received HIPEC with mitomycin C and doxorubicin with systemic fluorouracil.

The patient reported several-month right upper quadrant pain and 4-kg weight loss over the past year. There was no laboratory sign of obstructive jaundice at the day of admission. Preoperative CT and MR scan (Figs. and ) of the liver was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with a tumor in the gallbladder area with a relatively massive infiltration of the S5 and S6 liver segments and extensive regions of necrosis. Given the potentially resectable lesion according to preoperative imaging, exploratory laparotomy was indicated to attempt radical resection. During the exploration, a voluminous tumor was found attached to the peritoneum. Intraoperative ultrasound was performed and revealed a tumor originating from the gallbladder bed area and reaching up to the area of the hepatic hilum and extensive involvement of the hepatoduodenal ligament by the tumor through the lymph nodes. The tumor was classified as inoperable due to this finding. But during the exploration, however, a rupture of the fragile tumor occurred with massive eruption of the necrotic mass and the gallbladder content into the abdominal cavity, accompanied by bleeding of the liver parenchyma. We decided that the condition could only be managed by attempting modified resection.

He was found to have space-occupying lesions on both kidneys during routine physical examination and presented to our hospital for diagnosis and treatment. Laboratory test results including those for thyroid function were within normal ranges. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a relatively homogeneously enhancing mass in the lower pole of the left kidney (4 cm in its greatest dimension) and a cystic lesion in the right kidney (). Part of the wall of the right renal cyst was surgically removed, and intraoperative pathological examination was performed. Histology showed cells arranged in a single or multiple layers, which could be seen in some areas of the cyst wall. Cellular atypia, nucleoli, and mitosis were not obvious (). Obvious necrosis and hemorrhage could be seen in another area, and the fibrous tissue in the cyst wall was perforated; some suspicious infiltrating glands could also be seen in the fibrous stroma (). We suspected cystic renal cell carcinoma. To preserve some kidney function, the patient underwent partial nephrectomy of the right kidney with nephron preservation and left radical nephrectomy. According to the postoperative pathology examination, we observed follicular architecture with micro- and macrofollicles containing eosinophilic secretions or colloid-like material in another area of the right renal cyst wall (). The follicular cells contained moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm and round nuclei (). The left renal tumor was a typical clear cell renal cell carcinoma (). Immunohistochemistry revealed that the tumor cells of the right kidney tumor were positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7) () and paired Box 2 (PAX2) () but were negative for transcription termination factor 1 (TTF1) (), thyroglobulin (TG), and synaptophysin (Syn). There was no evidence of a mass in the thyroid gland or enlargement of regional lymph nodes on ultrasonography of the neck. Therefore, the right renal tumor was finally diagnosed as thyroid-like follicular renal cell carcinoma with cystic changes, while the left kidney tumor was diagnosed as clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

No malignancy was associated with the specimens recovered. In December of 2016, the abdominal pain persisted and a mass was palpable on physical examination in the mid-abdomen on the right. Colonoscopy was performed and biopsy showed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the caecum.\nCT was performed in December of 2016 and the primary right colon malignancy along with bilateral ovarian metastases were imaged. Percutaneous biopsy of the right ovarian mass showed well differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with a colonic primary. From December of 2016 through December of 2017, the patient was maintained on chemotherapy. Initially, she was treated with FOLFOX. After four cycles, because of neuropathy, the oxaliplatin was stopped. The patient was maintained on 5-fluorouracil and bevacizumab.\nIn December of 2017, a CT documented marked regression of the primary tumor. It was not visible by CT. However, multiple lymph nodes within the mesentery of the distal small bowel were enlarged. Also by CT a pelvic mass showed that the right ovary had increased in size to 15 cm in greatest diameter despite the fact that the primary caecal malignancy was no longer visible by CT.\nOver approximately one month the patient became rapidly more symptomatic with abdominal distention from ascites and an expanding right ovarian mass. On February 1, 2018 the patient underwent cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC in a specialized center for management of peritoneal metastases. At the time of surgery she underwent a greater omentectomy, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, complete pelvic peritonectomy, right colon resection, and small bowel resection. She received HIPEC with mitomycin C and doxorubicin with systemic fluorouracil. In order to determine if the multiple enlarged lymph nodes within the small bowel mesentery were involved by cancer, individual lymph nodes were removed and subjected to histopathologic study by permanent sections at a later time.

The pain that was mild at the time of symptom onset became slightly worse at night without association with knee effusion or swelling. She had no definite history of trauma and denied any medical history of rheumatoid arthritis or any other arthritic diseases. A year before this presentation, she visited another hospital for the same symptom where plain radiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee were performed. The patient knew plain radiographs showed normal findings but MRI revealed a widespread signal change in the subchondral bone of the lateral femoral condyle. The initial diagnosis was bone bruise of the lateral femoral condyle, and she was treated conservatively using intermittent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug medication and physical therapy, which did not result in pain relief.\nWhen the patient presented at Dongguk University Gyeongju Hospital, she complained of pain in the anterolateral aspect of the right knee, but joint effusion or tenderness was not evident and the range of knee motion was normal. McMurray and instability tests were negative, and laboratory findings were within normal ranges. Simple radiographs of both knees showed no specific bony abnormality, but the MRI showed a 6 mm \u00d7 3.5 mm \u00d7 3 mm sized intermediate-low signal intensity nodular lesion on the T1-weighted image and a nodular lesion with central intermediate-low signal intensity surrounded by high signal intensity in the anterosuperior subcortical area of the lateral femoral condyle with adjacent bone marrow edema on the T2-weightedimage (). Computed tomography (CT) of the right knee demonstrated a 5 mm \u00d7 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm sized lesion with the central nidus and perinidal sclerosis in the anterolateral subcortical area of the distal femur (). Bone scan showed increased uptake at the site corresponding to the lesion in the distal femur (). A diagnosis of osteoid osteoma of the distal femur was established and an arthroscopically assisted excision was scheduled.",

He had an excision and biopsy operation of chondroblastoma in the left humeral head 1 month previously and developed a continuous pain without any nerve damage on electromyelography. The visual analogue scale for pain (VAS) was 70/100 and hyperalgesia, allodynia, muscular atrophy and tremor of left forearm were observed on physical examination. The delayed phase of a 3 phase bone scan showed an increase of vascular flow on the left humeral head and an infra red image of upper limbs revealed the temperature of the left forearm was lower than the right one by 1.72 degree (). By his symptoms, physical examinations, and the infra red images, we diagnosed the patient as having CRPS type 1 and started oral medication and tried continuous cervical epidural catheterization, thoracic sympathetic ganglion block, cervical nerve root block, brachial plexus block and intravenous injection of local anesthetics and ketamin, so his symptoms were controlled around 40/100 on VAS. However, after summer vacation, while attending school regularly, the patient complained about having severe pain several times a day because of making contact with friends and he was rushed to the emergency room more often than before, and did not respond to any of treatments that we had used before with success. VAS was 80/100 and getting more severe and broadening to the tips of the left hand fingers; especially, he felt a cutting-like pain on the left fifth finger, allodynia even with breeze and squeezing pain, and a limited range of motion with tremor. We initially considered spinal cord stimulator insertion at first, but we were afraid of stimulation electrode migration because the patient was still growing 8 centimeters per year. Therefore we decided to try TSB and explained about the validity of using this procedure for uncontrollerable pain, We also explained the side effects",

His previous history included left and right pneumothorax at the ages of 15 and 16 years, respectively, which were treated by VATS. In the previous operation, simple resection of apical bullous lesion was carried out without surgical pleurodesis or covering any prosthetic sheets such as polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets. Although the left lung inflated quite well and air leakage disappeared immediately after chest drainage, VATS was planned for the surgical indication of second postoperative recurrence. A preoperative non-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed that the abnormally dilated pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein in the lingular segment ran towards the chest wall scar remaining at the surgical port site used at the previous operation (Fig. ). In this operation, a small bullous lesion arising in segment 6 of the left lung was ligated, and the dilated pulsating pulmonary vessels at the periphery of the lingular segment adhered to the aforementioned chest wall scar remaining at the thoracoscopy port site that was previously made in the fourth intercostal space (Fig. ). After this operation, we used contrast-enhanced CT scan for a suspected diagnosis of pulmonary vessel malformation. The examination revealed an abnormal connection between the branch of the systemic artery of the chest wall and the dilated pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein in the lingular segment. Left subclavian selective arteriography also showed hypertrophic blood vessels that arose from the internal thoracic artery, the lateral thoracic artery, and the subscapular artery arising from the axillary artery, which drained into the both the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein in the lingular segment (Fig. ). Because the chest CT scan obtained at the first episode of left pneumothorax showed no parietopulmonary fistula, a secondary SAPVF caused by first VATS for the pneumothorax was diagnosed.\nThe patient had no symptoms after the cure of pneumothorax, but the vascular abnormalities might lead to shunt-induced pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, hemoptysis, and possibly rupture.",

Distal embolization of individual bleeding vessels proved impossible due to anatomical distortion by the surrounding hematoma and vessel spasm. In view of the emergency nature of the situation, coil embolization of the proximal splenic artery was performed, with complete occlusion of splenic arterial flow.

The patient had a history of an open in situ CuTR 5 years previously. The patient reported that he did well in the initial post-op period, had good relief of his neurological symptoms, and was able to perform his daily activities. The mass, which was accentuated with wrist and finger flexion, was located on the ulnar side of his forearm deep to his prior CuTR scar. He also complained of discomfort when resting his forearm on a hard surface which started approximately 3 months prior to presentation with a maximum visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score of 5. He denied any trauma or inciting event. Clinical examination revealed a palpable mass over the ulnar aspect of his forearm deep to the surgical scar, with a tender area of fascia where the CuTR release had ended distally. He denied any exertional compartment syndrome\u2013type symptoms.\nThe patient presented to us with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ordered by his primary care physician, which was normal and did not reveal any masses. After discussing the diagnosis and treatment options, the patient wished to proceed with complete fasciotomy over the FCU.\nThe decision was made to complete the fasciotomy distally to the FCU tendon level in order to remove the painful stimulus as well as the discrete area muscle bulge noted over the ulnar forearm. This was performed open with an endoscopic assist method. A longitudinal incision was made in the skin approximately 2 cm long, 5 cm proximal to this fascial band. The soft tissue spreaders were then placed over the forearm fascia distally to create a working space for the endoscope. The nasal speculum was then inserted into the wound under the skin and the endoscopic camera was inserted. This revealed the leading edge of the fascial herniation ().

Being an endemic country to dengue viral infection, clinical suspicion made us prioritize our investigations and a positive dengue NS1 antigen confirmed dengue viral infection. She had a significant past history of symptomatic aortic stenosis which necessitated surgery and had undergone mechanical aortic valve replacement in 1999. She was on oral warfarin and had maintained a therapeutically appropriate internationalized ratio (INR) while on 5 mg with no prior episodes of significant bleeding. She additionally gave a history of hypertension with dyslipidemia and was also an asthmatic on medical management with good compliance. She also had a notable obstetric past history which had required a classical caesarean section.\nPreliminary examination revealed a normotensive patient with a blood pressure of 130 mmHg systole and 80 mmHg diastole and had a regular pulse of 92 beats per minute. Cardiac auscultation revealed a mechanical click coinciding with 2nd heart sound and an ejection systolic murmur favoring a functional mechanical aortic valve in the absence of any other findings favoring decompensation. Though respiratory examination revealed scattered bilateral rhonchi, the patient appeared stable with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination revealed a midline scar keeping in with the history of a classical caesarean section. Neurological examination was unrevealing. A decision was taken to continue her routine metered dose inhalers of salmeterol and fluticasone 250/50 micrograms twice daily. Additionally she was also nebulized 8 hourly with oxygen driven salbutamol. Though she had been on oral losartan 50 mg bd for her hypertension and rosuvastatin 10 mg nocte for her dyslipidemia a clinical decision was taken to discontinue both. However in consideration of her mechanical aortic valve, we took the clinical decision to continue her warfarin without dose reduction at 5 mg vesper.\nOn admission, which was day 1 of her illness, whole blood analysis revealed a hemoglobin of 9.3 g",
