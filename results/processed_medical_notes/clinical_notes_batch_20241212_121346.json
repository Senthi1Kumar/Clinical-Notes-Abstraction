    "original_text": "In January 2009, a 66-year-old woman with a medical history of thyroidectomy was admitted to Lille University Hospital for further evaluation of a large cystic mass in the distal pancreas. She had complained of transient epigastric pain one month before. Blood biochemical parameters showed no pancreatitis and the tumor markers, mainly CEA and CA 19-9, were all within the normal limits. On admission, the patient was asymptomatic and the pancreatic mass was not palpable in the upper abdomen. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a huge, well-defined, multiloculated, cystic mass, of 10 cm in greatest dimension, replacing the entire body and tail of the pancreas, and displaying multiple calcifications in its isthmic part (Figures and ). MRI also showed an upstream dilatation of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) to 16 mm, with no dilatation of its distal part and no abnormality in the pancreatic head (). Both MRI and CT concluded in IPMT. By contrast, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) showed a component of microcystic pattern and concluded in a serous cystadenoma. EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was performed through the gastric wall in order to analyze the cyst fluid at biochemical and cytological levels: concentration of CEA was 0.2 ng/mL, while cytological analysis was not contributory. Regarding the diagnostic uncertainty, we performed an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) that showed a cystic dilatation of the pancreatic branches communicating with the dilated MPD suggestive of an IPMT (). These results prompted us to operate on the patient especially as she had complained of abdominal pain. On exploratory laparotomy, a huge multicystic tumour measuring 10 cm in maximum diameter was found, replacing the entire body and tail of the pancreas and surrounding the splenic vessels.

His medical history included esophagectomy with esophagogastrostomy due to an esophageal rupture caused by a lodged chicken bone 8 years prior. This gastric transposition was performed by the substernal route. The patient also underwent several esophageal dilations because he suffered an esophageal stricture due to lye ingestion more than 11 years ago. Upon admission, laboratory studies revealed that he had mild leukocytosis (13,800/uL) and severe anemia (Hb 5.5 g/dL). Chest radiographs showed mild pulmonary edema without evidence of pneumopericardium. On endoscopic examination, there was a huge, deeply penetrating gastric ulcer on the anterior wall of the upper body (). A gastrograffin chest CT scan was then performed, showing a focal lesion bulging out of the posterior gastric wall and protruding into the pericardial space with severe thickening of the adjacent pericardium. However, there were no signs of gastrograffin leakage. The fistula between the posterior wall of the transposed stomach and pericardium was probably sealed off, resulting in an adhesion ().

She had a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and essential hypertension. She denied any history of thyroid disease and neck irradiation. She had no family history of any cancer. She was a housewife and had no history of tobacco smoking or consuming alcohol. A physical examination at the time of presentation was not significant except for right costovertebral angle tenderness. Her heart rate was 96 beats per minute and blood pressure was 155/90 mmHg. The findings of laboratory tests, which were complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, and urine analysis, were within normal range and they did not help us find the etiology of her right flank pain. Abdominal screening with computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass on her right kidney, which was considered a primary renal cell carcinoma and she underwent a right nephrectomy. Unexpectedly, PTC metastasis was diagnosed from demonstrative histopathological findings, such as positive immunoperoxidase staining for thyroglobulin (Tg). After further examinations of her thyroid and neck with ultrasonography (USG), a total thyroidectomy was performed. Pathological examination of thyroid tissue revealed a 5 cm tumor with capsular invasion and a strong positive immunoperoxidase staining of cytokeratin-19, HBME-1, and galectin-3. She was diagnosed as having metastatic PTC. Orally administered levothyroxine 75 mcg daily was initiated in addition to the metformin 1000 mg twice daily and amlodipine 10 mg daily treatments she received prior to PTC diagnosis. Postoperative serum Tg was above 300 ng/ml and anti-Tg was negative. Afterward, she was screened with unenhanced thoracic CT and skeletal scintigraphy. They revealed bilateral multiple nodules in her lungs and bone metastasis on T10 vertebra and right sacroiliac joint.

    "original_text": "A 56-year-old man was admitted to the hospital 1 week after a left thyroid nodule was discovered during a physical examination. Color Doppler ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic area approximately 1.2 \u00d7 0.8 cm in size in the central portion of the left thyroid gland. The area had unclear boundaries with the surrounding tissues, an irregular shape, aspect ratio imbalance, and fine sand calcification, and its TI-RADS grade was 4B. Fine needle aspiration cytology of the left thyroid nodule suggested papillary thyroid cancer. Preoperative thyroid function and serum calcium and phosphorus levels were within the normal range.\nSurgical treatment was performed under general anesthesia on 14 June 2019. The patient was placed in the supine position and intubated under general anesthesia. The intubation process was smooth, and no abnormal secretions were found in the mouth, pharynx, or larynx. Shoulder pads were used to fully expose the neck. A low neck arc incision was made to separate the skin flaps and expose the thyroid glands. Using a 1-mL skin test syringe, nanocarbon suspension (H20041829; Chongqing LUMMY Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Congqing, China) was injected with a perpendicular orientation into the two upper and lower poles of the left thyroid gland to about 4 mm in depth.

Confirmation was carried out by CT of the chest with intravenous contrast, and showed a bullet showing a streak artifact in the posterior basal region of the right lower lobe in the peripheral 2 cm zone of the lung (). The scan also showed dilated sub-segmental bronchus with no evidence of bronchiectasis, or cavitation. The remaining lung fields appear to be normal in the scan, which indicates the absence of any other pathological reason for causing hemoptysis in the patient. Bronchoscopic examination was not carried out due to the association of FB, leading to localized bronchiectasis, was quite obvious on the CT scan. Bronchoscopic examination was not expected to add any information to the clinical workup. Following consent for thoracotomy and wedge resection, a right posterolateral thoracotomy was performed at the seventh intercostal space with one lung ventilation using double lumen endotracheal tube under general anesthesia.

He had also experienced up to ten episodes of watery blood-stained stools per day over this period.\nOver the preceding thirteen months the patient had presented nine times to hospital with the same symptoms but of lesser severity. Upon closer questioning he admitted to experiencing altered bowel habits (alternating constipation and diarrhoea) for up to one month before presentation but denied any abnormalities in bowel habit frequency during childhood or adolescence.\nHis past medical history included an episode pericarditis of unknown aetiology 8 years prior and recurrent left shoulder dislocations. He had not previously undergone any prior abdominal operations or endoscopies. He had no known allergies. He was a previous habitual methamphetamine user but stated he had not used illicit substances for four years and was not taking any regular prescription medications.\nHis mother had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer at 42 years of age. There was no other relevant family history.\nPhysical examination revealed a slender man with a body mass index (BMI) of 22.5 kg/m2 with generalised abdominal pain and voluntary guarding. The tenderness was more severe on the left side and suprapubic region. Heart rate was 135 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, blood pressure 133/82 mmHg and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.

Clinical examination revealed left-sided antalgic gait and tenderness in her left groin. Left hip internal rotation was limited to 10\u00b0. Anteroposterior pelvic and true lateral hip radiographs revealed typical signs of osteoarthritis (Figure ). In addition, there was a 25-mm-diameter calcification in the lesser pelvis, which was reported by the radiologist to be a calcified uterine myoma.

On the basis of the urine dipstick stick, a diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) was made, although the patient was asymptomatic and urine was sent for culture. The patient was empirically treated with oral antibiotics, and the surgery was postponed. Urine cultures showed no bacterial growth, and no further tests or referral to other specialties were done. Four weeks later she underwent a THA with satisfactory recovery. At the first follow-up six weeks postoperatively, the patient was almost pain-free and was using two crutches for stability.

At the age of 23, her food intake reduced drastically to pieces of cucumber, selective fruits, and a cup of yoghurt. She became more obsessed with her body shape and regularly measured her waist circumference and checked her body weight as well. At the age of 36, she developed amenorrhea and had lost 10 kilograms (kg) of weight over the last few years in order to reach her ideal weight of 30 kgs. However the patient refused to seek any psychiatric consultation in the past. Based on the detailed history, she was subsequently diagnosed as anorexia nervosa as per ICD-10 []. But she was not taking any treatment for this disorder. There was no significant medical history in the past. Physical examination revealed asthenic female, with a body temperature of 98.6\u00b0F.

On physical examination, two bullet entry points were evident at the right popliteal fossa and dorsal soft tissues of the distal right leg. Initial radiographs were negative for fractures or dislocation.\nComputed tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrated a retained bullet fragment within the popliteal fossa abutting the dorsal aspect of the popliteal artery. An 8 millimeter (mm) soft tissue density abutting the medial aspect of the popliteal artery was also identified, concerning for either a small pseudoaneurysm or short segment intramural hematoma. Streak artifact from the retained bullet precluded adequate assessment of this region.

    "original_text": "A 56-year-old homeless male with a history of hypertension and a seizure disorder presented to the emergency department with a one-day history of pain, redness, and swelling of the right lower extremity. In the emergency department, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 102\u02daF and otherwise had normal vital signs. His physical exam revealed diffuse erythema and swelling to the right lower extremity extending up to the medial aspect of the right thigh. The patient was admitted to the hospital and was started on intravenous cefazolin, intravenous vancomycin, and oral clindamycin.\nDespite antibiotic therapy and bedside debridement, the patient\u2019s erythema continued to spread (see Figure ). On hospital Day 4, it was determined that the patient required irrigation and debridement of his right lower extremity wound. Extensive soft tissue debridement was required as a large portion of the right lower extremity was found to be necrotic (see Figure ). Devitalized tissue was removed from the dorsum of the foot, circumferentially around the lower leg and laterally to the level of the knee (see Figures -). An NPWTi-d device was applied over the wound in the operating room (see Figure ). A special three-layer reticulated open cell foam dressing was applied over the dorsum of the foot where the most necrotic tissue was found prior to debridement.

Three years after the operation, complaints of resistant ascites and dyspnea had been started. Electrocardiography (ECG) sinus rhythm revealed that the PR interval and QRS width were normal and there were no pathological ST-T wave changes. Echocardiography showed that the prosthetic tricuspid valve leaflets did not open and the maximum and mean gradients on the valve were 17 and 8 mmHg, respectively. Echocardiography revealed that prosthetic valve was dysfunctional thus reoperation was decided. In the second operation, a 27 mm St Jude Medical Epic porcine bioprosthetic valve was implanted in the patient and AV complete block developed in the postoperative period. Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was 45% and left ventricular dyssynchrony was found on echocardiography performed under transient pacemaker. Due to the low EF and pacemaker dependence of the patient, it was aimed to place two electrodes into the left ventricle and therefore reducing dyssynchrony. The patient underwent 3 left subclavian punctures and two simultaneous access systems were placed in the CS. In the CS angiography, lateral branch and middle cardiac veins were targeted (Fig. : a. Coronary sinus angiography, b. Two coronary sinus sheaths, c-d. Right atrium and coronary sinus electrodes). Electrodes were placed on the target two branches and right atrium.

The parents could not specify whether there was any connection with standing, coughing, or effort and she had no urge to void.\nShe was constantly wet but had normal voiding habits. On initial physical examination the external genitalia appeared normal with no vaginal pooling of urine or ectopic ureteral orifice. However, a long-term external genitalia examination revealed normal urethral and vaginal openings, with an intermittent urine leakage through the vaginal orifice, which slightly increased in abdominal pressure.\nIn her past history she had recurrent febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) since her infancy. At the age of 3 she underwent an abdominal ultrasound that suspected a double left kidney. A voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) was performed and a vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) grade III on the right kidney was found. She was given chronic chemoprophylaxis without any UTI recurrence. She had a good toilet training and gave up daytime diapers around the age of 3. At this moment parents noticed the urinary incontinence, but this didn't bother them. At the age of 4 parents asked a urologist for help, who considered the symptoms to be the result of an overactive bladder and anticholinergic treatment was recommended. No improvement was noticed, and for this reason the little girl was sent to our department for further investigation.\nComplete blood count, biochemical tests, and urinalysis were all normal and the urine culture was negative.\nAn abdominal ultrasound was performed and both kidneys had normal parenchyma and size, with a duplex-system suspicion on left side; the bladder was normal in appearance.

Most laboratory test results revealed normal limits except for elevated white blood count (11,170/\u03bcL) and serum C-reactive protein level (1.6 mg/dL). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (Fig. ) revealed intussusception at the ileocecal region, which appeared as a \u201ctarget\u201d sign with a tumorous oval mass of 56 \u00d7 41 mm as a leading point of intussusception. An urgent operation was performed because of the risk of colonic ischemia due to intussusception. At laparotomy, the bowels had already spontaneously reduced, and a mass was palpable in the ileocecal region. We performed an ileocecal resection, aiming to avoid the potential of relapse of intussusception due to the residual mass. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on day 16 postoperatively. The resected specimen (Fig. ) comprised an oval cystic lesion of 45 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 22 mm that protruded into the enteric lumen at the ileocecal valve. The cyst was filled with brown-colored stiff material and did not communicate with the original enteric lumen upon macroscopy.

Thus, we concluded that the cyst was a type of intestinal duplication.

Her pathological history reported an NSCLC treated seven months previously with neoadjuvant cisplatin (CDDP) based chemotherapy and upper left lobectomy. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed one heterogeneous lesion measuring 1 cm in diameter at the right frontal lobe. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected two solid lesions, the first at the right frontal lobe of 1.9 cm in diameter and the second at the left occipital of 1 cm with surrounding edema and mass effect suggestive of metastasis. The woman received immediately dexamethasone 8 mg two times a day to relieve the symptoms and in October 2011 accessed our radiation therapy department for evaluation. To complete her staging she underwent a total body CT that revealed no other disease location. Thereafter, she received a single-fraction SRS on the two brain lesions. SRS was delivered by Hi-Art helical tomotherapy (HT) and planned using the 1 cm field width on a CT scan with a 2.5 mm slice thickness from the vertex to the second cervical vertebra. Dose prescription was hard constrained so that planning target volume\u2019s (PTV) median dose equals the prescription dose. The patient was immobilized using the InterFix Radiosurgery Kit which fixes the patient\u2019s skull to tomotherapy treatment couch. CT images were fused with MRI with 1 mm slice thickness, performed the day before on a GE SIGNA 3T scanner, to allow a better identification of the target and organs at risk (OAR).

On simple radiographs, an unstable intertrochanteric fracture was observed (AO/OTA 31-A2) (). Under general anesthesia, closed reduction was performed on a fracture table, followed by internal flxation with a 200-mm length 125\u00b0 DLT nail at another local orthopedic clinic (). Walker ambulation was permitted from one week after surgery. The patient was discharged two weeks after the operation. Postoperative radiographs at the two-week follow-up revealed no evidence of implant migration (). Three weeks postoperatively, the patient developed sudden left inguinal pain while ambulating with a walker. She had not experienced any new falls or trauma, and was referred to our clinic. Her radiographs revealed that the lag screw had migrated through the acetabulum, and penetrated into the quadrilateral surface of the pelvis by 4 cm (). The patient was transferred to our clinic for further management. An abdomen/pelvis computed tomography (CT) with contrast revealed that the lag screw was in close proximity to the external iliac artery and vein (). The radiology report confirmed no evidence of vascular compromise or pseudoaneurysm formation. The patient's vitals remained stable.\nWe scheduled a two-stage operation. First, the migrated lag screw was removed without injury to other pelvic structures. Immediately after surgery, the pelvis and abdomen were assessed by CT, which revealed no intrapelvic damage due to removal of the migrated lag screw.

Drainage was removed on the 12th day after surgery and the first round of chemotherapy was administered on the 21st day postoperatively. During hospitalization, there were no complications at the donor site or any other issues, and she was discharged on the 36th day after the operation. She received three more rounds of chemotherapy after discharge, and outpatient follow-up for the next 7 years was uneventful. In July 2015, 7 years after surgery, the patient complained of a palpable mass on her back, at the donor site, at the outpatient clinic of the Department of General Surgery. Seroma was diagnosed, aspiration and drainage were performed, and the symptoms were relieved. In March 2018, 10 years after surgery, symptoms of a palpable mass recurred at the donor site. Incision, drainage, and bacterial culture were performed at the Department of General Surgery. The drained discharge from the donor site revealed a serous fluid pattern, including blood clot\u2013like material, and no bacteria were identified in the culture.

On the day of injury, he was diagnosed with a coronal plane fracture of the lateral femoral condyle and treated with open reduction and internal fixation using 3 screws at a different hospital. The fracture was type I according to the Letenneur classification []. At 2 months postoperatively, the range of motion was 0\u00b0/full extension to 40\u00b0 of flexion, and manipulation of the knee joint was performed under anesthesia. At 4 months postoperatively, he was referred to our hospital for further treatment. On presentation at our hospital, his chief complaints were knee pain after walking and decreased range of knee flexion. The limitation of his knee flexion affected his daily life. He hoped to improve his knee flexion and knee pain in order to continue his job as a waiter. Physical examination showed that the range of motion was 0\u00b0/full extension to 120\u00b0 of flexion, and the Lachman test was positive. No varus-valgus instability was noted. Plain radiographs and computed tomography scans revealed that the middle part of the lateral femoral condyle was depressed and the posterior part of the lateral femoral condyle was displaced posteriorly, although bony union was obtained (Figure ). This incongruity of the lateral compartment of the knee joint was considered to be responsible for his complaints. At the second operation, performed 6 months after the first operation, diagnostic arthroscopy showed severe incongruity of his joint with depressed articular cartilage in the fractured area (25 \u00d7 20 mm) (Figure ), with normal tibial surface, meniscus, and posterior cruciate ligament, and scarred anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).

Medical conditions of the patients were normal and there were no signs of any syndrome. Intraoral examination of both patients revealed yellowish-brown, rough, and atypical enamel formation. Generalized fibrotic gingival enlargements with secondary inflammation covering almost all teeth were also seen. Clinical crown lengths were short because of AI and diffuse gingival enlargement in both patients (Figures , , and ) and Figures , , and . However, these findings were more severe in the younger sister. O'Leary plaque index [] was found 83% in younger and 71% in older patient. Radiographic examination showed normal dentin formation and pulp chamber, but enamel appeared to be thin in each patient (). The other family members were examined except grand-parents and no familial occurrence of AI or gingival hyperplasia was observed.\nClinical findings determined the diagnosis as a pitted hypoplastic type of amelogenesis imperfecta in younger and a rough hypoplastic type of amelogenesis imperfecta in older patient. Histological investigations showed mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate, calcified bodies, and odontogenic epithelium in a dens-fibrovascular-connective tissue (). Because of fibrotic appearance, hereditary pattern, and histological character, the lesions were described as HGF like gingival enlargements with secondary inflammatory involvement for both patients.\nThe reduction of the gingival inflammation which was the main objective of the initial periodontal therapy was realized by oral hygiene motivation, scaling and root planning.

    "original_text": "A 66-year-old man with a history of infiltrative vesical carcinoma treated with intravesical immunotherapy 13 years previously was referred for recent-onset pain in the pelvic girdle. Pain was assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS) at 8/10 and was much increased with walking, which was limited to a short distance and required the use of a crutch. CT revealed extensive osteolytic metastasis involving almost all the right iliac wing and acetabulum together with the right sacral wing (\n). Bone scintigraphy and 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed multiple other skeletal lesions. Biopsy of the pelvic bone revealed an epidermoid carcinoma. A vesical biopsy gave negative results, but because the prostate was clinically enlarged and the prostate-specific antigen level was increased (5 ng/mL), a prostate biopsy was performed and revealed epidermoid urothelial tumoral infiltration. The patient received a first course of systemic chemotherapy with carboplatine (AUC 5) and paclitaxel (80 mg/m2), a first infusion of bisphosphonates (4 mg acid zoledronic), and analgesics.\nGiven the pending risk of fracture and severe pain, the decision was taken in a multidisciplinary consultation to stabilize the pelvis before continuing systemic treatment and to attempt percutaneous osteosynthesis rather than open surgery because of the comorbidities and risk of complications with extensive surgery. Extension of the bone destruction to the sacral wing and anterior acetabulum precluded the use of the locked and perforated nail recently described to reinforce the arcuateiliac line []. Therefore, a combination of double screwing and cementoplasty was planned to restore weight-bearing force transmission from the spine to the hip.\nThe first step of the procedure consisted of percutaneous double osteosynthesis with two perpendicular screws. The optimal position and dimensions of the screws were determined from 3D CT-scan reformations of the pelvis.

    "cleaned_text": "a 66-year-old man with a history of infiltrative vesical carcinoma treated with intravesical immunotherapy 13 years previously was referred for recent-onset pain in the pelvic girdle. pain was assessed by a visual analog scale (vas) at 8/10 and was much increased with walking, which was limited to a short distance and required the use of a crutch. ct revealed extensive osteolytic metastasis involving almost all the right iliac wing and acetabulum together with the right sacral wing (\n). bone scintigraphy and 18f-fdg pet/ct revealed multiple other skeletal lesions. biopsy of the pelvic bone revealed an epidermoid carcinoma. a vesical biopsy gave negative results, but because the prostate was clinically enlarged and the prostate-specific antigen level was increased (5 ng/ml), a prostate biopsy was performed and revealed epidermoid urothelial tumoral infiltration. the patient received a first course of systemic chemotherapy with carboplatine (auc 5) and paclitaxel (80 mg/m2), a first infusion of bisphosphonates (4 mg acid zoledronic), and analgesics.\ngiven the pending risk of fracture and severe pain, the decision was taken in a multidisciplinary consultation to stabilize the pelvis before continuing systemic treatment and to attempt percutaneous osteosynthesis rather than open surgery because of the comorbidities and risk of complications with extensive surgery. extension of the bone destruction to the sacral wing and anterior acetabulum precluded the use of the locked and perforated nail recently described to reinforce the arcuateiliac line []. therefore, a combination of double screwing and cementoplasty was planned to restore weight-bearing force transmission from the spine to the hip.\nthe first step of the procedure consisted of percutaneous double osteosynthesis with two perpendicular screws. the optimal position and dimensions of the screws were determined from 3d ct-scan reformations of the pelvis. the percutaneous osteosynthesis procedure was performed under ct guidance with the patient in the prone position under general anesthesia. skin incisions were made below the posterior superior iliac spine and laterally",

    "original_text": "A 58 year-old male presented to a community hospital with an acute onset of right lower quadrant pain and tenderness over McBurney\u2019s point. The patient had a known history of T4N2c squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. The patient had previously failed induction chemotherapy and underwent a laryngopharyngectomy with bilateral neck dissection and pectoralis major flap five and a half months prior to presentation, which was followed by postoperative radiation and chemotherapy.\nAn ultrasound performed at the hospital of presentation confirmed suspicion of acute appendicitis. Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated white blood cell count, a normal lactate and were otherwise unremarkable. The patient was accepted for transfer to our institution for a planned laparoscopic appendectomy for which he was taken to the operating room upon confirmation of his clinical findings.\nUpon laparoscopy, visualization of the appendix was limited by inflammation of the cecum and ileocecal junction and so conversion to an open procedure occurred through a midline incision. A perforated tumor of the distal ileum was quickly revealed for which a formal right hemicolectomy was performed. The abdomen was irrigated with normal saline before closure.Pathological gross examination confirmed a 4 cm transmural perforation in the terminal ileum, with an ill-defined nodular area at its distal edge. There was also an area of thicker serosal exudate around the tip of the appendix. Microscopy demonstrated deposits of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the muscle wall of the terminal ileum (Figure ) and the mesoappendix. Degenerating tumor cells were within the ileal perforation tract (Figure ). There was no appendicitis or appendiceal perforation. Metastatic carcinoma was also found in a separate nodule from the abdominal wall.\nThe patient survived the procedure and post-operative period which was uncomplicated. He received a targeted EGFR inhibitor and was symptom free. Unfortunately, the patient was readmitted to hospital within five months with widespread metastases and pneumonia. He died shortly thereafter secondary to respiratory failure.",
