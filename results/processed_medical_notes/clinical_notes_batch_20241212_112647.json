Before the colectomy, she had been found to have a tumor measuring approximately 25 mm in the left lobe of the thyroid that was diagnosed as an adenomatous goiter by fine-needle aspiration. Two years after her surgery, a 6-month follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan revealed enlargement of the thyroid tumor, but she remained asymptomatic. Blood tests revealed a small increase in CA 19-9 (from 3.5 ng/ml 6 months earlier to 8.9 ng/ml) and in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (from 1.7 ng/ml to 4.6 ng/ml). Her thyroid function tests were normal. Physical examination and laryngoscopy revealed a firm elastic nodule in the thyroid gland and left vocal fold paralyzed in the midline position.

Ultrasonographic examination of the neck revealed a solid tumor in the left thyroid lobe with a diameter of 35 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 20 mm.

As recommended by the American College of Surgeons,[] his treatment followed the Advanced Trauma Life Support Management of severe brain injury protocol. A neurological examination revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 6 and left anisocoria. He underwent brain computerized tomography (CT) that showed left hemispheric swelling associated with a temporo-parietal linear fracture and an acute subdural hemorrhage.\nHe was immediately transferred to the operating room and, after balanced standard general anesthesia, he received a left question mark incision and a fronto-temporo-parietal craniectomy. After a durotomy and acute subdural drainage, he underwent dura mater reconstruction using galea aponeurotica. After standard subcutaneous tissue and skin closures, the extracted bone flap was bisected via osteotomy and both parts were subcutaneously stored in his left abdomen.\nImmediately after the procedure, the patient underwent postoperative CT scanning before his intensive care unit (ICU) admission. This revealed an acute epidural hematoma, so he was returned to operating room for further neurosurgery. After standard balanced general anesthesia, the question mark incision was reopened and the hematoma was removed. No active bleeding site was identified. After careful hemostasis, the skin flap was sutured shut, and the patient was transferred to the ICU.\nBecause the patient presented diffuse brain edema, he was postoperatively sedated for 2 days, at which point CT scanning confirmed that his condition had improved. However, he was mildly sedated during the time of extubation. He developed pneumonia due mechanical ventilation, so he was tracheostomized and discharged from ICU without mechanical ventilation.

On arrival to the ED, the patient was managed according to the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol. The left lower limb was grossly shortened and externally rotated (Figure ). Swelling was noted in the left hip and thigh region. Tenderness was present near the hip joint and movements were painful. An abrasion of approximately 10 cm x 15 cm was present over the medial aspect of the left thigh. The neurovascular status was normal. Standard radiographs showed an anterior dislocation of the hip with an intra-articular bone fragment (Figure ). After stabilizing the vitals, the patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the pelvis, with both hips, which showed an anteriorly dislocated femoral head lying externally rotated in relation to the superolateral aspect of the acetabulum. In addition, a displaced posterior wall fracture fragment was found within the acetabulum and a separate anterior wall fracture was noted (Figure ). The patient was immediately rushed to the operation theater after consenting for both closed and open reduction. After general anesthesia, closed reduction was attempted by the Allis method under image guidance.

He had no medical history and was not taking any medication. His lower third molar in the right side was removed due to pericoronitis under local anesthesia by a family dentist in January 2018. The tooth was partially and horizontally impacted (Pell and Gregory Class I, position A) (). The method of the extraction involved local anesthesia administration, surgical incision, elevation of a mucoperiosteal flap, ostectomy, tooth sectioning, dislocation, curettage of granulation tissue, irrigation with saline, and suturing. The surgical procedure was uneventful, and he was administered amoxicillin for 3 days. At 7 days after the procedure, he only had mild postoperative pain and had no paresthesia of the lower lip and mental region, as confirmed by his family dentist. At 23 days after the procedure, when the patient was chewing an innards stew, he heard a cracking sound from his right mandible and felt mild pain, and his right masseteric region began to swell. The dentist found no abnormalities on his occlusion and panoramic radiograph. However, he was placed on a soft diet; to make matters worse, he had paresthesia of his lower lip and mental region in the right side in addition to worsening of the pain and swelling at 42 days after the procedure.

    "original_text": "A 72-year-old man with a history of anteroseptal acute myocardial infarction was admitted to our hospital with acute heart failure. He underwent left ventricular (LV) reconstruction due to LV aneurysm, coronary artery bypass grafting from the left internal thoracic artery to the left anterior descending artery, mitral valvuloplasty with artificial ring for moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid valvuloplasty with artificial ring 18 months earlier. On admission, his blood pressure was 86/55 mmHg, heart rate was 60 b.p.m., and a visible apex beat was present at the 6th left intercostal space just medial to the left mid-clavicular line (, Video S1). Computed tomography revealed a pseudoaneurysm with mild calcification, protruding outside the thorax around the apex of the heart (Figure ). Echocardiogram showed akinesis of the anteroseptal wall and a 40 \u00d7 27-mm pseudoaneurysm around the apex of the heart, moving in synchrony with the heartbeat, and a 17% LV ejection fraction (Figure , , Video S2). The connection was confirmed between the pseudoaneurysm and the left ventricle with a spontaneous echo contrast. An underlying infection could have contributed to the formation of the pseudoaneurysm. We theorize that as the pseudoaneurysm progressed, the tissue along its path of progression was mechanically damaged. This gradual damage could have resulted in impaired structural integrity of the surrounding tissue which ultimately allowed certain segments of the heart to protrude into regions beyond the normal anatomical confines of the heart.

She was unable to stand still and constantly shifted her lower extremities to maintain her balance. In the past, she had been admitted at the authors\u2019 hospital with chronic wounds, an osteomyelitis of the calcaneus, a distal femoral fracture, and multiple episodes of septicemia. On this occasion, she was admitted to the hospital with a grade I open tibia fracture after a fall from a small height. Routine plain radiographs showed a dislocated tibia and fibula fracture (Figure ). She was admitted, and because of her known neuropathy and problems with tissue and fracture healing in the past, an open reduction and internal fixation with plate osteosynthesis as well as soft tissue coverage combined with an external fixateur and cast therapy were performed to maintain maximal stability, allowing the possibility of full weight-bearing in the post-operative period (Figures a and b). To prevent full weight-bearing, a wheelchair was ordered and the family was instructed regarding her post-operative care.\nProphylactic antibiotic therapy with cefuroxime was prescribed for seven days. As expected, the girl\u2019s disease \u2013 that is, her hyperactivity and her habit of permanently shifting her leg to maintain balance \u2013 prevented her from following the post-operative instructions. Because of a broken cast and the consequent instability, the primary cast had to be restored four days after the operation.\nThe remainder of her recovery was uneventful, and she was discharged without signs of infection. However, her care was complicated by her continual manipulation of the wound, such as scratching and bouncing at the external fixateur.

All her previous pregnancies had resulted in healthy live births at term by vaginal delivery. This pregnancy had been conceived naturally, and she had not been detected to be hypertensive or diabetic. Furthermore, there was no history of consanguinity with her husband.\nThe USG revealed an MCDA twin pregnancy with discordant growth (28%) of the twins. One fetus was detected to have left hypoplastic heart, with a single umbilical artery, the absence of the kidney and bladder, and lower extremity deformities with an absence of feet. The other fetus was observed to have a normal growth and biophysical profile. The placentas appeared fused in the posterior uterine wall with barely detectable dividing membranes. The amniotic fluid index was grossly normal for both fetuses. Fetal echocardiography was performed and revealed hypoplastic left heart, transposition of the great arteries (TGA), and pulmonary atresia.\nThe patient and her husband were informed regarding the poor prognosis of the anomalous twin fetus. At 36 weeks of gestation, after antenatal steroid coverage, an elective caesarean section was performed for the patient in view of the MCDA twin with malposition of the first twin in accordance with the hospital protocol.\nThe neonate was born with severe growth restriction with a weight of 1300 gm and cyanosed with a poor Apgar score. As a result, soon after the delivery, it was shifted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

After cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the ventricular fibrillation (VF) had returned to a normal sinus rhythm using a single shock from an automated external defibrillator.\nNo abnormalities were noted in the electrolyte blood test results, 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG), or cardiac echography, and she recovered adequately normal conscious level after hypothermia therapy. The coronary angiography was normal, no spasms were observed during the acetylcholine loading test, and no abnormalities were observed in the 12-lead ECG under pilsicainide and epinephrine loading. She was diagnosed with idiopathic VF.\nAs no episodes of ventricular tachycardia or bradycardia were observed, we judged that implantation of an S-ICD was suitable for secondary prevention. In the DFT testing during the procedure, VF was induced with 50 Hz burst pacing and was successfully detected. However, VF was not terminated with a 65 J shock by the S-ICD whose vector was coil to generator, but was successfully terminated with a 200 J shock using an external defibrillator. After the DFT testing, we confirmed high shock impedance (138 \u03a9). The DFT testing was repeated, but the results were confirmed to be the same.\nTo investigate the cause of the high shock impedance and high DFT, we used fluoroscopy to check the lead position in the right anterior oblique (RAO) 70-degree view, which revealed a space between the lead and the sternum (Figure ). We suspected the reason for the high shock impedance and high DFT was due to fat between the lead and sternum, so we repositioned the lead to the depth just above the sternum at parasternal position. The shock impedance and DFT were retested, and the impedance had decreased to a normal value (68 \u03a9), and the induced VF was terminated with the first 65 J shock by the",

There was portal fibrosis without bridging formation or cirrhosis in the adjacent liver (ISHAK fibrosis score 1\u20132/6). Liver function tests were normal at this time. The mass had a well-defined capsule which enhanced on equilibrium phase images. There was no evidence of hepatic or portal venous invasion.

Final surgical pathology revealed adenoid cystic carcinoma, and he subsequently underwent bilateral lateral rhinotomies, resection of skull base tumor including nasal bones, frontal process of the maxilla, and nasal septum. After intraoperative evaluation of the defect, the defect was reconstructed with a pedicled mucosal lining flap, split calvarial bone graft, and paramedian forehead flap.\nThe design of the paramedian forehead flap was based on a paper template that was created from the defect. A Doppler probe was used to identify the course of the right supratrochlear vessels (). The flap was raised from distal to proximal, first in the supra-periosteal plane, and then the subperiosteal plane beginning 1 cm above the orbital rim. The flap was then transposed into the defect and sutured in place with interrupted sutures (). The forehead defect was closed primarily; however, due to tension on the skin edges, a small portion was left to heal by secondary intention.\nThe patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and 28 days following the first stage, he returned to the operating room for pedicle division and flap inset. Prior to division of the pedicle, perfusion of the flap was assessed using the LifeCell SpyElite System. The pedicle was compressed with both a Penrose drain and a forcep. A 10-mg dose of ICG was administered intravenously and images were captured with the SpyElite System (). (There is not currently a consensus as to the dose of ICG that should be administered. The dose chosen was arrived at through discussion with LifeCell representatives as well as extrapolation from previous usage in other reconstructive efforts). Fluorescence was observed throughout the flap and division and inset were performed. A second 10-mg dose of ICG was administered intravenously after inset (23 minutes after the first dose was given) to confirm perfusion",

Parents had noticed the torticollis since a few weeks earlier, but they reported that limping had begun since 3 years earlier and had become worse throughout the years. Conception was natural and the pregnancy was uncomplicated. Patient was born on 39 weeks of gestation, by caesarian section. Fetal ultrasound was reported as normal in the first and the second trimesters. IUGR and oligohydramnios were detected only one week prior to birth. Birth weight was 2250 g (<10th weight for gestational age percentile). Apgar score was 8 at 5 and 9 at 10 minutes. There were no respiratory, neurologic, metabolic, or infectious complications at neonatal and infantile period. The patient and her parents denied the history of any drug consumption or abuse. She suffered from failure to thrive with sparing of her head circumference. Her neurological development had been within normal limits initially but the parents reported that their daughter had become less and less communicative gradually over the years. She had developed a slurred speech and recently had much difficulty in performing the school tasks. She also suffered from limping which the parents thought it to be because of right lower limb weakness. Due to poor control over right hand, especially during writing, she had become an obligatorily left handed. Two weeks before her admission in our hospital, she developed an acute-onset, nontraumatic left-sided neck deviation. On admission, physical examination revealed a girl with a weight of 19 kg (standard deviation score (SDS) = \u22123.7), a height of 125 cm (SDS = \u22122.6), head circumference of 57 cm (within normal range for age and gender).

Physical examination revealed that the patient's height was 100 cm, weight 16 kg, and she had loose inelastic skin hanging in folds. Her face appeared like that of an elderly woman (fig. ). Loose and sagging skin folded over the neck, arm, and trunk, which gave her a prematurely senile appearance with her skin displaying obvious relaxation and elasticity (fig. ). The thyroid was not enlarged. Her father also had skin hanging in folds over his abdomen (fig. ). Further examination after admission revealed a normal electrocardiogram and chest X-ray. Radiological investigation of the hand wrist bone showed a markedly delayed bone age. Laboratory values revealed normal values for complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, routine urine analysis, blood biochemistry, hepatic enzymes, and serum electrophoresis. Serologic tests for syphilis (RPR, TPPA) were negative. Skin biopsy specimens taken from the involved area were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Weigert stains. Histological findings from the skin biopsy revealed a dermal collagen fiber glass-like swelling and perivascular lymphocyte infiltration. Elastic fiber staining showed that the elastic fibers present were fragmented, arranged in disorder, and had a granular appearance (fig. ). By contrast, the collagen structure, content, and distribution were normal (fig. ). Because of the growth delay, the thyroid functions were tested and revealed FT3 7.71 mmol",

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen indicated chronic calcific pancreatitis with splenic vein thrombosis, multiple splenic abscesses with evidence of rupture and ascites, and bilateral pleural effusion with basal lung collapse. Blood culture report showed the presence of B. pseudomallei, which was sensitive to imipenem and aminoglycosides, and so the patient was put on antibiotics. A few days through the course of treatment, the patient complained of low back pain. Clinical examination revealed tenderness at the bilateral sacroiliac joints with no neurological deficit.

Preoperative laboratories revealed an elevated total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Serum tumor marker analysis revealed a normal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) but an elevated CA 19-9. The patient underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography that revealed thickening of the proximal common bile duct with proximal biliary dilatation and an absence of distant disease. Incidentally noted on the MRI was that the third portion of the duodenum did not cross to the left of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and the majority of the small intestine lies in the patient's right abdomen, whereas the large intestine lies in the left. Also, the SMA lies to the right of the SMV consistent with gastrointestinal malrotation (). The patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiography with biliary endoprosthesis placement for decompression. Upon surgical exploration, a mass was identified in the proximal common bile duct (with no evidence of disseminated disease) and gastrointestinal malrotation was confirmed. Oncological resection of the extrahepatic biliary tree was performed from the level of the bifurcation of the right and left hepatic ducts to the intrapancreatic portion of the bile duct, along with a portal lymphadenectomy. A biliary enteric reconstruction was created with a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. To compensate for the malrotation, the proximal jejunum was divided 50 cm distal to where the duodenum exited the retroperitoneum and the 50 cm Roux limb was brought up in a right paracolic position rather easily, as the hepatic flexure of the colon was absent, such that it simply rested over the top of the duodenum.

    "original_text": "A 21-year-old male presented to our emergency department (ED) following a high-velocity road traffic accident (RTA), sustaining an injury to his left hip. While riding his motorcycle, he lost control of his bike and fell on his left hip. Immediately, he felt severe pain in the left hip and was unable to bear weight over the left hip. On arrival to the ED, the patient was managed according to the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol. The left lower limb was grossly shortened and externally rotated (Figure ). Swelling was noted in the left hip and thigh region. Tenderness was present near the hip joint and movements were painful. An abrasion of approximately 10 cm x 15 cm was present over the medial aspect of the left thigh. The neurovascular status was normal. Standard radiographs showed an anterior dislocation of the hip with an intra-articular bone fragment (Figure ). After stabilizing the vitals, the patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the pelvis, with both hips, which showed an anteriorly dislocated femoral head lying externally rotated in relation to the superolateral aspect of the acetabulum. In addition, a displaced posterior wall fracture fragment was found within the acetabulum and a separate anterior wall fracture was noted (Figure ). The patient was immediately rushed to the operation theater after consenting for both closed and open reduction. After general anesthesia, closed reduction was attempted by the Allis method under image guidance. The femoral head could not be displaced from its position despite three attempts and a decision was made to proceed with open reduction using the Smith-Peterson approach.

Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a nodule on the side of the left lower lobe or posterior mediastinum (A). The patient's medical history showed that he had multiple rib fractures and traumatic left hemopneumothorax due to falls 17 months before the first visit to our hospital. In addition, he had undergone chest tube insertion at another hospital. Three days after insertion of that tube, there was no leakage, and the amount of daily drainage was decreasing. Chest X-ray revealed improvement in the left hemothorax and the chest tube was removed. At this point, he had evidence of left lower pulmonary lobe contusion; however, no nodule was identified.\nContrast-enhanced chest CT of our hospital revealed a nodule in the left lower lobe (S10). The nodule was 27 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 16 mm in size and was elliptical with well-defined margins. It showed no contrast effect (B). Furthermore, 18F-fluorodexyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT) revealed a little uptake (the maximum standardized uptake value = 1.66) in the lesion (). Chest CT performed 4 months after the first visit showed that nodule size had not changed. The patient had no history of malignancy, making a metastatic tumor unlikely. Taking the shape of the nodule and his history together, we suggested that the differential diagnosis was a benign lung tumor, a neurogenic tumor in the posterior mediastinum, a low-grade malignant tumor such as a pulmonary carcinoid. The resection surgery for diagnostic treatment was planned to rule out a malignant tumor.\nPartial resection of the left lower lobe was performed by thoracoscopic surgery.

General physical examination and systemic examination were normal. Blood workup showed anemia. Renal function and liver functions were within normal limits. An ultrasound showed a polypoidal mass attached to the anterior wall of the bladder of 7 \u00d7 5 cm in size, which was further confirmed by a contrast enhanced CT scan (CECT) of abdomen. There was no evidence of lymph node or visceral metastasis. Transurethral resection of the bladder mass was performed. The upper gastrointestinal tract (GI) and lower GI endoscopy was within normal limits. A bone scan did not show any skeletal metastasis. Thereafter, the patient underwent robot assisted partial cystectomy and bilateral lymph node dissection till aortic bifurcation. The histopathology was suggestive of a high-grade urothelial carcinoma with six out of seven nodes showing metastasis. Post operatively, the patient developed fever and intestinal obstruction, initially managed conservatively, however, the patient did not show improvement. A repeat CECT abdomen was done which showed soft tissue lesions in both lungs, with pleural effusion, multiple liver lesions and ascites, suggestive of disseminated metastasis. The patient's general condition deteriorated, and he subsequently succumbed to his disease. An overview of the medical disease history is illustrated in a timeline (). Photomicrographs of the tumor from the urinary bladder showed a high-grade urothelial carcinoma with plenty of large pleomorphic cells and infiltrating the detrusor muscle ().\nWhole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis of the paired tumor-normal sample from the patient was performed.

The pain had been treated with analgesics. The patient had had a traffic accident seven years previously. After the accident, in the emergency room, he had undergone drainage to the right side of the thorax because of pleural effusion and the splinting of his upper arm due to a humerus fracture on the same side. An abdominal ultrasound examination, at that time, had confirmed no evidence of organ injury.\nOn arrival at the emergency department, the presence of gallstones was suspected, but none of the preclinical results supported this diagnosis. He was afebrile; his abdomen was inflated and insensitive to palpation. All laboratory results were within normal limits except for leucocytosis. The initial chest X-ray showed elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, an infiltrative shadow in the basal lobe of his right lung, and multiple radiolucencies over his right hemithorax (Figure ). The stones in the gallbladder were invisible. Black pigment or mixed gallstones may contain sufficient calcium to appear radiopaque on plain films. Only 15 to 20 percent of gallstones are visible on simple radiographs [].\nThe definite diagnosis was made through a thoracic-abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, which revealed intrathoracic displacement of his liver and part of the colon, and his gallbladder with regular walls and with three 17mm stones around its neck (Figures and ).\nThe patient underwent surgical intervention via an abdominal approach.

    "original_text": "A 63-year-old male presented with a history of progressive abdominal distension and abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 28\u00d720 cm fatty mass expanding the right retroperitoneum, extending from the subhepatic space into the right pelvis, and displacing the kidney superiorly. Inferiorly there was a 12\u00d711 cm solid, focally calcified component and a 5 cm solid nodule invading mesenteric fat and containing soft tissue stranding, as well as several smaller peripheral solid soft tissue nodules. There was no evidence of disease elsewhere in the chest, abdomen or pelvis. The radiological impression was of a large right-sided retroperitoneal well-differentiated liposarcoma with multiple dedifferentiated components. At laparotomy, the retroperitoneal mass was completely resected with en bloc resection including a right nephrectomy. Microscopic margins were negative.\nTwo years following primary tumor resection, follow-up imaging detected multifocal recurrence in the retroperitoneum and in the lungs, complicated with thrombus within the inferior vena cava and left femoral vein. The patient underwent sequential chemotherapy (prolonged infusional ifosfamide) and high-dose palliative radiotherapy to the retroperitoneal and tumor bed masses.

The ocular evaluation revealed a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/ 20 in the right eye and 20/ 80 in the left eye, with severe anterior chamber inflammation and hypopyon. There was a mild spillover inflammation seen in the vitreous cavity but third order vessels in the fundus could be visualized.\nThe patient was started on intense topical steroids and cycloplegics. All routine systemic investigations including HLA-B27, and X-ray sacroiliac joint were done. He was found to be HLA-B27 positive by deoxyribonucleic acid based molecular method: single specific primer- polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Over the next three days, the anterior segment inflammation considerably reduced, with the resolution of the hypopyon, but the patient noticed profound diminution of vision in the same eye, dropping to 20/ 400. The examination of the left eye revealed intense vitritis with media clarity decreased to Grade III, with the optic disc and vessels being faintly visible (), and optical coherence tomograph (OCT) showing macular fold and gross macular thickening. He was started on a high dose of oral steroids (1.5mg/ Kg body weight) in order to control the inflammation over the next one week, but the posterior segment inflammation persisted.

The PVCs were relatively narrow and the morphology of the PVCs was consistent with an incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) pattern causing confusion with an RBBB aberrancy. Notably, depending on the coupling interval of the PVC to the preceding sinus QRS complex, the degree of the RBBB pattern changed. As the preceding coupling interval shortened, the terminal R wave in lead V1 became progressively augmented with a progressive QRS widening, but the most augmented PVC (Figure , sixth beat) did not exceed 120 ms. This phenomena might have suggested the involvement of the proximal left ventricular (LV) conduction system in producing the PVC, which was likely due to the development of the coupling interval dependent RBB aberrant conduction.\nThe PVC with an RBBB pattern and suspicious involvement of the proximal LV conduction system, lead us to preferentially map the LV. Thus we placed a mapping catheter on the LV septum via a retrograde aortic approach to record the left bundle branch (LBB) potential. The baseline EGM recording from the mapping catheter revealed that the PVCs were preceded by a fascicular potential (FP), and following that by the ventricular depolarizations (Figure A, second beat). In the sinus QRS complex, the activation sequence of the FP preceded from proximal to distal, and the FP to ventricular interval recorded from the proximal and distal bipolar electrode pairs were 37 and 32 ms, respectively (Figure A, first beat), suggesting that the FP recorded from the mapping catheter was likely to be the LBB potential. During the PVC, the activation timing of the LBB potential recorded from the proximal",
