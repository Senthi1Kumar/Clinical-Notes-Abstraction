In her hospital room at 3 hours postoperative, however, the outflow from the drain was 1290 grams, her blood pressure decreased, and she had disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She was given a blood transfusion and was treated for DIC. After a few days, she recovered from the DIC, but she developed an infection on the prosthesis. Based on culture tests, she was diagnosed as having a pseudomonas infection. At this point, she was transferred to our hospital for treatment of the infection. In our hospital, we noted that her surgical wound appeared red and swollen. Her blood tests showed C-reactive protein at 7.5 mg/dL and a white blood cell count at 9.8 103/\u03bc. Her coagulation tests did not show abnormal values with an activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) at 31.2 sec and a prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PTINR) at 1.19.

The bulk of the calcification was at the periphery of the lesion with relative sparing of the central elements. 8-mg dexamethasone was administered intravenously prior to transfer to a tertiary centre where an MRI of the brain was undertaken. This showed a left extra-axial parafalcine mass compressing the pre- and postcentral gyri and abutting the paracentral lobule. It was isointense to cortex on T2 weighted images with hypointense peripheral component corresponding to areas of calcification. The mass demonstrated peripheral enhancement and an enhancing dural tail. There was no evidence of restricted diffusion.

The patient had a history of hypertension for 10 years, and the highest reported blood pressure was 170/100 mmHg. He was treated with nifedipine and carvedilol for a long period of time, and his blood pressure was not well controlled. He also had a history of cerebral infarction for 6 years that resulted in paralysis of the left limbs. The patient had renal dysfunction for more than 7 months and had undergone regular dialysis treatment. An aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA) examination upon admission showed calcified plaques scattered throughout the aorta and DeBakey type II dissection of the ascending aorta involving the right innominate artery, accompanied by cardiac tamponade (Fig. a). Cardiac ultrasound showed pericardial tamponade, ascending aorta dilation, a floating intima 2 cm above the junction of the sinus tube, and no aortic valve regurgitation. The patient underwent emergency aortic root repair, ascending aorta replacement, and hemiarch replacement as well as the placement of a right innominate artery graft.\nThe right femoral artery was separated via a right inguinal incision.

Celiac axis lymph nodes were negative, and the patient underwent the Whipple procedure.\nA year later, the patient reported having persistent headaches, which started ~3 months prior to visit. She had also reported having vertical diplopia on upward gaze. CT of the head and sinuses was taken, which revealed a 2.2 cm circumscribed mass of the left ethmoid sinus.

He had neither a past history nor a family history of pancreatic cancer. Laboratory examination revealed the serum carcinoembryonic antigen and the carbohydrate antigen 19-9 were within normal limits. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a dilated main pancreatic duct with an enhanced mural nodule (30 mm in diameter) in the pancreas body (). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) showed a 10-mm dilated main pancreatic duct and mural nodule in the body, while the main pancreatic duct in the head was intact (,). During the duodenoscopy, the main duodenal papilla was intact (). The patient had undergone distal pancreatectomy (,) based on the imaging findings, suggesting the malignant potential of the IPMNs []. The histological diagnosis revealed IPMN, high-grade, pancreatobiliary type (,). In the immunohistochemical analysis, the tumor cells were positive for MUC1, negative for MUC2 and positive for MUC5AC (-), supporting pancreatobiliary type.

The rest of her medical history was not significant. The patient was initially treated conservatively with medication and rest. However, the pain gradually worsened, and began to be apparent even at rest. At this stage (about 6 months after her initial presentation), the patient was referred to our clinic for further treatment.\nDuring the physical examination, the patient reported tenderness in the region of the navicular bone in her left foot, but there was no palpable mass in this area, and the temperature of the skin over the navicular bone was normal. The patient was unable to bear weight on her left foot, and the motor function of the foot was difficult to assess because of the pain.\nAnteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the left foot were taken, which showed an expansile lesion of the navicular bone without periosteal reaction (Figure \nA,B). Computed tomography showed thinning of the cortex, but the talonavicular joint was normal (Figure \nA,B). A technetium-99 m bone scan was also performed, which showed increased uptake of the tracer isolated to the left navicular. Based on the imaging data, the differential diagnosis included giant-cell tumor, aneurysmal bone cyst, and chondroblastoma.\nA biopsy was taken from the lesion. An 18-gauge needle was used to puncture the lesion, and blood was aspirated easily from the lesion. Baseline chest radiography was also performed at this point.

    "original_text": "On June 15, 2009, a 5-yr-old girl presented with a 1-yr history of a slightly tender, solitary pinkish protruding nodule on the dorsum of her left hand. The nodule dimensions were 7 \u00d7 9 mm () and it would bleed easily with a light touch. Under the impression of pyogenic granuloma or spitz nevus, we took punch biopy. The histopathologic findings showed multiple nests of variable size and irregular shape with large spindle or polygonal cells which had amphophilic cytoplasm. Contrary to features of a spitz nevus, there were no mature cells from the surface to the base and common mitosis in the dermis was observed. The Breslow's depth was obviously over 4 mm (). The immunohistochemical staining showed that Melan-A was positive in whole skin level and weakly positive for HMB-45 (). On the basis of these clinical and histological findings, a diagnosis of spitzoid melanoma was made. There was no personal or family history of melanomas and the patient was otherwise in good health.\nOn physical examination, the patient had a palpable left axillary lymph node. The laboratory analysis revealed the patient had 442 IU/L of LDH levels in her blood which was within the high normal range (50-450 IU/L). Gene analysis using multiplex PCR showed negative for B-RAF somatic mutation. Since a palpable left axillary lymph node was present, a metastatic workup by chest computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) scan was also performed. However, in these evaluations, there were no specific signs of distant metastasis. We performed excision biopsy with 2 cm free margin and repaired the defect with a full thickness skin graft.

    "cleaned_text": "on june 15, 2009, a 5-yr-old girl presented with a 1-yr history of a slightly tender, solitary pinkish protruding nodule on the dorsum of her left hand. the nodule dimensions were 7 \u00d7 9 mm () and it would bleed easily with a light touch. under the impression of pyogenic granuloma or spitz nevus, we took punch biopy. the histopathologic findings showed multiple nests of variable size and irregular shape with large spindle or polygonal cells which had amphophilic cytoplasm. contrary to features of a spitz nevus, there were no mature cells from the surface to the base and common mitosis in the dermis was observed. the breslow's depth was obviously over 4 mm (). the immunohistochemical staining showed that melan-a was positive in whole skin level and weakly positive for hmb-45 (). on the basis of these clinical and histological findings, a diagnosis of spitzoid melanoma was made. there was no personal or family history of melanomas and the patient was otherwise in good health.\non physical examination, the patient had a palpable left axillary lymph node. the laboratory analysis revealed the patient had 442 iu/l of ldh levels in her blood which was within the high normal range (50-450 iu/l). gene analysis using multiplex pcr showed negative for b-raf somatic mutation. since a palpable left axillary lymph node was present, a metastatic workup by chest computed tomography (ct) and positron emission tomography/ct (pet/ct) scan was also performed. however, in these evaluations, there were no specific signs of distant metastasis. we performed excision biopsy with 2 cm free margin and repaired the defect with a full thickness skin graft. we checked 3 sentinel lymph nodes on her left axillary area and found that all of them were metastasized. in cooperation with the breast surgeons, complete left axillary lymph nodes were dissected, which showed one of eighteen lymph nodes to be positive (). she received interferon-\u03b12",

Upon analyzing the history, the father in-formed that, the right upper central incisor was not erupted till the age of 2 and the child was taken to the dental clinic. Dental records stated that opperculectomy was done in 51 region following which the tooth erupted. 6 months later the patient developed a small swelling in the gum region in relation to 51. Swelling was gradually increasing in size with the displacement of incisor teeth and associated with pain.\nOn examination, a single well-defined sessile growth was evident on the anterior maxillary region encircling the crown of right upper central incisor (). The size was approximately 4 \u00d7 3 cm anteroposteriorly and mediolaterally protruding between the lips (). Mouth closure was incomplete. Mucosa overlying the growth was erythematous. Palpatory findings include bony hard consistency, fixation to the deep structures, tenderness and bleeding. 51 and 61 were not mobile and no response was elicited on using electronic pulp vitality tester. No evidence of paresthesia on lip and para-oral structures.\nAbove features made us to think, bony sarcoma and odontogenic tumor as possible differential diagnosis.\nMaxillary occlusal view in relation to 51 and 61 region showed well-defined radiopaque mass with numerous specks producing ground - glass appearance between widely displaced 51 and 61. The opaque mass was surrounded by unilocular radiolucency. No evidence of root resorption in relation to 51 and 61.

Aphasia was with sudden onset, lasted 30 min and was followed firstly by progressive right hemibody paraesthesia with cheiro-oral predominance. Then, after complete resolution of the sensory symptoms, she experienced seeing shimmering zigzag lines which gradually increased in her right visual field. Sensory and visual symptoms, gradually settled in a few minutes (about 10 min) and resolved successively after several hours. A typical migraine headache, identical to the patient's usual ones followed, within one hour, the end of these new phenomena. The patient had suffered from regular typical migraine with visual auras since her childhood but she had not experienced other types of auras before. Indeed, she never complained of any sensory nor language disorder during her previous migraine attacks. The presence of language disorders and sensory symptoms was totally new, and unusual for her. In addition, she did not experience any loss of consciousness nor abnormal movements during this episode. The patient was previously healthy but had vascular risk factors (smoking and obesity), and was taking combined oral contraceptive pill. She had no family history of migraine with or without an aura, or history of hemiplegic migraine and she was not taking any medication before except nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the acute treatment of her migraine attacks.\nA non-contrast CT of her brain and CT angiography of the supra-aortic and intracranial arteries were unremarkable. A perfusion CT performed 90 min after onset of the neurological symptoms showed a large area of hypoperfusion (increased mean transit time), in the left temporo-occipital region not restricted to a single vascular territory, without significant cerebral blood volume changes [Figures -].

    "original_text": "A 76-year-old female patient was admitted to our emergency department early in the morning with suspected acute coronary syndrome. The patient had suffered from a major stroke causing Broca's aphasia three months prior to this admission and was referred to us from a nearby neurorehabilitation clinic. Initial ECG showed no signs of acute ischemia, but troponin I levels were about 1000-fold elevated. History taking was complicated by patient's aphasia, but she did not appear to be in acute pain at the time of admission.\nWith a history of heart failure and an implanted single-chamber ICD, the patient was brought to the catheter lab to undergo coronary angiogram, where no culprit lesion could be detected ().\nIn a phone consultation with the rehab clinic's doctor in charge, he described how the patient had multiple episodes of acute chest and back pain with \u201celectrical twitches\u201d for the course of several hours during the past night. Pain medication was administered and the pain interpreted as musculoskeletal but no other diagnostic or therapeutic steps were taken.

He had a history of skin transplantation due to burns, and no significant family or occupational history. The patient\u2019s current medical history included emesis and a heightened emotional state the day before presentation to the Emergency Department. On admission, all vital signs were stable. Abdominal findings were abdominal fullness by palpation, but no myopathic defense.\nAbdominal computed tomography (CT) showed slight intestinal dilation (Fig. a). No abnormal findings were noted on blood biochemical analysis, other than the white blood cell count, C reactive protein levels, and a mild inflammatory response. On admission, a diagnosis of bowel obstruction was made. CT at the time of diagnosis showed an obstruction of the upper right quadrant of the small intestine (Fig. a), while ectopic gastric mucosal scintigraphy revealed abnormal accumulation in agreement with the structure identified by CT (Fig. b).\nThe cause of bowel obstruction was diagnosed as Meckel\u2019s diverticulum; thus, the patient was referred for surgery.\nA small laparotomy was performed by a skin incision of 35-mm length to the center of the navel (Fig. a). Once a lap disk was attached, a laparoscope was inserted to visualize the abdominal cavity. In the right upper quadrant, a structure was identified that protruded from the small intestine approximately 130 cm from the end of the ileum and became a blind end (Fig. b), which was pulled out from the umbilicus to the outside of the peritoneal cavity. The small intestine that includes the structure was partially resected.

The onset of memory loss and the persistence of the previous symptoms led the patient to seek medical attention in a public hospital where she was admitted and blood analysis was performed. The only alteration in the basic blood panel was high blood pressure, with a value of 149/100 mmHg. Pallor was observed in the skin and integuments. Neurological examination only showed cognitive impairment with bradypsychia, disorientation in time and space and difficulty in carrying out simple calculations, with no fever or meningeal signs. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging using gadolinium contrast (NMRI) of the brain revealed multiple bilateral cystic lesions containing varying amounts of fluid (white arrows in Fig. Ab). The lesions were detected in several brain locations: the frontal, temporal and occipital lobes (Fig. Aa-d) and in the supra- and infratentorial zones (Fig. Ba-d).

Cardiotocography showed a reassuring trace and the presence of low intensity uterine contractions. Ultrasound revealed a normal fetus in breech presentation, normal placenta, and normal amniotic fluid volume. On examination the cervix was long and closed and there was no evidence of external bleeding. Maternal hemoglobin at admission was 11.5 g/dL and there were no signs of hypovolemia.\nThe patient was admitted for observation. Subsequent cardiotocography showed a mild fetal tachycardia while uterine contractions remained at low frequency and intensity. However the distressing back pain continued increasing. It just partially ameliorated by sitting and worsened with recumbency. Because of breech presentation, the presence of symptoms and gestational age a Cesarean section was indicated. After laparotomy a moderate hemoperitoneum was seen in the abdominal cavity. No bleeding point was evident. After fetal extraction and deliver of the placenta, the uterus was exteriorized. A bleeding uterine superficial varicocele of about 7 cm was found on the left uterine horn (). Uterine wall was extremely thin at this area. There were numerous and friable bleeding points connecting with the left broad ligament. After a detailed examination of the abdominal cavity no other hemorrhagic area was located.\nFor treatment, local excision was not considered due to the extension of the injured area. Because the patient was hemodynamically stable and had future pregnancy aspirations, hysterectomy was not selected as the first therapeutical option. Surgical artery ligation was rejected because it was not technically possible to do and it is less effective than embolization due to the rich arterial collateral network of the pelvis.

She also endorsed a history of mild dysuria with urinary frequency and urgency at that time. She reported no fever, chills, or sick contacts. She was referred to the emergency department (ED) for further evaluation. She had no past medical history but had arrived in the United States from Pakistan 8 months earlier. Her ED vital signs showed a blood pressure of 103/70 mmHg, a heart rate of 133 beats per minute (bpm), a temperature of 99.9\u00b0F, and a respiratory rate of 16 per minute with an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. The patient was well appearing, and her physical examination was notable for tachycardia, suprapubic tenderness without rebound or guarding, and a pelvic examination with slight bleeding but no uterine tenderness. Her laboratory results showed a leukocytosis of 16.1 K/\u03bcL with 88% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which was considered within the normal range for the second trimester of pregnancy. The remainder of the complete blood count, chemistry panels, and urinalysis were unremarkable.

There was no history of rashes or seizures.\nThe pregnancy course was remarkable only for gestational diabetes and the fact that the mother had a history of vaginal discharges, which was treated as vaginal candidiasis during the last trimester. Group B streprococcus screening on the 37th week of gestation was negative. Similarly, HIV and hepatitis B serology were negative one day prior to delivery. There was no maternal history of genital lesions, vesicles, or ulcers.\nExamination was normal apart from the purulent eye discharge & swelling of the left eye upper eyelid. The eye secretions were yellowish sticky, copious, and profound. Fontanelles were soft & primitive reflexes were present and normal.\nDue to suspicion of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum, a full septic workup was obtained including CBC, blood culture, urine analysis and culture, CSF analysis and culture, and left eye swab for culture and Chlamydia antigen (). He was subsequently started on meningitis dose of Cefotaxime, in addition to Gentamycin ophthalmic drops while waiting for the previous cultures' results.

She reported significant weight loss of 7 kg, but no fever, chills, night sweats, productive cough, headache, dizziness, nausea or vomiting. One year earlier, she had been diagnosed with RA and took oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the first 3 months after the diagnosis. She had no history of tuberculosis or exposure to patients with tuberculosis. There was also no history of trauma to the back or leg and no loss of bowel or bladder function. She worked as a housewife and kept pigeons as pets, which she fed daily.\nOn admission, the patient was in considerable discomfort. She was apyrexial. Cardiac and abdominal examinations were normal, but on examination of the chest inspiratory crepitus was detected in the lower right lung base. Mild tenderness was found in the back around the L4 area and movement of the spine was restricted. Motor examination was normal, with normal power in both legs, but tactile hypoesthesia of the right medial femoral condyle was evident. The straight leg raising test (SLRT) elicited pain at 70\u00b0 on the left and was pain free to 90\u00b0 on the right. The right patellar reflex was normal, but it was diminished on the left. There were no skin nodules.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) undertaken in August 2010 demonstrated osteolytic lesions of the fourth lumbar vertebral body (L4) that involved the left pedicle and transverse process causing secondary spinal canal stenosis at that level (Figure A, B). Moreover, a paravertebral soft tissue mass was seen on both sides that was larger on the left. The intervertebral discs were relatively preserved. Single photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) showed increased uptake of technetium-99 m in the L4 vertebra (Figure ). Routine blood tests revealed: a white blood cell count of 65",

She had a medical history of uncontrolled hypertension for 10 years and was diagnosed with aortic valve stenosis 5 years ago at a local hospital. On physical examination, blood pressure was 170/80 mm Hg in both arms. A systolic ejection murmur was heard at the right upper sternal border. Electrocardiography showed left ventricular hypertrophy and T-wave inversion in the precordial leads. An enlarged cardiac silhouette and rib notching were observed on chest radiography. On echocardiography, severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal left ventricular systolic function were observed. The peak and mean pressure gradient of the aortic valve were estimated at 140 mm Hg and 80 mm Hg, respectively. Therefore, an aortic valve replacement was planned and coronary angiography was performed with aortography for evaluation of chest pain and uncontrolled blood pressure despite antihypertensive drug medication. Coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries, while aortography showed severe stenosis of the descending aorta just below the origin of the left subclavian artery (). We suspected aortic coarctation and computed tomographic angiography was performed. Severe aortic coarctation and compensatory dilatation of the intercostal and internal thoracic arteries were noted (). Ankle-Brachial index was 0.53. The blood pressure was 170/80 mm Hg in both upper arms, and 90/60 mm Hg in the lower extremities. The patient underwent a single-stage correction of the coarctation and aortic valve stenosis.

He ended up transferring from one department to another department since his condition did not improve at all during treatment due to constant and severe pain after the amputation surgery. We could not find any specific findings in this medical history. He kept complaining about cramping pain on his removed arm and electric-like pain occurring once every few minutes. He also said that he felt the entire shape of his removed arm, and it was medially rotated. Every day, he was prescribed gabapentine (2,400 mg), oxycodon (200 mg), and amitriptyline (25 mg), with other medications to control the pain. However, the degree of his pain relief was somewhat insignificant and the visual analog scale (VAS) was 8-10 out of 10. Other treatment methods, such as stellate ganglion block, thoracic sympathetic ganglion block, brachial plexus block, cervical transforaminal epidural block, and a subcutaneous infusion of ketamine, were also done. However, they gave the patient only short-term improvement. Lastly, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) was done for the patient, but the treatment effect was very insignificant.\nFinally, we performed mirror therapy for the patient. He had to visit the hospital four times a week and went through a 15-minute treatment period. We had the patient feel the movement of his removed arm and hand just like his normal arm and hand moving through a mirror ().

Past medical history was remarkable for locally advanced right breast infiltrating lobular carcinoma, with a primary mass measuring up to 10 cm (cT3) and positive lymph node involvement (N3 for ipsilateral supraclavicular nodes). Pathology revealed 100% estrogen receptor expression and negative Her2 amplification with histological characteristics of the luminal A phenotype. Given the non-resectable nature of a locally advanced tumor, the patient was started on ribociclib and letrozol, which were started 4 months prior to the onset of the chief complaint. The patient was not taking any other medication.\nAt the first examination 3 weeks prior to the clinical development, the patient reported a new onset of symmetric erythematous plaques along the extensor surface of both upper limbs with further development of tender and brittle lesions with spontaneous sloughing and bleeding. At that time, skin biopsies were obtained, and the patient was put on topical corticosteroids and discharged home. At the time of the next examination, the skin lesions had rapidly relapsed during the past 72 hours and involved the face and lips, both upper and lower limbs, the chest, the back, and the gluteal and perianal regions.

Laryngeal fiberscopic examination showed a large mass with necrosis at the middle of the base of tongue (). Movement of the tongue was normal, but the airway was almost completely blocked (). Palpation of the cervical region did not detect lymphadenopathy. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a 30-mm solid and well-defined mass involving the whole base of tongue (). The sagittal view of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified a 34-mm mass occupying the pharyngeal space with a high intensity signal on T2 sequence and low intensity on T1 (). Emergency tracheotomy was performed under local anesthesia, and biopsy was also performed after management of the airway. Histopathological studies showed differentiation to serous cells, while there was no existing glottal structure or fibrous stroma, and proliferative lesions having an acinous structure were seen. No cellular atypia or nuclear division was observed, but partial surface necrosis and vascular infiltration were seen. PAS staining and PAS digestive staining (i.e., diastase treatment followed by PAS) showed positive staining of the cytoplasm of the tumor cells. Mucicarmine staining was negative, showing zymogen-like granules, not mucinous granules. The findings indicated an epithelial malignant tumor showing an acinar or microcystic pattern of invasive growth, and a diagnosis of an oropharyngeal acinar cell adenocarcinoma was made. Resection of the tumor and conservative neck dissection were performed in Jikei University Hospital. This tumor was resected by pull-through method. The tumor resection resulted in a large deficit, and reconstructive surgery was performed using a rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap.

    "original_text": "A 46 year-old male was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer 30 months earlier. The primary cancer was located in the orifice of the left upper lobe bronchus without metastasis. He was treated with left pneumonectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy along with postoperative radiation therapy and systemic chemotherapy. Eleven months after the surgery, chest CT scans showed recurring mass at the stump of the left main bronchus, which was also confirmed by bronchoscopic biopsy. The patient underwent second and third line systemic chemotherapy, but it was unable to stop the disease from progressing. Approximately four months prior to this visit, he was admitted due to presence of blood-tinged sputum. At that time, a bronchoscopic examination showed that the bleeding was from recurred mass in the left main bronchus.\nHe visited again within several weeks due to dysphagia and recurrent blood-tinged sputum. We performed CT imaging, which depicted progression of a recurred mass at the stump of the left main bronchus.

He had been diagnosed with active PV 3 weeks earlier, for which he had been treated with oral prednisolone for 2 weeks. Because of the only slight improvement of the skin lesions, the patient then was treated by intravenous dexamethasone (5 mg every 6 h) with prophylaxis doses of intravenous cloxacillin (1 g every 6 h) for 1 week during hospitalization. Although there was a significant improvement of the skin lesions, the patient started to report ocular pain and blurred vision in the left eye. The pain, redness, and swelling around the upper and lower eyelids progressed so rapidly that the patient could not open his eye. The vision reduced to light perception in 4-day time. After stepping the antibiotics up to intravenous imipenem (500 mg every 6 h), his symptoms gradually worsened. Then, he was referred to our hospital.\nPhysical examination on admission revealed high body temperature (38.1\u00b0C) as well as skin lesions with multiple discrete flaccid blisters and oval-shaped erosions covered with hemorrhagic crust distributed along the trunk and extremities. Some of the lesions had healed as postinflammatory hyperpigmented patches without evidence of cellulitis or pustules (Fig. ).

He was therefore treated in another hospital with the implantation of a single-chamber T-ICD in the right pectoral side, for secondary prevention.
