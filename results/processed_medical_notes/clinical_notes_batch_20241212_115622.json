The patient mentioned that he predominantly landed on his left lower limb with his left knee in full extension and in external rotation. The patient started complaining of left knee pain limiting his range of motion and ability to bear weight immediately after the fall. He was brought to the Emergency Department (ER) of King Saud Medical City (KSMC) by his parents immediately after the injury. On physical examination, the left knee was profoundly swollen and bruised. There was tenderness over the tibial tuberosity and lateral joint line. He was unable to actively move the knee joint. The passive range of motion was painful. There were no signs indicating compartment syndrome or neurological or vascular injury. X-ray radiographs revealed a Watson-Jones type IIIB avulsion fracture of the tibial tuberosity apophysis (). A CT scan showed a step of the articular surface more than 2 mm extending to the posterior-lateral epiphyseal part of the proximal tibia (lateral tibial plateau) ().\nThe patient was admitted and was prepared for operative management. A procedure was planned and done on a radiolucent table under general anesthesia. A tourniquet was used to avoid excessive bleeding during the procedure. The tourniquet was inflated after pulling down the quadriceps to avoid blocking the reduction due to the extensor mechanism. The leg is prepped and draped according to the standard orthopedic protocol. Anterolateral approach of the knee was used with an incision starting from the lateral upper border of the patella to 10 cm down. Deep fascia was opened anterior to the iliotibial tract. The fracture line was identified; the reduction of the articular step was done using a reduction clamp and assured using a portable image intensifier on flexion and extension of the knee without arthrotomy. We avoided arthrotomy of the joint to not make it vulnerable to infection and possible scarring",

Her history was remarkable for systemic hypertension, dyslipidemia, and chronic persistent asthma. She denied any history of smoking or tobacco product use. She did not have any environmental or professional exposure to agents triggering her asthma. Her asthmatic symptoms dated back to late adolescence and had progressed in severity since then, with significant worsening over the last 3 years. She was steroid dependent for the last 15 months. Despite being on a maintenance dose of 10 mg of prednisolone per day, she used to experience nocturnal symptoms and needed salbutamol inhalations on an average 3-4 times a week. She used to get exacerbations once a month needing hiking up of prednisolone dose to 40 mg per day for 5-7 days. Her detailed evaluation was done in the United States. Her spirometry showed persistent obstructive ventilatory defect. Her compliance to medications was ascertained, inhaler technique was supervised, and medications were optimised. Thyroid abnormalities, gastroesophageal reflux, allergic rhinitis, and vocal cord dysfunction were ruled out by appropriate evaluations. She was obese (BMI 33) with no snoring or excessive daytime sleepiness measured by the Epworth scale. Cardiac function as measured by ECG and 2D ECHO were normal. CT chest showed no parenchymal shadows, bronchiectasis, or mucoid impaction. She had no features of anxiety or depression ascertained during a formal psychology evaluation. Her IgE levels were <10 mg/mL on multiple occasions in the United States as well as during her current evaluation. She was considered for therapy with biological agents (omalizumab) but therapy with this agent was not instituted as her IgE levels were below the range approved for therapy.

There was no enlargement of the lymph nodes in the neck on physical examination, and the color of the skin surface was normal. The mass was located in the left lobe of the thyroid, with an irregular shape, which indicated a malignant tumor. The maximum diameter of the mass was 2.4 cm, detected by ultrasonic examination. Scattered clusters of atypical cohesive epithelioid cells were found in the mass of the thyroid by fine-needle aspiration. The hematoxylin-eosin staining of the specimen, together with frozen section and extensive immunohistochemistry, confirmed a diagnosis of paraganglioma of the thyroid gland with melanocytic differential. The patient underwent a mass excision, and no lesion was found using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Four lymph nodes, which showed no metastatic carcinoma (0 of 4), were isolated from the left neck.\nThe mass specimen was measured to be 3.5 cm \u00d7 2.3 cm \u00d7 2.0 cm. On the cut surface, all the visible area of the tumor was solid without cyst changes, with grayish white or black color, and the margins of the tumor were slightly irregular. Two distinct components were found in the black area of the tumor through microscopic observation. The first component, the majority of the mass, was composed of solid sheets and clusters of cohesive epithelial cells, with no pigment observed in the cytoplasm (, ). The second component comprised cells covered by pigment, with the intercellular substance and structure unclear (, ). The tumor cells in the first component were arranged in a nest-like distribution without any gland cavity.

She reported that she only felt being hit with something hard on her right upper eyelid and the left eye. Following the incident, the umbrella was found on the floor.

On the next day she had severe ocular pain, headaches, and blurred vision in the right eye and she visited our clinic.\nAt presentation the lid wound in her right eye was sutured and the lids were severely swollen. Her vision had diminished to light perception only in her right eye and was 20/200 in the left eye, but she could barely open her right eye because of the severe ocular pain. The eyelids were gently separated and slit-lamp examination revealed an intact globe with moderate mydriasis.

The patient had a previously normal developmental history, up-to-date immunization record including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, and notable past medical history significant for recurrent otitis media due to poor compliance to oral antibiotics, which were subsequently successfully treated with parenteral antibiotics. Upon presentation, the patient recently had a left lower lobe community-acquired pneumonia that was treated with one dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone in the emergency department followed by a standard 10-day course of amoxicillin. The patient's family was instructed to open the capsule and mix the powder with food to improve compliance due to known history of poor palatability with previously prescribed antibiotics. The patient returned to the emergency department two weeks later with worsening of symptoms and was treated with oral cefdinir for unresolved pneumonia. He was subsequently seen in the pulmonology clinic four days later to establish care without acute complaint. He was started on fluticasone/salmeterol and a five-day course of oral prednisolone for management of an acute asthma exacerbation.\nOne month later, the patient presented to the emergency department with fever and increased cough and was diagnosed with right middle lobe pneumonia. He was treated with intramuscular ceftriaxone to be followed with a home course of oral antibiotics, which was reportedly completed. Two weeks later, the patient again presented to the emergency department with recurrent symptoms and diagnosed with right lower lobe pneumonia that failed outpatient treatment. The patient was subsequently admitted to the medical floor and managed with a single dose of intravenous ceftriaxone. He was discharged the following day in stable condition on cefdinir and azithromycin. The patient was to follow-up as an outpatient with his pulmonologist and primary care physician.

It was reported these had been slightly uncomfortable ever since she had received them. Later questioning further revealed that our patient had worn her dentures continuously, even at night, but had not yet returned to her dentist for a follow-up. Her medical history was significant for rheumatic fever as a child, resulting in valvular heart disease for which our patient had mitral and aortic mechanical valve replacements in 1991 and 2002, respectively. Warfarin 5 mg had been initiated to obtain a target INR between 2.5 and 3.5. Our patient also had hypothyroidism, which was being treated with thyroxine replacement therapy. On arrival to the hospital, her full blood count was found to be within the normal range, however her INR was recorded as 5.5. A clinical examination revealed a large, soft, dark red swelling involving the anterior region of the floor of her mouth, indicative of sublingual hematoma. The Wharton's duct of the submandibular gland was distinctly visible on opening (Figure ). As a result of the hematoma, the tongue was displaced superiorly and there was mild limitation of tongue movement. Our patient was acyanotic at the time of admission and on general examination there was no signs of stridor or major airway restriction. Further flexible endoscopic examination did not reveal any edema or obstruction within the pharynx or larynx.\nOn palpitation there were firm, bilateral swellings noted in the submandibular and submental regions.

She was found to have an isolated injury to the left knee. Plain radiographs and computer tomography (CT) scans of the knee showed a lateral split depression type fracture of the tibial plateau (Schatzker type 2), mostly in the anterior portion with a vertical split (Figures and ).

A detailed ligamentous exam in the emergency department was deferred due to the acute injury and the patient's significant discomfort. Based on the physical exam findings, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the knee was indicated. The results of the MRI showed no injury to the anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, medial collateral ligament, or meniscal damage (Figures and ). However, the MRI demonstrated a concomitant injury to the posterolateral corner (Figures \u2013).\nThe patient was taken to the operating room on the first day after her injury. Open reduction and internal fixation was performed through a standard lateral approach to the proximal tibia including a submeniscal arthrotomy.

Her mother stated that she was also unable to close both eyes since birth and there was difficulty in suckling. Her milestones were normal and there was no history of prenatal or postnatal trauma. Her medical history revealed that she had visited a medical hospital previously for augmentation of the upper lip at the age of 15 years and breast augmentation at the age of 18 years. Intelligence quotient (IQ) evaluation revealed normal IQ level of the patient. There was no history of consanguineous marriage between the parents.\nOn general examination, all the vital signs were within normal limits. No abnormality was detected in lower limbs whereas shortening of the index finger was noted in both the upper limbs (). Her sensory functions were normal. She was unable to close both eyes () and raise the eyebrows. There was absence of wrinkles on her forehead (). The patient was neither able to whistle or blow air between her cheeks nor was able to smile. She was not able to completely abduct her eyes and was unable to rotate her eyeballs upwards or downwards and could only partially move it in medial and lateral directions. Other ocular manifestations were the presence of ptosis of the right eye and strabismus. Other facial and intraoral features were wide nasal apertures, incompetent lips (), scar mark over the upper lip and a high-vault palate ().\nBased on history given by the patient and features shown on clinical examination, the case was diagnosed as Mobius syndrome.

These pains would get exacerbated soon after eating and/or taking tea and reduce only after defecation. Moreover, these pains would become worse after eating dosa, chapatti, green vegetables, spicy foods, and using tea or coffee. In order to control pain and associated bowel habits, the patient started eating less (including reduced consumption of vegetables) and would avoid eating several items. He would also avoid going and eating in public places due to the fear of getting abdominal pain and needing to defecate. On a typical day, he would use toilet 5\u20137 times. Over time he started avoiding going to various places, both known or unknown and had stopped travelling due to fear of pain and leakage. Gradually, he became partially house bound with marked impairment in social functioning. He was able to continue working despite abdominal pain and frequent visits to toilet that significantly affected his occupational performance. He used to feel helpless and worried about his gastroenterological condition. There was no past history of physical, neurological or psychiatric illness. Personal history revealed ongoing stressors due to financial losses in the recent past and associated worsening of the symptoms. He had fairly good support from immediate family members including the spouse. There was no family history of psychiatric problems and premorbidly he was noted to be well adjusted.

Laboratory tests for electrolytes, liver and kidney enzymes were within the normal ranges.\nA multislice CT scan with contrast was performed showing the presence of a dissected aneurysm of approximately 8 \u00d7 13 cm with complete obstruction of the abdominal aortic lumen below the renal arteries (, ). The open surgery was performed with the participation of four doctors from the vascular surgery department, an anesthesiologist and a nurse. We used halothane for general anesthesia.

    "original_text": "A 25-year-old gravida 3, para1 was admitted at 19 weeks of pregnancy with a history of vaginal bleeding for 1 week and pain in abdomen. She was told that she had a low lying placenta during her second trimester scan. A lower segment caesarean section for cephalopelvic disproportion was done 2 years back and the baby was alive and well. This was followed by a missed abortion at 8 weeks for which a curettage was done. At admission, her vitals were stable. Uterus was irritable. Hb was 7 gm/dL. Ultrasound done after admission showed a live fetus of 20 weeks and anterior placenta with a thin, bulging, and deficient lower uterine segment. The decidual interface between the placenta and myometrium was partially absent and there were large dilated vessels in the same area. These sonographic features were suggestive of a placenta accreta. Patient continued to bleed; 4 units of blood were crossmatched and injection of methotrexate 50 mg was given intramuscularly on the day of admission. Prophylactic uterine artery embolisation was done on day 2 but the bleeding continued. The next day she was taken up for hysterotomy under general anaesthesia. Entry into peritoneal cavity was difficult because of dense adhesions. There was no hemoperitoneum. Bladder was adherent to the lower uterine segment which was severely deficient.

She had two still births in the past, the details of which are not known. She is not a hypertensive or diabetic. There was no history of any drug intake except for iron and folic acid supplementation. Her routine hematological and biochemical investigations were within normal limits. A routine anomalous scan done at 2nd trimester showed a fetus with features of intrauterine growth retardation along with a large fluid-filled sac in the abdominal region which was compressing the thorax. Both upper and lower extremities were visualized. However, due to oligohydraminos no further comment could be made upon the fetal anatomy. Color flow showed two umbilical arteries along the wall of the cyst. The intraabdominal unilocular cystic mass was assumed to be the urinary bladder and in conjunction with the presence of oligohydraminos and Intrauterine growth retardation a proposed diagnosis of congenital megacystitis or Prune Belly Syndrome was made [Figures and ]. The parents were informed about the diagnosis and after counseling, they opted for termination of pregnancy. The pregnancy was terminated after obtaining the consent, and the abortus was sent for pathological examination.\nAt autopsy, the fetus weighed 75 g and on external examination a number of anomalies were noted. The genitalia were ambiguous. Encephalocoele was seen over the head of the fetus in the occipital region. The most striking abnormality was a left sided anterior abdominal wall defect, from which gastrointestinal organs were protruding. The organs identified included the liver and the intestine.

The patient\u2019s growth and development were within the normal range. Over time, the symptoms of chest tightness worsened, and were accompanied by dizziness and numbness of the extremities.\nThe patient had a history of incomplete abortion one year ago and had been treated with induced abortion.\nThe patient had never smoked and had no family history of heart or lung disease. She had congenital heart disease since childhood without standard treatment. The patient stated that she had a \"cold\" once a month. Symptoms such as shortness of breath and weakness appeared after walking up one flight of stairs and the symptoms were relieved after rest.\nOn admission, her blood pressure was 100/64 mmHg in both arms and her heart rate was approximately 74 bpm. Physical examination revealed that her heart rate was regular, and there was a 3/6 systolic murmur on the aortic second auscultation area. She had cyanotic lips and clubbing of her fingers.\nRoutine laboratory examinations were within normal limits.\nThe patient underwent multimodal imaging. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed that the main pulmonary artery was dilated with a diameter of 54 mm. There was an abnormal passage between the descending aorta and pulmonary artery with an inner diameter of 9 mm. The entire heart was enlarged. The continuity of the ventricular septal outflow tract was interrupted, and the defect size was approximately 14 mm.

The previous multiple evaluations by many specialists in other hospitals did not succeed to give a clear diagnosis and treatment.\nThe patient had no relevant medical history and took no medication, except ACEI that was stopped some months after angioedema onset. No relation with possible allergic stimuli could be identified and she had no clinical manifestations between attacks. Angioedema was painful, not accompanied by urticaria or abdominal symptoms, located variably to neck, arms or buttocks, without facial involvement during 6 years. The attacks occurred at weeks or months intervals and usually lasted between 48 and 72 h, irrespective of corticosteroids and antihistamines treatment usually administered. The frequency of attacks had progressively increased from one at 2\u20133 months intervals to almost weekly during the last year before presentation. The last angioedema attack, determining emergency hospitalization in September 2014, was more severe and prolonged, accompanied for the first time by laryngeal edema and respiratory symptoms. The extended medical evaluation, including complete blood tests for inflammation, allergy, autoimmunity and cancer, were all negative (Table ).

The patient complained of burning-like pain from his left shoulder to left forearm, followed by a vesicular eruption at the same location 10 days prior to admission. The diagnosis of HZ was made by a neurologist. An oral antiviral therapy with acyclovir was administered. Approximately 1 week later, the pain in the left elbow and forearm subsided. However, the patient was unable to elevate his left arm to the shoulder level, and the pain over the left shoulder persisted. Therefore, he visited our neurologic outpatient department where prednisolone (40 mg) was administered 2 times per day. The patient was admitted for further evaluation and management. His medical history included hypertension, coronary artery disease, and benign prostate hyperplasia. There was no history of trauma related to the left shoulder joint, or any systemic illnesses, including diabetes mellitus, cancer, or immunological disorder.\nPhysical examination of the patient revealed hyperpigmented macular lesions from the left shoulder to left forearm (Fig. ) and most of the skin lesions were found on the left shoulder.

All of these symptoms severely affected her daily activities and functionality.\nDuring the last 17 years, she had repeated episodes of neurological deficits. Even before the headache appeared, she has presented with visual impairment of the right eye and right lateral rectus palsy and was treated as retrobulbar neuritis with good response to methylprednisolone.

Figures and are the initial radiographs of the hand and elbow, respectively, showing the extent of the injury.\nThe patient went for emergent washout and exploration by hand surgery.

The thumb was attached via a single flexor tendon and remnant skin. The median nerve was completely severed at the level of the wrist. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the distal radius and the distal ulna was not performed because of a lack of viable soft tissue coverage secondary to the traumatic injury from the blast effect as determined by the hand surgeon intraoperatively. The amputation level was partially based on the level at which viable soft tissue coverage was available for coverage of bone. The hand surgeon proceeded with a transradial amputation.\nClosed reduction of the ulnohumeral joint was performed by the orthopaedic team once hand surgery was done with their part of the procedure. The patient required 90 degrees of flexion at the elbow to maintain reduction due to gross instability. 3D reconstructions from the postreduction computerized tomography (CT) scan are seen in Figures and showing the terrible triad injury of the elbow.\nTwelve days after the initial injury, the patient returned to the operating room for definitive fixation.

His past medical history and family history were unremarkable. Physical examination revealed an elastic hard tumor in the subcutis of his left cheek. The tumor did not adhere to the skin. There was no remarkable abnormality in his oral and nasal cavities. No lymph node swelling was observed in his head and neck. The patient exhibited no neurological deficits. Laboratory data were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a tumor 15 mm \u00d7 7 mm in diameter located anterior to the left masseter muscle, with lower intensity than the muscle on both T1- and T2-weighted images (Figure ). Imaging with a fat-suppression technique revealed slightly higher intensity in the tumor (Figure ). MRI findings were suggestive of a granuloma or a fibroma. The patient underwent local excision of the tumor under regional anesthesia. Grossly a whitish tumor was encapsulated by thin fibrous tissue, and it adhered to the masseter muscle. Postoperative investigation using MRI and positron emission tomography revealed no residual tumor or lymph node metastasis. The final histological diagnosis was ANOS of the accessory parotid gland. As the tumor was close to the surgical margin, we recommended that the patient receives adjuvant radiotherapy, but he did not wish to undergo the therapy. He is alive without recurrence of the disease 3 months after the surgery.\nThe tumor was encapsulated by fibrous tissue but extracapsular invasion was partially observed.

Patient reported suffering from severe pain in right chest, shoulder and diffuse abdominally that worsened with standing. Patient complained of inability to inspire due to pain and a 10-pound weight gain over 2 months. She confirmed decreased appetite especially with solids, nausea and emesis, alternating constipation and diarrhea, bruising, and pruritus at night. Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a peripherally septated 10 x 7 cm cystic mass in the liver with intrahepatic biliary dilation (). The patient was referred for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to establish preoperative biliary anatomy and was found to have moderate compression of the common hepatic duct managed with a right hepatic biliary endoprosthesis (); no obvious communication of the biliary tree with the cystic lesion was seen. Patient symptoms persisted despite optimizing with a protein-rich liquid diet; thus, the decision was made to proceed with the surgical plan for an open partial central hepatectomy. The patient was taken to the operative theater. After induction of general anesthetic, an upper midline incision was made. Inspection of the abdomen and liver showed no metastatic lesions grossly or with ultrasonographic imaging. The cyst was visible upon entry into the abdomen with no solid component to the mass in proximity to the cystic neoplasm. The second portion of the duodenum was adherent to the cyst with inflammatory adhesions and was quite boggy. A partial central hepatectomy was performed; a 3 mm biliary duct was found communicating to the cyst only with no drainage to the minimal liver parenchyma that was removed ().

Twenty days previously, she was found to have a gastric ulcer after having undergone upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in a local clinic. She continued to complain of abdominal discomfort, although she had been taking ulcer medications. On admission, her physical examination findings and laboratory data were unremarkable. A small amount of left pleural effusion was noted on a chest radiograph, and an abdominal radiograph showed no abnormality. Because she had upper respiratory symptoms, including cough, on admission, she had received antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. During her hospital course, a few days after starting the antibiotics, she showed improvement in respiratory symptoms. Symptoms associated with Parkinson disease and other upper respiratory symptoms had been well controlled with an oral antiparkinson drug and oral cough syrups followed by 3-day intravenous antibiotics. She did not report any upper respiratory symptoms, so the pleural effusion was expected to disappear soon.\nUpper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed to evaluate her symptoms. Endoscopic examination demonstrated a slightly elevated lesion (4 cm) with multiple shallow erosions, absence of a definite ulcer scar, and bridging or converging folds over the anterior wall of the antrum (type IIa) ().

His social history revealed that he worked as a gardener, was married with two kids, was a non-smoker, occasionally consumed alcohol and had no history of drug abuse. He gave no history of any psychological illnesses. A physical exam revealed sinus tachycardia, distant heart sounds and elevated jugular venous pressure and a normal blood pressure. Chest X-ray showed an impressive mediastinal enlargement. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a large pericardial effusion (\n) and collapse of the right atrium during diastole along with respirophasic changes consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. The patient underwent an emergent therapeutic pericardiocentesis that yielded hemorrhagic fluid. Cytological analysis of the fluid revealed no malignant cells. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed persistent pericardial effusion and a left anterior mediastinal mass (\n). Work-up for possible metastases performed using Gallium scintigraphy showed no evidence of involvement of any other organs. Left anterior thoracotomy, pericardial window and left anterior mediastinotomy were done, revealing a well-encapsulated gelatinous tumor originating from the pericardium. The tumor grew from the inner surface of the pericardium near the origin of the superior vena cava and ascending aorta (\n). A portion of the pericardium where the tumor was attached was resected and the tumor was biopsied.

The child was brought to the hospital 12 hours after the injury. On examination, he had the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of perception of light and projection of rays in all four quadrants in right eye. The fish hook had penetrated the cornea obliquely, 3 mm away from limbus at 9'0 clock []. Slit-lamp examination of the RE revealed, a shallow irregular anterior chamber filled with exudates due to which tip of fish hook was not clearly visible []. Fundus examination showed no fundal glow. B scan was not done as patient was highly unco-operative for examination. It was penetrating type of open globe injury of grade 4 involving zone 1 in right eye. The left eye was normal.\nThe patient was given inj.Tetanus Toxoid 0.5 cc intramuscular Surgical Technique and started on oral antibiotics and advised for corneal FB removal and corneal tear repair under general anaesthesia. A written consent was obtained from the parents for removal of the fish-hook under general anaesthesia (GA). Under GA, first we tried to remove barbed fish hook with help of forceps through same entry wound but the attempt was failed because of lack of visibility of tip due to exudates filled in irregular anterior chamber and incarceration of iris tissue in the tip. Then we made side port incision at 2 O clock at limbus and anterior chamber tap was taken, then anterior chamber was washed with help of saline and viscoelastic injected [].

The initial brain MRI and computed tomography (CT) scan showed a single cystic mass located in the left basal ganglia with a fluid-fluid level and without peri-lesional edema (). Because the initial brain MRI was performed without enhancement at another hospital, an enhancing nodular lesion or peripheral rim enhancement could not be verified, however no nodular lesion or capsule-like appearance was detected using T2-, T1-weighted MRI. There was no evidence of calcification of the lesion in CT and gradient recalled echo T2-weighted imaging. To rule out vascular diseases, cerebral angiography was performed, which did not demonstrate tumor staining or a vascular malformation (). The first repeat brain MRI with Gadolinium enhancement performed 5 months after the initial brain MRI showed no evidence of peripheral or nodular enhancement. A spherical mass with a diameter of 16 mm had enlarged to 25 mm.

The history of the patient revealed that she suffered from osteoporosis. In her eighties, she had been conservatively treated with a cast for a right wrist fracture. Previously the patient had been treated for four vertebral compression fractures with thoraco-lumbar orthosis. Spine and femur DEXA scan measurements at the time of the vertebral fractures showed T-Score of -4.9 and -3.7, respectively, confirming a severe osteoporosis.\nAfter routine clinical tests, the surgeon chose DHS to treat the pertrochanteric fracture. The operation was performed under general anesthesia, with the patient positioned on a fracture table. The fracture was manually reduced under image intensifier control. Thereafter the surgeon began placing two k-wires into the femoral head through the femoral neck with a lateral skin incision. A complication occurred in this step, as the surgeon found out that the first k-wire had been broken. A second K-wire was positioned. Next the cephalic screw was positioned in the middle of the femoral neck using K-wire to guide the insertion of the dynamic screw. Due to the severe osteoporosis, the surgeon decided to ream only the lateral cortex of the femur to boost the grip strength. The ensuing step was to slide the lateral plate to the cephalic screw until the internal side of the plate was seated on the lateral cortex of the femur.

The patient was otherwise healthy with no significant past medical history, including alcohol, smoking or tobacco abuse.\nA complete head and neck examination revealed a painless, firm and fixed right mandibular mass with no cutaneous inflammatory signs.

The symptoms were aggravated by melena and asthenia that motivated the medical consultation. A clinical examination at admission found a patient with a stable hemodynamic status, an abdominal examination revealed a palpable and mobile pelvic mass. Laboratory tests showed a hypochromic and microcytic anemia with low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels rating at 7.3 g/dL and 21%. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large pelvic mass measuring 11 \u00d7 9 cm involving the distal small bowel loops, the bladder dome, and the uterine body without peritoneal effusion (Fig. ). After primary care, our patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy. The intraoperative finding was a brownish pseudoaneurysmal mass of the small bowel located 80 cm from the Treitz\u2019s angle; this mass was invading the bladder dome and the left ovary and closely adhering to the uterus (Fig. ). Limited small bowel resection with 10 cm margins on both sides of the tumor extended to the left annexes and to a portion of the bladder with end-to-end anastomosis was achieved. The postoperative management was uneventful and our patient was discharged on day 6.

A histological examination revealed a malignant proliferation of large cells with prominent round nuclei and a cytoplasm with eosinophilic spots or the seat of melanin pigments. Tumor necrosis was estimated at 30%, the rest of the ileum was the seat of chronic ileitis (Fig. ).

Six years prior to presentation, she noticed painless swelling of her right thumb, which she initially attributed to an injury that occurred while working in a chicken-processing plant. She reported receiving repeated local injections of an unknown antibiotic in Honduras over the course of 2 weeks without relief. As time progressed, so did the swelling with extension from her hand to shoulder with eventual involvement of her right chest wall and hemithorax (). Her medical evaluation at that time was extremely limited and included a complete blood count and an X-ray, both of which she reported were normal, and hence, no further workup was sought. Eighteen months before presentation to the clinic, she developed dyspnoea on exertion with occasional cough. She reported right arm and back pain from the significant swelling with associated right chest wall discomfort. Apart from postprandial nausea, she denied any fever, night sweats, weight loss, or lower extremity oedema. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest with contrast revealed soft tissue oedema without evidence of thrombus or obstruction in the venous system (). Further evaluation for multiple infectious aetiologies, including tularaemia, coccidiodes, and malaria, were negative; however, she did have a positive purified protein derivative (PPD) test for which she received and completed latent tuberculosis treatment. Subsequent lymphoscintigraphy showed evidence of lymphatic obstruction at the level of the distal forearm and she was referred to a lymphedema clinic for compressive therapy. Her oedema continued to progress resulting in a large right-sided exudative chylus pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis. Fluid analysis for at that time was negative for malignancy and cultures were negative for acid-fast bacilli.

    "cleaned_text": "a 49-year-old hispanic woman presented to the ambulatory medicine service for worsening oedema of her right upper extremity. six years prior to presentation, she noticed painless swelling of her right thumb, which she initially attributed to an injury that occurred while working in a chicken-processing plant. she reported receiving repeated local injections of an unknown antibiotic in honduras over the course of 2 weeks without relief. as time progressed, so did the swelling with extension from her hand to shoulder with eventual involvement of her right chest wall and hemithorax (). her medical evaluation at that time was extremely limited and included a complete blood count and an x-ray, both of which she reported were normal, and hence, no further workup was sought. eighteen months before presentation to the clinic, she developed dyspnoea on exertion with occasional cough. she reported right arm and back pain from the significant swelling with associated right chest wall discomfort. apart from postprandial nausea, she denied any fever, night sweats, weight loss, or lower extremity oedema. a computed tomography (ct) scan of the chest with contrast revealed soft tissue oedema without evidence of thrombus or obstruction in the venous system (). further evaluation for multiple infectious aetiologies, including tularaemia, coccidiodes, and malaria, were negative; however, she did have a positive purified protein derivative (ppd) test for which she received and completed latent tuberculosis treatment. subsequent lymphoscintigraphy showed evidence of lymphatic obstruction at the level of the distal forearm and she was referred to a lymphedema clinic for compressive therapy. her oedema continued to progress resulting in a large right-sided exudative chylus pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis. fluid analysis for at that time was negative for malignancy and cultures were negative for acid-fast bacilli. she again presented two months later with dyspnoea and was found to have a re-accumulation of her pleural effusion at which time she underwent pleuroscopy with biopsy and pleurodesis with pleural drain placement. although repeat pleural fluid analysis",

    "original_text": "Our patient was a 2-year-old female infant. She presented with three painless vesicles on the lower lip that had emerged 3 weeks earlier. The vesicles had been left untreated due to their fluctuation in size. However, a local dentist who saw the patient for a routine checkup recommended a thorough examination of the vesicles, and thus referred her to our hospital. Her medical and family histories were unremarkable. At the initial visit, three well-circumscribed round masses, each measuring approximately 5 mm in diameter, were found on the lower lip. The lesions were bluish fluctuant masses covered with normal mucosa. No pain or congestion was noted. The facial appearance was symmetric without any skin rashes. No swelling or tenderness was present in the submandibular or cervical lymph nodes. The patient had no fever and her food intake was good. The differential diagnosis of mass lesions in lower lip is salivary gland tumors, fibroma, and hemangioma. Salivary gland tumors of the minor glands can occur on the lip but are more commonly seen in the upper lip rather than in the lower lip. Fibroma is commonly pink and nonfluctunt. Hemangioma can undergo transient reduction in size under pressure. Based on these findings, the lesions were diagnosed as multiple mucoceles of the lower lip. The mucoceles were individually excised, along with the surrounding minor salivary glands, under local anesthesia. We removed three spherical masses, each measuring 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 mm in size (Figure ). Histopathological analysis revealed that the cysts were present within connective tissues and lacked lining epithelium. In the minor salivary gland tissues, lymphocytic infiltration was noted around the ducts. These histopathological findings led to a diagnosis of mucoceles (Figure ).\nHer postoperative course was uneventful without any infection or wound dehiscence. To date, 3 years after the operation, the patient has not experienced any recurrence.
