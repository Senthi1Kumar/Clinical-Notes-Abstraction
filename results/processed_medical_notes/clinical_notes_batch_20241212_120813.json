A CT of the abdomen and pelvis with pancreatic mass protocol was repeated (), which revealed new hypoattenuating masses in the pancreatic neck and tail. Some of the smaller tumours were hypervascular on the arterial phase imaging. There was redemonstration of extensive parenchymal calcifications. No pancreatic atrophy was identified. The pancreatic duct remained minimally dilated. Given the new masses many of which were arterially enhancing, the possibility of neuroendocrine tumour was raised. A MRI of the abdomen with pancreatic mass protocol (T2 with fat saturation, MRCP, in and out of phase T1 and unenhanced T1/arterial/portal/ 5 min delayed post-contrast T1) was performed (). The MRI confirmed multiple well-circumscribed masses throughout the pancreas, many of which had increased T2 signal with cystic change. The pancreatic duct was at most mildly prominent, and no lesions were identified outside of the pancreas. The largest pancreatic mass in the tail measured approximately 3.5 cm, with peripheral enhancement and central hypointense signal (). An endoscopic ultrasound was performed, which confirmed a hypoechoic mass in the tail of the pancreas, two isoechoic masses in the head of the pancreas, and diffuse parenchymal calcifications suggestive of chronic pancreatitis.

Emergency medical services were called at the nursing home and the patient was reportedly hypoxic with oxygen saturation in the 70s on room air with subsequent development of agitation and lethargy after the seizure. The patient was transferred to an outside hospital's emergency department (ED), where additional tonic-clonic activity was noted. She subsequently developed hypotension with a blood pressure of 52/36 mmHg that was refractory to crystalloid intravenous fluid resuscitation. Central venous catheter (CVC) was placed and norepinephrine was started for persistent hypotension. Labs were notable for leukocytosis, troponin elevation, and low mixed venous saturation on CVC venous blood gas. The patient was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care facility cardiac intensive care unit for evaluation of cardiogenic shock.\nUpon arrival, the patient was alert and following commands, but disoriented. She was still requiring supplemental oxygen and norepinephrine for hypotension. Given the concern for cardiogenic shock, a stat bedside transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained, which demonstrated a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. The patient was urgently taken to the cardiac catheterization lab for pericardiocentesis with a drain placement. This yielded 580 ml of hemorrhagic fluid with rapid improvement in hemodynamics following drainage. During the pericardiocentesis, fluoroscopy demonstrated two embolized fragments of the IVC filter within the right ventricle (RV). Review of past imaging revealed that the embolized fragment was visualized on computer tomography (CT) of the chest one year and one month prior to presentation. Upon further investigation from family, it was discovered that the patient's Bard G2 retrievable IVC filter was placed in April 2007 in the context of a PE with concurrent GI bleed.

He kept his eyes closed for most of the day and demonstrated no spontaneous speech or reaction. Although his blood tests showed inflammatory reaction, his vital signs were normal, and computed tomography and electroencephalography of his brain showed no significant findings. He had no relatives and there was no life history information of him. According to the information of the neighboring residents, he had exhibited strange behaviors since about 2 months before admission and often annoyed the neighbors. Before his arrival to the emergency department, a neighbor called the police because the patient had stood in front of his apartment for a long time. While in detention, he did not respond to the police interrogations at all; he was found lying in front of his apartment a few hours after police released him. After admission to the emergency department, he was consulted with our department for the assessment of psychotic symptoms by his physician. Including the process leading to hospitalization, he was diagnosed with catatonia based on the presence of stupor, mutism, and negativism which was detected from the information by the police about the patients\u2019 uncooperative behavior during detention.

The patient had a history of scleroderma for 15 years with five years of interstitial lung disease, calcified nodules and anemia of chronic disease. She experienced six months of increased fatigue, anorexia and unintentional weight loss of 20 pounds without any fevers or night sweats. Physical examination showed a tender, non-fluctuant, 5 cm x 5 cm immobile subcutaneous mass with overlying skin excoriations and minimal surrounding erythema. Multiple old raised calcified skin nodules on the wrist, forearm, elbow and thigh were noted. No cervical, axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy noted. MRI of the left upper extremity with contrast showed a 4.7 cm x 3.4 cm x 3.6 cm mass in the middle-upper arm deep soft tissue between the biceps and triceps muscle and a second 4.9 cm x 4 cm x 4.5 cm mass in the subcutaneous tissue of the distal posterior part of the arm (Figure ). Core needle biopsy of the mass showed a fragment of completely necrotic tissue with necrotic cells suggestive of small blue cell neoplasm. The patient underwent surgical excision of the left arm masses with the presumptive diagnosis of sarcoma. Surgical findings included a distal superficial necrotic mass which was easily excised and a proximal deeper mass which involved muscle, surrounding nerves and vessels, and was adherent to the bone. This deeper mass was completely excised in pieces. Frozen section of the biopsy showed a small blue cell neoplasm with extensive necrosis in both masses (Figure ). Immunohistochemical (IHC) studies established the diagnosis of Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma. IHC was positive for CD45, CD 20, BCL2, and partial BCL6.

Pathological examination demonstrated G3 urothelial carcinoma with a component of squamous cell carcinoma (<5%), pT3b. she underwent two cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin and was in good condition without metastatic disease.\nNineteen years after the cystectomy, she was admitted to our hospital with anemia and Hb of 8 g/dL. Bleeding from the stoma continued and contrast-enhanced CT showed a tumor measuring 35 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 25 mm on the right-side wall of the conduit (Fig. ). Biopsy examination of the tumor revealed erosive mucosa and granulation tissue without malignancy. The bleeding from the stoma stopped with conservative therapy and she refused invasive treatment at the time; she was therefore discharged after 13 days\u2019 hospitalization. After hospitalization, she underwent outpatient checkups every 3 months, with no recurrence of bleeding thereafter.\nThree years later, acute bleeding from the stoma recurred and she was hospitalized again with severe anemia (Hb of 5.9 g/dL). Contrast-enhanced CT revealed an enlarged tumor measuring 50 \u00d7 45 \u00d7 40 mm in the ileal conduit (Fig. ).\nThe bleeding did not stop this time with conservative therapy and the size of this tumor had been gradually increasing over 3 years, so she underwent a complete resection of the tumor 16 days after admission.\nThe tumor was recognized from the surface of her abdominal wall under general anesthesia. Five centimeters incision was made just beside the stoma on the opposite side of mesentery and the tumor was dragged out of the stoma.

    "original_text": "A healthy, 10-year-old boy was admitted to pediatric dentistry clinic for the management of crowding associated with a large tooth present in the upper jaw. On intraoral examination, the patient's chief complaint was confirmed by the presence of a misaligned maxillary right central incisor. The tooth had a talon cusp-like enamel projection on the labial aspect of the crown and had a large mesiodistal dimension. Owing to the patient's gagging reflex, a proper radiographic examination of the incisor could not be made. However, the occlusal and periapical radiographs were highly suggestive of a large pulp chamber, and even of the possibility of a fused tooth. The occlusal radiograph also indicated an unerupted supernumerary incisor located on the contralateral side between the central and lateral incisors. The supernumerary incisor had a well-shaped crown and showed advanced root formation with incomplete apical closure ().\nAmong possible treatment options, esthetic reduction of the crown in both the proximal and labial aspects was considered unfavorable due to the presence of a large pulp chamber. Extraction of the tooth and consequent orthodontic correction were also discarded as a treatment alternative, since orthodontic movement of the supernumerary tooth over the midline could result in resorption of the alveolar bone. Finally, the use of the contralateral supernumerary incisor as a replacement for the existing large incisor was considered the best treatment option, since both the radiographic crown dimensions and presence of the immature apex favored the possibility for autotransplantation. The patient and his parents were informed about the treatment options and their possible outcomes. The patient showed up four months later, approving the treatment plan of autotransplantation. During the time, the supernumerary incisor erupted into the crowded maxillary arch in a rotated fashion ().

He was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism about three months prior to hospitalization. He was started on methimazole (MMI), but compliance taking the medication was low. His primary care provider had recommended thyroidectomy; however, he was unable to have the procedure due to lack of health insurance. On presentation to the outside hospital, imaging revealed right lower lobe pneumonia with an effusion and he was started on antibiotics. His clinical status deteriorated, and he developed shock complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate with documented rates in the 140\u2013190 beats per minute.

Two metal struts were inserted to stabilize the deformity and were sewn to the ribs with heavy No. 2 multifilament nonabsorbable braided sutures. The position of the bars was such that the tension had been larger on the inferior strut due to the asymmetry of the PE. The position of the metal bars had been verified postoperatively by anteroposterior and lateral chest X-ray only. The displacement of one strut was noted after 4 months. The inferior strut migrated approximately 1cm rightward and threatened to perforate the skin. The mechanism of migration was straightening of the strut due to the severity of the intrathoracic deformity, its strong pulling force and consequent displacement. The dislocated bar was surgically removed and the other strut left in place. The postoperative course was uneventful and the position of the remaining bar checked only by radiography. At the time of initial surgery, the laboratory results were consistent with the findings of a healthy young adolescent.\nThe patient complained of limb pain 10 days post strut removal. With pain intensification, he was examined by a vascular surgeon about 2 months after the second intervention. Bilateral distal arterial and venous leg thromboses were diagnosed by the color Doppler. The transthoracic heart ultrasound showed the remaining metal strut perforating the anterior right ventricular (RV) wall, the intraventricular septum, ending its course in the left ventricular (LV) cavity with massive intracardiac biventricular thrombosis with no pericardial effusion.

The patient had a history of hypertension and left renal urolithiasis. CT showed a heterogeneous left upper pole renal tumor (5.3 cm in diameter). A laparoscopic radical nephrectomy was performed in May 2008. Left adrenalectomy and lymph node dissection were not performed because the CT scan showed no adrenal gland invasion or lymphadenopathy. The histological evaluation of the tissue revealed a clear cell renal cell carcinoma and negative surgical margins (pathological stage, T2N0M0). Three years after nephrectomy, following a cerebrovascular accident, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score changed from 0 to 2. No tumor recurrence (CT scan was performed every 6 months) was found until 51 months later. A CT scan detected two nodules in the renal fossa (1.8 and 0.9 cm, respectively). Retroperitoneal exploration confirmed recurrent clear cell carcinoma with microscopically positive surgical margins. Lymph node dissection was not performed because of severe adhesion around the aorta. Lymph nodes that could be detected by palpation were not identified during the surgery. Four months after excision, an abdominal CT showed a nodule (1.6 cm) over the right adrenal gland. At that time, tumor target therapy was not covered by the national health insurance in Taiwan. Therefore, because of economic reasons, the patient could not afford the treatment until 2013. A repeat CT evaluation confirmed the disease progression of the adrenal metastasis (2.1 cm). The patient was treated with sunitinib (37.5 mg/d) for 4 weeks, but the treatment was discontinued because of gastrointestinal side effects and fatigue.

Her medical history included hypertension, anemia, and a cardiovascular accident without neurological sequelae. Two hours before admission, she experienced acute onset of bilateral lower back pain while bathing. She rated the pain as 5 out of 10 on the numeric rating scale (NRS). Approximately 30 min after her bath, while she was resting and watching television, she experienced sudden bilateral lower limb pain, weakness, and numbness. The numbness was described as the same feeling that follows electric shock. The back and lower limb pain worsened, and the NRS score rose from 5/10 to 10/10. She was unable to walk or even stand up because of the weakness and pain in both limbs. After calling the emergency number, she was sent to the regional hospital where magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine to lumbar spine revealed an epidural hematoma extending from the levels of T12 to L1 (Figs. and ). Some analgesic medication was injected twice, but the pain persisted. She was then transferred to our medical center for further treatment.\nDuring history taking, the patient denied any other discomfort such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, choking, seizure, focal neurological deficits (such as visual change or aphasia), urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, fever, neck pain, abdominal pain, or any history of back trauma. Although this patient had a stroke ~ 12 years ago, she had recovered almost entirely after undergoing rehabilitation for 2 years, and she had consumed neither aspirin nor anticoagulant since then.

Exploratory laparotomy revealed an incarcerated peristomal hernia with perforated small bowel. Extensive enterolysis, small bowel resection and hernia repair with permacol were performed. Cultures grew Escherichia coli; pathology revealed only neutrophilic inflammation. Due to the severity of disease, and distention of small bowel, the abdomen was left open to heal by secondary intention. Her postoperative course was complicated by severe sepsis syndrome with respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis, and DIC. Broad spectrum antibiotics were administered. The patient was also treated with hydrocortisone 100 mg every 8 hours and subsequently developed steroid induced hyperglycemia. On postoperative day (POD) 3, a vacuum assisted closure (VAC) device was placed to assist with fascial healing. The sepsis syndrome resolved and the patient's condition improved until POD 9, when stool was noticed collecting within the VAC system. The patient was returned to the operating room where she was found to have an anastamotic breakdown.\nPathology from the second surgery showed transmural ischemic necrosis with angioinvasion of a fungal organism (see figure ).

She described the pain as constant and associated with anorexia. She denied any urinary symptoms and is pre-menarchal.\nHer background surgical history consisted of a left inguinal hernia repair at the age of 11 months. She was on no medications and had no allergies.\nHer family history revealed her to be one of five sisters, and their mother known to be a carrier of androgenic insensitivity syndrome. The oldest sister aged 21 years had been diagnosed with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). The second oldest sister aged 17 year is well and has normal menstrual periods. The third sister aged 14 years has primary amenorrhea but has not been tested for CAIS.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 47-year-old male presenting to our hospital with the chief complaint of sudden epigastric pain with vital signs indicating shock. One month earlier, he was hospitalized in our department and underwent omental patch repair for gastric ulcer perforation. Emergent contrast-enhanced CT revealed a retroperitoneal hematoma in the pancreatic head (Figure A), aneurysm formation in the PDA (Figure B), and extraluminal compression to the celiac trunk (Figure C,D). Extravasation was also detected around the aneurysm in the PDA (Figure A), but no liquid was retained in the peritoneal cavity. Emergent IVR for hemostasis was performed for retroperitoneal hemorrhage from the ruptured PDA aneurysm. Arteriography of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was performed through a sheath introduced in the right femoral artery. Imaging of the SMA revealed the development of several collaterals in the pancreatic head (Figure A), and the common and proper hepatic arteries were imaged via these collaterals. The aneurysm in the PDA accompanied by leakage of the contrast-enhanced agent had a diameter of 9.3 mm. IVR hemostasis was completed by PDA coil embolization. Subsequent SMA arteriography showed several collaterals other than embolized PDA perfusing the proper hepatic artery (Figure B). After IVR therapy, blood chemical analysis was monitored for several weeks, revealing that transaminase level was not elevated and hepatic infarction was considered negative.

On admission, her Glasgow Coma Scale score was 14, and CT demonstrated SAH, with a thick hematoma in the right sylvian cistern [ and ]. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of right carotid artery revealed severe stenosis and irregular aneurysmal dilatation in the M1 portion of the MCA, and poor perfusion of the MCA territory compared with the anterior and posterior cerebral artery areas [ and ]. In addition, the stenotic anterior temporal artery (ATA) originated from the proximal portion of the lesion, and the inferior trunk and LSA branched off just distal to the lesion. We considered that the right MCA dissection had caused the SAH, and planned surgery to prevent repeated hemorrhage on the next morning.\nOn the day after admission, CT before surgery identified increased hematoma, indicating repeated hemorrhage, and diffusion-weighted imaging revealed infarctions mainly in the right MCA area [ and ]. We assumed the cause of infarction was embolism originating from the MCA dissection. We planned trapping of the dissection and high-flow bypass using the RAG to the distal MCA, intended to prevent repeated hemorrhage from the dissection, stop thrombus moving off from the lesion, and preclude infarction by maintaining adequate blood flow in the MCA area including perforators from the M1 portion.\nNeuroanesthesia was induced under monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) of the left extremities and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of the left upper limb.

A CT scan showed a pancreatic head mass compressing the common bile duct. For palliation of hyperbilirubinemia, a palliative stent was placed in the common bile duct. A fine needle aspirate obtained through an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. A follow-up CT scan performed on February 13, 2015 revealed a 3.6 \u00d7 2.7 cm pancreatic head mass that abutted the superior mesenteric artery and one of its proximal branches. There were suspicious peripancreatic and retroperitoneal nodes and no evidence of distant disease. At the beginning of March, she began taking 50,000 U vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) daily, ordered directly from the Internet and not under the direction of a healthcare practitioner. Repeat EUS and biopsy on March 3, 2015 again confirmed adenocarcinoma with papillary features. She was referred to an oncologist and surgeon for evaluation. A triple phase CT was done on March 16, 2015 that showed a stable mass without any evidence of involvement of the celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery. Upfront chemotherapy was recommended, with consideration of surgery in the future.\nShe received gemcitabine/protein nanoparticle-bound paclitaxel in March.

A cardiac wound in the left ventricle was repaired using a 2.0 polypropylene suture. An aortic cross-clamp was applied. Cardiac massage along with intracardiac injection of epinephrine and bicarbonate resulted in sinus tachycardia. Four additional sutures were required upon restoration of sinus tachycardia to control an exsanguination in the emergency department as the full extent of the defect was not evident during asystole. Residual hemorrhage was present when the patient was taken to the operating room (OR) for definitive repair. In the OR, the cardiac wound was reinforced with four pledgeted polypropylene mattress sutures with no residual hemorrhage. Nevertheless, the left ventricular wall appeared edematous and bruised after the complex repair. The pericardium was left open. The patient continued to be hypothermic, acidotic and coagulopathic. Attempted chest closure resulted in severe bradycardia and therefore, temporary closure was obtained with a vacuum-assisted closure device and the patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit. In total, 24 units of packed red cells, 10 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 6 units of platelets were transfused. On the second postoperative day, chest was uneventfully closed in the OR.

Due to unremitting back pain, he presented to our institution where a repeat MR imaging study was obtained demonstrating abnormal intradiscal signal between the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies consistent with disc space infection and adjacent vertebral osteomyelitis (). In addition, a small amount of enhancing phlegmon was noted. The patient underwent a CT-guided biopsy of the disc space which was nondiagnostic with negative cultures. At the time of his initial presentation, his white count was 7.2 with C-reactive protein of 84 and a sedimentation rate of 84. Blood cultures were obtained and were negative. The patient was initially placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics. With ongoing symptoms and no identifiable pathogen, an open L3 disc space biopsy was performed three days later. Fungal culture revealed growth of Aspergillus nidulans. Susceptibility testing was performed. Serum Aspergillus antigen and Fungitell assays were significantly elevated. He was started on voriconazole 200 mg orally twice per day with excellent serum levels.\nInitially, the patient's back pain began to improve. However, 4 weeks after the disc space biopsy and initiation of antifungal treatment, his symptoms rapidly progressed. The patient's laboratory studies revealed a sedimentation rate greater than 100 and his C-reactive protein was elevated at 25.

He was seen at his primary care physician\u2019s office few weeks before admission for worsening shortness of breath, cough, and lower extremity swelling. The patient was given a prescription of oral azithromycin and furosemide. Despite these medications, his breathing continued to get worse prompting him to be seen at a local emergency room. He was found to be hypoxic on room air and in moderate to severe respiratory distress. He was emergently intubated, and the x-ray of the chest done at the outside hospital showed complete opacification of the left lung prompting the transfer to our medical intensive care unit (MICU) facility for further evaluation.\nOn arrival to the MICU, he was intubated and sedated. Initial blood work on arrival was remarkable for an elevated white count, uric acid, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), potassium, and phosphorus with normal creatinine (Table ).

She went to an urgent care the next day and received medications, after which she felt better for about two days. When her symptoms recurred, she went to an outside hospital where she had a computed tomography scan of the head and lumbar puncture, both of which were negative. The patient was admitted for an elevated troponin level and received a cardiac catheterization without intervention, findings significant for 60% blockage of a single vessel. The patient presented to us one day post discharge due to persistent headache. She described the headache as similar to her prior preeclampsia headache, feeling \"like a grip around\" her entire head.\nHer initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 172/92 mmHg, pulse 81, respiratory rate 18, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. A physical exam revealed a woman in pain but nontoxic appearing. Her heart and lung sounds were normal. Her neurological exam was unremarkable with no focal numbness, weakness, or abnormalities with coordination, gait, or cranial nerves. The chest plain film, initial lab, and electrocardiogram results were normal.\nThe patient received one liter intravenous fluids, metoclopramide intravenous, and ketorolac intravenous with minimal improvement and still appeared uncomfortable on multiple reassessments.

A year before, a tumour of the right orbit was partially excised. Histopathological examination at that time showed fibrous tissue with vascular proliferation (). The nature of the proliferation, reactive or neoplastic, was not definitively established at that time. Nevertheless the lesion was considered benign because histological parameters typical for malignant neoplasm\u2014high mitotic activity, cellular atypia, necrosis, and infiltrative growth pattern\u2014were not observed; therefore further treatment was not recommended. Symptoms, however, recurred after a few months and were progressively worsening.\nAt the time of admission to the hospital, exophthalmos of the right eye was evident with paresis of the third and fourth cranial nerves. Visual acuity was 0.8 and had not changed since previous hospitalization. The patient complained of double vision, which was exaggerated in the gaze directions of the affected orbital muscles. No other cranial nerve abnormalities were noted.\nMRI of the head revealed a mass of the right orbit, about two centimetres in diameter (). Some contrast staining was present in the operative field, indicating scar tissue from previous surgery. A CT scan showed a defect of the orbital roof bone, removed at the time of the first operation (). Surgical resection was indicated.\nSurgery was performed through right pterional approach with retrepanation of the cranial bone and complete orbitotomy. A fibrous tumour was found in the periorbital adipose tissue, embedded in scar tissue and extending to the fibrous coverings of the globe, partially adherent to the extraocular muscles.

She underwent a preventive esophagogastroduodenoscopy 2 years and 7 months prior to the referral. The examination had revealed a submucosal tumor-like lesion in the fornix, which measured 10 mm. After this diagnosis, she was referred to her previous physician. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a low density, round mass, measuring approximately 20 mm that was located between the upper stomach and left lateral segment of the liver (Fig. a). Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the mass showed a high signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging and seemed to be distinct from the stomach (Fig. b). It was determined that the tumor would require careful follow-up. A follow-up MRI was performed 5 months later, and it showed slight growth of the tumor. An endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was also performed, and it revealed a cystic structure continuous with the gastric wall. Contrary to the previous CT and MRI results that suggested the presentation of an extra-gastric tumor, the EUS results suggested that a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) could not be ruled out. Owing to the conflicting results, the patient was referred to the endoscopy division of our hospital two years ago for detailed examination.
