Further workup with a transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated a small mobile echo density measuring 4 \u00d7 5 mm attached to the coumadin ridge. She was placed on prophylactic and not therapeutic anticoagulation due to a high bleeding risk. Cardiac computed tomography ruled out the involvement of the aortic root, ie, aortic root abscess or pseudoaneurysm. No other reversible causes of her complete heart block could be identified. Subsequently, a transvenous pacing wire was successfully placed within the right ventricle.\nGiven her diagnosis of infective endocarditis and need for a prolonged course of antibiotics, the decision was made to proceed with the implantation of a permanent pacing system. The patient decided to undergo Micra\u2122 transcatheter LP implantation, due to her recent history of extraction of her potentially infected left upper-extremity AV graft and previously documented right subclavian vein occlusion. Subsequently, the patient underwent Micra\u2122 implantation through the right femoral vein. After the device was deployed, the pull-and-hold test was performed to ensure adequate fixation. The postfixation electrical testing of the device demonstrated an R-wave sensing value of 6.5 mV, an impedance of 550 \u03a9, and a pacing threshold of 1.3 V at 0.24 ms. The latter improved to less than 1 V at 0.24 ms before the end of the case. Hence, the decision was made to cut the tethering suture and release the Micra\u2122 device. Postprocedure, the patient remained stable and was transferred to the medical floor",

The patient was asymptomatic on his original presentation but subsequently developed nausea and vomiting along with right lower quadrant abdominal pain in the following days resulting in admission to the general surgery service for treatment of appendicitis. The patient did not have any contributory family, drug, or psychosocial history.\nOn chart review, the patient had an extensive past oncological history dating back to 2014 after resection of an enlarging, exophytic, ulcerating chest mass on the right side just lateral to the midline. Pathology from the wide local excision of this mass demonstrated estrogen receptor (ER) positive, progesterone receptor (PR) positive, and HER2/neu negative metastatic adenocarcinoma with an unknown primary source at the time. He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy to rule out a primary gastrointestinal malignancy, however, both were normal. He was followed closely by medical oncology and treated with tamoxifen for hormone therapy. Due to an enlarged anterior mediastinal wall lymph node discovered on routine CT surveillance in May of 2017, the patient underwent CT-guided biopsy and positron emission tomography (PET). The biopsy was negative for malignancy, however, the PET demonstrated abnormal, hypermetabolic activity within a retrosternal nodule, intense activity in a mixed focus in the manubrium, and several hypermetabolic nodes within the mediastinum. It also showed an abnormal hypermetabolic focus in the cecum suspicious for a colon primary (, ).

The 12-lead electrocardiogram suggested inferior wall and right ventricle STEMI, including ST elevation in leads III, and aVF, lead I with reciprocal ST depression, and right side V4R elevation (Fig. A). Under the impression of an inferior wall STEMI, antiplatelet medications and inotropic agent were administrated, and the patient was sent promptly for a primary PCI.\nEmergent primary PCI was approached through right radial access. After the insertion of radial sheath, the radial systolic blood pressure was 82 mm Hg.

Due to the abnormally large pressure differential between the peripheral radial artery and central ascending aorta, TAAD was suspected.

There was no significant previous medical history. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) suggested lymphoma and subsequent histological examination of an excised lymph node between level two and three from the left side of the neck confirmed the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). PET-CT and bone marrow examination further demonstrated bone marrow involvement. Accordingly, the lymphoma was staged as Ann Arbor IVB and AJCC stage IV. The patient received eight series of R-CHOP followed by a scheduled 2-year-period of maintenance therapy with rituximab. Twelve months into maintenance therapy the patient developed a tender swelling of the right submandibular- and left sublingual gland. On clinical examination, a one-centimeter process with normal overlying mucosa was found in the left sublingual gland () along with a similar process in the right submandibular gland. Ultrasound of the left sublingual- and right submandibular gland revealed two hyperechoic one-centimeter tumors. Further examination and ultrasound of the neck revealed no enlarged lymph nodes. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and neck was performed (). PET-CT revealed a process of the sigmoid colon, but the bone marrow examination showed no signs of infiltration. MCL relapse was confirmed by subsequent excision and histological examination of the sublingual- and submandibular gland, as well as histological examination of a biopsy specimen taken from the sigmoid colon via colonoscopy. Histological examination of the excised sublingual gland showed salivary gland tissue infiltrated by lymphoid tumor cells appearing as blastoid cells with multiple membrane bound nucleoli (). Mitotic figures were seen in several of these cells. Immunohistochemistry showed positive reaction in the tumor cells' nuclei for PAX5, cyclin D1, and SOX11 and on the tumor cells' surface for CD5 and the proliferation index was estimated to >80%.

His renal function gradually improved on dialysis while his cardiac function also significantly improved with the ejection fraction increasing from 20% on admission to 40%. About five days into admission, his hemoglobin was noted to have decreased gradually from the initial value of 148 g/L to 84 g/L despite packed red cell transfusions (). The platelet count similarly decreased progressively despite multiple platelet transfusions. Blood cultures were negative. The virology workup for cytomegalovirus, EBV, parvovirus B19, and HIV screening, were also negative. He was subsequently transferred to the University of Alberta Hospital for further review and management. Additional recommended testing following his transfer of care included screening for antiphospholipid, lupus anticoagulant and hepatitis B core antibodies. All were negative. The transfusion history confirmed that the patient had previously received packed cell transfusions perioperatively more than 2 yrs prior to the present illness. The patient deteriorated with development of purpuric skin lesions and epistaxis while the progressive drop in the platelet count continued. The onset of purpuric bleeding followed red cell transfusion given during hemodialysis as a result of the acute renal shut down. At the time of the referral, he was on methylprednisolone and tranexamic acid. A review of his CBC showed hemoglobin; 88 g/L and total white cells; 14.2 \u00d7 109/L (neutrophils 9.1). At the nadir, platelet count was 1 \u00d7 109/L. The international normalized ratio (INR) fluctuated between 1.1 at admission and 2.1. PTT was stable and within normal limits.

Four days prior to presentation, he was seen in the emergency department for chronic back pain and was discharged with naproxen and instruction to follow up with his primary care physician. Since then, he developed acute onset of sharp constant pain of his left testicle and his abdomen. He admitted to using ten bags of heroin intravenously daily. He underwent an incision and drainage one month prior for a skin abscess. He reported no new sexual partner and is only sexually active with his current girlfriend. Family history was significant for heart disease in both his parents and maternal grandparents. His vital signs on admission were within the normal range.

    "original_text": "A 62-year-old male presented with a history of shortness of breath for one year, with his condition worsening over the past two to three months. Initially, he was able to walk three to four miles a day but has been able to walk only half to one mile over the last year. He gave a remote two-year history of cigarette smoking half a pack per day about 25 - 30 years ago. He was admitted to the hospital with similar complaints three months prior to his presentation. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest done at that time showed no pulmonary embolism and no consolidation/parenchymal changes. An echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 55% with a normal right ventricle and no valvular abnormality. The viral panel was positive for rhinovirus and he was deemed to have dyspnea because of the rhinovirus infection. On discharge, he was comfortable on room air with no active complaints, although he felt he was not back to his baseline exercise capacity.\nSometime later, the patient went to his primary care physician for persistent shortness of breath. To rule out coronary ischemia, a left heart catheterization was performed which showed normal coronary arteries.\nThe patient then presented to the pulmonary clinic with hypoxemia. Even with supplemental oxygen, the hypoxemia persisted. However, when asked to lay flat, his oxygen saturation improved to 95%.

The physician who evaluated her in the emergency room referred her to our department with a tentative diagnosis of WE based on the early gestation, nausea, and dizziness. She had hyperemesis gravidarum since 6 weeks of gestation. She first noted double vision 4 days prior to the emergency room visit. On questioning, she admitted that the gait difficulties secondary to dizziness worsened slightly each day. Her double vision was now continuous, and objects appeared skewed. She reported that she was nauseated and found it difficult to tolerate the double vision. She reported no definite weakness but had considerable difficulty walking without assistance. She reported no paresthesias or sensory loss in her limbs, trunk, or face. She had an unremarkable medical history and she had not been hospitalized. Her family history was significant for maternal IgA nephropathy. The obstetric examination at the time of admission revealed an 11-week gestation and a single live fetus was detected in utero.

He was transferred to the emergency room with fading mental awareness. The facial laceration was 15 cm in length from nose to right cheek (). A piece of the broken blade was observed in the deep portion of the facial wound. Facial bone CTs revealed a blade fragment in the anterior skull base from his nose to the dorsum sellae area (). Brain CTs demonstrated the involvement of the right temporal lobe, cavernous sinus, paraclinoid segment of the carotid artery (). Also there were traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, pneumocephalus without apparent low attenuation area of the right ICA (). Raw data from CT angiography revealed non-visualization of the right carotid artery while left carotid artery density was visible (). The paraclinoid area was occupied by the foreign body, suggesting ICA encroachment. Delayed time to peak of the right side was noticed on perfusion CT suggesting right carotid artery occlusion (). Progressive left side weakness developed after admission. Because of the patient's critical condition, we needed prompt management to restore blood flow without digital substraction angiography (DSA). Emergency skull base surgery was planned to unblock the cavernous sinus. And then we considered extracranial to intracranial high flow arterial bypass in case of flow decrement on the right ICA. Conventional craniotomy was performed on the right pterional area. After extradural removal of the anterior clinoid process, micro-Doppler revealed restoration of carotid flow to the paraclinoid segment (). Intradural inspection revealed displacement of the carotid artery due to the foreign body ().

At admission, the physical examination revealed abdominal pain and abdominal distention. Our patient also complained of constipation and failure to pass gas or feces for three days. On physical examination, our patient had a painful distended abdomen. Digital examination revealed an empty rectum. An X-ray of her abdomen revealed a bowel obstruction (Figure ). The impression was that the large bowel obstruction was due to a tumor.\nOur patient had undergone a cesarean section for delivery of her first child, 12 years before this admission, in another country. One year after the cesarean, she was operated on for symphysiolysis because of an acute bowel obstruction. After that surgery our patient started taking oral contraception which she stopped when she decided to have a second pregnancy. The second child was delivered normally. She then resumed taking oral contraception for two years, and stopped. She then started having symptoms of menstrual irregularity and cyclic menstrual pain, but she did not seek any medical help.\nOur patient underwent exploratory laparotomy because of the bowel obstruction. There were adhesions in her abdomen between her appendix, uterus, the sigmoid and her left ureter. Her appendix was found with small abnormal lesions, and an appendectomy was performed. During adhesiolysis, the left ureter was injured, and it was restored at this point using a pig-tail. Her bowel was swollen and the feces could not pass through. The rectum stenosis (almost complete obstruction) was located 8-10 cm from her anus. A rectosigmoidectomy with rectal stump closure and temporary colostomy (Hartmann's procedure) was performed.

Six months postoperatively, he was noted to have elevated BUN and creatinine levels of 38 mg/dL and 1.86 mg/dL, respectively, from a previously normal baseline. Tacrolimus levels were checked to exclude its toxicity. A renal ultrasound was performed but was found to be negative for any leak or obstruction. BK levels were checked, and he was found to have a viral load greater than 400,000 copies/mL on two separate occasions. Doses of his immunosuppressant medications were immediately reduced. Over the next four years, he continued to undergo close surveillance with regular monitoring of serum creatinine and BK virus DNA levels. In spite of our best efforts, he eventually developed renal allograft failure. Histopathological specimens were sent.

Patient had a history of road traffic accident 2 months back, sustained injuries to lower jaw, and right upper limb. The patient was treated elsewhere for fracture right parasymphysis of the mandible by open reduction and internal fixation []. Patient was placed on intermaxillary fixation (IMF) for condyle fractures. Patient had persistent swelling in front of the right ear since then. The patient reported to us for treatment of swelling on the right side of the face and also for the removal of IMF.\nOn examination, the swelling was well-defined and was confined to parotid region []. The skin over swelling was normal and pulsations seen over the swelling. On palpation, the swelling was soft, fluctuant and mimicked an abscess, except for the pulsation and an audible bruit. A provisional diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm was made and the patient was advised for an orthopantomogram and angio-CT [], which confirmed a pseudoaneurysm. Carotid angiogram and possible embolization was planned []. Due to financial constraints of the patient only angiogram was done. A final diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm of the internal maxillary artery was made, with the identification of feeder vessel. Surgical resection of the aneurysm was planned. Under general anesthesia, an extended submandibular incision was given. Superior and inferior flaps were raised, the common carotid artery was exposed and a vascular clamp was applied to external carotid artery (ECA). The sac reduced in size considerably. The sac was attached to the posterior border of ramus, extended superiorly and medially until the infra-temporal fossa []. The sac was carefully dissected.

No bone resection was performed during prior surgery. Magnetic resonance scanning confirmed the recurrence and defined the tumor extent, which did not involve neurovascular structures. Except for oncological disease, the patient was healthy and her clinical history was unremarkable.

The patient was then informed about the diagnosis and further surgical procedure was discussed in a consultation with oncological, orthopaedic, microsurgical and reconstructive staff. The operation was planned according to an oncological resection of the sarcoma including the 3rd and 4th metatarsal bones followed by reconstruction with osteomuscular serratus anterior and rib free flap in order to fill the defect and restore bone continuity for functional preservation. This flap was preferred to a vascularized fibular flap in order to avoid donor site morbidity because of the characteristics of the patient (highly active woman practising climbing and running).\nEn bloc tumor resection with wide margins, including the proximal and medial thirds of the 3rd and 4th metatarsal bone, was performed (Fig. ).

The surgery was converted to open surgery because of the severe adhesion between the myoma and the right ureter. On postoperative day 2, she complained of right flank pain, and a sonogram revealed mild right-sided hydronephrosis. The patient was referred to the urology department, and it was speculated that the right ureter was edematous due to damage that occurred during the hysterectomy, which led to the mild hydronephrosis. Thus specific interventions were not instituted at that moment. The patient developed fever of >38\u00b0C on postoperative day 3, and RP revealed complete obstruction of the right ureter at the ureterovesical junction where neither a guidewire nor the contrast medium passed through the obstruction at all. We performed contrast-enhanced CT to identify the cause of the fever and ureteral obstruction. The ureteral obstruction at the ureterovesical junction was approximately 3.5 cm long. Nephrographic phase images showed that the right kidney was enhanced to the same degree as the left kidney despite the complete obstruction of the right ureter (Fig. ). Excretory phase images depicted backflow from the renal pelvis via the renal vein (Fig. ). PVB was determined to be responsible for the decompression of the hydronephrosis, such that the contrast enhancement of the renal parenchyma was preserved despite the complete ureteral obstruction. Both venous and excretory phase images also revealed a low-density lesion in the IVC (Figs a,a,c). We suspected the lesion to be a thrombus and placed a temporal IVC filter from the internal jugular vein to prevent it from traveling to the lungs. Ureteroneocystostomy was performed 13 days after hysterectomy, and a CT scan performed 4 days after the procedure revealed that the hydronephrosis, PVB, and the low-density lesion in the IVC had completely disappeared without any thrombolytic therapy.

The patient experienced a twisting of his knee, while a valgus impaction force was applied to the slightly flexed knee. The patient had a dislocated feeling in his knee with severe knee pain and could not stand up. He visited our affiliate hospital on the day of the accident. Physical examination revealed knee effusion and a positive Lachman test with valgus instability in right knee. The patient presented the tenderness at the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and the lateral femoral condyle. The range of motion was reduced to 90 degrees of flexion due to knee pain. Fat droplets were present in the aspirated blood from the knee joint. Plain radiographs showed a huge depression fracture in the lateral femoral condyle (Fig. a, b). Computed tomography (CT) also revealed a huge depressed lesion of 35 mm \u00d7 15 mm in area and 7 mm in depth in the joint surface of the lateral femoral condyle extending to the edge of the condyle (Fig. c). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an ACL and superficial MCL tears combined with a huge depression fracture in the injured knee (Fig. d, e).\nFour weeks after injury, arthroscopy was performed at the same hospital. The arthroscopy revealed that the patient had an ACL rupture, a large cartilage injury, and a huge depression fracture on the lateral femoral condyle. Superficial MCL was repaired with a suture anchor. Eight weeks after injury, this patient was referred to our hospital. We decided a two-staged surgery which was ACL reconstruction with MACI implantation and an iliac bone graft. First, we conducted an arthroscopically assisted cartilage harvest for MACI procedure from the medial edge of the femoral trochlea of the ipsilateral knee joint []. Briefly, under general anesthesia, approximately 800 mg of cartilage tissue was harvested. The cartilage tissue was sent to the facility (Japan Tissue Engineering Co., Ltd., Gam",

On arrival he was examined by the emergency department registrar and found to have a tender left shoulder, with bizarre skin puckering overlying his proximal humerus anteriorly (Fig. ). The skin lesion measured approximately 2cm in diameter and was very tender to palpation. The patient was unable to move his left shoulder due to pain.\nHe was noted to have intact motor and sensory function of his Axillary, Radial, Median and Ulnar nerves. Initial radiographs were performed which demonstrated a minimally displaced transverse fracture through the surgical neck of the left humerus (Fig. ).\nThe attending emergency department registrar then attempted to reduce the skin defect but various attempts were unsuccessful, which prompted referral to the on-call orthopaedic team. The skin defect was examined by the authors and thought to be entrapped skin \u2018button-holed\u2019 into the fracture site. This was very unusual given the minimally displaced nature of the fracture.\nThe patient was taken to theatre emergently and the fracture was manipulated under general anaesthesia. The fracture was distracted with manual in-line traction and counter-traction with slight external rotation. The incarcerated skin was freed with difficulty by applying lateral traction to the skin whilst simultaneously sweeping a finger under the defect. This allowed the underlying fascia to be unhitched from the fracture site. The skin was released without causing any further trauma.

    "cleaned_text": "our patient was a 58 year old man with a background of heavy smoking and alcohol excess, who presented to our local emergency department complaining of left arm pain following a fall out of a ground floor window the previous night. on arrival he was examined by the emergency department registrar and found to have a tender left shoulder, with bizarre skin puckering overlying his proximal humerus anteriorly (fig. ). the skin lesion measured approximately 2cm in diameter and was very tender to palpation. the patient was unable to move his left shoulder due to pain.\nhe was noted to have intact motor and sensory function of his axillary, radial, median and ulnar nerves. initial radiographs were performed which demonstrated a minimally displaced transverse fracture through the surgical neck of the left humerus (fig. ).\nthe attending emergency department registrar then attempted to reduce the skin defect but various attempts were unsuccessful, which prompted referral to the on-call orthopaedic team. the skin defect was examined by the authors and thought to be entrapped skin 'button-holed' into the fracture site. this was very unusual given the minimally displaced nature of the fracture.\nthe patient was taken to theatre emergently and the fracture was manipulated under general anaesthesia. the fracture was distracted with manual in-line traction and counter-traction with slight external rotation. the incarcerated skin was freed with difficulty by applying lateral traction to the skin whilst simultaneously sweeping a finger under the defect. this allowed the underlying fascia to be unhitched from the fracture site. the skin was released without causing any further trauma. the skin appeared viable despite being incarcerated for over twelve hours (fig. ). the fracture was then reduced by releasing the traction and reversing the external rotation. satisfactory check radiographs were obtained.\nthe patient was placed into a collar and cuff sling and allowed home, he attended his next two fracture clinic follow-up appointments where serial radiographs demonstrated",

On admission she was afebrile, with a BP of 146/79, and pulse of 110. On examination of the abdomen she had distension with lower abdominal tenderness. Abdominal XR showed dilated small and large bowel loops. The WCC (White Cell Count) was raised at 12.6, with CRP of 54 & bilirubin of 34. A CT scan of the abdomen showed large bowel obstruction thought to be secondary to a sigmoid carcinoma. A solid mass in the right adnexa was also noted and thought to be either a primary ovarian tumour or metastatic deposit. No distant disease was seen.\nAfter a period of resuscitation, a laparotomy was performed. The large bowel obstruction was found to be secondary to a \"sigmoid tumour\". The uterus and right ovary were abnormal and were \"fixed\" to the upper rectum distal to the tumour. The appendix was noted to be abnormal with palpable ileocaecal lymph nodes. A low Hartman's was performed with en-bloc total hysterectomy and bilateral salpigo-oophorectomy. A separate Ileocaecal resection with end ileostomy was also performed. Postoperatively the patient made an uneventful recovery and she was discharged home two weeks later.\nMacroscopic examination of the specimen showed an appendix measuring 40 mm in length and up to 15 mm in diameter. Microscopic examination showed invasive high grade adenocarcinoma of appendiceal origin showing diffuse infiltration of the wall of the appendix and the caecum with serosal extension. Metastatic tumour was seen in 2 out of 9 ileocaecal lymph nodes. Distant metastatic carcinoma was also shown to involve the wall of the distal sigmoid colon with stricture formation and infiltration of the adherent uterus, cervix, both ovaries and right fallopian tube.\nImmunohistochemistry showed that in all areas of tumour infiltration identical staining was identified.

Additionally, there was patchy loss of sensation to the anterior right thigh and the dorsum of the right foot. A Doppler ultrasound of the right groin was performed which revealed a 2 cm false aneurysm in the right groin medial to the right common femoral artery.
