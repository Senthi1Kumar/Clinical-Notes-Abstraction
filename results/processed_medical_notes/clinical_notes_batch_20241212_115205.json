    "original_text": "The case refers to a 72-year-old Caucasian woman, diagnosed in 1995 (at the age of 58) with a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the left lateral border of the tongue (). The patient underwent hemiglossectomy associated with an en bloc resection of the corresponding lateral floor of the mouth and conservative neck dissection. Postoperative microscopic examination of the specimen revealed a multifocal low grade carcinoma and one lymph node metastasis (pT1pN1pMx G1). The resulting tissue defect was primarily closed with local flaps, and a 6-week postoperative radiotherapy (60 Gy) was delivered. Five months after the primary surgery the patient noted a swelling in the right lateral neck. A submandibular fine-needle aspiration was performed confirming the diagnosis of \u201cmetastatic carcinoma.\u201d The patient was then treated with a right conservative neck dissection associated with resection of the submandibular gland. After this second intervention, no signs of recurrent disease were observed, and the patient was rehabilitated with a resin removable partial prosthesis anchored to the remaining teeth. During the following years, the patient lived healthy but lost her teeth due to periodontal disease with the resultant impossibility to wear the prosthesis.\nThe patient was then referred to our department needing a new prosthesis.

A gradually enlarging tissue mass was identified as a lymph node by the lesser curvature of the stomach on plain CT in June 2017. The patient had already undergone an endoscopic examination of the upper digestive tract in February of that year and was diagnosed with chronic atrophic gastritis, but no neoplastic lesions had been identified. The patient, who had no complaints, was referred to a gastroenterologist in July 2017. He underwent an enhanced CT study of the abdomen with a venous bolus injection of contrast medium. A tissue mass that measured 18 \u00d7 15 mm was observed adjacent to the lesser curvature of the stomach, and there was no communication with the gastric wall. Enhanced CT showed homogeneous, high enhancement of the tissue mass in the early phase that was attenuated but prolonged after 120 seconds (Fig. ). The findings of predominant enhancement during the arterial phase suggested the possibility of a paraganglioma, a solitary aneurysm, an extragastrointestinal stromal tumor (EGIST), Castleman disease, a solitary fibrous tumor, or a splenotic nodule. Based on the high and homogenous enhancement pattern, the location of the tissue mass, and the lack of a past history of trauma, we suspected a paraganglioma, an aneurysm, or an EGIST. Annual plain abdominal CT had been performed since 2013, and we reviewed all of these previous scans.

Clinically, the masses were on the palmar aspect of the left third and fifth distal phalanges.

Despite this, the vertebrobasilar angiography was not remarkable (). Next, a balloon occlusion test was performed in the right ICA. After expanding the balloon, the control angiography disclosed the anterior communicating artery in well patent, in addition to the posterior communicating arteries, which were also were patent but small in size. The basilar artery system was connected with the right internal carotid system by another two persistent anastomoses, which supplied a continuous blood supply to the giant aneurysm and then to the distal end of the right ICA (). Consequently, the right cerebral hemisphere was likely in well perfusion based on these communication channels. Moreover, the patient passed the balloon occlusion test. As for the anastomoses, one arose from the aneurysm sac, near the normal origin of the meningohypophyseal trunk (), and joined the basilar artery near the junction of the middle and upper thirds (). As described in multiple studies, this represents the PTA (-). Another anastomoses was smaller in caliber than the PTA, and arose from the basal part of the giant aneurysm, but joined the basilar artery at the caudal point (). Moreover, it was clearly visualized after occlusion of the PTA with detachable coils under general anesthesia on another day ().

Unfortunately, the lesion re-appeared on the distal aspect of the right thumb stump in August of 2017. The patient had no significant past medical history and was not on any medications.\nOn physical examination the patient had a 1.8cm by 1.3cm well circumcised indurated lesion over the dorsum of his right thumb stump (). The mass was firm, non-tender, and mobile over the deep structures. The patient had no palpable lymphadenopathy. The patient was then sent for a metastatic workup, which involved a computer tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and a bone scan. The CT scan indicated a positive enlarged lymph node in his ipsilateral axilla that was presumed to represent a metastasis.\nThe patient subsequently underwent a surgical excision in August of 2017 of the eccrine porocarcinoma of the thumb with an amputation at the level of the distal interphalangeal joint, and fine needle aspiration of the ipsilateral enlarged axillary node. A wide margin of 2.0 cm was used to ensure margins were clear of the tumor on the thumb.

The detailed history revealed total maxillectomy was done to resect sarcoma 1 month ago []. The patient was on Ryle's feed. Surgical reconstruction was attempted with the right side of the face as donor site, but was unsuccessful []. On examination, the oral nasal communication was evident []. Healing mucosa with no clinical evidence of recurrence of the lesion, loss of soft tissue support, were noted. The goal of the treatment was not only to provide an obturator to close the defect but also to discontinue nasal feed and facilitate oral feeding. The choice of the interim obturator to treat the defect was clear, but the method of retention of the prosthesis remained a challenge. This was over come by the innovative use of an orthodontic facebow. The patient desired to have a prosthesis that would facilitate his swallowing function without regurgitation, and not to have the prosthesis retained in the mouth. Hence, a prosthesis that can be worn during feeding and removed for the rest of the time to facilitate soft tissue healing was planned. The orthodontic facebow and the brackets to retain the head gear would accomplish the requirement of clinical situation. The subsequent appointments and the procedure were done as follows. In the first appointment, an alginate impression was made []. The cast was poured with dental stone, and a denture base was fabricated using a light-cured acrylic sheet. Occlusal rims were fabricated on this denture base [Figure and ]. The denture base served the dual purpose of the special tray that was used to record the maximum supporting area using a soft liner [] and to record the jaw relation [Figure and ].

Preoperative TEE revealed subaortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 42 mmHg and septal hypertrophy. Cardiac catheterization revealed normal coronary arteries with an ejection fraction of 60%.\nShe was offered alcohol septal ablation but elected to receive extensive transaortic septal myectomy with two bypass runs, and TEE showed no septal defect, peak gradient across the left ventricular outflow tract at 3 mmHg in the operating room. The patient later became progressively hypotensive requiring vasopressor support and remained hypoxic in the intensive care unit (ICU). Bedside TEE showed a new VSD about 14 mm in size with left to right shunt and lay behind the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve []. The patient was taken back to the operating room emergently. The delayed presentation of VSD was unclear and might be related to damage to the perforator artery of the septum and continued myocardial infarction led to the creation of VSD. Bovine pericardium patch repair was attempted to fix this defect surgically unsuccessfully after multiple cardiopulmonary bypass runs. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated, and the patient was transferred to ICU in a critical condition.\nInterventional cardiology was consulted for the possible transcatheter closure of the defect, and the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Amplatzer muscular 14 mm VSD closure system was attempted through the right femoral vein without success utilizing a purely transcatheter technique.

The indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min was 21.8%. Child-Pugh score was A. The patient tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody. He had a history of excessive consumption of alcohol, and alcoholic liver damage was considered as a possibility. Partial hepatectomy with segments IV + V and cholecystectomy with cystic duct-tube drainage were performed. Intraoperative findings indicated that the anterior branch of bile duct was exposed at the resected area, and some small bile ducts were ligated. On POD 1 following hepatectomy, bile leakage developed from the drain placed in the foramen of Winslow. CT showed fluid collection in the cavity between the liver and fistula to drain. Cholangiography via the endoscopic bile duct enhancement showed no communication between the common bile duct and abdominal cavity. Drip infusion cholangiography (DIC)-CT revealed the bile duct of the peripheral side. We maintained simple drainage to reduce the cavity.

According to the patient, a surgeon had attempted to resect the mass 12 years earlier, but could not do so due to excessive bleeding from the tumor. She was offered no further treatment.\nAt presentation, her main complaint was epigastric discomfort. She also gave a history of some mild back pain and occasional abdominal pain. Her appetite was good and she had not lost weight. There was no history of vomiting, change in bowel habits or melena.

These symptoms had first appeared 1 year earlier and had worsened during the previous 3 months. Five years prior to presentation, he underwent a curettage and cavity filling cementation with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) cement for a chondroblastoma of the proximal tibia at another hospital. His postoperative course was uneventful and he continued to work at his job and performed light exercises comfortably. Approximately 5 years after surgery, the patient reported insidiously progressive knee pain with restricted range of motion, as well as intermittent clicking at various knee positions. He had no history of major knee trauma.\nPhysical examination revealed moderate swelling and pain around the knee joint without heating. The range of knee motion was restricted to an extension of -15\u00b0 and a flexion of 110\u00b0. Wasting of the quadriceps muscles was observed. Plain radiographs showed no evidence of local tumor relapse, but suggested intra-articular extension of PMMA. Computed tomography (CT) of the knee showed protrusion of cement into the knee joint through a broken subchondral bone and articular cartilage in both the medial and lateral tibial spines of the tibia and scraping of the lateral aspect of the intercondylar notch ().

    "original_text": "A 38-year-old woman, gravida 1, was referred to our hospital for further evaluation of a pharyngeal cyst of the fetus at 35 weeks gestation. Prenatal ultrasonography showed that the fetus had a 3 \u00d7 2\u00d72 cm hypoechoic simple cystic mass in the pharyngeal region, without signs of internal blood flow by Doppler examination (Fig. and ). Amniotic fluid volume was normal. Fetal MRI at 35 weeks gestation indicated the presence of a 3 \u00d7 3\u00d72 cm simple cystic mass on the left side of the posterior pharyngeal gap, a mass that showed marked extrinsic compression of the airway (Fig.). A prenatal diagnosis of pyriform sinus fistula was made on the basis of these findings. There was no family history of congenital malformation.\nThe prevention of asphyxia at birth was of such importance that the mode of delivery was discussed extensively, with combined input from obstetrics, neonatology, anesthesiology, and pediatric surgery. The ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure was adopted to manage airway access at birth. The cesarean section was performed at 37 weeks of gestation under deep maternal and fetal anesthesia. The fetus was delivered via the EXIT procedure, and the endotracheal tube was placed to establish the airway in the first attempt. Direct laryngoscopy showed a mass that demonstrated extrinsic compression of the airway at the level of the larynx. At that time, an opening of the pyriform sinus fistula was not observed. A male neonate weighting 2684 g, with Apgar scores of 5 and 6 at 1 and 5 min, respectively, was delivered with no apparent neck mass or visible cutaneous sinus.\nThe neonate was admitted immediately to the neonatal intensive care unit. On admission, ultrasonography showed a well-circumscribed hypoechoic mass lying adjacent to the left lobe of the thyroid.

The patient's vital signs at the time of admission indicated an O2 saturation level of 98% prior to receiving oxygen therapy, while all other vital signs appeared normal.\nThe patient's electrocardiography revealed normal sinus rhythm, short PR interval, and delta wave.\nTransthoracic echocardiography results showed normal left ventricle size and systolic function with mild CS dilation. A pulsatile echo-free space was observed at the interventricular septum base and posterior side of the left ventricle indicating a maximum diameter of 1.96 cm \u00d7 1.33 cm [ and Movie 1] which was connected through isthmus to the CS. Two-dimensional and color flow Doppler study results indicated that CS connection to the right atrium appeared to be atretic. The diagnosis was further confirmed using agitated saline injection. We did not observe any air bubbles entering from the right atrium into the CS during the agitated saline injection procedure [].\nThe accessory pathway electrophysiology procedure at the time of CS cannulation was challenging. Therefore, we elected to perform a coronary angiogram procedure which focused on the venous phase. Our evaluation showed the presence of CS atresia, diverticula (which was pulsatile echo-free space in echocardiography), and LSVC [].\nBased on our clinical investigations as described herein, we have determined that LSVC is the only pathway for CS blood drainage when considering the anatomy of the disease. We have successfully shown that the diseased anatomy is responsible for the incorrect and reversed blood drainage in the patient.

The patient was brought in by his acquaintances who reported headaches for two weeks along with vision changes and a slow decline in his mentation. His friends stated that the patient was becoming more tired and lethargic with a waxing and waning in mentation. Pertinent physical exam revealed Parinaud's syndrome with upward gaze palsy, diplopia, and unsteady gait. A CT scan was done in the emergency department that showed a pineal mass of 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3.5 mm in size along with obstructive hydrocephalus and dilatation of lateral and third ventricles without any evidence of bleeding. The patient also had an episode of seizure in the emergency department and was administered a loading dose of Keppra 1000 mg and a maintenance dose of 500 mg twice a day intravenously. The patient was then admitted to the neurological critical care unit for further monitoring.\nNeurosurgery evaluated the patient and recommended to bolus 10 mg of IV dexamethasone and with the maintenance of 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent expansion and reduction of the cytotoxic edema from the mass effect. Given his symptoms of obstructive hydrocephalus with increased ICP of 22 mmHg, an endoscopic ventricular drain was placed for the drainage to relieve the pressure by the neurosurgeon. MRI of the brain revealed a pineal mass causing obstructive hydrocephalus via the compression of the cerebral aqueduct likely from a possible underlying intracranial germ cell tumor (, image R to L).

Computed tomography (CT) showed that the tumor was enhanced during the arterial phase and washed out during the portal phase, and the tumor pressed the right anterior branch to the main branch of Glisson and the middle hepatic vein; hence, the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma was made (Fig. ). The indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min was 21.8%. Child-Pugh score was A. The patient tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody. He had a history of excessive consumption of alcohol, and alcoholic liver damage was considered as a possibility. Partial hepatectomy with segments IV + V and cholecystectomy with cystic duct-tube drainage were performed. Intraoperative findings indicated that the anterior branch of bile duct was exposed at the resected area, and some small bile ducts were ligated. On POD 1 following hepatectomy, bile leakage developed from the drain placed in the foramen of Winslow. CT showed fluid collection in the cavity between the liver and fistula to drain. Cholangiography via the endoscopic bile duct enhancement showed no communication between the common bile duct and abdominal cavity. Drip infusion cholangiography (DIC)-CT revealed the bile duct of the peripheral side. We maintained simple drainage to reduce the cavity. On POD 19, this patient had fever and CT revealed that the fluid collection has increased (Fig. ). Percutaneous drainage to the cavity near the liver cut surface was performed. Cholangiography via the c-tube did not show the anterior branch of the bile duct. Fistulogram from the drainage tube at the abdominal cavity showed the bile duct at segments V and VIII (Fig. ).

The patient had a 40-year history of a yellow patch-like lesion on the same site with an irregular surface accompanied by itching and hair loss. The size of the lesion had not changed over time but had suddenly begun to grow 4 months before.\nOn physical examination, the patient had a hard, palpable, immobile mass measuring 7\u00d77 cm accompanied by bleeding, discharge, an irregular surface and a red ulcer on the left anterior scalp (). The patient also had bilateral palpable masses on the parotid gland and cervical lymph nodes. The patient had no specific underlying disease or family history of cancer. Due to the rapid growth of the mass, a malignant tumor was suspected.\nFor further evaluation, a punch biopsy and computed tomography (CT) were performed. On CT scans, the patient had an exophytic, heterogeneously enhancing mass measuring 6.9 cm, accompanied by multiple masses on both parotid glands and the posterior neck (). On punch biopsy, there were signs that were suggestive of SC. The patient received a whole-body CT scan and a positron emission tomography scan for evaluation of distant metastases. However, no metastases were observed other than those to the parotid and cervical lymph nodes. The patient was therefore suspected of having SC of the scalp with lymph node metastases. The patient was planned for surgery but was lost to follow-up due to financial constraints.\nAt 3 months, the patient returned to us with bleeding from the scalp mass whose size had increased to 11\u00d711 cm ().

He was taken to a nearby hospital where X-rays of the knee were done; no abnormality was noticed and was prescribed analgesics. Symptoms worsened after 2 days when he developed deformity of knee and inability to bear weight on the affected side. He was then taken to a different hospital where he was diagnosed to have a foreign body in his knee and referred to our institution for further management. He gave no history of locking or giving away sensation.\nOn examination, the left knee was in 30 degrees flexion, supra-patellar fullness and mild effusion was noted. An oblique skin laceration of 1x1 cm was noted lateral to the patella (). There was no active discharge from the wound or local raise of temperature. Tenderness was noted around the knee. The skin overlying the knee joint appeared normal. Boy was unable to move his knee due to pain and did not allow us to examine him thoroughly.\nAntero-posterior and lateral radiographs of the knee done 5 days prior to admission showed a radio-opaque shadow measuring about 1x1 cm in the supero-lateral quadrant of the knee, residing in the superficial planes, perhaps in the subcutaneous tissues (). This explains the child not having symptoms for the first 4 days.

The first and second removals of the tumor via open surgery remained as Simpson grade IV because of hardening of the tumor and adhesion to surrounding structures including the SSS. The remaining tumor massively recurred within 1 year after the last discharge despite \u03b3-knife radiosurgery following the second tumor removal (\n). We attempted removal of the tumor combined with SSS resection because obstruction of the SSS caused by the developed tumor was confirmed. The tumor was consequently removed as Simpson grade II. The residual tumor, including the dural tail sign, was not observed on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (\n). The third histopathological result showed an atypical meningioma, World Health Organization (WHO) grade II.

Therefore, he took 0.5 mg of dexamethasone tablet twice a day to increase his weight, although we do not have any written proof that he had taken the medications that he claims. He started taking these tablets as he thought he would look good on gaining weight. Although there was no preoccupation with weight or body image, he was not even spending excessive time thinking about his looks. There was no interference with his social life or his work. He took dexamethasone tablets for 2 months and had a weight gain of around 3 kg and also suffered mild gastritis, although not documented. Subsequently, he could not take the tablets for 2 days and on the second day he experienced GTCS characterized by tonic, clonic movements with up-rolling of eyes and tongue bite with loss of consciousness. There was also postictal drowsiness for 30 min. After the first seizure, he had gone to the emergency department of a nearby hospital, then dilantinzed exact details of which are not available, and he did not follow-up there and he did not even inform them about his steroid intake. Thereafter, assuming that the episode was due to missing medications, he again started taking the dexamethasone tablets, but at a dose of 0.5 mg once a day. After taking these tablets for 1 month, he again missed doses for 2 days and on the second day had a GTCS. Subsequently, he reported to the hospital outpatient department.

Intraoperative pathologic assessment on frozen sections was consistent with osteosarcoma: pleomorphic spindle cells with nuclear atypia and associated osteoid. Staging was completed with computed tomography (CT) of the chest and a whole-body bone scan. The chest CT demonstrated two 1-mm nodules of indeterminate significance and the bone scan showed uptake only in the left femur. The final pathology confirmed the diagnosis of conventional osteosarcoma. The case was presented at the multidisciplinary sarcoma tumor board, and the patient began neoadjuvant chemotherapy 2 weeks after initial presentation.

    "original_text": "We present a case of a 70-year old Caucasian gentleman who underwent a living donor renal transplant 10 years ago following a diagnosis of glomerulonephritis aged 34. More recently, he had developed acute heart failure manifested by bilateral leg oedema, facial oedema and difficulty in breathing together with severe and difficult to control hypertension with wide pulse pressures. Biochemistry at the time of presentation revealed Cr 190 mmol/L and eGFR 27\u201332.\nThe patient had past history of several transplant biopsies performed to investigate repeated rise in serum creatinine level over the last 10 years. Clinically, there was audible bruit over the right side of the lower abdomen. Ultrasound, CT angiography scan and subsequently catheter angiography demonstrated very high flow arterial venous fistula within the transplanted organ (Fig. ), likely to be the cause of the patients symptoms of decompensated heart failure. The main transplant artery and veins, as well as all intra renal branches were aneurysmal with extreme tortuosity, especially in the intra renal vessels. The maximum diameter of the main transplant artery was 12 mm with relative narrowing at the origin. Other salient findings were ectatic and tortuous iliac vessels (Fig. ). Given the decompensated heart failure being caused as a result of the high flow AVF, patient planned for super-selective embolisation of the arterio-venous communication under interventional radiology.\nInformed consent was obtained and patient readmitted for elective super selective renal transplant embolization, to be performed under general anaesthesia in order to control the patient\u2019s haemodynamic status. Given the knowledge of high flow through the AVM, plans were made to make both arterial and venous punctures. The contralateral left common femoral artery was punctured under ultrasound guidance and 6F sheath was inserted and positioned in the right common iliac artery.

The patient reported atypical chest pain intermittently upon awakening but denies any palpitations or dyspnea. The patient had been diagnosed with a cardiac abnormality and murmur at birth, but she believed the murmur and abnormality had resolved. The patient was previously diagnosed with mild developmental delay, hyperthyroidism, and asthma. She lives with her parents and denies any alcohol or drug use. There was no family history of congenital heart disease. Clinical examination revealed a 3/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border radiating to the apex. A continuous, high-pitched, and diastolic murmur was also were noted at the left sternal border.\nThe transthoracic echocardiogram showed an intracardiac shunt from the right coronary sinus of Valsalva to the right atrium creating inward movement towards the right atrium of the tricuspid valve during systole. The echocardiogram also revealed mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation, right atrial enlargement, and right and left ventricles with normal size and function. Cardiac computed tomography angiography was obtained for better anatomical delineation of the abnormality, which showed presumably no evidence of coronary artery obstruction and a small ventricular septal defect in the mid-septum. The sinuses of Valsalva were found to be prominent with communication between the right coronary sinus at its base and the right ventricle (Figures and ). The computed tomography of the chest was unremarkable.\nThe patient underwent a right and left cardiac catheterization with aortography. The coronary angiography demonstrated a fistula between the proximal circumflex artery and the pulmonary artery (PA) (). Left ventriculography was normal.

    "original_text": "A 60-year-old male, ex-smoker, presented to the emergency department complaining of right colicky pain and high-grade fever 24 hours after being subjected to ESWL. Patient underwent an abdominal ultrasound revealing urolithiasis on the right side along with minimal urine stasis in the right renal pelvis. He was subjected to prophylactic antibiotic coverage and pigtail placement under fluoroscopic guidance with subsequent remission of fever and pain. Forty-eight hours later he complained of acute onset of sharp epigastric pain reflecting to the lumbar region. His physical examination revealed tenderness over the epigastrium with no abdominal palpable mass. The arterial pressure was mildly elevated (140\u201390 mmHg) and his pulses were 60 bpm. His lab workout revealed a blood count and a basic metabolic panel within normal limits, with the exception of WBC and CRP which were moderately increased. An abdominal duplex ultrasound was performed revealing a flap in the superior mesenteric artery. The CT angiogram of thoracic and abdominal aorta demonstrated an isolated superior mesenteric artery dissection, starting from its orifice, without SMA branch involvement (). Both true and false lumens were patent (). The diameters of the infrarenal aorta and superior mesenteric artery were normal. Additionally, the aorta and the iliac arteries were found abundant of atheromatous plaques.\nThe patient was transferred to our vascular department. We decided to start a medical treatment consisting of food and liquid restriction, close surveillance, intravenous administration of beta-blockers, and antithrombotic therapy with unfractionated heparin. After 10 hours the patient's symptoms had diminished and subsided 24 hours later. Liquid restriction was halted on the third day and food restriction on the fourth day of admission to our department. No signs of bowel ischemia were reported during the patient's stay in our department. On the seventh day of admission, the patient underwent a CT angiography revealing no change in the arterial dissection. The patient was discharged ten days after admission and was advised to receive warfarin orally and to undergo a follow-up CT angiography one month later.",
