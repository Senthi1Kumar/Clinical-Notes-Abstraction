Two years prior to this study, the abdominal ultrasonography of the patient showed an upper abdominal hypoechoic nodule, suggesting an enlarged lymph node. One and a half years prior to this study, the contrast-enhanced CT suggested that the liver and stomach space contained an irregular mass, suggesting lymphoma. One month prior to this study, the patient had pain in the right hypochondrial region with no obvious causes; the pain was intermittent and radiated to the umbilicus, with self-remission. The mass appeared in the right upper quadrant, and increased in size rapidly. After physical examination, one-7 cm mass could be felt in the right upper quadrant, and the texture was medium. In laboratory tests, there was elevated blood glucose antigen 125, 316.9 U/mL (reference value, 0.0 \u2013 35.0 U/mL). The routine abdominal CT and contrast-enhanced CT showed that a lobulated soft tissue mass was in the liver and stomach space with a size of approximately 7.7 \u00d7 14.2 cm2; the internal density was slightly heterogeneous, and the boundary was still clear. In CT arterial phase, the peripheral part of the mass had slight reinforcement. Gross vascular features were seen in the center of the lesion. During the portal phase and delay phase, there was progressive enhancement of lesions and reinforcement came from the center to the surrounding progress, showing a centrifugal reinforcement (Fig. ). Other manifestations included chronic liver disease, splenomegaly, ascites, a cavernous transformation of the portal vein, and a collateral circulation opening.

The patient was referred to psychiatry outpatient department from the plastic surgery department for clearance for rhinoplasty surgery. Patient was interviewed in detail and his history dated back to 17 years of age when he was in his final year of schooling. He started noticing pimples and acne on his face, which embarrassed him to face his peers. He observed that few of the acne cleared, but few on the face left black marks and those on the nose turned into comedones. Most of them cleared with the treatment from a dermatologist. But the patient's concern with the healed scars on the face and nose started increasing and he started becoming preoccupied with them. He felt embarrassed to face his classmates and would feel shy to face the public or relatives visiting his house.\nThe patient adopted measures like covering his nose with his hands while speaking to others or while listening to the lectures in the class so as to hide the marks. Over a period of time, he started developing rituals such as repeatedly watching his nose in the mirror, frequently washing his face after he returns back home from outside, applying powder over the nose to cover up the imagined area of scars on the nose, and trying to reshape his nose on his own using a stone, which resulted in bleeding and worsening of the condition.\nThe patient developed anxiety in social situations because of his referential thinking involving his imagined ugly appearance. He also developed misinterpretations of other people's behavior and comments linking them to his facial disfigurement.

He was suspected of having a central nervous system disorder and underwent head brain CT that showed a 50 \u00d7 50 mm mass lesion in the right frontal lobe (fig. ). His chest X-ray showed a mass shadow with a cavity in the right-middle lung field (fig. ). The chest CT also showed a 70 \u00d7 68 mm mass with a cavity in the right lower lobe (fig. ). The level of tumor markers like carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin 19 fragments and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide were not elevated. Based on these clinical findings, the patient was diagnosed with lung cancer with a single brain metastasis.\nCraniotomy was performed because the patient's central nervous system's symptoms were severe and his Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was zero. The brain tumor in the right frontal lobe was completely removed, and the pathological diagnosis was confirmed as sarcomatoid pattern carcinoma. A CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy proved that the pathological diagnosis of the right lung mass was spindle cell carcinoma. The patient was therefore diagnosed as having pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung with a single brain metastasis (clinical T3N0M1b stage IV).\nAfter craniotomy, the patient underwent 6 courses of chemotherapy (carboplatin AUC 4 on day 1 and gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, repeated every 3 weeks). After chemotherapy, the chest CT showed a reduced nodular shadow (62 \u00d7 50 mm) (fig. ), while 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed no uptake in the lymph nodes (data not shown). The patient achieved a partial response by preoperative chemotherapy and underwent a right-lower lobectomy, partial resection of a right S2 segment, parietal pleurectomy, and mediastinal lymph node dissection through a posterolateral thoracotomy. This surgery was required because of the possibility of invasion into the right upper lobe and the parietal pleura.\nMacroscopically, the tumor was 64 \u00d7",

She was a known case of hypertension and osteoarthritis of both knees, and had a positive family history for ischemic heart disease. On examination, the first and second heart sounds were normal and a III/VI systolic murmur was heard at the apex with radiation to the left axilla.\nUpon investigating, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed thickened rolled up and prolapsed anterior mitral leaflet with severe mitral regurgitation (MR). A Trans-Esophageal Echocardiography (TEE) revealed thickened anterior mitral valve leaflet with rolled up margins, forming an aneurysm, with severe mitral regurgitation but no rupture of sub-valvular apparatus (Figs. and ). The posterior leaflet was also thickened with rolled up tips with mild prolapse of P1/P3. Mitral valve annulus measured about 42 mm. A diagnosis of mitral valve aneurysm along with severe MR was made, with prolapse of both leaflets and a grade II left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.\nSubsequently, an elective surgery was scheduled for mitral valve repair +/\u2212 replacement. Median sternotomy approach was taken. Cardiac arrest was achieved with antegrade cardioplegia, under cardiopulmonary bypass and the usual state of moderate hypothermia was maintained. Mitral valve was approached through the left atrium and the findings of anterior mitral leaflet aneurysm were confirmed. The severely thickened valve was grossly evaluated again and assessed for repair but it was not possible due to severely distorted leaflets, hence most of the anterior leaflet and part of the posterior leaflet had to be excised (Fig. ), and replaced with a Hancock II 29 mm valve.

He had undergone fracture stabilization by internal fixation at another institution before being referred to our outpatient clinic. After serial debridements, a soft tissue defect that constituted 70% of tibial surface was produced (Fig. a, b). There was hypoesthesia in dermatomes of the deep peroneal, superficial peroneal and saphenous nerves. Angiography revealed the tibialis posterior vessel was occluded due to thrombosis. The tibialis anterior artery was patent and could be seen through the whole of its course. Three weeks after the initial injury, a combined latissimus dorsi with serratus anterior muscle flap was harvested using a posterior axillary incision. The pedicles of latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior were dissected up to the thoracodorsal artery (Fig. ). The muscles were carried to the right lower extremity defect area, and an end to end anastomosis was performed to the posterior tibial artery and vein of the contralateral leg. A split thickness skin graft was used to cover the muscle flap.\nAn above-knee plaster cast was applied for immobilization. Patient was immobilized in this position for 25 days. After the second week, the pedicle was constricted with a clamp and penrose drain for 15 min (Fig. ). The clamping time was increased by 15 min on each consequent day. On the last 2 days, the pedicle was clamped for 2 h and bleeding was assessed by a needle prick test. Return of bright red blood in the distal part of the flap was taken as a sign for sufficient circulation. The pedicle was divided on the 25th day.

On physical examination, a 2/6 systolic heart murmur on the middle left sternal border and mild cyanosis (O2 saturation=80% by pulse oximetry) were the only findings. Her blood pressure and heart rate were 110/70 mmHg and 100 bpm, respectively. She had no history of stroke, dyspnea, dizziness, and syncope. Electrocardiography was normal, and there was no finding in favor of the enlargement of any chamber. Chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly with normal pulmonary vascular markings. Her hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were 14 g/dL and 41%, respectively. Transthoracic 2D echocardiography, via the segmental approach, demonstrated the normal continuation of the inferior vena cava to the right atrium. However, the orifice of the RSVC to the right atrium could not be visualized. Instead, it seemed that the RSVC was draining into the left atrium. The left atrium and the left ventricle were mildly enlarged (). The function of both ventricles was normal. Other echocardiographic findings were mild mitral regurgitation and trivial tricuspid regurgitation. The peak pressure gradient of the tricuspid regurgitation was 20 mm Hg, and there was mild pulmonary valve regurgitation. In addition, there were no intracardiac defects or shunts. The pulmonary veins were connected to the left atrium normally. The diagnosis was confirmed through contrast study with agitated normal saline. Injection via the left brachial vein showed the drainage of the SVC into the left atrium, no atrial septal defect, and no left SVC ( & ). Cardiac catheterization and angiography confirmed a systemic oxygen saturation rate of 80% and a normal pulmonary artery pressure (mean pulmonary artery pressure=15 mmHg).

The physical examination based on the walking analysis illustrated limited range of motion in addition to 55\u00b0 of increased femoral anteversion in either hips. From the data of walking analysis, physical examination and radiological findings, the increased femoral anteversion and excessive soft tissue contractures due to CP were considered the primary reason for her walking difficulty.

Bilateral distal femoral derotational osteotomy was then performed just above the metaphysis level with a lateral approach, and osteosynthesis was obtained by dynamic compression plate and screw fixation. Bilateral long leg casts were applied postoperatively to maintain osteosynthesis. The patient was discharged on the third post-operative day, casts were removed one month later and routine rehabilitative physiotherapy was instituted.\nAt one-year routine follow-up, there was complete union of the osteotomy. Although pre-operative radiographs of the right knee showed no evidence of any cystic or tumoral lesions around the distal femur (), the second-year follow-up radiographs revealed an asymptomatic large bone cyst in the distal part of the right femur. A computed tomography (CT) scan identified the lesion as a large cystic lesion located just above the lateral femoral condyle expanding from metaphysis to the femoral diaphysis involving the osteotomy site with cortical thinning (). The initial diagnosis was an aneurysmal bone cyst. To verify the diagnosis, an incisional biopsy was performed under general anaesthesia. Cortical bone was partially destroyed by the lesion",

Reconstruction was performed using plates and an artificial bone graft and autograft (normal iliac bone) to fill the cavity for the defect of the load surface of acetabulum after tumor curettage.

On physical examination, a firm mass measuring 2 cm \u00d7 2 cm and involving the inferior portion of the right epididymis was found. The left testicle, right testicle and left epididymis looked normal on physical examination. Laboratory studies showed normal complete blood count, serum creatinine, electrolytes and liver function tests. The results of testicular tumor markers, including \u03b1-fetoprotein and \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin were within the normal limits. Ultrasound examination of the scrotum, Doppler ultrasound and scrotal tomography examination, surgical exploration and histologic examination of frozen sections were performed. Ultrasound examination of the scrotum revealed a solid, hypoechoic mass measuring 2 cm \u00d7 2 cm \u00d7 3 cm in the tail of the right epididymis []. Doppler ultrasound examination showed moderate blood flow to the mass. The mass did not involve the left testicle. Indeed, the left testicle, right testicle and body of the epididymis were completely normal.\nThe epididymal mass was explored through a midline scrotal incision; a solid, encapsulated mass appearing at the tail of the epididymis was found. It was separated from the testis and did not extend into the cord. Surgical exploration revealed a discreet epididymal mass arising from a stalk, which was easily dissected from the epididymis. Histological examination of frozen sections of the mass suggested a benign spindle-cell proliferation. Given the histological findings, the decision was made to preserve the testicle and part of the epididymis while completely resecting the mass and contiguous epididymis. Final histological examination revealed a well-circumscribed mass composed of spindle cells with deeply eosinophilic, fibrillar cytoplasm []. No nuclear atypia, mitosis or necrosis were identified. Cells were arranged in intersecting fascicles. The appearance of a benign smooth-muscle tumor was confirmed by its strong cytoplasmic staining for desmin []. Ki-67 proliferation index was %2. The mass was classified as a pure leiomyoma arising",

Laboratory tests including complete blood counts, liver function test (LFT) and blood chemistry were normal. Anti-hydatic cyst antibody test was negative. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was high (62 mm/h) and culture for enterococcus was positive.

The mass had septa and calcification in its inferior part. Using contrast enhancement, no abnormal vessel or enhancement was noted (). Thus the patient underwent a semi-elective operation. During the operation, a huge cystic structure was discovered filled with thick, brownish secretions in retroperitoneal area.

Postoperative course was uneventful; the patient was discharged on day 3, and had remained asymptomatic during the follow-up period of 4 years.\nOn gross examination, the specimen consisted of an opened creamy brown ovoid cystic lesion, measuring 10 x 8 x 7 cm with irregular surface. On opening internal surface was brownish and irregular, wall thickness from 0.2 cm to 1.5 cm. The cyst was submitted for microscopic examination.\nHistological sections showed fragments of cystic wall, lined by bronchial type pseudostratified cylindrical epithelium resting on fibrovascular connective tissue containing extensive foci of mononuclear inflammatory cells aggregates and presence of smooth muscle fascicles.

The urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracolumbar spine disclosed an abnormal sizeable mixed hypo- and hyperintensed lesions on T1 and T2 [Figure \u2013] at multiple spinal levels. Eccentrically, the lesions did not seem to cause compressive effect onto the spinal cord. The conservative management was opted after noting the harmless looking lesions on the MRI. Two weeks of regular analgesia and physiotherapy in neurointensive care were given, but the lower limbs weakness recovered partially to grade 3 with more intense pain at the back. She remained bed bound and was unable to urinate and therefore was catheterized. At the same time she started to complain of right subcostal and lower pelvic pain, which were tender; further investigation revealed two cystic lesions in the liver and her ovaries. Our initial provisional diagnosis was either a traumatic or vascular malformation-induced spinal hematoma, or spinal metastases. Nonetheless, history did not favor the second provisional diagnosis. Since the recovery was partial and the diagnosis was doubtful, we decided to proceed with laminectomy at lesional site of T9-T11.\nLaminectomy was completed from T9 to T11 and the intraoperative finding is shown in . The histopathological diagnosis was arachnoiditis. The surgery was uneventful and she was discharged home with regular follow-ups.

At last examination, visual acuity was 0.05 cm in the right eye and counting fingers at 50 cm in the left eye, while intraocular pressure was 17 mmHg in the right eye and 16 mmHg in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination revealed pseudophakia and clear cornea in the right eye and posterior subcapsular cataract in the left eye. On fundus examination, cellophane maculopathy, laser scars in the periphery, and macular edema were observed in the right eye. Laser scars and macular microhemorrhages were observed in the left eye. Bilateral cystoid macular edema was noted on OCT. No response was achieved despite 4 bilateral intravitreal ranibizumab injections, so the decision was made to administer dexamethasone implants. Slit-lamp examination at 1-month follow-up after dexamethasone implantation revealed corneal edema and the dexamethasone implant was seen in the anterior chamber of the right eye (). Using a 23-G catheter and anterior chamber maintainer, the implant was moved from the anterior chamber and directed to the vitreous cavity through the zonular area. At follow-up 9 months after implantation, an increase in cystoid macular edema was observed and the patient was given a second dexamethasone implant. No complications related to the dexamethasone implant were noted during follow-up. Due to clinical and OCT findings of recurrent cystoid macular edema at 7-month follow-up, a third dexamethasone implant was administered ().

The patient developed a deep melting area that almost reached the choroid underlying the nasal sclera during follow-up and was referred to our clinic. The examination revealed full visual acuity bilaterally with normal biomicroscopy and retinal findings in the left eye. A scleral melt area with a diameter of 0.5\u20130.75 cm and extending almost to the choroid except for a thin membrane was present approximately 1 cm away from the limbus at the nasal section of the right eye. Normal vascularization was severely decreased in the defect starting from the limbus (Fig. ). It was decided to close the defect as the area was open to trauma.\nThe conjunctiva in the defect region of the right eye was dissected under retrobulbar anesthesia. The edges of the scleral defect were trimmed with a crescent knife to ensure donor tissue as the graft site would adhere easily. In the same eye, the conjunctiva and Tenon\u2019s capsule in the upper temporal region were then dissected. A partial thickness scleral graft about 0.75\u20131.00 cm and suitable for the defect region in size was then removed from the upper temporal region with a 45\u00b0 surgical knife. Dissection was performed with utmost care in order not to create scleromalacia in the area. The Tenon\u2019s capsule and conjunctiva in the region where the graft was taken were primarily closed with 8-0 vicryl. The removed graft was placed in the appropriate position so as to close the defect region and sutured with 8-0 vicryl. The Tenon\u2019s capsule and conjunctival tissue at the site of the sclera defect were freed with blunt dissection and sutured with 8-0 vicryl so as to close the entire defect region. There were no complications and surgery was ended with a subconjunctival gentamicin and dexamethasone injection",

Therapy with oral and later parenteral gold was provided for more than five years with very little clinical benefit. Following this, the patient was successfully treated with methotrexate for four years. MTX had to be terminated in 1999 due to MTX pneumonitis and leflunomide was started. Because of high disease activity and radiological progress (also with involvement of the atlantodental joint) treatment with etanercept was initiated in February 2000 with initially good response. At the end of 2001 an increase in RA activity could be observed and rituximab was applied within the framework of a local pilot study in the use of rituximab for RA February 2002. Altogether 4 infusions of rituximab were administered at weekly intervals in dosages of 375 mg/m2 under premedication with paracetamol (1000 mg) and clemastin (1 mg) without significant acute side effects. The preceding antirheumatic therapy with etanercept 25 mg twice weekly, leflunomide 20 mg and prednisolone 2.5 mg daily was continued. After rituximab therapy a measurable decrease of disease activity (decline of DAS28 from 5.7 to 4.4 after three months) was observed lasting up to 2007 with a DAS28 < 3 (Table ). In addition the radiological assessment showed no progression between 2002 and 2006. 25 months after rituximab therapy and 13 months after completed B-cell regeneration, pneumonia was diagnosed and treated successfully with antibiotics.

The patient first noticed pain and swelling soon after riding a bicycle one mile and walking for approximately two miles. The patient could not recall any direct impact on the area while riding or walking. He denied the use of any antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications.\nPhysical examination revealed a small region of ecchymosis along the superomedial left lower extremity and a soft, fluctuant mass just inferior to the ecchymosis.

The patient had no specific medical conditions within her family history. She had no prior history of alcohol consumption and she was a nonsmoker.\nThe patient first experienced symptoms of persistent diarrhea and abdominal pain in 1994. In 1997, she underwent comprehensive testing including stool cultures, gastroscopy, colonoscopy, and small bowel biopsy and numerous blood tests, which ultimately confirmed very active small bowel CD and a small patch of colitis at her terminal ilium, palpable hemorrhoids, lactase deficiency, and shallow duodenal ulcers.

He had initially undergone an open knee arthrodesis 50 years earlier for septic arthritis with a post-operative long rigid knee extension brace for 3 years. Conversion of the knee arthrodesis to a TKA was performed in 1997 at another hospital with a non-cemented cruciate sparing implant. The patella was not resurfaced. In the early post-operative period full knee extension and 75\u00b0 of active flexion was achieved. The outcome deteriorated after a few years with the patient developing worsening stiffness and increasing pain and for these reasons a TKA revision had already been recommended. At his presentation the left leg was 1 cm shorter than the right. The circumference of the left thigh 5 cm above the patella was 3.5 cm smaller than the right. The left knee was stable with a valgus alignment. All movements of the left knee caused pain. Full extension of the left knee but less than 20\u00b0 active flexion was seen with a mobile patella. There was no clinical evidence of knee sepsis or effusion. Radiographic evaluation showed the mechanical axis of the left lower limb was 188\u00b0. Patella baja and clear signs of loosening of both the femoral and tibial components were evident (Figure ). After obtaining informed consent in March 2008 the patient underwent to a revision TKA using a cemented semi-constrained prosthesis (Legion, Smith & Nephew, Memphis, Tennessee, USA). At operation a mid-line para-patellar approach was made partially detaching the anterior tibial tuberosity (6 cm long bone block) on the medial side. The osteotomy was subsequently reattached with 2 staples and reasorbable sutures. Intraoperatively polyethylene wear was seen in the lateral femoro-tibial compartment.

The patient did not have past history of inflammatory bowel diseases, hematological or rheumatic disorders. The patient was immediately admitted to the burn unit. She received debridement followed by split-thickness skin grafts, an artificial dermal graft, and autologous cultured epidermal sheet grafts five times during the next two months, during which most of the injured tissue was covered ().\nApproximately 80 days after the burn injury, multiple ulcers appeared on the trunk and right temporal area, and the lesions rapidly increased in both size and number (). The ulcers were located in regions once covered with split-thickness skin grafts together with autologous cultured epidermal sheet grafts. Finally, the patient received a sixth round of debridement and skin grafts on the 139th day. At that time, the white blood cell (WBC) count was 12,290/\u03bcl, with 73.5% neutrophils, and the CRP level was 10.32 mg/dl just prior to the operation. She was transferred to another hospital on the 158th day; however, multiple ulcers rapidly recurred in the grafted skin and donor sites. Therefore, she was readmitted to our hospital 17 days after the first discharge.\nUpon an examination, many punched-out ulcers were scattered along the trunk and donor sites on the back and thighs (), and some had fused to form irregularly shaped lesions ().

He suffered a fall about three years ago and did not receive any kind of treatment. A physical examination showed a 10\u00b0 varus deformity, a 25\u00b0 flexion contracture, and a limited amount of joint movement in the patient's right knee. There was no neurological damage. Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) images showed a malunited isolated medial condyle fracture in the coronal plane with an intra-articular incongruity (Figure ).\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no ligaments injury in the knee. We planned for corrective osteotomy of the medial femoral condyle (Figure ).\nThe knee was placed in the flexed position for skin incision. An anterior skin incision was made that extends 3 cm proximal to the patella to the tibial tubercle. The medial parapatellar arthrotomy was made 2 cm proximal to the patella, curving along the medial patella and parallel to the patellar ligament to the tibial tubercle, and the distal medial femoral condyle was exposed. An approximately 5-mm step was detected in the medial femoral condyle. The chondral structures, meniscus, and ligaments were in good shape. An osteotomy line was identified with fluoroscopy using two Kirschner wires. Then, corrective osteotomy was carried out carefully. Posterior soft tissue dissection was not performed to protect the blood supply of the femur medial condyle. Therefore, a difficulty was encountered in bringing the osteotomized medial condyle to an anatomical position.

The patient received her first BTX injection about six years ago, although details regarding the amounts and sites of injections were not available. She abandoned Dysport injection due to the finical problems. On physical examination, she has right torticollis, left laterocollis, head shaking and shoulder elevation with no other clinical problem. Her second injection was performed by the following dosages and sites: 200 U at right splenius capitis, 100 U at left sternocleidomastoid, 100 U at left scalen, 50 U at left splenius capitis and 50 U at left trapezius muscle.\nOn the 2nd following day, she sought dental care for mandibular molar root canal therapy. Inferior alveolar nerve block was performed by local administration of 1.8cc containing lidocaine 2% and 1:80,000 epinephrine. Dental procedure was uneventful and she was discharged with routine analgesic prescription. The patient suffered from difficulty with swallowing solid foods in a progressive manner that she was unable to drink 24 hours after IANB. Thereafter, she was admitted to the hospital for severe dysphagia. Supportive care initiated and she was kept NPO and received fluids by gastric gavage for five consecutive days. On hospital examination, she was mildly dysphonic; she had mild dystonia and cervical weakness and was totally unable to initiate to swallow when a spoon of water was distilled in her mouth.

    "original_text": "A 67-year-old woman presented with a six-year history of recurrent focal seizures with impaired consciousness suggesting a left hemispheric origin. The patient had a recent increase in the frequency of seizures with poor response to medical treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the onset of seizures revealed multiple heterogeneous intracranial lesions located in the ventral midbrain and in the left frontal white matter. The MRI features of the lesions were fairly similar, demonstrating hypointensity on T1- and T2-weighted images. The lesion in the left frontal lobe showed moderate contrast enhancement as well as a mild adjacent hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images. Minimal to no contrast enhancement was observed around the lesion in the brainstem (Figure ).\nComputed tomography (CT) demonstrated dense calcifications in the supratentorial lesion and peripheral calcifications in the brainstem mass (Figure ).\nOf note, the patient had a remote history of infection with multiple brain abscesses and a mycotic aneurysm of the right posterior cerebral artery. Reportedly, the infection occurred 30 years before the onset of seizures and was attributed to rheumatic heart disease and infective endocarditis. Her physical examination showed a partial right third cranial nerve palsy, which was the sequelae of her aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and a new right pronator drift. An MRI scan performed six months later showed interval growth of the left frontal mass and an increased area of T2-weighted hyperintensity in the adjacent brain (Figure ).\nBased on imaging characteristics of the lesions, the differential diagnosis included multiple cavernous malformations, calcified meningiomas, intracranial infections, and other less likely diagnoses, including primary osseous and chondroid malignant tumors (e.g. chondrosarcoma).

He had no symptomatology related to posterior fossa syndrome or increased intracranial pressure. Six weeks after the start of his symptoms, he developed urinary and bowel incontinence. During the physical examination, the boy was fully awake and cooperative. All cranial nerves were intact. His pupils were 2 mm, bilaterally equal and normally reacting to light. He had full extra-ocular movement with no nystagmus. There was no papilloedema. An examination of the upper extremities was normal. He had symmetrical lower limb weakness with muscle group power grade 1/5 distally and 3/5 proximally associated with hypotonia, absent reflexes and diminished sensations up to the L1 dermatome. His anal tone was reduced. Cauda equina syndrome was suspected, for which he underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the spine that revealed spinal canal filling and lesions in the thoracic and lumbar regions. At that stage, he was referred to our institution as a patient with a spinal tumor.\nUpon reviewing his spinal MRI, drop metastasis was suspected. A cranio-spinal MRI scan was performed, which showed a posterior fossa tumor associated with radiographic features of intracranial and spinal metastasis, (Figures A, B and A). This MRI feature was suggestive of medulloblastoma. Given the fact that the thoracolumbar pathology is mainly a diffuse process affecting cauda equina roots, which is probably not amenable to surgical removal, we decided to direct the surgical treatment to the primary posterior fossa tumor only. Therefore, he underwent a suboccipital craniotomy and subtotal resection of the posterior fossa tumor. Neuropathological examination of the resected specimen revealed features of classic medulloblastoma. The cells had primitive nuclei, which were packed without signs of differentiation (Figure A). Also, the tumor lacked any anaplastic or large cell features. The tumor cells were uniformly expressing synaptophysin",

His only significant medical history was that he had sustained a right hand fracture the year before. MEN-1 gene testing was performed and was negative. Given his hypercalcemia, the assessment by one endocrinologist was parathyroid adenoma versus four-gland hyperplasia and the patient was referred to ENT for surgical evaluation.\nOne primary ENT surgeon assumed care of the patient upon referral.

Given no localization, the patient underwent a four-gland exploration. Intraoperative findings showed two left sided normal parathyroids and a right inferior parathyroidectomy. Pathology of this lesion was consistent with parathyroid hyperplasia on permanent pathology. Postoperatively; however, he remained hypercalcemic.\nThe patient underwent a second neck exploration six months later after a repeat ultrasound showed a suspicious nodule in the right carotid sheath. At that surgery, venous intraoperative PTH sampling was performed which showed elevated levels in the left innominate vein and superior vena cava. Biochemical and radiologic evidence was conflicting. Even after this second exploration, postoperatively the patient continued to experience hypercalcemia and was maintained on Sensipar and 1,25-OH vitamin D.
