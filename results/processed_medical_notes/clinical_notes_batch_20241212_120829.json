He underwent cervical laminoplasty for cervical spondylotic myelopathy 8 years ago at a regional hospital. The initial MRI revealed the pannus at the retroodontoid. His doctor managed chronological MRI follow-up. The ventral compression of the brain stem and the myelopathy of the patient were getting worse. But the patient and his family did not want to receive surgery. After progression of the myelopathy, he was introduced to our department. When he was introduced to our department, neurological examination revealed spastic tetraparesis (MMT3-4/5), dominant in distal arms, and sensory disturbance with numbness but no brainstem sign. Dynamic x-rays revealed slight instability of the atlantoaxial joints. MRI showed severe compression of the ventral brain stem and upper spinal cord by soft mass and cystic lesion. Because of no severe atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD), and the presence of T2 high signal area at the tip of the dens, OCF at O\u2013C3 was performed first. Because the mass effect was only ventral and soft tissue with cyst, we expected the volume reduction of mass effect after fixation surgery and we did not perform C1 laminectomy. After first surgery, he started rehabilitation. Transient improvement of myelopathy was observed, but his symptoms were getting worse again. MRI at 21 postoperative days showed slight decrease of the cyst size and there was no instrumentation failure on CT. MRI at 40 postoperative days showed no change of compression, but weakness of his left leg started to stand out. A second surgery was scheduled. Transcervical decompression was performed under uniportal endoscope. Intraosseous approach was selected to reach the dorsal of the dens. The yellowish fibrous tissue was removed, and the cyst was opened. After decompression cyst wall pulsation was confirmed remarkably. Fluoroscope and corn beam CT by O-arm were both performed with contrast medium in the decompression area. Postoperative drainage was 50 mL in the first",

He had been using intravenous heroin and was lying supine on a floor for approximately 24 hours.\nUpon presentation to our emergency department, the patient had pain in his bilateral lower extremities and no appreciable motor function below the level of the knee. He was in mild distress with a temperature of 37\u00b0C, pulse of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 146/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Examination of the lower extremities revealed erythema and tension in the bilateral posterior thigh compartments. In contrast, the medial thigh compartments bilaterally along with all four leg compartments were soft. Gluteal and buttock compartments were soft and compressible bilaterally. Motor strength testing revealed 1/5 strength bilaterally with manual testing of ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, and knee flexion and extension. The patient was found to have bilateral sciatic nerve palsies, with no sensation bilaterally in the tibial nerve, deep and superficial peroneal nerve distributions. Both legs were warm and pink with brisk capillary refill along with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. Provocative testing demonstrated pain with passive range of motion of the knees bilaterally and no pain with passive ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Lab work was significant for a creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) of 231,360 U/L.\nGiven the high suspicion for compartment syndrome, the patient underwent compartment pressure testing via Stryker pressure monitor system. Diastolic blood pressure recording measured 75 mmHg. The right posterior thigh compartment measured 75 mmHg and left posterior thigh compartment measured 30 mmHg. Based on the history and physical examination findings, the patient was diagnosed with bilateral thigh compartment syndrome likely secondary to his recent IVDA",

There was no family history of thrombophilia and she had no other significant medical history, but received bilateral EVLA for treatment of varicose veins two months ago at other hospital.\nOn physical examination, her left leg circumferences were significantly increased compared with her right leg circumferences (left thigh 44 cm and left calf 35 cm vs. right thigh 41 cm and right calf 32 cm). Despite this finding, her motor function, sensory function, and pulses were all normal.

Computerized tomographic (CT) venography images indicated DVT from the left common iliac vein to the left deep femoral vein.\nWe performed inferior vena cava (IVC) filter insertion through a right internal jugular vein approach to prevent pulmonary embolism, and proceeded with angiography () and aspiration thrombectomy followed by catheter-directed thrombolysis for 12 hours with urokinase 80,000 IU/hr and heparin 500 IU/hr through a left popliteal vein access. After the first session of thrombolysis, we found improved blood flow, but still noted filling defects and flow disturbances that indicated a remaining chronic thrombus (). Thus, we continued an additional seven hours of thrombolytic therapy, but there was no significant improvement.\nBecause the remaining thrombus was located at the left sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ), a location that is readily accessible, we performed a surgical thrombectomy of the left SFJ, removing the thrombus through a small inguinal incision (). Inflammatory change was noted around the SFJ. After proximal and distal control, a 3 cm longitudinal venotomy was made over the SFJ. The thrombus nearly obliterated the lumen of the SFJ. During surgical thrombectomy, we found organized old thrombus which was located at the SFJ and extending to the deep femoral vein. From this finding",

There was no record of bacteriological examination performed at that time. One year later, when the patient was 20 years of age, the infection had resolved, and he underwent hemiarthroplasty of the hip joint with a bipolar cup.

He noticed a leg-length discrepancy, but he did not seek medical attention because there was no pain.Twenty years later, at age forty, the patient was injured while surfing. He felt a strong pain in the right femoral region and had difficulty walking. He was transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital. The diagnosis was Vancouver type B2 peri-prosthetic fracture of the femur. However, because the prosthesis had migrated, there was a massive bone defect of the acetabular roof on the pelvic side (Figure \n) that had resulted in the leg-length discrepancy.The plan was to treat only the peri-prosthetic fracture because the hospital had no bone bank. The implant was removed using a posterolateral approach and an extended trochanteric osteotomy. He underwent a new hemiarthroplasty of the hip joint with a modular neck and long stem. He also underwent osteosynthesis of the femur using a plate and hook for trochanteric fixation (Figure \n).

Some 9 years later she was found to have colonic polyps with malignant transformation and was treated by surgical resection (colotomy and polypectomy).\nIn 1993 and 1997 she was found to have benign colonic polyps which were excised endoscopically, and in March and June 2003 she was referred to our surgical outpatient department with subcutaneus lesions, first on the left side of the abdominal wall and then on the right buttock. The lesions were excised under local anesthesia and were reported to be sebaceous adenomas, and the diagnosis of the Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS) was suggested. Ever since the patient was commenced on surveillance program that included annual clinical examination, CEA evaluation, chest radiography, urine cytology, colonoscopy and mammography.\nIn June 2005, an adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon was detected. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed no evidence of metastatic disease or paraaortic lymphadenopathy. A right hemicolectomy was performed, and the pathology report confirmed a poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma (stage II, T3N0M0, Dukes B). Screening tests for further malignancies, including chest radiography and upper GI endoscopy were all negative, and none of the tumor markers were elevated.\nThe patient has twin sons both of whom are in their early forties and currently healthy. She had three siblings from that only one brother is alive without cancerous history. One brother underwent a subtotal gastrectomy in his forties for gastric cancer and died in his fifties of a metachronous primary gastric cancer in the oesophagogastric junction.

The family observed that their son had stopped interacting with them and had been spending long periods of time alone in his bedroom. He had also reportedly not been sleeping well and had started talking to himself. For over a month, he had not attended school at the local community college. His parents finally made the decision to call police when their son started screaming at them; the police were monitoring him at their request, soon after he threatened them with a knife. The police took him to the local emergency room for a crisis evaluation.\nWhen the patient arrived at the emergency room, he was given intramuscular lorazepam 1 mg and haloperidol 5 mg because he attempted to strike the nursing staff and security guards. Following administration of the medication, he tried to escape from the emergency room, contending that the hospital staff was planning to kill him. The patient appeared to be internally preoccupied and his mood labile. He refused to cooperate with anyone attempting to conduct a meaningful psychiatric evaluation. He eventually slept for approximately four hours. When he awoke, he reported to the crisis worker that he had been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder (ADHD) a month ago.

    "cleaned_text": "an 18-year-old caucasian male with no prior psychiatric hospitalizations was sent to the local emergency room after his parents called 911; they were concerned that their son had become uncharacteristically irritable and paranoid. the family observed that their son had stopped interacting with them and had been spending long periods of time alone in his bedroom. he had also reportedly not been sleeping well and had started talking to himself. for over a month, he had not attended school at the local community college. his parents finally made the decision to call police when their son started screaming at them; the police were monitoring him at their request, soon after he threatened them with a knife. the police took him to the local emergency room for a crisis evaluation.\nwhen the patient arrived at the emergency room, he was given intramuscular lorazepam 1 mg and haloperidol 5 mg because he attempted to strike the nursing staff and security guards. following administration of the medication, he tried to escape from the emergency room, contending that the hospital staff was planning to kill him. the patient appeared to be internally preoccupied and his mood labile. he refused to cooperate with anyone attempting to conduct a meaningful psychiatric evaluation. he eventually slept for approximately four hours. when he awoke, he reported to the crisis worker that he had been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder (adhd) a month ago. at the time of this adhd diagnosis he was started on 30 mg of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate to be taken every morning in order to help him focus and become less stressed over the possibility of poor school performance.\nafter two weeks, the provider increased his lisdexamfetamine dimesylate dosage to 60 mg every morning. the provider also started him on dextroamphetamine sulfate tablets (10 mg) that he took daily in the afternoon in order to improve his concentration and ability to study. the patient claimed that",

Specifically, he was using a microwave oven electrical circuit to etch wood in a process called fractal wood burning. His right hand injuries included predominantly full-thickness burns to the thumb, index, and long fingers, a dysvascular thumb beyond the interphalangeal joint (IP) and blast injuries causing segmental loss of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) of the index finger ( and ). Initial management included conservative tangential excision and serial debridement of clearly devitalized soft tissue and repair of the FDP tendon of the right index finger. Eight days later at a second look operation, progressive necrosis of the affected soft tissue was apparent, with destruction of the radial digital bundle to the index finger, rendering the finger functionally useless. Similarly, necrosis of the thumb had progressed proximally to the level of the metacarpophalangeal joint (MP). This necessitated amputation of the right thumb and index finger at the MP joint and the long finger at the distal IP level.

    "original_text": "A 55-year-old man presented with chronic testicular pain. An ultrasonography of the abdomen detected left renal tumor. The patient had a history of hypertension and left renal urolithiasis. CT showed a heterogeneous left upper pole renal tumor (5.3 cm in diameter). A laparoscopic radical nephrectomy was performed in May 2008. Left adrenalectomy and lymph node dissection were not performed because the CT scan showed no adrenal gland invasion or lymphadenopathy. The histological evaluation of the tissue revealed a clear cell renal cell carcinoma and negative surgical margins (pathological stage, T2N0M0). Three years after nephrectomy, following a cerebrovascular accident, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score changed from 0 to 2. No tumor recurrence (CT scan was performed every 6 months) was found until 51 months later. A CT scan detected two nodules in the renal fossa (1.8 and 0.9 cm, respectively). Retroperitoneal exploration confirmed recurrent clear cell carcinoma with microscopically positive surgical margins. Lymph node dissection was not performed because of severe adhesion around the aorta. Lymph nodes that could be detected by palpation were not identified during the surgery. Four months after excision, an abdominal CT showed a nodule (1.6 cm) over the right adrenal gland. At that time, tumor target therapy was not covered by the national health insurance in Taiwan. Therefore, because of economic reasons, the patient could not afford the treatment until 2013. A repeat CT evaluation confirmed the disease progression of the adrenal metastasis (2.1 cm). The patient was treated with sunitinib (37.5 mg/d) for 4 weeks, but the treatment was discontinued because of gastrointestinal side effects and fatigue.

This situation was accompanied by lateral hip joint pain: the hip joint was unable to adduct and sometimes the pain can be felt at the knee joint if severe enough. It was also accompanied by pain during micturition which however, was relieved after rest.

During the course of follow-up for the respiratory condition an abdominal ultrasound was ordered to investigate a new onset minor abdominal discomfort. An abdominal cyst was found which, otherwise, was not clinically palpable during abdominal examination. Subsequent computed tomography (CT) scanning of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast revealed a retroperitoneal thick-walled fluid filled mass, measuring approximately 11.5 \u00d7 13 cm in close relation to the main pancreatic duct with inflammation of the adjacent pancreatic tissue. Provisional reports indicated a pseudo-pancreatic cyst with further extension into the posterior mediastinum through one of the diaphragmatic hiatus (\n). Serum amylase and lipase were markedly elevated (amylase: 45,630 U/I and lipase: 180,000 U/I).\nThe decision after surgical consultation was to perform laparotomy. The child was prepared for the operation. Through an upper midline incision, the abdomen was explored. This revealed a large, smooth, and fluctuant mass behind the stomach extending up to the posterior mediastinum through the esophageal hiatus, mostly arising from the pancreas. Aspiration of the coffee ground contents was done followed by a drainage procedure by anastomosing the posterior wall of the stomach to the anterior wall of the cyst wall (cystogastrostomy) using running 4/0 vicryl sutures. A Penrose drain was inserted in the left upper quadrant followed by a layered closure. The postoperative course was uneventful.

The father (38 years old) and the mother (35 years old) are not known to have any genetic or chronic diseases. The parents have three daughters aged 11, 10, and 6 years, all of whom are healthy. The proband is a product of a normal vaginal delivery. There were no complications during pregnancy, nor during delivery. He was born with Apgar scores of 9 at 1 min and 10 at 5 min. His birth weight was 3.05 kg (6th percentile), length was 53 cm (54th percentile), and head circumference was 34 cm (6th percentile).\nHe was admitted four times for lower respiratory tract infections: twice for pneumonia, once for bronchiolitis, and once for bronchitis. He also had a total of ten clinically documented upper respiratory tract infections that resolved spontaneously at home. They were associated with otitis media and conjunctivitis. The patient was treated once for a cutaneous abscess with antibiotics. He was also treated for a skin rash, impetigo, and candidal stomatitis. These infections were documented clinically, without microbiological or radiological documentations. The proband had two clinically documented generalized tonic-clonic seizures at one and three months of age and one undocumented generalized tonic-clonic seizure at seven months of age. He was investigated with an electroencephalograph (EEG) at seven months of age due to repeated seizures. The EEG showed no abnormalities. It was performed when the patient was not on antiepileptic drugs.

On postoperative day 1, sedation was weaned, and she was communicating appropriately while intubated and desired to have an epidural catheter placed for pain control prior to extubation. Timing of the epidural for patients on anticoagulation was in accordance with the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine guidelines []. Two hours prior to the procedure, the patient was started on a dexmedetomidine infusion at 0.5 micrograms/kilogram/hour for anxiolysis during the procedure. Since bradycardia is oftentimes associated with large boluses and high-dose infusions of dexmedetomidine, we decided to start the infusion at a lower dose two hours prior to procedure. She remained spontaneously breathing, comfortable, and cooperative. Her hemodynamics remained unchanged during the initiation of the dexmedetomidine infusion.\nWith her assistance and the endotracheal tube remaining in place, she was placed in a sitting position for epidural placement, and 50 micrograms of intravenous fentanyl was given for additional analgesia. Hemodynamic and respiratory stability was maintained with a sinus rhythm of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/63 mmHg, and SpO2 of 95% and was consistent with her vitals prior to initiating the dexmedetomidine infusion. After obtaining the sitting position, her sinus rhythm deteriorated to bradycardia of 30 beats per minute, and she subsequently became hypotensive. She became agitated, ceased following commands, and became unresponsive. The dexmedetomidine infusion was immediately stopped, and one milligram of intravenous atropine was administered for the bradycardia with no effect.

At the time of the car crash, he did not experience loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia. The patient\u2019s Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15. However, he was diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage and underwent conservative management at a local hospital. Three days after the car crash, he began to feel tinnitus in both ears and his tinnitus became aggravated with the passage of time. No specific lesion was observed on a conventional brain MRI performed two weeks after the car crash. Although he visited several hospitals, the precise cause of his tinnitus was not detected. Two years after the car crash, he underwent evaluation for his tinnitus at the ear, nose and throat department of a university hospital. The pure tone audiometry was evaluated in a sound-proof room to screen his hearing status for frequencies of 250\u20138000 Hz and no specific abnormality was detected []. Although he was also tested for speech audiometry which is a clinical examination that is commonly used to assess the impact of a potential hearing deficit on speech understanding, there was no specific abnormality.

She was on warfarin for aortic root and valve replacement surgery she had in the previous year. Although she remained haemodynamically stable, her haemoglobin levels gradually dropped 4 units over the next 36 hours. Along with correction of her clotting function, investigations were initiated that included an upper GI endoscopy which revealed blood in the second part of duodenum. Due to a rapid deterioration in her haemodynamic status colonoscopy was cancelled and a mesenteric angiogram was done that suggested bleeding from the region between the 4th part of duodenum and upper jejunum from intestinal mass. She was subjected to emergency laparotomy. At surgery, smooth nodular masses were found on the serosal surface of the first 50 cm of jejunum; these were 3-4 cm and projected into the lumen having eroded the mucosal surface. Resection of the affected segment and end to end anastomosis was performed. The rest of the bowel appeared free of any masses and after concluding surgery the patient was transferred to ITU postoperatively. She made an uncomplicated recovery and was discharged 7 days after operation. A subsequent CT scan did not reveal any other masses.\nHistopathology revealed an 8 cm length of jejunum involved with tumour nodules, smallest 3.4 cm and largest 4.4 cm, composed of spindle and polygonal cells. The tumour involved the full thickness of the bowel wall and there was no spread of disease to lymph nodes.

On clinical examination, it was revealed that the patient had maxillary class III defect according to Armany classification[] and had both maxillary central and lateral incisors missing []. He was undergoing treatment for arch expansion with a quadhelix appliance []. The definitive treatment was to fabricate a cast partial obturator to close the defect after the completion of orthodontic treatment. But in such cases, one cannot wait till the completion of orthodontic treatment as the patient was suffering from problems in regurgitation and speech, the biggest challenge in this case was to devise a prosthesis that\nwould close the palatal defect even with the quad helix in place. would not hamper the orthodontic treatment. Could be easily cleansable by the patient to maintain proper oral hygiene. would improve the patient's aesthetics by replacing the missing teeth.\nIt was decided that to fulfil all the above needs, the prosthesis would have to be fabricated in an innovative way which would help the patient in improving his regurgitation, speech, maintain oral hygiene, aesthetics and will not hamper the orthodontic treatment. So prosthesis was fabricated in two parts: the anterior part and posterior part. For ease of understanding, the anterior part was designated as part A and the posterior part was designated as part P. The part A consisted of a removable partial denture replacing missing teeth and a ball end was joined to its posterior surface.The part P covered the defect and was bordered by permanent soft liner.

There was no evidence of direct impact injury to either the left ankle or leg. Prior to this event, the patient had no medical problems, was not on any regular medication, and had no previous history of ligamentous laxity or ankle sprains.\nOn examination, the left ankle was grossly swollen and the whole foot was displaced medially. This provided somewhat of a distraction and comprehensive examination of the remainder of the leg was not performed. The ankle injury was closed and there was no neurovascular deficit. Beighton's score was zero. A preliminary diagnosis of a medial ankle dislocation was made and immediate closed reduction was performed in the Emergency Department. Closed reduction took precedence over radiological investigation of the injury since any delays in the restoration of normal anatomy could potentially compromise the integrity of the overlying skin and also increase the risk of neurovascular damage. Accordingly, it is institutional policy that ankle dislocations are reduced immediately without the need for X-rays.\nHaving reduced the dislocation confirmatory X-rays were then taken. While the patient was being positioned on the X-ray table it was noted by the radiographer that she had some tenderness around the upper leg. Radiographs were therefore taken of this anatomical region too. These illustrated a fracture of the proximal fibula in conjunction with a widened syndesmosis (Figures and ).

Based on findings of chronic active hepatitis in liver biopsy, autoimmune hepatitis was suspected, and treatment with prednisolone and azathioprine initiated. Seven years later, an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed a stricture in the common bile duct which was interpreted as possible extrahepatic PSC or tentatively an inborn anomaly of the common bile duct. After 20 years with fluctuating transaminases between 100 and 300 U/L and no recorded major clinical events, she developed general edema and thoracic spider nevi. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension with massive ascites. After an initial response to symptomatic treatment, she soon developed uncompensated liver failure with severe hepatic encephalopathy and was transferred to the national transplant unit for work-up and listing for liver transplantation. A few days later, an ABO-identical donor liver was available and LTX was performed with a duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis. The histopathological examination of the liver explant revealed cirrhosis and pathological changes typical for underlying PSC. Cholangiocarcinoma in situ was found in the common hepatic duct, the cystic duct, and the common bile duct, involving the resection margin. It was decided that the patient should be controlled with ERC with brush cytology from the duct-to-duct anastomosis after 6 months due to the histopathological findings. The brush cytology showed mild to moderate epithelial dysplasia in the common bile duct. After discussion in the multidisciplinary team, a pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) was decided due to the risk of development of cholangiocarcinoma. Ten months after LTX, the procedure was performed. Because of a possible increased risk of anastomotic leak due to immunosuppression, an enteropancreatic anastomosis was avoided and the pancreatic duct was occluded. The surgical specimen showed intestinal metaplasia in the common bile duct, but no dysplasia or carcinoma. She was then followed according to standard post-liver transplantation follow-up regimen.

At first, fine-needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid tumor suggested anaplastic carcinoma. Thereafter, we performed a left lobectomy of the thyroid to prevent fatal airway obstruction from the rapid tumor growth and to make a histological diagnosis. However, pathological examination of the thyroid tumor revealed two distinct neoplasia types (): half of the tumor showed solid growth of small cells with round-to-oval nuclei and scant cytoplasm (), and the other half was composed of nests and rosettes of polygonal cells with enlarged round-to-oval and prominent nuclei (). The specimen stained positively for synaptophysin, CD 56, and chromogranin A via immunohistochemistry (). These findings were consistent with NEC composed of small-cell and large-cell carcinoma [], which is generally an indicator of metastasis from another organ. A whole-body CT performed to identify a primary NEC revealed a 7 cm tumor in the liver and a 3 cm tumor in the transverse colon (); however, no tumors were detected in the lung. Ultrasound-guided needle biopsy revealed that the liver tumor was histopathologically the same type as that of the thyroid tumor, while the transverse colon tumor was found to be an adenocarcinoma based on colonoscopic biopsy. We performed colon cancer resection to prevent intestinal obstruction as palliative care. Surprisingly, two distinct areas of histological features were found in the colon specimen: well-differentiated adenocarcinoma and NEC similar to that in the thyroid and the liver (). In addition, immunohistochemistry of the entire specimen revealed that synaptophysin and CD5 were positive in the NEC component and partially positive in the adenocarcinoma component.

    "original_text": "A 47-year-old man with left shoulder pain lasting for more than 2 years was referred to our hospital because a radiolucent cystic lesion of the glenoid was observed on plane radiography of the left shoulder. He had no history of dislocation or trauma of the shoulder joint. On visiting our hospital, he complained of continuous posterior shoulder pain at rest; however, he could move his shoulder actively at 160 degrees of flexion and abduction, 60 degrees of external rotation at the side, and 90 degrees of external rotation at abduction and could maintain muscle strength around the shoulder on manual muscle testing. He did not show sensory and motor paralysis of the supra- and infraspinatus muscles and did not exhibit muscle atrophy on visual examination. The area at which he experienced spontaneous shoulder pain was innervated by the suprascapular nerve (). Plain anteroposterior radiography of the left shoulder showed a circular lesion with marginal osteosclerosis at the glenoid (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an osteolytic cystic lesion with very high intensity on T2-weighted images and low intensity on T1-weighted images, and the lesion was located at the posterior cranial portion of the glenoid and partially extended to the spinoglenoid notch (Figures and ), and there were no findings about fatty change and intramuscular edema in supra- and infraspinatus muscles.

A physical examination revealed an edematous, tender, and mildly erythematous left lower extremity. Mild tachycardia was noted. A lower extremity venous duplex ultrasound showed an extensive, occlusive deep venous thrombosis (DVT) from the left common femoral vein to the calf veins. Also, there was occlusive DVT within the left common and external iliac veins. A computer tomographic (CT) imaging of the chest with contrast revealed pulmonary emboli within the subsegmental pulmonary artery branches in the right lower lobe. Heparin was administered intravenously. Catheter-directed venous thrombolysis was done, and complete clearing of the left iliofemoral DVT was achieved. Intravenous heparin was switched to rivaroxaban, and the patient was discharged home. A week later, the patient presented with right-sided pleuritic chest pain. A CT of the chest with contrast revealed new acute pulmonary emboli within the distal left lower lobar artery and the basilar segmental pulmonary arteries of the left lower lobe. A venous duplex ultrasound showed extensive left lower extremity DVT from the left common femoral vein to the calf veins and occlusive thrombus within the left external iliac vein and the left common iliac vein. Intravenous heparin drip was initiated. Inferior vena cava filter was placed. Catheter-directed venous thrombolysis was performed, and complete thrombolysis of the left lower extremity DVT was noted within 24 hours.

    "original_text": "A 72-year-old woman with osteoarthritis of both knees underwent a left TKA in March 2005. A standard midline anterior incision with a medial arthrotomy was used to implant a Scorpio (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ, USA) PS knee prosthesis. Preoperatively, the radiographs showed a 4\u00b0 varus deformity of the right knee and a 7\u00b0 varus deformity of the left knee. The range of motion of both knees was 5\u00b0 to 135\u00b0. There was weakness of the left thigh flexors (motor grade IV) because the patient suffered from a cerebrovascular accident 10 years earlier. During surgery, an 8 mm polyethylene tibial insert was used, which provided good stability in full extension, mid-flexion, and full flexion of the left knee intraoperatively. The patella was not replaced. Postoperatively, the patient recovered well, with knee flexion from 0\u00b0 to 125\u00b0 at 6 weeks.\nIn May 2006, 14 months after the TKA, the patient presented with painful swelling and an effusion of the left knee after slipping and falling. Radiographs showed a vertical fracture of the lateral aspect of the patella and genu recurvatum (). The patellar fracture was treated conservatively. Examination of her left knee revealed genu recurvatum and soft end points on varus and valgus stress testing. Soft tissue and ligamentous injuries were suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained to evaluate an acute ligamentous injury. The MRI demonstrated a loose body fragment in the suprapatellar pouch (). Based on the shape and signal density, the loose body was believed to be a part of the post from the polyethylene tibial insert. Arthroscopy revealed a post fracture as the source of the loose body and a broken polyethylene fragment was found in the suprapatellar pouch.

An open surgical approach was adopted to minimize chondral damage. Intraoperatively the patella was found incarcerated under tension, 1 cm tear in the medial retinaculum on the superomedial aspect, a partial avulsion of the quadriceps tendon and a complete tear of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL).\nA lateral parapatellar arthrotomy was performed to facilitate atraumatic repositioning of the patella without major chondral damage and for better visualization of the fracture of the lateral femoral condyle [].

The aneurysm in the PDA accompanied by leakage of the contrast-enhanced agent had a diameter of 9.3 mm. IVR hemostasis was completed by PDA coil embolization. Subsequent SMA arteriography showed several collaterals other than embolized PDA perfusing the proper hepatic artery (Figure B). After IVR therapy, blood chemical analysis was monitored for several weeks, revealing that transaminase level was not elevated and hepatic infarction was considered negative. Obstruction of the duodenal passage resulting from the hematoma was observed for a few weeks; however, bypass surgery was not required as the obstruction was completely relieved as the hematoma was naturally and gradually absorbed.\nIn this case, collateral perfusion pathways from the SMA developed to compensate for the reduced CA blood flow due to MAL compression, and the aneurysm might have generated in the PDA due to the abnormal changes in hemodynamic flow.

    "original_text": "A 49-year-old man sustained a tibial shaft spiral fracture (AO/OTA classification 42-A2) with a fibular fracture (). He had no previous medical history. The fracture was treated initially at another hospital with a reamed statically locked intramedullary nail (). He noted increased external rotation of the affected leg immediately after the surgery. The tibial fracture united after a year (), but he still complained of the asymmetry of his legs, difficulty walking and running, and inability to ride a bicycle. Computed tomography (CT) of both tibias showed 24\u00b0 of increased external rotation of the affected leg (Figures , ). Because it was a symptomatic rotational deformity, we decided to perform corrective osteotomy in a minimally invasive fashion.\nThe surgical procedure consisted of, first, a 1 cm skin incision at the original fracture site. Multiple efforts were then made to drill around the nail in a radial manner (leaving the nail in place) while using a 3.0 mm Kirschner wire to prepare a percutaneous osteotomy line. Osteotomy for the affected tibia was performed percutaneously using an osteotome on the prepared osteotomy line while retaining the intramedullary nail ().

No particular sprain or accident had occurred. A clinical examination revealed slight lameness without visible muscular atrophy. Muscular testing showed paralysis of his tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus; his common extensor digitorum was also partially deficient. Stretching of the EPSN was diagnosed based on functional disability after the football match. However, subsequent examination in our Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation revealed an asymptomatic minor soft tumefaction localized at the neck of his fibula. The Tinel sign was present with a sensory deficit on the back of his foot. An electromyographic study of the nerve revealed severe damage to the EPSN at the neck of his fibula with a slow nerve conduction velocity. An electromyographic study of the nerves of his right lower limb was normal, and X-rays showed no abnormalities. Ultrasound of the tumefaction revealed a tubulated, non-compressive, anechoic mass without a Doppler signal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed low signal intensity on T1 images, high signal intensity on T2 images, and a heterogeneous pattern due to the presence of some fine regular partitions. The lesion was in contact with the EPSN at its proximal part and coursed downward externally, following the path of its external collateral. A gadolinium injection revealed regular peripheral enhancement of the lesion, defining a central cystic area with low signal intensity (Figs. and ).\nAn intraoperative examination revealed a mass at the origin of the fibular communicating branch and the lateral sural cutaneous nerves (Fig. ).

She had a medical history of hypothyroidism, and 3 months before, she had undergone lumpectomy with axillary lymph node dissection for left breast invasive ductal carcinoma at a different hospital. During a follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopy, she was diagnosed incidentally with early gastric cancer (). Endoscopic biopsy revealed moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma in the midbody of the anterior abdominal wall. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed neither regional lymph node metastasis nor distant metastasis. Because the patient had a history of hypothyroidism, we performed ultrasonography for further evaluation of the thyroid. A small calcified mass was detected in the upper pole of the left thyroid gland (), and fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) was performed to rule out thyroid malignancy. Although fine-needle aspiration revealed lymphocytic thyroiditis without evidence of malignancy, the thyroid ultrasonographic findings indicated a high possibility of thyroid malignancy; therefore, we planned thyroidectomy with gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The patient underwent laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy, loop gastrojejunostomy, and D2 lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer, and left thyroidectomy with isthmectomy and central lymph node dissection for the left thyroid mass. The operation took 345 minutes, and there were no intraoperative complications.\nPathological examination of the permanent sections revealed a papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (8 mm) with lymphocytic thyroiditis and metastasis in 1 out of 4 lymph nodes (). The gastric cancer was poorly differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma that had invaded into the muscularis mucosa (). The most notable finding along with the gastric cancer was the presence of multiple perigastric lymph node metastases. After gastrectomy with lymph node dissection, 8 out of 55 lymph nodes showed metastases. All lymph nodes with metastases were located along the lesser curvature of the stomach. Initially, we theorized that the perigastric lymph node metastases had originated from gastric cancer; therefore, the TNM stage of the gastric cancer was determined to be T1aN2M0",
