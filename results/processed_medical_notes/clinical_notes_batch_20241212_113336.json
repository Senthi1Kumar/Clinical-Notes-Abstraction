The patient had previously undergone open surgical repair of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with aorto-aortic reconstruction sutured proximally approximately 15 mm below the lowest (right) renal artery and distally to the aortic bifurcation. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed the presence of an acute Stanford Type B aortic dissection originating just below the ostium of the left subclavian artery (LSA) and extending downward to the level of the renal arteries. Another radiological finding was a right HGA aneurysm measuring approximately 40 mm in maximal transverse diameter. The main aortic visceral branches (celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, renal arteries) were all patent and all took off from the true lumen. The abdominal aorta was almost completely occluded for a short segment just below the level of the renal arteries. This finding could be explained, in our opinion, by reflection and overturning of the dissection flap over the suture line of the preexisting surgical graft. The two iliac arteries were otherwise reperfused through the pelvic collateral network (\nand\n).\nThe patient was immediately transferred to the operating theater and underwent endovascular repair of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta. After bilateral surgical cutdown of the common femoral arteries (CFAs), we gained access to the true lumen above the renal arteries using combined angiographic and transesophageal echocardiographic control. At first, we covered the proximal entry tear with placement of a thoracic endograft (Valiant, MEDTRONIC) without any oversizing. Proximal and distal landing zones were achieved respectively in Ishimaru's zone 2 of the aortic arch and approximately 10 cm above the ostium of the celiac trunk. We then proceeded with placement of a bifurcated abdominal endograft (Endurant II, MEDTRONIC) with 15% oversizing. Proximal landing zone was achieved just below the right renal artery while",

She had had an uncomplicated pregnancy with spontaneous vaginal delivery two and a half years previously, with epidural analgesia, as well as a prior miscarriage.\nA year after her first delivery, she presented to the emergency department with severe back pain, worse on the right side. An X-ray of her spine showed instability of the third to fifth lumbar vertebrae, with widening of the disc spaces. She was referred to the orthopedic surgeons and had progressive worsening of her back pain and new-onset weakness in her right leg over the course of one year. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her lumbar spine revealed multi-level lumbar disc prolapse involving the third lumbar vertebra (L3) to the first sacral vertebra (S1), worse at L3/L4 (see , ). Spinal surgery was discussed, but the patient declined at the time and was managed conservatively.

At her initial appointment, the patient reported having constant headaches since the accident, with shooting, throbbing pains in her head, photosensitivity, difficulty driving, fatigue, poor memory, and trouble reading. She reported that her headaches were more severe during the night but improved after standing upright. Her ROS was positive for fatigue, nausea, easy bruising, debilitating headaches, neck and shoulder pain, hypermobility (Beighton score 5/9), low blood pressure and dizziness when standing, and cognitive impairment. Her past medical history was significant for melanoma, breast cancer, and heavy menstrual periods. The patient was diagnosed with postconcussion syndrome with potential elevated ICP. The patient was prescribed home orthoptic exercises and recommended to sleep in the reverse Trendelenburg position for a few nights to assess for the possibility of increased ICP, since she awoke every morning with headaches and a sense of pressure in the head. Prior to re-evaluation, the patient reported that her headaches improved in the morning after sleeping in the reverse Trendelenburg position, and so an MRI with contrast was ordered to explore findings that might be consistent with elevated ICP; the MRI showed some decrease in ventricle size, possibly consistent with intracranial hypertension, but was otherwise unremarkable. The patient was offered a trial of acetazolamide in August 2017 and she reported improvement initially with this medication but then symptoms of headache and blurred vision returned. The patient returned to the W-TBI clinic in October 2017 and noted that she had worsening nausea when trying to read or use the computer and could not complete home orthoptic exercises without vomiting.

In the last 30 days, the pain exacerbated and radiated in the anteromedial part of the arm and clavicular area. The patient also reported pain in the joints of the distal part of upper and lower limbs, especially in the small joints, which afterward became swollen.\nThe patient presented with a medical history of arterial hypertension for the last 10 years, treated with beta-blockers and sartans, and he was a heavy smoker (in the last period he used only electronic cigarettes).\nThe neurologic examination was normal, except for slightly diminished deep tendon reflexes of the lower limbs. The patient reported pain that did not correspond to any radicular or nerve territory, which was exacerbated by pressure on the distal third of radius and ulna, but was not related to active or passive movements of the cervical spine.

She was treated with interferon beta 1a from April 2013, and with fingolimod from September 2013 after a motor attack in the left leg from which she recovered partially. Treatment was changed again to natalizumab in January 2014 when macula edema was suspected. She remained clinically and radiologically stable until natalizumab was terminated in the beginning of June 2015, after she tested positive for John Cunningham virus. Alemtuzumab was started at the end of July 2015. During the first cycle (12 mg for 5 days) she had transient sinus bradycardia down to 30 beats per minute but no other adverse events.\nThe patient remained clinically stable with an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score at 2.5 until the second cycle (12 mg alemtuzumab preceded by 1000 mg methylprednisolone, 12 mg cetrizine and 1000 mg paracetamol for three consecutive days) in July 2016. Except for transient bradycardia there were no immediate adverse reactions, but some hours after the last infusion of alemtuzumab she became sick with nausea and fever up to 40 \u00b0C. At admission to hospital she was awake and did not have neck stiffness or other focal signs except abdominal discomfort and mild headache. She was febrile (39.5 C) and clinically dehydrated but normotensive. C-reactive protein was 180, lymphocytes were below the detection limit but the number of granulocytes was normal. As she did not have new neurological symptoms, neither detailed neurological examination, brain imaging nor lumbar puncture were performed.

    "original_text": "In 2011, a 42-year-old female was diagnosed with a large mesenteric DT with a CTNNB1 T41A somatic mutation (). The mesenteric tumor was intimately related to the superior mesenteric vessels, and due to its size and location, was not considered surgically resectable without major morbidity (sacrificing most of her small bowel and/or considering a small bowel transplantation). The patient was treated with imatinib with no response and then received 2 subsequent lines of therapy (tamoxifen and doxorubicin) without any evidence of an objective response to either agent. Approximately 14 months after her initial diagnosis, after failure of these therapies, the patient was enrolled into a phase 1 trial of AL101 at a dose of 8.4 mg once weekly (QW) on a 4-week cycle. AL101 was reasonably well tolerated; most adverse events were grade 1/2 and included diarrhea and fatigue. The diarrhea fluctuated but remained at a grade 1 or 2 level and was managed with antidiarrheals, when required. On cycle 21 day 22, the patient developed grade 3 diarrhea; therefore, because the diarrhea was intermittent before this but longstanding, the dose of AL101 was reduced to 6 mg QW for cycle 22. Grade 3 diarrhea was short-lived and resolved with intervention and dose modification. During cycle 26, the dose of AL101 was further reduced to 4 mg QW due to ongoing fatigue, lymphopenia, albuminemia, and intermittent episodes of diarrhea. The patient received AL101 during the clinical trial for approximately 4.6 years (60 cycles).

    "original_text": "A female patient aged 64 years old presented with chest pain and progressive dyspnea (New York Heart Association Class II). The patient had Ross operation 40 years ago for rheumatic aortic valve disease. Twenty years after the Ross procedure, the patient had aortic valve replacement with a tissue valve and open mitral commissurotomy for concomitant mitral valve stenosis. The patient had concomitant coronary artery disease and stenting of the left anterior descending and the circumflex coronary arteries 2 years prior to the latest presentation. The patient had atrial fibrillation, and the echocardiography showed mild global hypokinesia of the left ventricle, severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, severe mitral stenosis with the valve area of 1.1 cm2, calcific aortic tissue valve with moderate aortic stenosis, and severe aortic regurgitation. The ejection fraction was 45%, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 50 mmHg. The chest computed tomography scan showed calcific ascending aorta (Fig. ), and the carotid Doppler showed 50% bilateral stenosis. After a multidisciplinary discussion, we decided to implant a transcatheter aortic valve and perform open surgery to replace the mitral and repair the tricuspid valve. The aortic valve was replaced with Evolut R 29 mm (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA). After 3 months, the patient had mitral valve replacement through a median sternotomy. There was a 1 cm distance between the Evolut R valve and the brachiocephalic artery, and the aorta was heavily calcific, making the aortic cross-clamp not feasible. We decided to perform beating mitral valve replacement under hypothermia (30 \u00b0C) with no aortic cross-clamp nor cardioplegic arrest.

Laryngoscopic examination revealed a lesion involving the left true vocal cord, left laryngeal pocket, and posterior part of the ventricle false cord. Biopsy of the lesion revealed moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx (). CT demonstrated thickening of 8 mm of the left false vocal cord, shallowing the left laryngeal ventricle, and infiltration extending to the upper part of the vocal cord and small (up to 5 mm in the greatest diameter) unspecific lymph nodes of the neck. Staging work-up, including chest CT and ultrasound examination of the neck and abdomen, was negative for metastases. The patient was referred to radical radiotherapy with four lateral 6 MEV photon beams (5.5 cm \u00d7 7.5 cm) to the total dose of 66 Gy in 33 fractions.

Additional CT, performed for radiotherapy modification revealed previously absent, enlarged, left-sided cervical lymph nodes of the second group, outside the irradiated region. An ultrasound of this region showed enlarged lymph nodes with a central hyperechoic area. The biggest lymph node was 2.5 cm in diameter and was localised at the left mandibular angle.

Its progressive enlargement was associated with pain and restriction of movements. There were no other small or large joint symptoms. He did not have episodes of fever, and he maintained good physical well-being in terms of appetite and weight. He did not give any past history of chronic productive cough, pulmonary tuberculosis, or any contact history.\nOn examination, there was a swelling near the wrist joint and carpal region both volar and dorsal aspects (). The area was not warm, and mild tenderness was elicited. Flexion extension and circumduction movements were reduced. Distal neurovascular examination was unremarkable. His ESR was 98 mm/hr with full blood count and other biochemical investigations within the normal range. Initial digital X-ray of the hand showed destructive type lytic lesions involving mainly the carpal bones and bases of the 2nd to 5th metacarpals with sparing of the radiocarpal and distal radioulnar joints (). His chest X-ray was normal. He underwent a magnetic resonance (MR) scan of the hand which showed multiple destructive lesions in the carpal bones, surrounding focal fluid collections with narrowing of the intercarpal and carpometacarpal joints (). Flexor muscle tendons were intact. Upon initial assessment with basic investigations and imaging, a conclusive diagnosis was not achieved. A decision was made to go ahead with a synovial biopsy, and an intraoperative caseous material was noted. After the new finding, other investigations in relation to caseous necrosis were carried out. His Mantoux test was positive with 12 mm of induration. Serological assessment for melioidosis was negative.

She had been hospitalized there four times in 1 year for acute pyelonephritis. The fourth episode raised the suspicion for an underlying problem and justified her referral to our urology department after management of the acute pyelonephritis.\nOn admission, she complained of ascending left-sided flank pain during micturition but did not have dysuria or hematuria. She also had a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) as a young adult.\nShe was perfectly asymptomatic on the right side. A physical examination was normal. Her temperature was 37.4 \u00b0C, her blood pressure was 128/84 mmHg, and her pulse rate was regular at 76 beats per minute. Laboratory tests were normal; in particular, a urine examination showed no leukocyturia or bacteriuria.\nShe underwent an abdominal ultrasound which showed an asymmetric size of the kidneys and a bilateral chronic pyelonephritis aspect. Her right kidney measured 10 cm while the left measured 12 cm.\nA voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was performed and showed grade IV VUR on the left side and grade I VUR on the right (Figs. and ).\nAn abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan detected a left completely duplicated collecting system with hydroureteronephrosis and poor opacification of the upper pole moiety. In addition, the parenchyma of the upper pole moiety was atrophied with secretory and excretory delay.

History revealed the presence of pricky type pain 4\u20135 days ago. Then, she had noticed vesicles, which appeared 3 days ago on the right side of the face and in the oral cavity. Subsequently, the vesicles ruptured to form ulcers which were very painful. Extraoral vesicles were intact. All the vesicles and ulcers were limited to the face and oral cavity of the right side only until the midline.\nMedical history and dental history were not contributory except for the fact that the patient had undergone extraction of teeth 6\u20137 years ago. On examination, the right submandibular lymph nodes were palpable, tender and mobile. Examination of face revealed multiple vesicles extending from the right preauricular area to the right corner of the mouth. Encrustation was seen on the right side of the lip, but was not crossing the midline [].\nIntraorally, multiple shallow ulcerations with erythematous irregular borders and tissue tags were seen on the buccal mucosa, tongue and labial mucosa unilaterally on the right side. These ulcers were painful causing difficulty in eating and mouth opening. There were no other skin lesions accompanying the orofacial lesions. After careful clinical examination, a provisional diagnosis of HZI was made [Figures and ].\nClinical differential diagnosis included herpes simplex infection (HSV). HSV infection appears in a similar fashion and if mild and localized to one side may be mistaken for HZI; cultures helps to differentiate between the two.\nCytosmear prepared from the labial mucosa revealed epithelial cells. Epithelial cells were arranged in clusters, and few isolated cells were seen.

She had been reviewed by many consultants over the past few years for the same without getting any relief. She was referred to us by the Ear, Nose, and Throat Team. There were no other clinical symptoms like headache, temporomandibular pain, or ear pain. There was no history of previous trauma or any surgical procedure. On palpation, the styloid process could be felt quite easily intraorally and extraorally. A course of oral amitriptyline was offered to the patient in an attempt to treat the condition conservatively, but this did not help the patient get relief from pain. Therefore, surgical excision via Risdon's incision () was planned for the bilaterally elongated styloid processes. The patient was offered surgical excision through an intraoral approach, but declined the same when advised of the need for elective tonsillectomy bilaterally. When the styloid process was evaluated radiographically, on the right side it was found to be a Type II variation and on the left side a Type I variation. This was confirmed during the intraoperative phase (Figures and ). Investigations performed included computed tomography scan with 3 dimensional reconstruction (Figures and ).\nThe resection of the elongated styloid process was done with general anesthesia with oral intubation. After Risdon's incision, a subplatysmal flap was elevated with care to preserve the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve.

The patient could not recall whether she had lost consciousness following the accident. In the days following the accident, the patient started noticing nausea and headaches with reading on the computer, increased somnolence, and worsening discomfort with motion, sound, or lights. The patient had an MRI and CT following the accident which were both read as normal. At her initial appointment, the patient noted that she had enjoyed reading before the accident, but now could use a computer for only five minutes intervals prior to becoming nauseous and experiencing headache. Her past medical history was notable for breast cancer, migraines, rectal bleeding, gastric polyps, and dyspepsia. Her ROS was positive for fatigue, IBS, more headaches since the accident, increased urinary frequency, burning pain in neck and shoulders, sound sensitivity, worse bruxism since the injury, poor balance, insomnia, and cognitive impairments. The patient was diagnosed with convergence insufficiency and postconcussion syndrome and prescribed home-based orthoptic therapy. In June 2017, the patient was re-evaluated and demonstrated little improvement in her symptoms or upon examination. She did report some improvement in her fatigue, sleeping and cognition. Continued orthoptic training was recommended and that patient returned in October 2017 reporting further improvement in reading, driving, and computer use. However she stated she was not yet at her pre-morbid functioning. It was noted that the patient was hypermobile at that visit (Beighton score 4/9). In addition, she reported that the putative diagnosis of occipital neuralgia offered at previous visits was confirmed by pain management specialists.

She reported that she was a frequent faller due to her poor balance. She believed that one of the major contributors to her falls was having spasticity in her lower limbs.\nSince the PoNS\u2122 is not registered in Australia, it was used with approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia and the Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committee. The patient provided informed consent.\nIntervention consisted of 2 physiotherapy sessions per day, 1.5 h per session (3 h between sessions) for 2 weeks (18 sessions in total plus pre- and post- intervention assessment sessions). Each session was structured in three blocks of 20 min, each focusing on gait performance, balance control and a relaxation/meditation period in the same order. During each block the patient used the PoNS\u2122 device at a comfortable intensity which could be adjusted by the patient or therapist. At least 5 min of rest was given between stimulation blocks. Since the PoNS\u2122 mouthpiece sits on the tongue, the patient was allowed to remove the device in case of excessive salivation to swallow or clean up.\nClinical assessment of gait and balance was performed using the miniBEST, which is a 14-item test scored on a 3-level ordinal scale with a maximum of 28 points.

At 4 years of age, the patient first presented episodes of seizures and abnormal neurological findings and was diagnosed with HHH syndrome. The patient had developmental disability, manifested by expressive language and attention problems determined upon neuropsychiatric evaluation, and significant myopia. The patient was prescribed a diet consisting of protein restriction to 1.5 g/kg/d during childhood. The patient's weight was at the 25th percentile with height less than the 3rd percentile.\nThe patient's first pregnancy occurred at 18 years old. She had episodes of nausea and dizziness. She was maintained on a low-protein diet in the first trimester, but mild hyperammonemia was detected during the 11th and 12th week of pregnancy; as a result, protein intake was further restricted to 40 g/d. It was unclear if the patient was compliant or not. At 22 weeks gestation, the patient developed seizures, and was initiated with carbamazapine. Brain imaging showed multiple small calcifications of unreported cause, with normal cerebral angiography. The child was born at full term, via Cesarean-section. The baby girl had intrauterine growth restriction (weight <3rd percentile). Although the baby girl remained small, follow-up recorded a normal development at her 2 years of age.\nVery little is described for the course of her second and third pregnancy. The second child was born via Caesarian section. A moderately elevated ornithine concentration (302 \u03bcM/L) was measured in the cord blood, but the levels decreased to normal in the newborn's blood 24 hours after birth.

National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 6. He was supposed to be on anticoagulation therapy but had not been taking warfarin for the past two weeks.\nInitial assessment confirmed that he was out of therapeutic window (international normalized ratio [INR] was 1.1).

    "original_text": "In January 2014, a 55-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to our Emergency Unit with paroxysmal malignant hypertension accompanied by headache, vertigo, tachycardia, lacrimation, nausea and altered mental status. Her medical history included a caesarean section (1984), an abdominal surgery due to mechanical ileus, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (1995), gastro-oesophageal reflux and a total thyroidectomy due to a benign non-toxic multi-nodular goiter, later requiring thyroid hormonal substitution. In 2008, an elevated fasting glucose level pointed to an underlying type 2 diabetes mellitus. Hypertension and sinus tachycardia was first diagnosed in 2003. Consequently, the patient underwent several examinations in various hospitals but no underlying organic causes of her complaints could be detected. Endocrinological disorders - especially pheochromocytoma - were excluded on several occasions. Her altered mental status during the hypertensive crises raised the possibility of neurological deficiency, but no signs of intracranial tumor, cerebral vascular lesion, hemorrhage or even epilepsy were detectable. Moreover, cardiac arrhythmias and ischemic heart disease were also excluded. Eventually, in 2004, after numerous diagnostic procedures, panic syndrome was diagnosed; therefore anxiolytic and antidepressant medications were initiated. Between 2004 and 2013 the patient was treated with this combination of psychopharmacological agents. During a thorough psychiatric follow-up period the frequency of the paroxysms dropped noticeably, but the patient seemed to be addicted to the psychopharmacological regimen so the medications were withdrawn in another center. During the following year the patient did not show any clinical symptoms of paroxysmal hypertension.

Ultrasound and computed tomography suggested terminal ileitis and abdominal lymphadenopathy. Stool tests for microorganisms including Clostridium difficile were negative.

He had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, 2 years ago and 3 months ago, respectively. He was a heavy alcoholic, with a drinking history of two bottles of Soju daily for more than thirty years. There were no abnormal findings on physical examination. Chest X-ray on admission showed increased haziness in the right middle and right lower lobes. Laboratory evaluation at presentation revealed; a serum white blood cell count of 8.51\u00d7103/\u00b5L, hemoglobin, 8.2 g/dL, and a platelet count of 292\u00d7103/\u00b5L. Because the patient had only respiratory symptoms, other specific lab data, such as amylase or lipase levels were not checked at that time. A computed tomography (CT) scan of chest was performed to evaluate hemoptysis and findings suggestive of mediastinitis with abscess and esophageal perforation were obtained. Increased opacity and a ground glass pattern were observed in the middle and the lower lobes of the right lung (). A sputum examination returned negative findings for acid fast bacillus (AFB) smear, sputum cytology, sputum gram staining and culture. Gastrofiberoscopy was performed to check for gastroesophageal perforation, and bronchofiberoscopy to check for the presence of an endobronchial lesion that might have caused hemoptysis, but no abnormalities were found in both. Furthermore, bronchial washing cytology showed no evidence of malignancy, and esophagography also presented no specific findings. In addition, endoscopic ultrasonography failed to depict any mediastinal lesion, and fine needle aspiration revealed only the presence of some red blood cells and inflammatory cells.\nAlthough there was no evidence of esophageal perforation, assuming that esophageal microperforation may attribute to vessel erosion with mediastinal abscess or mediastinitis, the patient was managed conservatively with intravenous antibiotics and hemostatic agents for fifteen days, and was discharged when his symptoms resolved",

She had been diagnosed with Ebstein's anomaly and an associated atrial septal defect at 3 years of age. She had been asymptomatic without medication. At age 25, she underwent cardiac catheterization for hemodynamic assessment anticipating a subsequent pregnancy. It revealed that her left arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) was 93%, with good left ventricular function (). Surgical intervention was recommended due to severe tricuspid regurgitation and a remarkably enlarged, atrialized right ventricle. She declined to undergo surgery and became pregnant at the age of 28. At the first medical examination conducted at our hospital, she had no respiratory failure and had good percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93%. A chest X-ray confirmed cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) of 54% (), and echocardiography revealed a dilated right atrium, a septal leaflet displaced by 50 mm from the tricuspid annulus, moderate tricuspid regurgitation (Carpentier's type C), and an ostium secundum atrial septal defect (). Left ventricular systolic function was preserved, though the interventricular septum was displaced by the enlarged, atrialized right ventricle (). At 22 weeks' gestation, her SpO2 decreased to 89%, and oxygen was administered by nasal cannula for cyanosis along with anticoagulation therapy (heparin) to prevent occult embolism. She was admitted at 27 weeks' gestation with dyspnea on exertion. Echocardiography revealed worsening tricuspid regurgitation and right side volume overload, but left ventricular systolic function seemed to be maintained. Although fetal growth was appropriate, elective cesarean section was performed at 33 weeks' gestation due to her respiratory failure and progressive desaturation with worsening cardiomegaly (). Her baby, weighing 1943 g (appropriate for date), was delivered with respiratory distress syndrome and required surfactant treatment. Pathological examination of the placenta was appropriate for gestational age. Two months after delivery, the mother's cardiac condition worsened to the level of NYHA class IV. A",

His cardiovascular risk profile consisted of smoking (38 pack years), arterial hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes, obesity, and dyslipoproteinemia. His medical history additionally comprised bilateral carotid artery disease and stenting of the right internal carotid artery, chronic renal impairment, and chronic obstructive lung disease. Chronic occlusion and good collateralization of his left anterior descending artery (LAD) had been described 5 years previously when he underwent PCI for myocardial infarction with stent implantation in the RCX.\nAfter recurrence of the HCC, he suffered a posterior NSTEMI and underwent stenting of a subtotal stenosis of the RCA. In addition to the chronically occluded LAD, coronary angiography now showed 80 and 90% stenosis of the distal RCX and a posterolateral branch, respectively, which were not addressed in the course of the intervention.\nIn the weeks after the coronary intervention, he suffered from increasing angina and developed ventricular arrhythmia. Echocardiography, MRI (Siemens Magnetom Prisma, 3 Tesla), and CT (256 Multisclice Philips ICT) showed a tissue mass of 72 \u00d7 45 \u00d7 56 mm infiltrating the myocardium of both ventricles and the interventricular septum (Fig. a, b). When his cardiac symptoms became so debilitating that they limited his quality of life more than the cancer and he expressed an urgent desire for treatment despite his dismal prognosis, he was referred to our department to evaluate surgical treatment options.\nAs the RCA lesion had already been addressed, the LAD had been occluded with good collateralization for at least 5 years, and we agreed with the cardiologist that it was highly unlikely that such severe symptoms were caused by the remaining RCX lesions alone, we assumed the metastatic tumor to contribute to the patient\u2019s deterioration by stealing perfusion from, compressing, or infiltrating coronary vessels.

There was no sensory impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intraspinal extradural tumor over T10 to L3 (Fig. ). It appeared to be a spinal extradural arachnoid cyst (SEAC). To confirm whether the fistula existed between the subarachnoid space and arachnoid cyst, and to localize the position of the fistula, we performed a real-time technique. First, we injected contrast medium into the cyst under fluoroscopy. After 1 h the follow-up computed tomography (CT) was administered, and it revealed there was no contrast-infiltration into the subarachnoid space (Fig. ). We then extracted about 20 mL of fluid from the cyst. The follow-up magnetic resonance imaging on the same day indicated the cyst did not become smaller (Fig. ). A \u201cone-way valve\u201d fistula was suspected such that cerebral spinal fluid could pass into the cystic space from the subarachnoid space but could not flow in the opposite manner. Therefore we designed a procedure to localize the fistula. We penetrated two needles into the cyst and subarachnoid space separately in the L3/L4 level under digital subtraction angiography (Fig. ). Pending the fluid drained through those two needles, we injected 10 mL of contrast medium slowly into the subarachnoid space and a little contrast medium infiltrated into the cystic space horizontally at the T12/L1 level.

Urgent surgery was performed with incision of the parapharyngeal abscess, neck dissection, and left side thoracotomy with incision and drainage of the mediastinum and thorax. In the postoperative period in the ICU, the patient was sedated and mechanically ventilated with antibiotic therapy according to microbiological findings (blood, urine, bronchoalveolar lavage, and tissue sample taken during surgery). After the first surgery, Streptococcus mitis was isolated from the parapharyngeal abscessus. In the second surgery, Staphylococcus sp. was isolated from the mediastinal and neck swab wounds. From the beginning (upon admission to the ICU), the patient was treated with meropenem and linezolid. During the second week of treatment, he started to develop a nosocomial infection of the lung caused by multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was treated with ceftolozane/tazobactam 3 \u00d7 3 g intravenously. In the next 10 days, control computed tomographic (CT) scans of the neck and chest showed progression of mediastinal infiltrates and the formation of organized pleural effusion on the left side that required additional surgery. Due to atelectasis of the left lung that persisted during the second week of treatment in the ICU, bronchoscopy with bronchoaspiration and recruitment maneuvers were performed several times. Residual pleural effusions were drained several times before and after weaning procedures with a small-bore pleural catheter and Seldinger technique. On the 30th day of the patient\u2019s illness, sedation was stopped, and the patient awoke promptly.

At the time of referral, he was intubated and ventilated in paediatric intensive care receiving intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy for pneumonia. Sputum was positive for metapneumovirus. He had a significant past medical history including a bicuspid aortic valve, visual impairment, and chromosomal duplication disorder with significant developmental delay.

A skin biopsy () supported this demonstrating a neutrophilic infiltrate in the upper dermis around the dermal blood vessels, in the deeper dermis and the subcutaneous fat. A small number of mononuclear cells were present. There was no evidence of vasculitis. Blood results revealed a marked leucocytosis (41.4 \u00d7 109/L); predominantly neutrophils (32.4 \u00d7 109/L); elevated C reactive protein 145 mg/L; anaemia; and thrombocytopenia. Blood film examination revealed a myeloid left shift and toxic granulation in neutrophils. Neutrophil integrin expression was normal. IgG and IgA were both elevated at 23 and 4.86 g/L, respectively. Specialist input from Immunology and Haematology was sought and it was felt that both the hyperglobulinaemia and blood film findings were secondary to inflammation and sepsis.

Postoperatively, a slight leakage persisted and a stenosis of the choledochal duct at the site of the injury and a choledochocutaneous fistula developed. Because conservative measures did not close the fistula, a high Roux-Y latero-lateral choledochojejunostomy (biliodigestive anastomosis) was set up 5 months after cholecystectomy. Despite this procedure, recurrent cholangitis developed, which responded favorably to antibiotics at each episode. As the frequency of cholangitic episodes increased 2 years after cholecystectomy (patient age, 47 years), the choledochojejunostomy was revised, the jejunum was partially resected, an adhesiolysis was performed, and intrahepatic gallstones were removed. Eight years after cholecystectomy, cholangitis recurred, multiple liver abscesses developed, and blood cultures grew Streptococcus intermedius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and E. coli. Twelve years after cholecystectomy, cholangitis relapsed owing to the recurrence of bile duct stenosis at the site of the previous injury, which was dilated during an ERCP without complications. Despite this measure, cholangitis recurred 2 weeks later but responded to appropriate treatment. Three months later, cholangitis recurred and blood cultures grew ESBL. Stenosis at the site of the anastomosis was dilated and, for the first time, a plastic stent was deployed by means of ERCP. Three months later, cholangitis recurred. On ERCP, the previously placed plastic stent was no longer visible and a new one was deployed into the right hepatic duct without complications. Cholangitis recurred again 6 and 7 months later. During consecutive ERCP, a liver abscess was detected, and as the previous plastic stent was no longer visible, a 10-mm-long Wallstent (metal stent) was deployed.\nTwo weeks after ERCP, the patient was readmitted because of fever and tenderness of the right upper quadrant.
