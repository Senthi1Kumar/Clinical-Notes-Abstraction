    "original_text": "A 69-year-old Japanese female was admitted to our hospital due to thyroid tumors that had been increasing in number and size on routine thyroid ultrasonography (US). On physical examination, the patient was in a good nutritional state and in no acute distress. She had no symptoms of heart failure. There was a palpable soft mass in the thyroid gland, and the patient\u2019s serum CEA level was a little high (5.1 ng/mL). Free T3 and free T4 levels were normal, but her TSH level was high (4.56 \u03bcIU/mL). Full blood count, blood chemistry, and serum thyroglobulin levels were normal. She had been taking thiamazole for 25 years for hyperthyroidism.\nShe had been operated on 10 years earlier to extirpate a left atrial myxoma (Fig. ). Multiple thyroid nodules were observed at that time. Thyroid scintigraphy revealed an increased focal uptake of 99mTc in the same lesions in the left lobe, being consistent with toxic multinodular goiter. These corresponded to the criteria of CNC, and she was diagnosed with CNC. Genetic studies found no mutation in the PRKAR1A gene. From that time on, she received annual brain MRI, abdominal CT, and thyroid US examinations. The thyroid nodules on thyroid US gradually increased in number and size.

She has had difficulties in walking longer distances since the age of 14 when she underwent corrective osteotomy for congenital genu valgum. However during the last years she noticed a newly developed decrease in tone and strength of the proximal muscles, predominantly affecting the lower limbs, especially when climbing stairs. Muscular weakness had slowly progressed, being most prominent in the evening hours. For the past 6 months she had been dependent on walking aids (canes or crutches). Moreover she reported of exertion induced myalgia. Family history at this time was unremarkable.\nClinical examination showed a symmetric proximal tetraparesis particular of the limb girdle muscles (MRC grade 4+ / 5 on arm elevation, rotation and abduction and 4 / 5 on hip and knee flexion and extension on both sides). Strength of the distal muscles was unremarkable. Muscle tone was slightly decreased. There were no relevant muscular atrophies. Tendon reflexes were normal. Examination of gait revealed slight bilateral Trendelenburg\u2019s sign. History and clinical features were consistent with signs of a neuromuscular disorder.\nOn diagnostic work-up, both cranial and spinal MRI scans were unremarkable, as well as the lumbar punction. ECG and echocardiogram showed no abnormalities. Electrophysiological examination showed neither signs of peripheral sensory or motoric neuropathy nor of central nervous disorders, however EMG revealed myopathic changes in the proximal muscles of the upper and lower limbs with few myotonic discharges.

    "original_text": "A 25-year-old male presented to emergency with a history of metallic ring stuck at the base of penis following insertion for sexual pleasure, two hours after the incident (Figure ). Initially, he was admitted to the urology department and was posted for its removal. Help was sought when they failed to remove it after their best efforts. The ring was approximately 1 cm wide and 0.25 cm thick and was made up of gold-plated platinum. The penis was swollen with a constriction at the base. The venous prominence was seen distal to the constriction ring. Mild edema at the glans penis was noted. The first attempt was made to cut the ring using a motorized cutting tool used in orthopedics. However, the speed and size of the saw were worrisome and there was every possibility of damaging the underlying soft tissue due to its high speed. Hence, this attempt was abandoned.\nThe second attempt was made using a Bard-Parker (BP) handle (Figure ) and a jumbo cutter (Figure ). This technique was fairly simple, as we passed the reverse end of the BP handle between the metallic ring and soft tissue at the base of the penis. The jumbo cutter was used to cut the ring over it. The advantage of using the reverse end of the BP handle blade was to ensure the prevention of soft tissue damage as one stabilizes it, while the other person can use a considerable amount of force over the jumbo cutter.

She was referred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment on the next day. Several years earlier, she had a tumor excised from her right eyelid, and the tumor was diagnosed as a spiradenoma. Our examination showed that her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/30 OD and 20/20 OS. A round to oval-shaped nodule with smooth borders was present in the right upper palpebral conjunctiva (Figure A), which was thought to be the same location of the previous tumor. The tumor was excised and evaluated histopathologically. The tumor cells were arranged in intertwining bands just beneath the conjunctiva. Two types of neoplastic cells were recognized; one had a small dark nucleus representing an undifferentiated cell, and the other was located at the center of the bands with large pale nucleus (Figure B). Levels of mitotic counts were low (0.3/10 HPF) and immunohistochemical analysis showed that the Ki-67 labeling index was 2.8% (Figure A). It was unclear if there were the tumor cells still in the incisional margin of the slices.One year later, she visited our hospital again complaining of pain in the right eye. A nodule of approximately 1\u20133 mm in size accompanying by enlarged blood vessels was observed at the right upper palpebral conjunctiva (Figure C). This nodule was regarded as a recurrence. Preauricular and cervical lymphadenopathy was not present. Laboratory data including blood chemistry, and serum level of tumor markers were within the normal range. No abnormal findings were seen in the chest X-rays. The tumor was excised with adjunctive cryotherapy and examined histopathologically.

In June 2017, he developed recurrent localized and dark pain in the upper abdomen without obvious inducement. It was tolerable, lasted for about 1 h, occurred about 3 times a day and was accompanied by thin, textureless melena, dizziness, and fatigue. His symptoms occurred repeatedly. He had gone to major hospitals across the country many times, but there was no clear diagnosis, and conservative treatment was used for alleviation. Two months before admission, the above symptoms progressively worsened. Melena was passed 4-5 times a day, with a total volume of about 200 g, and the dizziness and fatigue were significantly worse than before. After symptomatic treatment of hemostasis in the local hospital, the symptoms were improved, but still existed.\nHe was diagnosed with syphilis in 2008. Multiple treatments were successful, but the disease recurred shortly afterward. Because of heart valve disease, he underwent a mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valvuloplasty at Fujian Provincial Hospital In 2010. In 2019, he was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and chronic pancreatitis. Currently, he is taking Betaloc 23.75 mg qd orally.\nThe patient had a history of unprotected intercourse with multiple sexual partners, a smoking history for 40 years (20 cigarettes a day), and a drinking history for 30 years.

Avulsed maxillary central incisor had been kept in saline solution from the moment of trauma until its replantation 3 h later. The crown of the avulsed tooth was intact and the root had a closed apex. The intraoral and radiographic examination also revealed complicated crown fracture of the left central incisor []. No other oral injury was detected clinically. The left central and lateral incisors showed negative response to vitality test.\nThe patient was immediately anaesthetized, the alveolar socket was washed with saline solution to remove the blood clot and the avulsed maxillary right central incisor was replanted back into the alveoler socket with the help of finger pressure []. The tooth then splinted to the adjacent teeth with composite resin and the gingival lacerations were also repaired with sutures [Figures and and ]. The patient was instructed about her biting habits and oral hygiene implement.

Since the patient also suffered from mild hypertension, vascular encephalopathy was thought to be the cause of the progressive cognitive decline.

The initial outside multi-phase dynamic CT scan obtained at that time using a multidetector CT scanner (Sensation 16, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) after intravenous injection of contrast media was available for review, although the information on the amount and the brand name of the contrast media was not available. The CT images revealed two nodules each in the left upper and lower lobes. These nodules were round in shape with a well-circumscribed margin, and maximum diameters of 22 and 20 mm, respectively. On non-contrast CT scan, the nodules revealed no calcification. On multi-phase dynamic CT images, the nodules showed peripheral nodular enhancement at the early arterial phase obtained 1 minute after intravenous administration of contrast media and a subsequent \"central filling-in\" enhancement pattern on the delayed scans (obtained 2 and 4 minutes after contrast enhancement) (), which was identical to the well-known enhancement pattern of hemangiomas of the liver. Wedge resection of those left pulmonary nodules was performed at the other hospital, and the review of the pathologic specimen revealed pulmonary capillary hemangiomas.\nAt 50 months follow-up, new pulmonary nodules were detected on a chest radiograph, and the patient visited our institution for further evaluation.

On admission, the blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg, the respiratory rate was 36 per minute, the pulse rate was 112 per minute, and the peripheral oxygen saturation was 80%. Fine crackles were auscultated in both lower lung fields and an apical grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur was present. A chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion (). The electrocardiogram showed voltage criteria consistent with LV hypertrophy, and T wave inversion in leads V5 and V6 was compatible with LV strain ().\nThe CK-MB and troponin-I levels were normal (1.87 and 0.022 ng/mL, respectively). The B-type natriuretic peptide was markedly elevated (1,850 pg/mL). Other laboratory parameters were unremarkable.\nThe patient had a history of an acute MI during a previous admission; the electrocardiogram showed ST segment elevation in leads III and aVF and Q waves in leads II, III, and aVF. Coronary angiography revealed severe coronary artery stenoses (total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery, total occlusion of the proximal left circumflex artery, and a 40% stenotic lesion in the distal left main artery). Thus, primary percutaneous coronary revascularization of the right coronary artery was performed.\nTwo-dimensional echocardiography at the previous admission showed decreased LV systolic function (ejection fraction, 40%) and a mild pericardial effusion. The regional wall motion abnormalities with akinetic basal to the mid-inferior and posterolateral walls of the LV were observed.

The phyma was 1.5 \u00d7 1.0 cm in size, with mild tenderness and no local redness. The patient presented with no abnormal coughing, sputum or fever. A surgical resection was performed on October 26, 2007, and the phyma was identified as a left frontal metastatic poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma by pathology (). Further examinations were performed in order to identify the primary tumor, and a chest computed tomography (CT) scan disclosed the presence of two lesions. One was a lump shadow with a small burr of ~2.0 cm in size in the upper right lung, while the other was also in the upper right lung, but was a patchy shadow with an unclear edge, thereby indicating a high possibility of lung cancer (). Using emission computed tomography (ECT), several lightly visible restricted radioactivity concentration sites were detected at the left temporal bone, the 7th and 10th thoracic vertebra and the right ileum, while no evident abnormalities were observed in the brain. There were also no evident abnormalities in the pancreas, spleen, kidney or double-adrenal gland, which were examined by an ultra-B scan. The gastroscopic results and blood carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were normal and the patient had no history of smoking or high blood pressure.\nThe general health of the patient was fine and the performance status (PS) was scored as 0. A surgical scar was observed on the left frontal area of the face. There was no enlargement of the two supraclavicular lymph nodes and heart and lung auscultation heralded negative results.

The patient suffered from Charcot Marie Tooth Type 1b and bilateral hip dysplasia, which had been treated with multiple surgeries. On first presentation, the patient was found to have patellar dysplasia and patella alta, but with normal patellar tracking, and there was a full-thickness chondral defect on the lateral facet of the patella. In addition, there was also an old complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), and the patient was complaining of intermittent instability.\nThe patient underwent an ACL reconstruction combined with a tibial tuberosity advancement osteotomy, to correct the patella alta. The chondral defect on the lateral facet of the patella was found to measure approximately 2 cm \u00d7 1 cm. The edges of this defect were stabilized by arthroscopic radiofrequency chondroplasty and the base was treated with microfracture.\nThe patient underwent slow and cautious rehabilitation, remaining non-weight-bearing for the first 6-week period followed by a gradual return to full-weight-bearing as comfort allowed, but avoiding any heavy patellofemoral loading until 6 months post-operatively.\nThe patient then reported that the knee felt stable and initially there was reduced anterior knee pain. However, over the course of the following 3\u20134 years, the patient once more began to complain of increasing anterior knee pain again, particularly with any activity that involved patellofemoral loading. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at 4 years post-microfracture showed poor filling of the patellar lesion with minimal fibrocartilage ().\nAfter a detailed discussion of the various potential options, the patient consented to further surgery.

There was no urinary incontinence or dysparunia.\nOn general physical examination, secondary sexual characters were present. On local examination, external urethral meatus appeared dilated, and there was blindly ending vagina approximately 3 cm in length. On per rectum examination, uterus appeared normal in size and there was no bulge felt below it to suggest any collection. On investigations, the ultrasound showed normal uterus with endometrial thickness 9.5 mm, ovaries were normal, and bilateral kidneys were also normal. MRI of abdomen showed normal uterine body and cervix with small amount of fluid in endometrial cavity, endocervical cavity, and in upper part of vagina; below that there was a transverse vaginal septum of about 3.5 cm in thickness. No fistulous tract or communication was visualized between the genital and urinary tract.

Her obstetric history was significant for prior spontaneous preterm birth with placement of an ultrasound-indicated McDonald cerclage at 20 1/7 weeks of gestation in the index pregnancy. At the time of cerclage placement, the 5 mm Mersilene (polyester) tape was noted to be suboptimally placed along the posterior rim, distal to the internal os, so a second McDonald cerclage of 0-polyester suture was placed cephalad to the tape. She was admitted at 28 0/7 weeks for preterm labor and the cerclages were removed with no remarkable anatomic irregularities. She received antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium sulfate during her admission for preterm labor and was discharged on hospital day #3 with a cervical exam of 1cm dilation and 70% effacement. During her readmission at 29 0/7 weeks for shortness of breath, she began to have contractions and moderate vaginal bleeding on hospital day #3. Her cervical exam was 4 cm and 90% effaced. She was transferred to labor and delivery, where she continued to have a rapid cervical change to 6 cm. A brief fetal heart rate bradycardia occurred with spontaneous recovery to a normal baseline. At this time, findings were concerning for placental abruption or possible coagulopathy from decompensated liver failure with a total estimated blood loss of 500 mL. Amniotomy was performed to expedite vaginal delivery. However, cervical dilation did not continue and complete cessation of vaginal bleeding was noted.

She was asymptomatic at rest and denied chest pain, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, leg swelling, presyncope, or syncope. She was incidentally found to have a systolic murmur during her pregnancy 20 years prior to this presentation. Notably, she had been offered aortic valve replacement in the past but declined.\nVital signs were normal with blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg, pulse rate of 79/min, temperature of 97.2\u00b0F, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min with normal oxygen saturation of 100% on ambient air. Physical examination was significant for irregularly irregular heart rhythm, and ejection systolic murmur was loudest in the aortic area with radiation to the carotids. Her lungs were clear to auscultation, and no pedal edema was noted. Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. Her most recent transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a thickened calcified aortic valve with decreased excursion with 4.6 m/s velocity suggesting a peak of 86 mmHg and mean of 36 mmHg suggestive of severe aortic stenosis. No other significant valvular abnormalities noted. Cardiac catheterization revealed widely patent coronary arteries.\nBased on the presence of worsening symptoms and the risk of sudden cardiac death, the decision was made to proceed with surgical aortic valve replacement. Given her history of chronic atrial fibrillation, she was also planned for left atrial appendage exclusion and Cox Maze IV procedure simultaneously with the aortic valve replacement. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram revealed quadricuspid aortic valves confirmed during surgical exploration ().

As a result, she was referred to our hospital approximately 1 year after her first symptom presentation, where she presented with severe left hip pain and was completely unable to walk. Radiographs of her left hip showed no obvious osseous abnormality (Fig. ). In contrast, CT examinations revealed a well-demarcated 5 mm mass with limited bone sclerosis in her left acetabulum (Fig. ). The mass was characterized by low intensity on T1 and high intensity on T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. MRI also revealed joint effusion (Fig. ). Clinical and radiological findings were consistent with OO of the left acetabulum. She underwent CT-guided resection of the nidus and ablation using a standard electrosurgical generator at a power output of 15 W for 60-seconds duration (Fig. ). This procedure was performed under total anesthesia and in the prone position. We identified the positional relationship between the nidus, triradiate cartilage, and sciatic nerve using a CT marker. After making a small 3-cm long incision while avoiding her sciatic nerve, a guide pin was inserted.

An extraoral clinical examination identified a pigmented subcutaneous nodule on the patient\u2019s dorsum, measuring 5 cm in diameter, and scarring from the previous surgical resections.\nThe patient\u2019s chief complaint was the loss of the dental crown of her upper left incisor. She denied oral pain or the existence of any relevant oral soft tissue lesion. Intraoral soft tissue examination revealed a nodule with an ulcerated surface and areas of telangiectasia, on the posterior left lateral border of the tongue, measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter, adjacent to a partial edentulous mandibular area (Fig. A). Based on the clinical features of the tongue lesion and on the patient\u2019s medical background, the diagnostic hypothesis included metastatic melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma and fibrous hyperplasia.\nAn incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia.

Postoperatively, the patient was followed up at our hospital for 1 year due to residential issues, and the removal of the plate was scheduled after confirmation of bone union. According to the previous hospital\u2019s medical records, a 9-hole locking plate (APIS\u00ae, Gwangju, Republic of Korea) was used for the distal tibia, with three 5.0-mm locking screws for proximal fixation and six 3.5-mm locking screws for distal fixation. Under spinal anesthesia, a plate removal surgery was performed, following which the fibular plate was easily removed. However, five of the six distal locking screws were damaged, and they could not be removed with a screwdriver. This situation was explained to the patient during the operation, and we could confirm that the patient wanted to remove the plate irrespective of the amount of time required. At the time, a tourniquet was used for approximately 1 h, and screw removal was attempted using a conical extraction screw, but only one of the six screws could be removed. Previously proposed techniques requiring additional skin incisions were not considered because there were multiple damaged screws that could not be removed, these techniques would require extended amount of time for removal, and the surrounding soft tissues could be damaged. Hence, we decided to use a screw extractor (IRWIN\u00ae, Huntersville, NC, USA), a non-medical instrument, following sterilization with ethylene oxide.

The patient immediately had two episodes of vomiting and then gradually developed altered sensorium in the form of drowsiness within two hours of ingestion of the poison. On examination in the ER, the patient had a Glasgow coma scale score of 9/15 (E2V2M5). Vital signs revealed a radial pulse of 50 beats per minute, blood pressure 90/50mm Hg, respiratory rate 16 breaths/minute, the temperature of 97.2 degrees F and oxygen saturation of 86% in room air. His pupils were constricted bilaterally and sluggishly reacting to light. His chest auscultation revealed bilateral vesicular breath sounds, the abdomen was soft with normal bowel sounds on auscultation. Deep tendon reflexes were present with down going plantars.\nThe patient was provided oxygen at two litres per minute via nasal cannula, his oxygen saturation improved to 96%. He was managed by administering immediately a bolus dose of 500ml of 0.9% of normal saline and an intravenous dose of atropine 0.6mg following which his heart rate increased to 96 beats per minute showing a normal sinus rhythm in the 12 lead electrocardiogram and was normotensive. His investigations comprising a full blood count, renal function tests, a random blood sugar level, liver function tests, and a coagulation profile were all within normal limits. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis did not reveal any abnormalities and a serum cholinesterase level was within normal limit.\nSix hours of close monitoring with continuous supportive management resulted in the patient opening his eyes spontaneously with a purposeful response to verbal stimuli.

Her medical history began about 2 years ago when she was admitted to a different surgical Department with the same symptoms; the CT scan revealed a large well-defined cystic mass of 15 \u00d7 12 cm in size in the upper pole of the spleen. Elective laparoscopic decapsulation was performed along with puncture of the cyst in order to reduce its size. At histological examination, the cyst was composed of a thick fibrous tissue wall lined by a stratified squamous epithelium. After 5 months of follow-up, a CT scan demonstrated a recurrent cystic lesion; subsequently, the patient turned to another surgical team who performed further laparoscopic decapsulation with drainage of the lesion. In this case, the microscopic examination of the removed wall fragment showed a coating of squamous epithelial cells. Eight months later, the patient complained again of pain and sense of weight in the same location, and a CT examination revealed the second recurrence of the cyst. She came to our attention 10 months later. On the clinical examination, pre-existing surgical scars were noted, and deep palpation of the left hypochondrium evoked an intense pain.

There were no symptoms of breathing difficulty, hemoptysis, bony pains, or lumps noticed anywhere in body. Evaluation included a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of thorax which revealed a left upper lobe peripherally situated mass of size 2 \u00d7 2 cm involving chest wall, enlarged pretracheal, prevascular, and aortopulmonary window nodes, and mild left pleural effusion.\nThe common differential diagnoses for weight loss and lung mass with lymphadenopathy in a male smoker in our country are chronic obstructive lung disease, chronic bronchitis, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and lung cancer. Clinical history and thorough examination should be made with careful palpation of the neck for lymphadenopathy and chest auscultation. A chest radiograph is the basis of imaging and is complemented by a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest, which should include the liver and the adrenal glands. Tissue diagnosis is mandatory if the clinicoradiological suspicion of malignancy is high and a biopsy should be performed either by bronchoscopy or with CT guidance. If confirmed to be malignant, further staging workup would be required if the chest CT scan shows non-metastatic disease. A metastatic workup would include a positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain.\nOur patient presented to us with a CT scan showing a left upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a small pleural effusion.

Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed a 3.9 \u00d7 3.7 cm heterogenous soft tissue mass in the ascending colon near the hepatic flexure with invasion of the right anterior pararenal fascia and the second/third portion of the duodenum. There were associated enlarged and necrotic portacaval and mesenteric lymph nodes and a 1 cm hypodense lesion in the right hepatic lobe. Colonoscopy with biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, and subsequent immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed loss of MLH1 and PMS2 gene expression consistent with MSI-H/dMMR. The patient was started on 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), but continued experiencing symptoms of partial bowel obstruction including severe nausea, emesis, abdominal pain and dizziness from hypovolemia. CT imaging at this time is shown in . Given no evidence of response to chemotherapy for 2 months, she was transitioned to pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1). Shortly after initiation of pembrolizumab, she developed a partial large bowel obstruction secondary to the tumor. This was relieved by placement of a percutaneous gastrostomy tube and she was started on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and resumed immunotherapy. Following three cycles of immunotherapy, imaging was consistent with partial response in the primary tumor and associated lymph nodes and the patient was also able to transition to an oral diet. However, after 8 months on immunotherapy she developed complete bowel obstruction, though imaging showed continued response in the primary tumor and metastases. The bowel obstruction was thought to be from adhesions and inflammatory changes and not progression of the patient's primary disease.

She was seen on May 2011 for the first time by a neurologist with a 3-month history of dull holocephalic headache who ordered a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diagnosed a tension-type headache and a depressive disorder. Treatment with an antidepressant (duloxetine) was started. The patient experienced no improvement and a second examination by another neurologist was undertaken 2 months later. Again no focal neurological signs could be detected. Due to the weight loss, an occult neoplasm was suspected but not detected during an extensive inpatient investigation at a medical department during February 2012; however, the MRI showed bilateral white matter lesions (WML) and an old lacunar lesion located at the left striatum, the latter was not seen in the previous MRI from May 2011. Since the patient also suffered from mild hypertension, vascular encephalopathy was thought to be the cause of the progressive cognitive decline. Extensive neurocognitive testing was carried out in a rehabilitation centre in May 2012 and disclosed a severe decline of attention, memory and executive functions corresponding to subcortical dementia (Fig. ). When the patient was seen for a further diagnostic work-up at the SMZ-Ost-Donauspital in July 2012, the weight was 47\u202fkg and a weight loss of 20\u202fkg was reported over the past year. The gait was insecure with postural instability and with a tendency to fall when turning around. Frontal signs were positive, the voice was quiet, the tonus was mildly elevated and showed a slight hesitancy (\u201cGegenhalten\u201d), tendon reflexes were brisk, paresis and pyramidal signs missing. There were no signs of ataxia, but a mild bradykinesia. Action tremor was more distinct than a mild resting tremor.",

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) has been diagnosed in 1973, and the patient reached end-stage renal failure in 1982. He received two kidney allografts, in 1983 and 1993, which both failed as a consequence of early recurrence of FSGS. Since 2002, hemodialysis was performed on a left femorofemoral fistula, because it was impossible to create new upper arm fistula after multiple episodes of thrombosis.\nThe third kidney transplantation was performed in April 2011 on the right iliac fossa. The patient was not immunized, and cold ischemia time was 23 hours. The patient received thymoglobulin as an induction therapy, with mycophenolate mofetil daily, and tacrolimus and corticosteroids as maintenance therapy. After an initial delayed graft function, renal function improved, and on day 10 serum creatinine was 155 \u00b5mol/L.\nA rise of serum creatinine at 180 \u00b5mol/L on day 10 led to the initial diagnosis of moderate acute humoral rejection (g1, cpt1, C4d 3, and acute tubular necrosis), despite the absence of donor specific antibodies. Serum creatinine improved after an increase of corticosteroids doses and plasma exchange therapy.\nThe patient was discharged 3 weeks after transplantation with serum creatinine at 124 \u00b5mol/L.\nA phlebography with carbon dioxide followed by an angioplasty of the femorofemoral fistula was performed 3 weeks after discharge because of a stenosis diagnosed before the transplantation, leading to decreased blood flow and difficulties in cannulation.\nThree days after angioplasty, the patient was readmitted for volume overload syndrome with peripheral oedema and shortness of breath.\nOn admission, the patient was afebrile, its blood pressure was 118/66 mmHg, and its pulse rate 83/min.
