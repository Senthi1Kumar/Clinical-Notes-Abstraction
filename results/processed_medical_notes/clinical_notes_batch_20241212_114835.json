He was referred from the medical department for complaints of increased water intake with two episodes of abnormal movements. Abnormal movements were characterized by sudden tightening of limbs and jaws with jerky movements with urinary incontinence and loss of consciousness one month prior to the visit. Patient was evaluated and found to have low serum sodium levels. The jerky movements were attributed to hyponatremia induced seizure due to increased water intake. On elicitation of history from patient, his wife and his brother who accompanied him, reported that patient was apparently functioning well until 2 to 3 years ago when he had an episode of fever following which he started reporting complaints of weakness and anxiety. He reported that he was advised by the doctor to drink fluids, following which he initially started taking increased amounts of water per day and gradually the intake was raised to about 10 liters / day. He started feeling thirsty while talking or after micturition and there was a need to drink water after every five to ten minutes and also, after whenever he passed urine. He reported that he would feel anxious and irritable if he was unable to get water or if family would stop him from taking water. His appetite had decreased and he had suffered loss of weight over the period of 2 years and had thoughts preoccupied with water intake. He would always keep a 2 liter bottle of water with him. He also lost interest in work and stopped going to work, citing weakness and fatigability all through the day as the reason for absenteeism from work. There was no history of sadness of mood or any other depressive symptoms. No psychotic symptoms could be elicited and no other obsessive thoughts, images or impulses or any other",

The patient was postmenopausal for 30 years and had a free medical history. Physical examination revealed no tenderness, but a hard and mobile mass palpable in the right iliac fossa. Further investigation by means of transvaginal ultrasound revealed a cystic formation, sized 83 \u00d7 65 \u00d7 64 mm in the right adnexal area. The mass was of mixed structure, comprising of solid and cystic areas. The wall was smooth and anechoic on ultrasound imaging.

The left ovary was illustrated measuring 25 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 11 mm, but the right ovary could not be visualized (Figures and ). A polyp of the endometrium was also recorded, with total endometrial thickness of 8 mm. No free fluid was seen in the Douglas pouch. However, it was inconclusive whether the mass originated from the right adnexa or it concerned a uterine necrotic leiomyoma that protruded towards the adnexa. Because of the indeterminate ultrasound findings, an abdominal CT scan was carried out which identified a cyst sized 100 \u00d7 80 mm with signs of peripheral calcification attributed to a lesion of the right ovary (Figures and ). As a routine investigation, when an ovarian tumor is suspected, our patient underwent colonoscopy, during which a benign polyp of the sigmoid colon was excised; also a submucosal round smooth cystic formation of one cm in diameter at the site of the appendix was identified. Tumor markers were within normal limits, with the exception of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA: 54, 2 ng/mL).\nThe patient underwent laparotomy with the diagnosis of a pelvic mass, in which a cystic tumor originating from the appendix, sized 80 \u00d7 90 mm, was identified, whereas the uterus and ovaries were atrophic.

Patient gave no history of trauma and extractions in relation with the missing teeth. The patient reported that the teeth exfoliated due to loosening. The patient's medical history was not contributory. Family history revealed no such abnormality among other family members.\nOn intraoral examination [] the morphologic appearance and color of the permanent teeth were normal. In maxillary arch, the missing teeth were from right canine region to left canine region and in mandibular arch, all the incisors were missing. There was generalized grade II and grade III mobility. Oral hygiene was poor and there were plaque and calculus deposits in all the quadrants. Restorations were present in left maxillary first molar and mandibular second molar.\nPanoramic radiograph [] revealed adequate enamel thickness on the cuspal tips of all the teeth. There was no root formation in most of the teeth while some of the teeth exhibited short, blunted and malformed roots of only a few millimeters with obliterated pulp chambers.

Upon presentation to our clinic in May of 2012, he was complaining of a two-week history of right lower quadrant pain and a newly discovered mass in the vicinity of a previous trocar site. He initially noted the onset of the pain when performing pull-ups at a local gym, at which time he noted pulling sensation in the right lower quadrant. Following the initial onset of symptoms, he continued to have pain in the area and noted an intermittent bulge as well. He presented for initial evaluation by his primary care provider who obtained a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. The scan revealed a 10 mm right lower quadrant hernia with herniated fat and a tubular structure which was read as a possible omental vessel, with concern for incarceration (). Upon reviewing the CT with the patient in clinic it was felt that the tubular structure was actually the vermiform appendix and thus laparoscopic incisional hernia repair was recommended.\nHe presented the following week for an elective hernia repair.

Her history began with an ACDF from C5 to C7 in 2009 for neck and arm pain. Following her index procedure, she experienced nonunion with loosening of screws and thus underwent a revision extension ACDF from C3 to C7 in 2010 which resulted in significant and immediate neck and arm pain relief. Despite her pain relief, her postoperative course was complicated by superficial surgical site infection necessitating irrigation and debridement 3 days later and antibiotics. Despite no apparent intraoperative complications or oropharyngeal perforation, she experienced significant dysphagia following the third surgery, and, despite unremarkable serial esophagrams, required a feeding tube for approximately 1 year. Gradually, after this period of oropharyngeal rest, her dysphagia somewhat improved and she was able to tolerate a mechanical soft diet with some difficulty. The patient had sustained pain relief but persistent dysphagia for approximately 3 years without any additional work-up. The patient initially presented to our institution following a low-energy fall. Her symptomatology had not changed but routine cervical spine imaging was obtained and she was subsequently referred to our spine specialty clinic for continued evaluation.\nAt the time of her presentation, her plain film radiography () and computed tomography (CT) of the cervical spine () revealed nonhealing posterior pseudarthrosis with local kyphosis, screw loosening, plate migration, and air communicating with the plate raising concern for esophageal perforation.

The patient is a 42-year-old female who presented to her local medical officer with a two-week history of neck pain and radicular like pains extending into her right arm. A CT scan of her cervical spine revealed multilevel intervertebral disc and facet joint degenerative change resulting in neural exit foraminal narrowing. She was noted to have raised inflammatory markers (WCC 27.5, neutrophils 24.8, and CRP 319) and S. aureus was isolated on a blood culture. She was commenced on IV antibiotics; however her symptoms failed to improve and she subsequently developed significant lower back pain for which a CT of her lumbar spine was arranged. This revealed no convincing evidence of a lumbar spine infective process; however a 47 \u00d7 31 mm solid upper pole mass with an irregular periphery and internal calcification was identified in the left kidney, suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma.\nThe renal mass was further characterized with a triple phase abdominal CT scan and this confirmed a 4 \u00d7 4.9 \u00d7 4.5 cm heterogenous mass in the upper pole of the left kidney. There was no evidence of left renal vein involvement nor was any radiologically significant lymphadenopathy seen. Her films were reviewed and the decision was made to biopsy the left renal mass to establish whether the lesion was neoplastic or inflammatory. A core biopsy of the left kidney was reported as a Fuhrman grade 1, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (). She was then booked for an elective laparoscopic left radical nephrectomy. She underwent this procedure without complication and had an uneventful postoperative course subsequently being discharged home on day four.\nMacroscopic examination of the surgical specimen revealed a tumor in the mid portion of the kidney located superior to the renal hilum measuring 48 mm \u00d7 40 mm \u00d7 46 mm",

In 2015 the patient was diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma in the right thigh and bilateral pulmonary metastases.

On our examination, the swelling was around 4\u00d72 cm in size. It was pulsatile on palpation, and there were no motor deficits in the left hand. This swelling was localized in the left hand hypothenar eminence, and both the radial and ulnar pulses were palpable with a good capillary refill.

He had undergone a mechanical aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis 14 years ago which was followed 2 years later by repeat mechanical aortic valve replacement for streptococcal prosthetic valve endocarditis. His postoperative recovery following his second valve replacement was uneventful. He continued to be well and asymptomatic with a well healed sternal wound for the next 12 years. However, 12 years following his 2nd operation, he presented with a discharging sinus in epigastrium (fig ) which was initially treated with dressings and antibiotics by his GP. Exploration of the sinus under general anaesthetic was undertaken after the sinus failed to heal. The sinus was in communication with anterior mediastinum by penetrating the rectus sheath and was divided at the point of entry into mediastinum and removed. All sternal wires were removed. Microbiology of the excised tissue revealed staphylococcus aureus infection and this was treated with appropriate antibiotics for 4 weeks. However, the wound failed to heal although he never developed any signs of systemic illness. A CT scan of chest showed an encapsulated mass extending from ascending aorta to the diaphragm and normal sternum. Transthoracic echocardiography ruled out pseudoaneurysm of ascending aorta, prosthetic endocarditis or aortic root abscess. An MR scan confirmed a longitudinal retrosternal mass extending from mid ascending aorta to the diaphragm (figs and ) and cutaneous fistulization to the epigastrium through left rectus sheath.\nAn exploratory secondary median sternotomy was made with cardiopulmonary bypass on standby. Heart and the great vessels were dissected out within the pericardial cavity. A nonpulsatile longitudinal 15 cm mass was found on the anterior surface of ascending aorta and right ventricle along the entire length of anterior mediastinum.

CT images of the patient demonstrated that the medial side of the left mandible was missing and there was a 3 \u00d7 2 cm diameter defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible neighboring the left submandibular gland. The main reason of the failed attempts to close the fistula was considered to be the ineffective management of dead space surrounding the fistula. Consequently, it was decided to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect and support the oral and the cutaneous flaps.\nUnder general anesthesia, the fistula was excised initially and the oral and the cutaneous healthy soft tissues were prepared. At the extraoral site, the incision was extended to the posterior and anterior directions, following the previous incision lines.

Early ultrasound showed a twin pregnancy, each containing a yolk sac and a live embryo. One sac was placed low towards the cervical canal while the other sac was placed towards the fundus, corresponding to 6 weeks of gestation. Early ultrasound suggested the possibility of a low implantation but did not confirm heterotopic pregnancy. On 4 Feb 2007, the patient was hospitalized in view of one episode of bleeding pervaginum. Keeping in mind the diagnosis of threatened abortion, she was managed conservatively and was discharged after 3 days. A repeat ultrasound at 7 weeks and 5 days of gestation confirmed the diagnosis of intrauterine and cervical heterotropic pregnancy []. The patient was readmitted on 19 Feb 2007. Fetal reduction of cervical pregnancy was performed under general anesthesia by injecting intrathoracic potassium chloride under transvaginal ultrasound guidance. The cardiac activity of the intrauterine fetus was found to be normal after the procedure was completed. The patient was discharged after 2 days. The rest of the pregnancy went uneventfully, except for mild vaginal spotting off and on. At 28 weeks of gestation, the patient was readmitted with asymmetrical intrauterine growth retardation. Fetal Doppler study on ultrasound showed reduced umbilical blood flows with adequate liquor and normal middle cerebral artery blood flows. She was serially monitored with biweekly ultrasound for fetal Doppler blood flow studies. At 31 weeks of gestation, a lower segment cesarean section was performed in view of absent end diastolic umbilical arterial fetal blood flow with reduced amniotic fluid index (amniotic fluid index 5). A male baby weighing 1.16 kg was born on 26 July 2007. Intraoperatively, the lower uterine segment showed presence of trophoblastic tissue and hemostatic sutures had to be taken in view of active bleeding from the anterior wall near the isthmus. The lower segment was ballooned up. Post-operative ultrasonography showed the presence of small amounts of trophoblastic tissue with low vascularity",

He had been admitted elsewhere for the management of those injuries and had been managed on an indoor basis for 16 days. His shoulder discomfort had not been thought to be serious during his stay in that hospital. Orthopaedic consultation had been recommended at the time of discharge. Examination revealed a reasonably maintained contour of the shoulder with total restriction of abduction. The patient was able to internally rotate the shoulder up to 20\u00b0 and external rotation was not possible (Figs. , , ).\nRadiographs of the shoulder showed that the proximal humerus was fractured, and the proximal end of the distal fragment had migrated proximally to lie under the deltoid giving it a near normal contour. The head was dislocated inferiorly. This was confirmed by the axillary view. A significant callus had formed around the head and the shaft at their new position of contact.\nIt was obvious that the proximal pull on the distal fragment had made it migrate proximally.\nAccording to these findings, open reduction and reconstruction of the proximal humerus were considered necessary. Under general anaesthesia, the patient was placed in a supine position and the glenohumeral joint was assessed via a deltopectoral approach. The axillary nerve was palpated to ascertain its position. The long head of the biceps was still intact. The glenoid cavity and the proximal humerus were exposed, and granulation tissue and the callus were cleared from it. After meticulous removal of the scar tissue, the glenoid articular cartilage looked to be in good condition and the humeral head was reduced.\nAs expected, it was not possible to reduce the distal fragment to its normal position beneath the head of the humerus. The end was stripped of soft tissue and shortened by 2 cm. This made the reduction possible beneath the head.",

The patient was suffering from recurrent seizures since his childhood and was under anticonvulsant treatment with phenobarbital and valproic acid. He was a heavy smoker and had a history of dyslipidemia and allergy in amoxicillin. Also, in the past, the patient underwent a surgery on his right hip after a traffic accident that he had 2 years before.\nHis clinical examination showed increased reflexes of his left leg without other neurological findings. A brain CT scan without contrast was initially performed and revealed a lesion in his right parietal-occipital lobe. The additional intravenous administration of contrast medium showed that the dimensions of the lesion were 7.5 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 4.6 cm. The contrast uptake and the density of the tumor were heterogeneous. There was also 1 cm middle line shift to the left as well as elevation of the right occipital horn. The patient had screws in his right hip, which were surgically removed in order to perform an MRI for further investigation of the tumor. MRI examination confirmed the existence of a lesion in the right occipital lobe, nearby the occipital horn compatible with the image of a low grade glioma (). The patient did not have any visual disorders as the opthalmologists reported before surgery. Also, blood exams did not reveal any numerical or functional disorders.

Over a period of time the bowel got contained and the patient was put on oral nutrition. The patient was discharged was doing fine at home. However his abdominal wound was not healing. In the fourth month it was covered with the split thickness skin graft. The procedure and the post-operative period was uneventful till one month. However in the fifth month a serous discharge from the upper part of the grafted surface was noticed. It was coming from a small ulcer and was small in amount. Over a the period of time till he presented at our OPD it remained small in output. It was managed by applying gauge pieces over the wound which has to be changed once or sometimes two to three times a day.\nThe examination of the abdomen revealed a 12 cm \u00d7 5 cm elliptical patch of skin graft over the middle of the abdomen. There was a small depressed ulcer of around 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm in its upper part covered with pale granulation showing serous ooze. Apart from this ulcer there were few other spots showing exuberant pale granulation (). A scar was seen at previous drain site.

The patient had a history of child birth eight months prior, and had proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on the left common femoral vein during the 36th week of pregnancy. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter had been inserted instead of anticoagulation due to the high risk of bleeding during pregnancy. Anticoagulation therapy was administered immediately after the birth of her child. Removal of the IVC filter was recommended one month after insertion, but the patient refused for personal reasons. On arriving at the emergency room, her vital signs were stable and the laboratory examination did not show abnormalities other than mild leukocytosis. The patient's prothrombin time international normalized ratio value at the emergency room was 1.31 due to irregular intake of warfarin. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed that one of the IVC filter legs had penetrated the IVC wall and caused a duodenal perforation (). There was no evidence of thrombi in the lower IVC. An endoscopy was performed to evaluate the severity of duodenal injury. A protruding IVC filter leg was observed in the lumen of the third portion of the duodenum (). In addition, the duodenum mucous membrane on the opposite side showed erythema, erosion, and nodular changes, resembling chronically progressing penetration.\nAn emergency laparotomy was performed in order to remove the IVC filter and to repair the duodenum.

However, there was no definite abnormality on both adnexae and uterus grossly and the retroperitoneal mass on right side of uterus was detected in the operative field. The patient was referred to our institution for further evaluation and definitive treatment of right retroperitoneal pelvic mass. She had no previous medical illness except surgical history of appendectomy 22 years ago. Abdominal and vaginal examination revealed non-specific findings without palpation of abdominal mass and the laboratory findings are within normal limit including tumor marker.\nAbdominal ultrasonography revealed the right adnexal mass with echogenicity and this mass was abutting to uterus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated 8 cm-sized, enhancing mass attached to right adnexa and the uterus. This mass had the low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and heterogeneous, high signal intensity on T2-weighted images (). Because the previous laparoscopic exploration was negative for abnormality of right ovary, the ovarian tumor was excluded on diagnosis of the patient. Other possible diagnosis on MRI finding was mesenchymal sarcoma because the tumor had similar intensity to the muscle of uterus meaning originated from muscle but it looked like as separate from the uterus. Based on the imaging findings, the patient was diagnosed preoperatively as mesenchymal sarcoma on pelvic cavity and exploratory laparotomy was planned for removal the pelvic mass.\nAfter laparotomy via lower midline incision, the careful examination of pelvic cavity was performed. On the operative fields, the uterus was found to be normal size with smooth contour and there was no abnormal finding on both ovaries and fallopian tubes (). The retroperitoneal tumor of size 8 \u00d7 6 cm was palpated beneath the right broad ligament of uterus and",

Workup in the way of liver function tests and abdominal ultrasound did not demonstrate evidence suggesting biliary or gallbladder pathology, and as such she was discharged home. She represented within hours of discharge due to worsening symptoms. She therefore underwent evaluation with a computed tomography that demonstrated a soft tissue mass located posterior to the gallbladder (). The patient then underwent further evaluation with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Again, a complex cystic structure of indeterminate etiology was observed at the porta hepatis without evidence of communication with either the biliary or vascular structures. At the time, the differential diagnosis included a ruptured hepatic adenoma, biliary cystic lesion, or enteric cyst.\nSecondary to these findings and her persistent symptoms the patient was taken to the operating room. At the time of laparoscopy a hemorrhagic pedunculated mass was identified attached to the infundibulum of the gallbladder once the fundus was retracted in a cephalad direction ().

Her medical history was notable for prior deep vein thrombus in the right distal lower extremity while on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). She denied the active use of HRT and tobacco use during this admission. Venous Doppler ultrasound completed in the emergency room revealed extensive thrombosis of the left lower extremity extending superiorly towards the left common iliac vein. Further imaging with ultrasound revealed compression of the left iliac vein by the right iliac artery as well as a significantly elevated reflux time of the left great saphenous vein (14.2 seconds) suggestive of MTS. The patient was taken to the operating suite and during the procedure the common iliac vein appeared normal distally, but more proximally the vein was narrowed significantly to a diameter of less than 2 mm. Prior to entering the inferior vena cava, the common iliac vein normalized. Using intravenous ultrasound, measurements were taken and a 14 x 60 mm Luminexx stent was deployed at the area of stenosis. The stent was noted to have migrated upward into the inferior vena cava and a buttressing of this stent with a 16 x 40 mm Wallstent was placed to ensure adequate apposition. Unfortunately, this caused further migration upward into the IVC and a 14 mm Atlas balloon was used to help secure the migrated IVC stent. The area of stenosis was no longer stented given this migration. Therefore, stenting of the left common iliac vein stenosis was ultimately achieved with a 14 x 80 mm Luminexx stent ().

He presented to the emergency department in 4 h injury time with painful deformities of the right hip and knee, along with Type I open wound right leg with abnormal mobility suggestive of fracture in the ipsilateral leg. On examination, he was drowsy and disoriented with a Glasgow Coma Scale 8/15 and found to be hemodynamically unstable. Physical examination of the extremities revealed a flexed and adducted right hip with the right knee flexed to 30\u00b0 and with posterior dislocation (). Neurovascular examination revealed common peroneal nerve palsy and absent distal pulses. However, the Doppler showed weak signals over posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery, and the toes were found to be warm with delayed capillary filling. Computed tomography (CT) brain showed acute hemorrhagic contusion.

She did not have a history of headaches and there was no trauma.\nThe patient was evaluated by a physician at triage upon initial arrival in the department and was not noted to have any focal deficits. Her initial vital signs were only notable for a blood pressure of 125/95mmHg. She was evaluated by the treating physicians approximately 20 minutes after arrival and noted to have an NIH stroke scale score of three for slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold, drift in the right leg, and altered sensation in the right leg. Sensation was tested by comparing the perception of sharp stimuli between each lower extremity, which was reported to be more dull throughout the right lower extremity compared to the left in a non-dermatomal pattern. The patient underwent an emergent non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head followed by CT angiograms of the neck and brain. The on-call neurologist was consulted and noted no focal deficits on exam with an NIH stroke scale of zero approximately 40 minutes after the exam by the emergency physician. Her imaging studies were reviewed and she was found to have bilateral internal carotid artery dissections with pseudoaneurysm formation on the left creating a relative stenosis ().\nAfter discussion with the neurosurgical service, she was started on a heparin drip and admitted to the ICU for monitoring.

She cried for a brief period and there was no loss of consciousness. There was no vomiting or convulsions following the head injury. Next day morning, about 12 hours after the injury, child developed weakness involving right side of the face, right arm, and the right leg. Child was unable to sit or stand. On examination child was conscious and active showing decreased movements in the right half of the body with muscle power 2/5 in both right upper and lower extremity along with right sided UMN type of facial palsy, with a positive Babinski sign on the same side. There were no signs of raised intracranial pressure or meningeal irritation. Other neurological examinations were normal. Child did not have any signs suggestive of nonaccidental injury and did not have any external signs of trauma to the head or elsewhere on the body. Child had no clinical history suggestive of varicella, measles, or ear discharge in the past. There was no history of feeding difficulty which suggests that there was no lower cranial nerve involvement. Perinatal history was uneventful. There were no significant family history suggestive of thromboembolic disorders and no history of recent vaccination.

Having been subject to a preliminary evaluation in our emergency department, the patient was transferred to the gastroenterology clinic for further investigation and treatment, where oral intake was stopped and replaced with parenteral replacement therapy. The patient\u2019s medical background revealed nothing remarkable other than recurrent epigastric pain. He also had a history of receiving proton pump inhibitor drugs on an irregular basis. Upon physical examination, his general clinical status was good, with stable vital parameters. A palpable mass of 5 \u00d7 5 cm, along with tenderness in the epigastric region on palpation, was detected during abdominal examination. The laboratory test results, including liver and renal function tests, complete blood count, coagulation profiles and tumor markers were within normal limits. Upper GIS endoscopy revealed a submucosally located mass lesion of dense vascularity at the antrum-corpus junction on the greater gastric curvature. The appearance of the mass evoked the impression of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor of mesenchymal origin (). Accordingly, a biopsy was taken from this area. No definite focus of active bleeding was evident. In abdominal computed tomographic evaluation, an isodense and smooth contoured mass lesion of 52 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 32 mm that contained focal calcifications and was located on the greater gastric curvature in the left upper abdominal quadrant was detected (). Since the biopsy report indicated that the material was insufficient for a definitive diagnosis to be made, a deeper biopsy sampling was recommended. As such, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) was performed in an attempt to identify whether or not the mass was malignant. PET showed a smooth contoured mass of 5 \u00d7 5 cm, projecting from the gastric corpus into the lumen and containing scattered calcifications, which displayed no evidence of malignant transformation.

This ultrasound showed right adrenal lesion of 9 cm of diameter. An Abdominal MRI was then done and revealed a soft tissue necrotic encapsulated mass of 10 \u00d7 9 cm of right adrenal gland origin. She was completely asymptomatic and the physical exam was strictly normal. Endocrinological evaluation was done with normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and no hyper secretion of catecholamines. The patient was considered to have a non-secreting right adrenal mass for which an adrenal scan was done and showed a well encapsulated 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 7 cm heterogeneous right adrenal mass with areas of necrosis and calcifications without local invasion (). The decision of right laparoscopic trans peritoneal adrenalectomy was taken with the patient. The surgery was done under general anesthesia after central and arterial lines insertion, the patient was on left decubitus position. 5 trocars were inserted as follows: The first 12-mm port was inserted at the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle just above the level of the umbilicus to accommodate the camera. Two subcostal 11 mm ports were also placed; one in the midclavicular line and the other in the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle. The forth 5-mm subcostal trocar was inserted in the anterior axillary line to retract the liver and the fifth 5 mm one was inserted in the epigastrium and used specially for aspiration and irrigation. After liver retraction, the peritoneum along the lateral aspect of the IVC was incised to expose the IVC just below its intrahepatic course. The duodenum which was diverted by the mass was mobilized.
