The patient presented with a 7-month history of progressively enlarging mass on her left ring finger. The patient mentioned that the mass appeared suddenly with no history of trauma and that she was concerned about the potential malignant nature of the mass. The patient also mentioned that she underwent incision and drainage of that mass 2 months after its appearance with no improvement and provided no detailed surgical or pathological reports, which was the reason for her delayed presentation. Upon her assessment, the mass was located over the ulnar side of the proximal phalanx of left ring finger with extensive involvement of the 4th web space. The overlying skin coverage was ulcerative with no active signs of infection. Range of motion of the involved digit was limited, however neurovascular examination was normal. ().\nRadiological evaluation of the involved hand showed a soft tissue swelling with no evidence of bone involvement (). Further magnetic resonant (MRI) evaluation showed a mass on the volar aspect of the ring finger encasing about 50% of the flexor tendons of that digit with low signal intensity on T1 and high signal intensity on T2 evaluation with strong enhancement in post contrast evaluation. Assessment of neurovascular structures showed partial abutment of the radial sided bundle together with complete encirclement of the ulnar sided neurovascular bundle. The surrounding bone was free of any masses and associated mass effect.\nThe patient was taken to the OR for exploration and mass excision by the senior author. Possible risks associated with such intervention were explained. Intra-operatively, bruner type incision was designed together with island of skin involved in the mass.

An orthopedic surgeon was consulted, who ruled out a hip problem. Then the family was told it was something constitutional and no other recommendation was made.

    "original_text": "A 32-year-old multiparous woman was admitted at 37 2/7 weeks for induction of labor for abnormal antenatal testing. She had a history of a prior cesarean delivery for arrest of active labor at 7 cm and after extensive counseling chose to undergo a TOLAC. The initial cervical exam was 2 cm dilation and 50% effacement. Her labor was induced with oxytocin and amniotomy was performed at 5 cm dilation with clear fluid noted. She progressed from 2 cm to 5 cm over the course of 10 hours; interval time to progression to 6 cm was 3.5 hours. The patient then began to have a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding with associated minimal fetal heart rate variability and variable decelerations that did not improve with intrauterine resuscitation. She was taken to the operating room for repeat cesarean delivery due to concern for a uterine rupture and/or a placental abruption. Upon entry into the abdomen, there was no uterine rupture or dehiscence, nor was there evidence of a significant placental abruption. She delivered a male infant with a weight of 2659 g and Apgar scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively; arterial cord pH was 7.26. No extension of the hysterotomy was noted following delivery of the infant.

She complained of left-sided flank pain that was aggravated with deep inspiration for twelve months and began to experience dyspnea for one month. She had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis with a six-month course of anti-tuberculosis medication 20 years earlier. She did not have a history of smoking or environmental or occupational exposures to toxins. The laboratory tests including tumor markers on admission were normal. The result of acid fast staining of her sputum was also normal. Findings of physical examinations were unremarkable. The initial chest radiograph taken at the other hospital 8 months previously demonstrated an ambiguous consolidation in the left lower lung without a definite mass lesion (). The patient did not receive treatment for the lesion but has been followed-up for eight months. A chest radiograph taken eight months after the initial visit revealed an irregularly shaped large mass occupying the left lower lung field and compressing the left lower lobe and diaphragm (). Compared with the initial chest radiograph, the mass had grown markedly. Consequently, chest CT was carried out immediately. Chest CT showed two irregularly shaped soft tissue masses adjacent to the parietal pleura in the left hemithorax, which contained dense calcifications without the invasion of the ribs ().\nFor correct diagnosis and proper treatment, surgical excision of the masses was performed through left thoracotomy via the 7th intercostal space. The intraoperative findings showed two hard and irregularly shaped masses with a hard osteoid surface. These masses were clearly separated.

At the age of three years and nine months, she was diagnosed with pure red cell hypoplasia, manifested as severe anaemia (haemoglobin: 3.00 g/dL; red blood cells: 1,000,000/mm3) with an extreme lack of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, but high growth of them in culture, probably caused by anti-EPO antibodies. The detection of anti-EPO antibodies, however, is not routinely performed in a clinical setting. The autoimmune hypothesis was postulated on empirical bases, since haemoglobin levels did not increase after recombinant human EPO administration, but normalized after corticosteroid therapy, and the addition of autologous serum to the erythroid precursor culture inhibited EPO growth. When she was 4 years and 4 months old, the patient presented with a second episode of left facial palsy, combined with the acute onset of a strength deficit on the left side of the body.

He denied any vomiting, changes to his bowel habits, weight loss, fever or history of similar pain episodes. He was otherwise healthy and had no previous abdominal surgeries. On physical examination, there was some mild lower abdominal tenderness, but no mass was clinically palpable. A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast was done and revealed a heterogeneous appearing mass like lesion in the midline of the pelvis measuring 11.4 \u00d7 6.8 \u00d7 6.6 cm. It showed peripheral enhancement with central hypodensity. The mass appears to be intimately associated with multiple segments of small bowel in the lower abdomen with no associated bowel obstruction (Fig. ). The initial radiologist impression was suggestive of a possible gastrointestinal stromal tumor. A CT scan of the chest was performed as well and there was no evidence of metastatic disease in the abdominal or thoracic cavities.\nThe case was discussed in multidisciplinary tumor boards and the consensus was to proceed with surgical resection of the primary tumor. The patient was therefore taken to the operating room for a diagnostic laparoscopy, laparotomy and resection of the mass which was not found to involve the small bowel. During laparoscopic exploration, we did not identify any liver metastases or peritoneal deposits. The mass was occupying the middle portion of the lower abdominal cavity. We elected to convert to an open procedure due to concerns of disrupting the integrity of the tumor during laparoscopic dissection given its large size and weight. It was connected to the greater omentum with a vascular pedicle and slightly adherent to epiploic appendages of the sigmoid colon. An intraoperative flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed and was unremarkable. The mass was not invading any intra-abdominal structures and there was no evidence of metastatic disease. It was resected en bloc with adequate margin on the omental pedicle. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged home on postoperative day three.",

About two years ago, she noticed a lump in the left breast that appeared to increase in size over time. Around the same time, she had a single episode of spontaneous bloody discharge from the left nipple. Due to various personal reasons, she delayed her own care and had not sought breast evaluations until the size of the mass had reached a point that prompted her to have it assessed.

She had no family history of breast or ovarian cancer and no risk factors for breast cancer other than her age.\nClinical examination revealed a large left breast mass measuring \u223c20 cm involving the inferior and medial left breast. The overlying skin was bluish-purple in color, with a lateral deviation and distortion of the nipple (Fig.). Upon palpation, the mass measured \u223c20 \u00d7 15 cm with thickening of the nipple. The patient also had a small mass on the left upper anterior chest that had remained unchanged for several years.\nBreast imaging work up included mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Electrocardiogram revealed evidence of severe left ventricular hypertrophy. This was confirmed with echocardiography which also demonstrated a tricuspid aortic valve with significant aortic regurgitation in the presence of an aortic root aneurysm of approximately 9 cm. Left ventricular function was preserved. Computerised tomography angiography (CTA) was performed to evaluate the aortic pathology in further detail (Fig. ). The scan noted an aortic root aneurysm (8.8 cm), in addition to the presence of severe aortic coarctation, with subtotal occlusion and a lumen less than 6 mm in size. The coarctation was just distal to the left subclavian artery, at the aortic isthmus. There was clear evidence of collateral circulation to the descending thoracic aorta via the subclavian and intercostal arteries. Coronary angiography confirmed a right dominant coronary system with no significant coronary disease.\nA multidisciplinary team meeting took place and a consensus was agreed to proceed with a two staged hybrid approach, with the first phase involving an endovascular approach to stent the coarctation, followed by a second stage to perform the surgical repair of the aortic root aneurysm. The first stage to stent the coarctation was unsuccessful via the femoral approach, as the guidewire could not cross the coarctation.

She underwent closed reduction for dislocation elsewhere, and above elbow slab application (,). She was referred to our hospital three days later with complaints of severe pain, swelling around the right elbow and numbness of fingers. As per the treatment notes there was no obvious neuro vascular injury and radialartery pulse was felt immediately after reduction of elbow dislocation. On examination, We noted that the elbow was swollen, there were superficial blebs, forearm was tense, and there was mild stretch pain. Vascular examination showed good capillary refill with palpable radial artery pulse and decreased sensation over fingers. We evaluated the patient using X-ray of the right elbow -which showed well reduced dislocation and no evidence of fracture. To rule out any vascular injury, arterial doppler scan was performed which showed -large hematoma causing extrinsic compression over distal end of brachial artery with minimal monophasic flow in distal arteries. We took the patient for brachial artery exploration to clear-the hematoma under general anesthesia. A two cm vertical incision was made over medial aspect of lower arm and hematoma was removed. We were surprised to note a pulsating tubular structure with occluded lumen, which led to our suspicion of a complete brachial artery rupture. Immediately, the patient was referred to a vascular surgeon for CT-angiography and for further management. CT angiography showed complete right brachial artery transection five cm above the elbow with thrombus in both ends and significant blood flow in distal arteries through collateral circulation (). The patient was further treated with excision of injured segment of vessel and right transbrachial proximal and distal thrombectomy. The artery was reconstructed by interposition repair of right great saphenous vein graft and forearm fasciotomy () in anticipation of compartment syndrome and reperfusion injury.

Besides the injured thigh, there was no complaint of pain at any other site. There was no associated injury and any other comorbid conditions. The patient was obese with a body mass index of 37 and no other comorbidities. He had no history of veno-occlusive disease, and all the preoperative laboratory evaluations were normal. Antegrade interlocking nailing was planned as a treatment strategy. He was taken into the operating theatre within 48 h of the trauma after adequate resuscitation. The surgery was carried out under general anaesthesia, with epidural analgesia. The patient was positioned on a fracture table. The well leg was placed in hemilithotomy position in 70\u00b0 flexion and 40\u00b0 abduction, and it was placed on a leg holder. The patient was maintained in this position throughout the procedure. Following closed reduction of the fracture, nailing was attempted. But the failure to obtain acceptable reduction initially increased the surgical time; the intraoperative plan was changed and fixation with a dynamic condylar screw (DCS) was performed (fig. ). The total surgical time was 2 h and 30 min. There was 650 ml of blood loss and 1 unit of whole blood was transfused intraoperatively. The patient's arterial blood pressure was maintained by the anaesthetists at 94/60 mm Hg or above throughout the procedure as a preventive measure to reduce bleeding at the operative site. The intraoperative traction was released after 2 h for 5 min. When the procedure was nearing completion, a dose of epidural analgesia was given to relieve the patient of any possible postoperative pain. The patient was shifted to the ward after the completion of surgery.\nIn the postoperative rounds, the distal pulses of the operated extremity were palpable and any neural deficit could not be assessed as the patient was under the effect of epidural analgesia.

Electrocardiogram revealed evidence of severe left ventricular hypertrophy. This was confirmed with echocardiography which also demonstrated a tricuspid aortic valve with significant aortic regurgitation in the presence of an aortic root aneurysm of approximately 9 cm. Left ventricular function was preserved. Computerised tomography angiography (CTA) was performed to evaluate the aortic pathology in further detail (Fig. ). The scan noted an aortic root aneurysm (8.8 cm), in addition to the presence of severe aortic coarctation, with subtotal occlusion and a lumen less than 6 mm in size. The coarctation was just distal to the left subclavian artery, at the aortic isthmus. There was clear evidence of collateral circulation to the descending thoracic aorta via the subclavian and intercostal arteries. Coronary angiography confirmed a right dominant coronary system with no significant coronary disease.\nA multidisciplinary team meeting took place and a consensus was agreed to proceed with a two staged hybrid approach, with the first phase involving an endovascular approach to stent the coarctation, followed by a second stage to perform the surgical repair of the aortic root aneurysm. The first stage to stent the coarctation was unsuccessful via the femoral approach, as the guidewire could not cross the coarctation.

Nothing was found relevant about his medical condition. The patient shows a high risk for caries and also eccentric bruxism. He has partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant and multiple decay and fractured teeth. The initial approach was conservative aiming to keep the upper front by means of composite fillings (Figures and ). Then, the posterior superior quadrants needed to be restored with implants.\nThree years after, in 2017, the patient came back to the office referring pain of endodontic origin in the upper left canine. New and secondary subgingival caries were found in the six front teeth. The conservative prognosis was considered poor due to the subgingival depth and extent of decay presented by the lesions from canine to canine. After having discussed the treatment options, especially the surgical lengthening of the front teeth or the orthodontic extrusion, the patient decides to replace the residual teeth with a new implant-supported bridge similar to the recently performed prostheses of the posterior areas that were judged by him as a highly satisfactory treatment. The patient preferred not to involve these restorations in the present anterior treatment and limited it to place only two implants in the lateral incisors' positions ().\nThe treatment was carried out in a staged approach. Briefly, first, we extracted the lateral incisors, using the SST, and placed two immediate implants. The four residual teeth were then prepared to be used as abutments of a temporary bridge for the purpose of maintaining the aesthetics and function of the patient during the early osseointegration period.

    "original_text": "A 25-year-old male patient was admitted to our department, presenting progressive pain and numbness with a rapidly growing mass located in the upper part of the right arm for 2 months in 2005. At the time of the hospital admission, he had completely lost his occupational capacity of the arm (100% unable to work). Physical examination revealed a palpable mass on the upper part of his right arm with a size 13 \u00d7 12 cm. Radiographic examination demonstrated a large mass over 10 cm in diameter on the proximal humerus, with massive cortical erosion, extension of the tumor into soft tissues and indistinctness of the surface of the tumor (). A diagnosis of chondrosarcoma was made in view of the radiologic findings in combination with the histology by the needle biopsy. The specimen was histologically classified as grade II chondrosarcoma. The patient had a 20-year history of a painless and palpable bony mass on this location and had gradually increased in size. He first sought treatment at age 16 because he had a distal radius fracture. At that period of time, the plain radiographs demonstrated multiple cartilaginous dysplasia or multiple enchondromatosis (Ollier\u2019s disease) in the humerus with most evidently involving the upper part of the humerus (), and the lower part of the radius () of the right upper limb. Soft tissue of hemangiomas was not detected. The patient had no family history of skeletal disorders and no other medical history of note.\nA limb-salvage strategy with treatment of the large segmental defects following resection of the tumor and a prosthetic replacement of the proximal humerus was designed for the patient. The informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the operation. The tumor resection prosthesis was applied in the same session following the tumor resection ().

A first peripheral facial nerve palsy occurred when she was three years and one month old, with complete regression after corticosteroid treatment. At the age of three years and nine months, she was diagnosed with pure red cell hypoplasia, manifested as severe anaemia (haemoglobin: 3.00 g/dL; red blood cells: 1,000,000/mm3) with an extreme lack of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, but high growth of them in culture, probably caused by anti-EPO antibodies. The detection of anti-EPO antibodies, however, is not routinely performed in a clinical setting. The autoimmune hypothesis was postulated on empirical bases, since haemoglobin levels did not increase after recombinant human EPO administration, but normalized after corticosteroid therapy, and the addition of autologous serum to the erythroid precursor culture inhibited EPO growth. When she was 4 years and 4 months old, the patient presented with a second episode of left facial palsy, combined with the acute onset of a strength deficit on the left side of the body.

There was no history of any head, chest, and abdominal injury and the patient was not a known case of hypertension and diabetes. The patient had a history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery 6 years back and is on tablet Ecosprin since then. On local examination, tenderness was present over the lateral tibial condyle, skin condition was good, and range of motion was restricted. X-ray of the left knee was taken, which was suggestive of the left tibia lateral condyle split fracture (Schatzker type 1) with severe osteoarthritis of the left knee ( and ). The patient was managed initially with above knee slab and limb elevation. As the patient was having osteoarthritis with fracture, we planned for primary TKR with stemmed tibial component. Surgery was postponed for 15 days because of patient medical fitness issues.\nAfter getting the fitness for surgery (40 days after the trauma), the patient was operated in supine position through medial parapatellar approach using tourniquet. After the femur preparation, tibial preparation was started with removal of fibrous tissue at the fracture site, anatomical reduction of fracture, and maintaining the reduction with reduction forceps till the completion of the tibial preparation to prevent the displacement of fracture fragment. Cemented TKR was done using Zimmer implant of femoral component size E, tibial component of size 4 with stem extension of 12 mm diameter \u00d7 155 mm length and articular surface height of 10 mm ( and ).

A first peripheral facial nerve palsy occurred when she was three years and one month old, with complete regression after corticosteroid treatment. At the age of three years and nine months, she was diagnosed with pure red cell hypoplasia, manifested as severe anaemia (haemoglobin: 3.00 g/dL; red blood cells: 1,000,000/mm3) with an extreme lack of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, but high growth of them in culture, probably caused by anti-EPO antibodies.

The autoimmune hypothesis was postulated on empirical bases, since haemoglobin levels did not increase after recombinant human EPO administration, but normalized after corticosteroid therapy, and the addition of autologous serum to the erythroid precursor culture inhibited EPO growth. When she was 4 years and 4 months old, the patient presented with a second episode of left facial palsy, combined with the acute onset of a strength deficit on the left side of the body.

The patient had been under nephrological follow up since adolescence, when she was incidentally discovered to have mild renal impairment (Fig. ). An intravenous pyelogram performed at the time showed that both kidneys were small with decreased cortical thickness and the most likely diagnosis was felt to be chronic pyelonephritis. Ultrasound scanning confirmed small kidneys with no overt renal cysts observed; urinalysis was consistently bland. She had also been investigated for symptoms of marked tiredness as a teenager and was found to be anaemic with a haemoglobin value of approximately 90 g/L. This was felt to be out of keeping with her level of kidney function at the time and remained unexplained despite extensive investigation. She developed gout in her twenties and her serum uric acid level was measured at 550 \u03bcmol/L; treatment with allopurinol was initiated. She remained under renal follow up and her kidney function continued to slowly deteriorate. Her haemoglobin level remained stable at around 100 g/L after initial treatment with iron and later an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA). When she was aged 37 years, one of the nephrology team noted that her mother had recently commenced haemodialysis. As both mother and daughter had presented with slowly progressive CKD, bland urinary sediment and small kidneys on renal imaging, the most likely diagnosis was now felt to be ADTKD.\nA detailed family history revealed that the patient\u2019s maternal grandmother had been told she had small kidneys but no further clinical details were available (Fig. ). The patient\u2019s mother was identified as having mild CKD and hypertension at the age of 65 years during a routine health screen; renal ultrasound scanning at the time showed two small kidneys.

A first peripheral facial nerve palsy occurred when she was three years and one month old, with complete regression after corticosteroid treatment. At the age of three years and nine months, she was diagnosed with pure red cell hypoplasia, manifested as severe anaemia (haemoglobin: 3.00 g/dL; red blood cells: 1,000,000/mm3) with an extreme lack of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, but high growth of them in culture, probably caused by anti-EPO antibodies. The detection of anti-EPO antibodies, however, is not routinely performed in a clinical setting. The autoimmune hypothesis was postulated on empirical bases, since haemoglobin levels did not increase after recombinant human EPO administration, but normalized after corticosteroid therapy, and the addition of autologous serum to the erythroid precursor culture inhibited EPO growth. When she was 4 years and 4 months old, the patient presented with a second episode of left facial palsy, combined with the acute onset of a strength deficit on the left side of the body. Mingazzini I and II were positive for the left limbs. The imaging assessment showed a haemorrhagic stroke corresponding to the anterior portion of the right putamen and of the external capsule with perilesional oedema, involving the anterior limb of the internal capsule. Blood pressure measurements performed during the hospitalisation revealed high diastolic blood pressure values. These findings suggest a central rather than peripheral involvement of the facial nerve. Three weeks after their beginning, the symptoms had completely regressed. At the age of five years and six months, a third episode of left peripheral facial palsy occurred. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was repeated, showing gliotic evolution of the previous haemorrhagic insult without new lesions. The patient was treated with corticosteroids, with a good regression of symptoms. On the last episode, the patient had initially visited a first level emergency room",

Ultrasound examination of the abdomen revealed few cysts in the liver without any associated lymphadenopathy in the coeliac group of lymph nodes.

The CT showed one cyst in the heart, four cysts in the liver, but no cysts in the lungs or the brain (Figures -).\nThe cystic nature of the lesions and their locations in multiple organs made us think of the HC as the pathology. The serology test for HC using the ELISA test came positive, which helped to confirm the diagnosis.

The patient underwent conventional median sternotomy and aortocaval cannulation with aortic cross-clamp and cardioplegic heart arrest.

He had a right lung empyema a month ago and was still undergoing drainage and appropriate antibiotic treatment. Because of the history of empyema, which increases the risk of infection in AVG, we decided to implant an AVF in the upper extremity again. Ultrasound mapping was performed for the patient in the operating room without tourniquet application to examine the basilic and brachial veins in both limbs. The basilic vein was thrombosed previously, but in the left upper limb, the brachial veins were open and the medial vein was 3 mm and joined by the axillary vein in the higher part of the upper arm. The paired brachial vein diameter was also 3 mm. Therefore, we planned the surgery to transpose the left medial brachial vein. BrVT was performed under local anesthesia with sedation with three skip incisions in the medial arm. Initially, a 4-cm horizontal skin incision was made distally in the arm to explore the brachial artery and vein. Then, the lateral branches were found and separated along the brachial vein. The connections between the two brachial veins were divided by simple sutures. The main difficulty with the restricted incision was to obtain proper exposure and this was resolved by cutting the brachial vein in the cubital part and changing its direction in different views. In the second stage, another 4-cm incision was made horizontally in the middle of the arm. The lateral branches of the brachial vein were carefully explored and separated from the lateral incisions at intervals between skin incisions.

Laboratory tests, including white blood cells, liver enzymes, and amylase, were normal. The abdominal X-ray in upright (standing) position did not reveal the presence of free intraperitoneal air. Abdominal ultrasound did not reveal any solid abdominal organ injury nor the presence of free intraperitoneal fluid. The pain was attributed to hematoma of the rectus abdominis muscle pricey below the abrasion which was revealed by ultrasound.\nThe pain of the young man was gradually worsening and was mostly described diffusely throughout the whole abdomen. The abdomen remained soft and tender without signs of peritoneal irritation. We proceeded to the administration of per os contrast material and CT abdomen. The CT scan revealed the presence of sufficient amount of free intraperitoneal contrast but did not allow the clarification of the exact point of escape. The free contrast material was detected at the left side of the abdomen, at the area of the descending colon but mainly in the pelvis ().

She was a non smoker and did not drink alcohol. She had developed severe continuous pain in the right upper limb with no specific aggravating or relieving factors and associated with severe weakness. She had had three episodes of vomiting and diarrhoea and had been treated by her general practitioner with paracetamol for flu-like symptoms for three days. On the morning of the day of admission she had noticed that her lips and tongue were swollen and she felt short of breath. She was given intramuscular adrenaline by the ambulance staff for a threatened airway and was transferred to the acute medical unit for further evaluation and management.\nOn admission she had pulse rate of 110/min, respiratory rate of 22/min and was febrile with a temperature of 38.9 deg c. She was agitated, restless and incontinent. Three hours later she started to develop swelling of the face. The facial skin was intact and there was no erythema, rash or blisters. Examination of the oral cavity revealed an oedematous tongue, pharynx and buccal mucosa with no detectable septic focus. There was no neck stiffness, no localising neurological signs and her GCS was 14.

Biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass confirmed RCC. MRI of the brain and bone scan was negative. He was seen for the first time at our institution in April of 2006. He was determined to be a candidate for high-dose IL-2 (600,000 IU/kg). After 8 weeks, he did show some response, but was only able to tolerate half of cycle 2 and he declined further IL-2. He was then started on sorafenib and had a minor response at all disease sites until CT scan in January 2007 after 24 weeks showed progression. He was then switched to sunitinib 50 mg daily for 4 weeks of a 6 weeks cycles, and after 12 weeks on therapy had a significant response which he enjoyed until week 54 when CT scanning showed marked disease progression. Sunitinib was discontinued and in January of 2008 he was started on temsirolimus 25 mg IV weekly. He required a 20% dose reduction for thrombocytopenia and oral ulcers. He remained on temsirolimus until April of 2008 when he developed symptomatic mTOR interstitial pneumonitis, so temsirolimus was discontinued. His disease continued to progress off therapy and in October of 2008, bevacizumab 10 mg/m2 given every 2 weeks was started as fifth line therapy.

The patient first noticed some small blisters on her left lower extremity which subsequently opened with some clear serous drainage. She also experienced progressively worsening swelling first of the left lower extremity and then her right lower extremity which prompted her to come into the hospital. Except for a cough, the patient had no other symptoms.\nPreliminary evaluation at the emergency department indicated the patient had cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions with a BNP of 1260. She also had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient was not complaining of any chest pain, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Her chest x-ray showed evidence of cardiac enlargement with interstitial densities and bilateral air-space processes possibly associated with asymmetric pulmonary edema. Large bilateral pleural effusions were noted, with the left greater than the right side. Incidentally, some evidence indicating a compression fracture of indeterminate age involving the upper lumbar/lower dorsal spine was observed.\nThe patient had no known medical history. In fact, she had not been seen by a physician for the last 15 years. Besides taking aspirin occasionally, she was not on any medications. She did not use alcohol, tobacco or illicit drugs. Physical examination did not reveal any specific concerns other than bilateral lower extremity edema.\nCT angiogram of the chest showed large bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe enhancing volume loss and worse on the left. Cardiomegaly was noted and there was no evidence for a pulmonary embolus. In addition, there was no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the venous Doppler studies of her lower extremities bilaterally.\nEchocardiogram indicated the left ventricle with some mild hypertrophy.

    "original_text": "A 51 year-old woman with a past medical history of well controlled asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis was referred to our university clinic complaining of chronic urticaria for the previous three years. She experienced almost daily episodes of hives that would last less than a day and were intensely pruritic. Prior to presentation in our clinic, she was treated by several physicians with various combinations of high dose first and second generation antihistamines without success. Montelukast offered no benefit when added to treatment with antihistamines. However, relief was obtainable with oral prednisone (20 mg/day) or cyclosporine (200 mg daily in divided doses). A biopsy was obtained which confirmed the diagnosis of true urticaria and ruled out urticarial vasculitis. During the course of her work up, a number of laboratory tests were ordered and were unrevealing as to the potential etiology of her hives (Table ). She noted no association of symptoms with food or medications. Despite frequent monitoring, she was fearful of the potential toxic effects from cyclosporine after she experienced a transient decrease in renal function of unknown significance. Additionally, she was intolerant of prednisone when used at times in place of cyclosporine due weight gain and psychosis. In an effort to find a more tolerable and effective alternative, treatment was initiated with omalizumab 300 mg every two weeks. This dose was chosen based upon the severity of her symptoms and previous successful outcomes []. After the first treatment with omalizumab, the patient noted significant improvement. Over the course of the subsequent 2 weeks, she was able to wean cyclosporine down to 25 mg daily without experiencing an urticarial flare. This was the lowest tolerable dose required to prevent flares until the eighth treatment visit at which time she was able to completely withdraw from cyclosporine use. At the start of omalizumab treatment, she would experience only a generalized sensation of pruritus without visible lesions. This symptom was controlled initially with the addition of diphenhydramine 25 mg every 8 hours, and later with this",
