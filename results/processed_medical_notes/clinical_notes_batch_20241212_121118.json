Our patient had undergone a left mastectomy for lobular carcinoma of the breast three years ago. She had no history of previous abdominal operations.

Her small bowel was dilated from the ligament of Treitz to approximately 10 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. The cause of intussusception was an intraluminal mass 3 \u00d7 4 cm in size (Figure ).

    "original_text": "A 31-years old male patient with no medical comorbidity presented to our facility. Six years prior to this presentation he had an isolated left testicular mass detected on physical examination and CT which proved to be a malignant germ cell tumour. He underwent left orchiectomy but retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) was not carried out as the CT showed no enlarged lymph nodes and histopathology showed the presence of a teratoma and yolk sac tumour. No further details however were mentioned. Accordingly, he received four cycles of chemotherapy (Cisplatin, Bleomycin, and Etoposide). He did well for six years, had no major complaints, and underwent only one follow up ultrasound which showed no suspicious abdominal swellings. He presented to us with on and off upper abdominal pain of six months duration, with no other associated symptoms. On physical examination he was vitally stable with a soft and lax abdomen but mild tenderness in the upper central part of the abdomen and a deep mass. Groin examination revealed signs of a left orchiectomy; the right testicle was in normal position with no swelling or other abnormality detected. Abdominopelvic US showed a large retroperitoneal semisolid mass measuring 8 by 6\u202fcm, abating the body and tail of the pancreas.

His C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased up to 13.36 mg/dL, suggesting the presence of inflammation. An increase of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and uric acid was observed which we think was probably due to dehydration. Although he had high fever and high CRP, all the infection markers that we examined were negative. In addition, several antibodies which we examined were all negative. Taking into account these data, we thought it unlikely that he had some inflammatory disease and/or autoimmune disorder such as collagen disease. Since his blood glucose level was relatively low and the number of eosinophils was relatively high, we examined the possibility of adrenal deficiency. As shown in Table , ACTH and cortisol levels were low and urinary cortisol level was also low, suggesting the presence of ACTH deficiency and adrenal insufficiency.

The patient unfortunately was lost to follow-up until she was seen in our minimally invasive general and bariatric surgery clinic in December of 2013. After our assessment, the patient was referred back to gastroenterology for further evaluation based on prior findings of multiple colonic polyps from 2010.

A comprehensive treatment plan was given to the patient and he was first referred for endodontic, periodontal and restorative treatment of the remaining teeth, and then for placement of dental implants.\nImplant surgery was preformed under local anesthesia (2% lidocaine, 1:100000 epinephrine). On the right side of the mandible, two Replace Select wide platform implants (10mm \u00d7 5mm), were placed in teeth 30 and 31 positions. A 10mm \u00d7 4.3mm Replace Select regular platform implant was placed in tooth number 19 position on the left side of the mandible and for position 18, a Replace wide platform implant (10mm \u00d7 5mm) was inserted.\nThere were no complications during implant placement. The type of bone in the implant areas was type 1.\nA post-operative antibiotic regime of 500mg amoxicillin was prescribed three times daily for 7 days, 400mg gelofen 4 times a day for 3 days and a chlorhexidine mouth rinse 2 times a day for 14 days was also prescribed for the patient. The sutures were removed 10 days later. After initial healing and taking a panoramic radiograph an appointment was set for the patient for impression taking, but he did not refer until 6 years later, in 2011, to continue the treatment.

The Ganslene test was also positive in both sides, but the pain was worse in the right. There was tenderness in the spinous process of L3, and there were no tender points in the facet joints.

She had a history of grade I, node negative, triple receptor negative ACC of the left breast, which was treated with mastectomy in 2003. Eight years later she was diagnosed with a new primary tumour in the contralateral (right) breast. This was a grade III, 3/17 node positive, ER positive/HER2 negative invasive ductal carcinoma, which was treated with mastectomy, axillary node clearance, chemoradiotherapy and letrozole (Femara, Novartis, UK). The patient had been disease free up to the latest presentation in 2016. The clavicular pain initially settled spontaneously but recurred and prompted further investigations. Clinical examination revealed a mass involving the left clavicle measuring 5 cm in transverse diameter. A radiograph of the left clavicle showed evidence of an expansile destructive lesion at its medial end (). This finding, in addition to the soft tissue invasion, was confirmed on CT (), bone scintigraphy () and PET-CT ().

At 3-month follow-up, the skin was characterized by fibrotic and thickened cicatricial areas with purulent drainage and inflamed nodules. Topical metronidazole and oral lymecycline 300 mg twice daily were administered and the patient was referred to wide excisional plastic surgery of the groins, provided she stopped smoking 2 months prior to surgery.\nSurgery was canceled due to continued smoking, and no further surgery was planned. She failed to seek further help for her HS until she was admitted 3 years later after severe worsening of HS, with multiple severe fistulae and a large foul-smelling tumor with drainage in the left groin and necrosis of lymph nodes (Figure ).

The right thumb was clinically normal, but the fourth and fifth digits were malformed. The right foot had fixed clubfoot deformity with only 2 toes (Fig. ). There was no facial dysmorphism or facial clefts. Radiographs of the upper limbs showed complete absence of the metacarpal bone and the phalanges of the third digit in the left hand and absent metacarpals and phalanges of two digits on the right hand (Fig. ). During a subsequent evaluation of the proband at the pediatric clinic, right tibial hemimelia was documented in the patient\u2019s medical records by the attending clinician, but the radiological images of the leg were not available for inclusion in this article.

Moreover, Family history and psychosocial history were also not particular.\nIn abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), 130 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 90 mm huge cystic mass was demonstrated in right upper peritoneal cavity. The cyst had thickened wall and many enhanced nodules. Many nodules and the thickened wall were slightly enhanced in early phase (A) and gradually enhanced in delayed phase (B). Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that intra-cystic fluid was bleeding or mucinous fluid as the intensity was slightly high in T1WI (C), high in T2WI (D), and slightly high in fat suppression T1WI. The thickened wall of the cyst and mural nodules were high intensity in Diffusion-weighted MRI. The findings of connection with pancreatic head suggested a tumor originated from pancreas.

In surgical findings, this tumor did not attach to gastrointestinal tract and originated from pancreatic head (A). The aspirated fluid was bloody and the cyst had re-increased for short time in operation. In these reasons, we diagnosed the tumor as hemorrhagic cyst and selected partial pancreatectomy because this tumor was resected completely (B). The cystic wall was thickened and elastic soft.

The pelvic X-ray showed a displaced comminuted right intertrochanteric fracture (Figure ). His right lower extremity was placed in a Hare traction splint, and he underwent an open reduction and intramedullary gamma nail fixation of the right femur.

Though she had problems in ambulation since early childhood and used to walk with a limp, it was only after she could not walk that she sought for medical help.

The circumference of the swelling was 44 cm as compared to the head circumference of 33 cm. The overlying skin was stretched but well formed []. There was neither discernible congenital anomaly nor neurological deficit, and the hematological and biochemical parameters showed no abnormality.\nA computerized tomography (CT) scan demonstrated the encephalocele with evidence of herniation of a very thin-looking redundant brain tissue into the sac, and a defect of the occipital bone measuring 8 mm \u00d7 10 mm. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a defect at the occipital region and a large encephalocele sac with herniated right cerebellar brain parenchyma through this defect.

There was a good tolerance to liquid intake.\nPhysical examination revealed that the patient was afebrile, slightly pale, hemodynamically stable with no jaundice. We noticed an abdominal scar of midline incision and a mild tenderness in epigastrium. No organomegaly was found.\nPreviously, 1 month ago, the patient was admitted for the same complaints. He underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy which was unsuccessful because of the residual food in his stomach. The patient was put on omeprazole 20 mg twice daily with a re-evaluation after a month.\nThe patient\u2019s past surgical history included perforated benign first portion of duodenal ulcer 15 years ago (treated by primary closure and graham patch) and cholecystoctomy with no other significant medical history.\nAdmission work-up is shown in Table .\nAn upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed again after having the patient fast overnight with these findings (Fig. ): residual food in stomach, pyloric edema and severe stenosis of the bulb that prevented us from progressing further into the small intestine. Biopsies were taken from the bulb and the atrophic mucosa of antrum.

He had an exanthematous fever at 5 months of age, suggestive of measles which resolved without any immediate complications. He was immunized adequately for his age, with measles vaccination been given at tenth month of life.\nHe developed recurrent respiratory tract infections and loose stools requiring repeated admissions from 7 years of age. He had an episode of epistaxis at 9 years of age, during evaluation of which he was found to be seropositive for HIV I antibodies. He did not have any prior blood product transfusions or sexual abuse to suggest horizontally-acquired HIV infection. Possibility of perinatally-acquired infection was considered as perinatally acquired HIV infection presenting with symptoms only in adolescence and early adulthood has been described in literature.[] He was lost to follow up then and returned after 3 months with progressive painless visual loss in his left eye that was diagnosed to be CMV retinitis; his concomitant CD4 count was 379 cells per micro liter and CD3 count was 1208 cells per microliter. Since he had WHO clinical stage IV manifestations of HIV disease, he was initiated on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) after treating CMV retinitis.

Histological examination detected an undifferentiated urothelial carcinoma infiltrating the muscularis mucosae with no nodal involvement. A pre-operatory radiological study excluded the presence of disseminated disease. He was therefore staged as T3N0Mo and no adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended. On February 2019 he become symptomatic with a rise in sacral and pelvic pain associated with weight loss and ankle swelling. A CT/PET scan detected the presence of soft tissue relapse within the left ileo-psoas muscle as well as bone (costs, pelvis, ischiopubic bones) and iliac, lombo-aortic and inguinal node metastasis. This patient was therefore addressed to palliative chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine that was ineffective in controlling the disease and was suspended just after three cycles upon instrumental demonstration of disease progression (from 20 March to 10 May 2019). Subsequently, he received radiation therapy (8Gy) and then metronomic chemotherapy with oral vinorelbine (20 mg three times a week) from 1 September to 10 December 2019, before new disease progression was demonstrated (A). He therefore was addressed to immunotherapy, receiving pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg every three weeks, starting on 17 December 2019. He showed a fast benefit in terms of quality of life and pain decrease and swelling after the first administration.

He had been involved in a traffic accident six months prior to presenting at the hospital. He had undergone some initial treatment in oil massage and splinting from the traditional indigenous bone setters.\nOn examination, there was no tenderness in the right knee. There was an unreduced posterior dislocation of the knee with instability in all planes and a limited range of motion (ROM) from 10\u00b0 to 100\u00b0. There was wasting of the quadriceps (). Clinical examination of the knee was negative for drawer, Lachman and varus tests and positive for the valgus test. Roentgenograms showed a posterior dislocation of the knee.\nFrom the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we found complete rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and the patellar tendon (). Therefore, we planned to perform a two-stage surgery, with the first stage of soft tissue distraction and the second stage of multiple ligament reconstruction.\nIn the first stage, we performed the soft tissue distraction. Under anaesthesia, we evaluated the ROM, which was 10\u00b0 to 100\u00b0. Then we put one planar distraction for external fixation at the femoral and tibial bones.\nIn the ward, the patient underwent soft-tissue distraction 1mm/day, and after 30 days, the dislocation of the knee was resolved. We evaluated serial neurovascular examination while performing the distraction. There was no neurovascular injury right through to the final distraction.\nFor the second stage of the surgery, the multiple ligament reconstruction, we performed a medial parapatellar approach for knee arthrotomy and excised all the fibrotic tissues. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) was missing, and there was a complete rupture of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and patellar tendon ().

She had been experiencing diffuse mild abdominal pain for the past year and reported that in the last 4 months the pain became more intense and was experiencing weight loss. On clinical examination, a dehydrated, malnourished and tachycardic patient with abdominal tenderness and a mass in the abdomen was discovered. She had leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and a heterogeneous mass with peripheral vascularity attached to the small bowel was revealed by echography. A contrast-enhanced CT confirmed a 10 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 5 cm3 mass in the transverse colon near the hepatic flexure that invaded the small bowel mesentery (Fig. A). The mass had a cavity filled with fluid and gas. Free abdominal fluid and some dilated loops of bowel were also observed (Fig. B). With these findings and after adequate resuscitation, surgery was decided. At laparotomy, 300 ml of purulent liquid in the abdominal cavity and a 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 5 cm3 blueish colonic mass, near the hepatic flexure that invaded the jejunum 50 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz, was discovered.

The left foot was warm and well perfused with palpable pedal pulses.\nDoppler ultrasound study of the right lower limb showed an occlusion at the proximal part of the right popliteal artery (PA). With magnetic resonance angiography the presence of a four-centimeter thrombus occluding this section of the PA was confirmed.\nFurthermore, Doppler ultrasound study of the asymptomatic, contralateral (left) popliteal region revealed an occlusion of the PA with sufficient collateralization and unimpaired three-vessel runoff to the foot.\nBy conventional transfemoral angiography, the previously identified occlusion of the right PA and its aberrant course were demonstrated again (). An attempt of continuous intraarterial thrombolysis of the occluded right PA was undertaken by the use of actilyse and continuous heparin applied via a lysis catheter over 24 hours. The required therapeutic dose was controlled with aPTT between 60 and 80 seconds.

After 24 hours of catheter-directed thrombolysis, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in therapeutic dosage and continuous infusion of iloprost (over 4h) were given daily. Further investigations were started to identify the already suspected extravascular cause of occlusion.\nIndeed, in magnetic resonance imaging the anomalous origin of the MHGM lateral to the medial condyle of the femur was detected.

    "original_text": "The 74-year old woman was referred to hospital due to recurrent symptoms of heart failure which twice caused hospitalization during the previous 12 months. The patient had a history of anterior myocardial infarction that was treated with primary PCI 7 years ago. Other comorbidities included diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease grade III and a history of colorectal cancer successfully treated 3 years ago. Recent coronary angiography did not reveal obstructive disease that required revascularization. The transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed left ventricular enlargement (left ventricular end diastolic diameter = 61 mm), depressed systolic function (EF = 25%), left atrial enlargement, severe functional mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular systolic pressure of 70 mm Hg. The therapy for a heart failure in accordance with the guidelines was prescribed to the patient and consisted of full doses of \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE) and eplerenone. A cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted in the patient for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. There was no indication for resynchronization therapy. Due to the fact that heart failure symptoms were persistent, the decision was made to treat mitral regurgitation interventionally.

    "original_text": "A five-year-old male began experiencing a popping sensation followed immediately by the sensation of heat and pressure starting medially at the base of the skull which radiated two centimeters bilaterally. He was a product of a nonconsanguineous union, whose birth history did not involve instrumentation and whose past medical, surgical, and developmental histories were all noncontributory. This sensation was experienced simultaneously with bilateral numbness of the posterior tongue and difficulty in speaking, both of which lasted fifteen seconds with gradual attenuation. The above would occur upon abrupt lateral rotation (either direction) of the head approximately five to ten times a year unrelated to trauma, diminishing in frequency as the patient aged.\nBetween the ages of eleven and fifteen, as a competitive fencer, the patient would experience the same symptomology when performing actions involving extreme, abrupt lateral rotation of the head, translating to a frequency of approximately once to twice weekly.\nAt the age of nineteen, during military training and combat, the same symptomology was experienced approximately fifteen times when abrupt lateral rotation of the head prompted by various forms of minor external head trauma was experienced. After discharge from the military, frequency of these episodes was sustained with simple lateral rotation of the head outside the context of trauma for six months with spontaneous abatement.\nAt the age of twenty-one, the first time the patient came to medical attention for the above complaint, the patient's physical and neurologic examinations were completely normal, including cranial nerve exam. Of note, the patient was not hyperelastic, nor was there a family history of the same. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine (Figures \u2013) was performed revealing slight dysplastic enlargement of the anterior arch of C1 vertebrate, mild degenerative changes of the atlantoaxial junction, and spinal canal caliber on the lower end of normal limits.

    "cleaned_text": "a five-year-old male began experiencing a popping sensation followed immediately by the sensation of heat and pressure starting medially at the base of the skull which radiated two centimeters bilaterally. he was a product of a nonconsanguineous union, whose birth history did not involve instrumentation and whose past medical, surgical, and developmental histories were all noncontributory. this sensation was experienced simultaneously with bilateral numbness of the posterior tongue and difficulty in speaking, both of which lasted fifteen seconds with gradual attenuation. the above would occur upon abrupt lateral rotation (either direction) of the head approximately five to ten times a year unrelated to trauma, diminishing in frequency as the patient aged.\nbetween the ages of eleven and fifteen, as a competitive fencer, the patient would experience the same symptomology when performing actions involving extreme, abrupt lateral rotation of the head, translating to a frequency of approximately once to twice weekly.\nat the age of nineteen, during military training and combat, the same symptomology was experienced approximately fifteen times when abrupt lateral rotation of the head prompted by various forms of minor external head trauma was experienced. after discharge from the military, frequency of these episodes was sustained with simple lateral rotation of the head outside the context of trauma for six months with spontaneous abatement.\nat the age of twenty-one, the first time the patient came to medical attention for the above complaint, the patient's physical and neurologic examinations were completely normal, including cranial nerve exam. of note, the patient was not hyperelastic, nor was there a family history of the same. magnetic resonance imaging (mri) of the cervical spine (figures \u2013) was performed revealing slight dysplastic enlargement of the anterior arch of c1 vertebrate, mild degenerative changes of the atlantoaxial junction, and spinal canal caliber on the lower end of normal limits. no evidence for abnormal bone spurring or abnormality of the hypoglossal canal was found.\no",

    "original_text": "An 8-year-old girl, who suffered from chronic cyanosis, was referred to our hospital for further evaluation. The patient was well developed with normal growth. On physical examination, a 2/6 systolic heart murmur on the middle left sternal border and mild cyanosis (O2 saturation=80% by pulse oximetry) were the only findings. Her blood pressure and heart rate were 110/70 mmHg and 100 bpm, respectively. She had no history of stroke, dyspnea, dizziness, and syncope. Electrocardiography was normal, and there was no finding in favor of the enlargement of any chamber. Chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly with normal pulmonary vascular markings. Her hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were 14 g/dL and 41%, respectively. Transthoracic 2D echocardiography, via the segmental approach, demonstrated the normal continuation of the inferior vena cava to the right atrium. However, the orifice of the RSVC to the right atrium could not be visualized. Instead, it seemed that the RSVC was draining into the left atrium. The left atrium and the left ventricle were mildly enlarged (). The function of both ventricles was normal. Other echocardiographic findings were mild mitral regurgitation and trivial tricuspid regurgitation. The peak pressure gradient of the tricuspid regurgitation was 20 mm Hg, and there was mild pulmonary valve regurgitation. In addition, there were no intracardiac defects or shunts. The pulmonary veins were connected to the left atrium normally. The diagnosis was confirmed through contrast study with agitated normal saline. Injection via the left brachial vein showed the drainage of the SVC into the left atrium, no atrial septal defect, and no left SVC ( & ). Cardiac catheterization and angiography confirmed a systemic oxygen saturation rate of 80% and a normal pulmonary artery pressure (mean pulmonary artery pressure=15 mmHg). Because transthoracic echocardiography and catheterization confirmed the diagnosis (), there was no need to utilize any other imaging modalities.\nSurgery was performed through median sternotomy.
