There was normal systemic and pulmonary venous drainage, and no other associated cardiac lesions were noted.\nThe patient was taken up for surgical patch closure after due informed consent. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established using aorto-bicaval cannulation and mild hypothermia (32\u00b0C). Aorta was clamped and antegrade cardioplegia was perfused. After right atriotomy, a solitary OS-ASD was found. There was normal pulmonary venous drainage. However, there was a slightly aneurysmal outpouching on the right side of the left atrium (LA), and right pulmonary veins were opening into this aneurysmal sac. A small additional opening in the aneurysmal sac where right pulmonary veins were opening was noted and this was probed. The distal end seemed to be directed into the right lung. No intervention was done for it as it was thought to be an abnormal opening of a right lobar pulmonary vein into LA. Pericardial patch closure of ASD was done. However, on weaning the patient off, CPB blood SpO2 dropped down to 72%.\nA transthoracic echocardiogram with saline contrast was performed which demonstrated intact ASD patch. SVC and inferior vena cava were seen draining into the right atrium (RA). This ruled out patch dehiscence or routing of caval blood into LA.

Motion of each finger was normal, but the range of motion of the wrist joint was slightly restricted. Skin color change and local heat were not observed around the mass.

No hilar lymphoadenopathy was observed on a chest radiogram.\nPlain radiograms of the right wrist and hand showed degenerative changes and Heberden's nodes in the distal interphalangeal joints, but no apparent calcification was observed in the mass (). On magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, T1-weighted images showed a low-intensity mass surrounding the flexor tendons (A). On T2-weighed images, the mass partially showed high-signal intensity (B). Sagittal T2-weighed images demonstrated an effusion in the sheaths of the flexor tendons and many small low-intensity bodies in the mass (C). The mass was moderately enhanced by administration of intravenous gadolinium (D), but the small bodies were not enhanced.\nAn incisional biopsy was performed in June 2004. The mass existed adjacent to the flexor tendons and was encapsulated by a yellow fibrous wall. Many rice bodies had erupted from a small hole in the wall of the mass (). Histological findings revealed hyperplastic tenosynovitis with fibrinous loose bodies (). During the surgery, we confirmed that the flexor tendons were intact.

There was no history of chest pain, cough, palpitations or syncope. On examination no significant findings could be elicited. Laboratory investigations and complete haematological profile was within normal limits (no features of hypercoagulable disorders). Echocardiography showed dilated right atrium and right ventricle with impaired right ventricular systolic function. The pulmonary valve appeared thickened with possible mass attached to it, with turbulence and gradient in the main pulmonary artery. A contrast enhanced CT was performed which revealed a hypodense filling defect in the main and bilateral pulmonary arteries which did not exhibit any significant post contrast enhancement (Fig. ). Based on the clinical and radiological findings a diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism was made and pulmonary thromboendarterectomy was planned. Under GA, midline sternotomy was performed and main pulmonary artery was opened.

Her BMI was 38 (height 4 ft 11.5 inches, weight 188.2 pounds), and she had a lifelong history of morbid obesity and obesity-related comorbidities, including obstructive sleep apnea requiring a continuous positive airway pressure machine, an elevated hemoglobin A1c (5.8) and a fasting blood glucose increasing her risk of developing diabetes mellitus, and degenerative joint disease which significantly impacted her ability to exercise. The main challenges she identified in losing weight involved eating carbohydrate rich foods, overeating during meals and limited activity due to musculoskeletal pain. The patient had made multiple attempts to lose weight through commercial dieting programs but had been unsuccessful. The patient also completed a six-month medically supervised diet through her primary care provider, which also included working closely with a bariatric registered dietician, following a strict diet of about 1800 calories/day and performing modified exercise, about 120 minutes/week. Despite these intense medical weight loss efforts, she was unable to maintain a healthy weight. The patient was motivated to try bariatric surgery after she witnessed the significant weight loss success her daughters had from this intervention. Her greatest hope from the bariatric surgery was to be healthier and to alleviate her obesity-related comorbidities.\nThe patient\u2019s surgical history included cesarean section and evacuation of an ectopic pregnancy. She was a former smoker, quitting over 25 years ago, and has no other history of substance or alcohol use.

Given the patient's history of multiple prior open hernia surgeries, we initially favoured a laparoscopic approach. Given the history of robotic prostatectomy with a post-operative pelvic haematoma and the likelihood of adhesions, we decided on a robotic TAPP approach, which would allow for easier lysis of adhesions, reduction of the hernia sac and sutured closure of the peritoneal pocket.\nOn insufflation of the abdomen, placement of robotic trocars and docking of the da Vinci Si system, a large right indirect inguinal hernia defect containing small bowel was visualised lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels. The peritoneum was incised and the hernia sac reduced into the peritoneal cavity with subsequent development of a pre-peritoneal pocket. An extra-large Bard 3DMax polypropylene mesh (12.4 cm \u00d7 17.3 cm) was tacked into place to the pubic tubercle and onto the anterior pubic ramus at Cooper's ligament. The peritoneal defect was then closed using 2-0 absorbable V-Loc (barbed) suture in a running fashion. The left-sided hernia was repaired in the same manner.\nThe patient was discharged home on the same day after surgery but returned to the emergency room on the 2nd post-operative day with complaints of significant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and obstipation. He was diffusely tender on abdominal examination and a computed tomography (CT) scan [] was performed demonstrating a high grade closed-loop small bowel obstruction with a transition point in the right lower quadrant.

There was a history of polyhydramnion. Fetal ultrasonography had revealed no abnormalities such as abnormal lung development or absent gastric filling. A course of antenatal steroids was given to induce lung maturation. At 31 weeks gestation delivery was imminent and a boy was born. Despite the fact that there were no signs of fetal distress during labour the newborn baby had a poor start: there were signs of severe respiratory distress and there was no audible cry. Positive pressure ventilation with a mask was initiated, which not resulted in thoracic excursions and lead to further deterioration of the newborn. Apgar score was 1 after 1 minute and tracheal intubation was attempted with an endotracheal tube size 3.0. Despite good visualisation of the epiglottis and vocal cords, the tube could not pass any further than the vocal cords. Subsequent attempts with a tube 2.5 and tube 2.0 failed in a similar way. While breathing spontaneous with CPAP and 100% oxygen there were periods of visible chest excursions and brief improvement of the condition of the patient. Flexible tracheoscopy showed a blind ending larynx. Based on this finding combined with profound hypoxia and bradycardia resuscitation attempts were ceased. Post mortem analysis showed a normal larynx, complete absence of the trachea, a normal developed carina and main bronchi and a small fistula (diameter 1 mm) between the distal oesophagus to the right main bronchus ( and ).

Therefore, a contrasted CT scan of the brain was performed, which demonstrated a heterogeneously enhancing left frontal mass just anterior to the left motor cortex thought to be either a primary central nervous system tumor or a metastatic lesion (Figure ).\nA full metastatic workup was conducted with no primary lesion detected. Given the location of the lesion, further imaging was thought to be necessary for two reasons: 1) to further elucidate the differential diagnosis of the lesion and 2) to help safely guide resection or biopsy of a lesion in close proximity to eloquent brain tissue.

The patient subsequently underwent the removal of their pacemaker and replacement with a Surescan Medtronic DDD Pacemaker RVDR01 (Minneapolis, MN, US).

There was no history of trauma or falls. He was unemployed and lived with his mother. He took no medications or supplements, did not smoke, consume excessive alcohol, or use illegal drugs, and had never been treated with corticosteroids. He had no history of prior fractures. Family history was negative for gonadal, endocrine, or bone diseases. Review of systems was remarkable for markedly delayed puberty for which he had received testosterone injections starting at 16 years of age. Three years later, testosterone replacement therapy was terminated by the treating physician, after he responded well in terms of growth and development of secondary male sexual characteristics. He remarked decreased libido for several years and absence of morning erections.\nOn examination, he was a well-nourished gentleman in obvious distress due to pain at the level of the lower thoracic/lumbar spine. He had an eunuchoidal body habitus with the arm span (181 cm) exceeding the height (174 cm). The pupils were round, equal, and reactive to light. Visual fields were normal to confrontation. The skin turgor was normal, the mucous membranes were moist and the teeth were in good condition with no decay. Examination of the head and neck was remarkable for hyposmia to a number of odorants. The cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal exams were within normal limits. There was no edema in the extremities and neurological assessment was normal.

Her tumor was 1 cm in size and was ER/PR/Her2Neu positive with an oncotype score of 29. Axillary lymph node sampling revealed 0/6 positive lymph nodes. She underwent adjuvant treatment with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and trastuzumab later that year. At that time she had no clinical signs of congestive heart failure (CHF). In January 2007, she developed pain in her sternum and back, and X-rays revealed multiple small lytic lesions. The diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer was made and she underwent radiation therapy to the symptomatic lesions as well as further trastuzumab treatment for metastatic disease. She did not receive hormones at the time of diagnosis of presumed relapse. Soon after start of adjuvant therapy, she developed symptomatic CHF and was found to have a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%. The patient was diagnosed empirically with trastuzumab-induced cardiomyopathy at an outside hospital and was started on diuretics. After a time in rehab, she improved and went back home.\nIn February 2008, she presented to our institution for a second opinion regarding metastatic breast cancer treatment. Because she was dehydrated and lightheaded she was admitted. The patient was diagnosed with renal failure with a creatinine above 3 mg/dL. Her work-up also included serum and urine protein electrophoresis. Both demonstrated a monoclonal gammopathy. She was noted to have 3.5 gm of protein on a 24-hour urine collection and both the urine and serum immunofixation demonstrated an IgG kappa monoclonal protein with a serum M-spike of.88 gm/dL.

Despite her previous reduction, she has a very large breast volume and footprint that will be difficult to replicate on the reconstructed left side. She desires nipple preservation and wants to keep her native right breast. We proceed with a left nipple-sparing mastectomy through her previous vertical limb and immediate prepectoral reconstruction using a full-height variable-projection tissue expander (width = 16 cm, height = 16.5 cm, projection = 6.8 cm, and volume = 850 ml) with anterior coverage using an acellular dermal matrix. Twelve weeks later, we exchange her tissue expander for the largest anatomical implant available, a full-height extra-projection 775 ml implant (width = 15.5 cm, height = 16 cm, and projection = 7.1 cm). She also undergoes a contralateral reduction of 300 g to achieve better symmetry. The final result is shown in Figure . Despite using the largest and tallest implant available and reducing the right breast by an additional 300 g, the entire upper pole of the left breast was depleted with significant size asymmetry between the breasts. We discussed multiple sessions of lipofilling to fill this defect but felt that an autologous flap would be more definitive.

She was not taking any medication and had no known previous cardiovascular disease, as well as no family history of sudden cardiac death. In addition, the patient had no cardiovascular symptoms, including syncope, tachycardia, or chest pain, under at least 4 METs of daily activity. However, routine preoperative resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a second-degree 2:1 AV block with a narrow QRS complex (0.102 s), heart rate (HR) of 46 bpm, normal axis, and with no ischemic change (Fig. ). The patient was sent to the cardiology department in our hospital for detailed cardiac examinations. Holter\u2019s ECG recording for 24 h indicated the constant fixed 2:1 AV block. Echocardiography demonstrated a normal left ventricular systolic function with ejection of 80.2% with no segmental anomaly. At that time, exercise stress testing and cardiac artery computed tomography were not conducted due to the symptom of lumbar spinal canal stenosis and patient\u2019s denial, respectively. After discussion with the consulting cardiologists, we concluded that she was at a low risk of progression to high grade AV block as she was asymptomatic, had a stable heart rhythm, had no established underlying cardiac disease, and a narrow QRS interval. Therefore, we decided that a temporary (or permanent) pacemaker would not be implanted before surgery in this case. In addition to the general preoperative explanation, the attending anesthesiologist informed the patient about the potential risks associated with her AV block, as well as our recommendations including relevant alternatives, obtaining the consent for the management of anesthesia.\nOn the day of surgery, no premedication was administered before surgery.

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a late-onset traumatic diaphragmatic hernia with strangulated ileum (Fig. ). The small intestine, transverse colon, and omentum were displaced into the left thoracic cavity, and some portions of these organs showed a decrease in blood flow. Left lung collapse and a compressed right lung with mediastinal shift were evident. The patient underwent emergency surgery.

Preoperative chest radiography, electrocardiogram, full blood count, and serum biochemistry were within the normal range. After being diagnosed with SCC as a result of incisional biopsy, the patient underwent the resection of SCC on the right buccal mucosa of the mandible, modified radical neck dissection, and primary reconstruction with a fibula-free flap. Tourniquet pressure was 300 mm/Hg, and its application time was 60 min. Total on-table time was approximately 7 h. Upon admission to the SICU after the 7-h operation, hypothermia and hypotension were noted. On the first postoperative day, the patient exhibited oliguria and proteinuria and elevation of CK, AST, ALT, and LDH. Together with the nephrology and neurology staff, we tried to figure out our patient\u2019s symptoms and clinical findings. We thought that her clinical picture was based on an impression in which acute renal failure was diagnosed as secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Thus, she was managed with high-dose loop diuretic therapy. Additionally, we gave her hepatotonic to recover her liver function. The patient was supplemented with 150 to 250 mL/h of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution and 0.9% NaCl. When the volume was full, urine output of above 100 mL/h was maintained by 20 mg intravenous injection with furosemide.\nHer urine output for the first hour is at 20 mL/hour, but after the medication, her urine output began to improve on day 4 with a corresponding reversal in the serum creatinine.

The patient denied history of smoking and lung disease and had no respiratory complaints or other physical symptoms. She received the enhanced chest computerized tomography (CT) scan that showed a tumor located in the left lingular lobe (Figs. and ). Given that trans-bronchial lung biopsy or bronchial alveolar lavage might lead to a false-negative result, the percutaneous lung biopsy was undertaken to diagnosis precisely, and the biopsy pathology showed sarcomatoid cancer. Some other preoperative evaluations were also conducted including physical examinations, cardiac, and pulmonary function test. In addition, CT scans of the brain and abdomen and bone scintigraphy were performed to rule out distant metastasis. According to all the preoperative examinations, the clinical stage was classified as Ib stage and there was no obvious contraindication.

Multiple lesions of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence image (FLAIR) hyperintensities were revealed in the left frontal and parietal lobes and right temporal lobe (Fig. A), attributed to the previous several attacks of ischemia. During that time, antiplatelet agent was intermittently used. The latest episode of symptomatic stroke was in May 2013, with sudden onset of expressive dysphasia and right hemiplegia. DWI revealed massive restricted diffusion in the left frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. Antiplatelet therapy and rehabilitation were given and her symptoms got partial recovery. Brain magnetic resonance angiography disclosed that left anterior cerebral artery and bilateral posterior cerebral artery originated from the communicating arteries (not shown). The patient was then admitted to our hospital for identifying the cause of recurrent stroke.\nShe had varicose veins in lower extremities for 30 years.

Patient was participating in a bicycle race when another rider ahead of him fell causing the patient to swerve to avoid him. Patient states that he fell on his left side and hit a tree with his right leg. Patient was wearing a helmet and did not suffer any chest or head trauma. After the fall, he felt lightheaded and diaphoretic and complained of mid back pain. Patient denied any chest pains or shortness of breath. Patient was subsequently brought to the hospital directly following the accident by ambulance.\nIn the emergency department, patient was noted to be in no acute distress; initial blood pressure was 128/69 mmHg with pulse of 65 beats per minute. He was afebrile, not tachypneic, and well appearing with marked right thigh swelling and tenderness to his medial thigh. Given the dizziness and diaphoresis initially, patient had an ECG performed which showed lateral ST segment elevation () and had a subsequent troponin I that was positive, 0.49ng/mL, with a Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) of 617 U/L.\nThere was initial concern for a possible cardiac contusion, although the patient had no chest wall trauma and thus was admitted for further evaluation. As an inpatient, an echocardiogram was performed demonstrating normal right and left ventricular function and trace pericardial effusion while the patients troponin continued to trend upwards towards a maximum of 21ng/mL. He was loaded with Aspirin and Clopidogrel as well as initiation of a heparin infusion, Lisinopril, and a Beta Blocker.

    "original_text": "A 61-year-old woman presented to a knee surgeon with a 6-month history of pain in the distal anterior left thigh accompanied by ipsilateral knee instability and stiffness. Pain was exacerbated by walking up and down stairs, squatting, kneeling and was worse at night, whereas resting the knee in extension alleviated pain. The patient was otherwise well and without history of previous knee injury. She had power walked 6 miles daily for many years. Salient medical history included shock-wave treatment for left-sided rotator cuff calcification many years previously. On examination, there was tenderness 3\u20134 cm proximal to the left patella associated with effusion and quadriceps wasting.\nPlain radiographs and an MRI scan of the left knee were undertaken.\nRadiographic appearance and MRI signal change confirmed calcification rather than ossification or enthesopathy. An unusual diagnosis of dystrophic calcification of the left quadriceps tendon was made (Figs \u2013).\nElectrolytes and renal function, bone profile, parathyroid hormone, ESR and CRP were unremarkable.\nDespite conservative management, her symptoms continued and she was offered surgery.\nThe surgical procedure began with an arthroscopy.

An arthroscopic shaver was used to excise calcified deposits, prior to open operation.\nUsing a 12 cm longitudinal incision in the distal anterior thigh, the quadriceps tendon was exposed and ~10% of the tendon was excised to remove as much of the visible calcification and surrounding paste-like material as possible.

    "original_text": "A 67-year-old male with a past medical history of congestive heart failure, non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and pacer-dependent heart block, presented to the University of Miami emergency department with refractory complex partial seizures. Due to the fact that the patient was pacemaker-dependent, he was unable to undergo MRI. Therefore, a contrasted CT scan of the brain was performed, which demonstrated a heterogeneously enhancing left frontal mass just anterior to the left motor cortex thought to be either a primary central nervous system tumor or a metastatic lesion (Figure ).\nA full metastatic workup was conducted with no primary lesion detected. Given the location of the lesion, further imaging was thought to be necessary for two reasons: 1) to further elucidate the differential diagnosis of the lesion and 2) to help safely guide resection or biopsy of a lesion in close proximity to eloquent brain tissue. As a result, cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for the possible replacement of the patient\u2019s current pacemaker with an MRI-compatible alternative. The patient subsequently underwent the removal of their pacemaker and replacement with a Surescan Medtronic DDD Pacemaker RVDR01 (Minneapolis, MN, US). Following this procedure, an MRI was performed and demonstrated a multi-lobulated, relatively uniformly enhancing left frontal lesion (Figure ). Due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis, the decision was made to perform an awake craniotomy with MRI-assisted stereotactic guidance and intraoperative electrocorticoraphy for a definitive diagnosis. The lesion was able to be resected with the initial pathology suggestive of Mycobacterium tuberculosae brain abscess. The patient was placed on anti-tuberculosis medication and intravenous (IV) antibiotics and discharged home.

According to the referring clinic, the chest radiography and UGIS were normal (, ). However, after taking the gastric bloating agent the patient developed increasing epigastric pain and nausea.\nOn admission, the respiratory rate of the patient was 38 breaths/min and the oxygen saturation was 91% in room air. Physical examination showed absent breath sounds and dull to percussion findings at the left lung base. The chest radiography revealed gastric air-fluid levels and bowel loops in the left thoracic cavity. After the placement of a nasogastric tube, the chest radiography showed displacement of the tip of the tube to the dilated stomach located in the left thoracic cavity (). An UGIS using gastrograffin was performed without a bloating agent (). The UGIS showed no transit of the gastrograffin through the duodenum and a hook-like image was noted at the medial portion of the herniated stomach. A chest CT revealed absence of the left side of the diaphragm (). The impression was that the patient had a mesenteroaxial gastric volvulus with a diaphragmatic hernia.

Video fibroscopy revealed a severe subglottic stenosis grade III according to the Cotton-Myer scale. Computed tomography scan of the neck and chest confirmed an hourglass-shaped subglottic stenosis which carried down to the second tracheal ring (). Three months prior to hospitalization, the patient underwent aortic valve replacement because of severe regurgitation after bacterial endocarditis. The patient was intubated in an intensive care unit for 5 days. A month after this procedure, the first signs of breathing problems began to appear. The cardiac status before our intervention displayed good functionality of the replaced valve but moderate insufficiency of the mitral and tricuspid valves, with an ejection fraction of 28%. The patient showed a decrease in functional capacity - the Duke Activity Status Index score was 4 points. According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists was grade IV. The patient's informed consent was obtained according to the guidelines of the local medical ethics committee.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced and patient was ventilated through a laryngeal mask airway. Low collar incision was performed and the subplatysmal flap was raised. The trachea and cricoid cartilage were dissected from the soft tissues surrounding them, while protecting the recurrent nerve. The first two tracheal rings were shrunk, with a loss of cartilaginous support. Through an incision just beneath the pathological section, the patient was intubated with a tube and afterwards the stenotic segment, the cricoid arch and the first two tracheal rings were resected. The lumen of the stenosis was 2.5 mm (). Severe adhesions were found and resected posteriorly enveloping the corresponding segment of the esophagus. Afterwards, the trachea was released from the upper mediastinum and thyrohyoid release of the larynx was performed. Thyrotracheal anastomosis was performed using MonoPlus\u00ae (B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) (polydioxanone) sutures",

His chief symptom included several episodes daily of severe abdominal pain, and unable to stand without narcotic analgesics. The pain was mainly epigastric, but radiating to the rear. It was more severe after meals, and was relieved by leaning forward. Patient had lost weight (from 90 kg to 65 kg), and was diabetic.\nThe diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis was made based on the clinical presentation, radiological workups and percutaneous biopsy at another center. He had a metallic biliary stent for biliary stenosis. Endoscopic examinations revealed gastritis. A percutaneous celiac axis blockage was required for severe episodes of pain. Before referring to our center, patient had undergone laparotomy for pancreatic resection; however, because of the portal hypertension, the procedure had been capped off. The pancreatic tru-cut biopsy at this laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis without evidence of malignancy. He was then referred to us for surgery for pain relief.\nAt the time of admission, he was daily using narcotic analgesics, proton pump inhibitor, pancreas enzyme extracts and antidepressant drugs. He had mild anemia, slightly elevated liver function tests, and CA-19-9 was 202 U/ml. Computed tomography was compatible with chronic pancreatitis (heterogenous parenchyma, dilated pancreatic duct), and a 4 cm pseudocyst was seen at the tail of the pancreas ( and ).
