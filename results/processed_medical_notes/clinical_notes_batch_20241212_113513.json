The patient was mechanically ventilated with gastrostomy tube and tracheostomy in place. His physical exam otherwise was benign. He was found to have acute onset anemia with hemoglobin of 7.1 g/dl. He was suspected of having peptic ulcer disease secondary to NSAIDs given the history of chronic musculoskeletal pain with NSAID use. Due to continual decrease in hemoglobin requiring daily blood transfusions despite conservative management, upper endoscopy was performed. It demonstrated a bleeding ulcer distal to pylorus in the duodenal bulb. Endoscopic technique was used to remove the clot, but the procedure resulted in bleeding that could not be stopped leading to poor visualization despite epinephrine injections. Due to his multiple comorbidities, he was deemed to be a poor surgical candidate. The patient was referred to interventional radiology for embolization of gastroduodenal artery (GDA).\nDuring the embolization of GDA, the celiac angiogram demonstrated no evidence of active extravasation, but contour irregularity at the level of the mid-GDA was noted. Prophylactic coil embolization of GDA was performed achieving GDA stasis. Post-embolization angiography of the SMA demonstrated no evidence of bleeding from IPDA branches. Incidentally noted was a replaced right hepatic artery arising from the SMA.\nDespite embolization of GDA, patient\u2019s hemoglobin continued to decrease to 6.8 g/dl and the patient continued to have melena and hematemesis resulting in hypotension.

The patient complained of worsening of dyspnea symptoms during exercise, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II\u2013III for several months without angina. The resting electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 90/min (see supplemental figure 1). The N\u2011terminal pro B\u2011type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level was moderately elevated (2274 ng/l) with normal renal and thyroid function and borderline anemia (hemoglobin 116 g/l). Transthoracic and transesophageal 3D echocardiography (see Fig. , upper panels, supplemental video 1) revealed a rare cause of heart failure in octogenarians, i. e. a partially calcified but patent ductus arteriosus 6 mm in diameter, which was confirmed by 3D-VRT computed tomography (see Fig. , lower panels, supplemental video 2). All 4 heart chambers were dilated (echocardiography: left ventricular end-diastolic diameter 67 mm, right ventricle 35 mm, left atrium 59 mm and right atrium 48 mm), the pulmonary arteries (right 40 mm and left 30 mm) and the pulmonary trunk (55 mm) were severely dilated. Left ventricular systolic function was slightly decreased (left ventricular ejection fraction 45 %) and the right ventricular systolic function was normal.

The patient was admitted into the surgical unit and treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics for scrotal cellulitis.\nOn day 2 of admission, he had a witnessed cardiac arrest whilst getting out of bed. A rhythm check during resuscitation revealed asystole. The patient had return of spontaneous circulation after 15 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and 2 mg of IV adrenaline. He was intubated and subsequently transferred to a tertiary hospital intensive care unit (ICU) for further care.\nOn arrival at the ICU, physical examination revealed dual heart sounds with a pansystolic murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, bilateral inspiratory crepitations at the lung bases and moderate bilateral pitting oedema to the thighs and scrotum. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm, normal QRS morphology, a prolonged QTc interval at 470 ms and no features of ischaemia ().\nSerum creatinine was 402 \u03bcmol/l, and troponin T was 266 ng/l (normal <14).

He was diagnosed with CES, due to a L3 burst facture and spinal canal compression. Thus, posterior lumbar interbody fusion was performed (). After surgery, paraparesis improved progressively and no specific symptoms were reported, except neuropathic pain. The patient was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital for conservative treatment of the neurogenic pain and gait training; no specific complication was found during treatment.\nThe patient was transferred to our emergency department with fever and general weakness for 7 days. A complete blood count indicated leukocytosis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from blood and urine culture tests. By abdominal ultrasonography, edema was observed in the bilateral renal parenchyma with hyperechogenicity, indicating renal failure, caused by acute pyelonephritis. No local lesion in the renal parenchyma, decreased blood perfusion, or extension of the renal pelvis or renal calyx was observed. After diagnosing sepsis, caused by acute pyelonephritis, meropenem was administered intravenously. After antibiotic treatment for 13 days, vital signs were stable and laboratory findings returned to normal. Antibiotics were stopped on the 15th day.\nThe patient was transferred to the rehabilitation medicine department for comprehensive management of his CES on the 16th day of hospitalization.

Two years ago he had undergone pelvic exenteration because of advanced prostate cancer with intraoperative (15 Gy) and adjuvant radiotherapy (63 Gy). Wound healing was complicated by a perineal wound infection and development of a perineal abscess. Afterwards, periodical bouginage by flexible endoscopy (Hegar bouginage) of the abscess fistula had been necessary in order to drain pus and to keep the fistula open.\nAfter a few seconds tachycardia ceased spontaneously but neurologic examination revealed a comatose patient with ping-pong gaze, decerebrate rigidity and positive Babinski response bilaterally. Mechanical ventilation was initiated with 100% oxygen since vascular air embolism was suspected. Furthermore, the patient was placed in partial left lateral decubitus position in order to entrap possible air in the right ventricle. Head CT showed massive air entrapment in cortical branches of both middle cerebral arteries, predominantly on the right side, and in the cavernous sinus (Figure ). Since the patient was in need of critical care medicine we were not able to administer hyperbaric therapy. Thus, in order to reduce brain injury we decided to apply moderate hypothermia with a target bladder temperature of 33\u00b0C for 24 hours. Hypothermia was immediately induced with rapid free floating ice cold saline infusions (4\u00b0C, 25 ml/kg body weight) and after the diagnostic procedures by an external cooling system. Transthoracic echocardiography detected no intraventricular air. One hour and fifteen minutes after the first imaging, CT angiography showed normal cerebral blood vessels and complete resolution of the intracranial air.

    "cleaned_text": "a 59-year-old man developed sudden respiratory distress, tachycardia, hypotonia, and coma about one minute after flexible endoscopy with dilatation and irrigation of a perineal abscess under sedation with propofol. two years ago he had undergone pelvic exenteration because of advanced prostate cancer with intraoperative (15 gy) and adjuvant radiotherapy (63 gy). wound healing was complicated by a perineal wound infection and development of a perineal abscess. afterwards, periodical bouginage by flexible endoscopy (hegar bouginage) of the abscess fistula had been necessary in order to drain pus and to keep the fistula open.\nafter a few seconds tachycardia ceased spontaneously but neurologic examination revealed a comatose patient with ping-pong gaze, decerebrate rigidity and positive babinski response bilaterally. mechanical ventilation was initiated with 100% oxygen since vascular air embolism was suspected. furthermore, the patient was placed in partial left lateral decubitus position in order to entrap possible air in the right ventricle. head ct showed massive air entrapment in cortical branches of both middle cerebral arteries, predominantly on the right side, and in the cavernous sinus (figure ). since the patient was in need of critical care medicine we were not able to administer hyperbaric therapy. thus, in order to reduce brain injury we decided to apply moderate hypothermia with a target bladder temperature of 33\u00b0c for 24 hours. hypothermia was immediately induced with rapid free floating ice cold saline infusions (4\u00b0c, 25 ml/kg body weight) and after the diagnostic procedures by an external cooling system. transthoracic echocardiography detected no intraventricular air. one hour and fifteen minutes after the first imaging, ct angiography showed normal cerebral blood vessels and complete resolution of the intracranial air. during rewarming the patient developed generalized myoclonus which did not respond to intravenous valproic acid, phenytoin and levetiracetam. only propofol resulted in a discontinuation of myoclonus. the following days the patient increasingly regained consciousness and could be ext",

    "original_text": "A 29-year-old Asian female presented to the emergency department for a progressively worsening rash over the prior week. The eruption originated as a solitary pruritic plaque on her left arm, which over the next two days spread to her trunk and legs. Her family physician initially prescribed a course of valacyclovir for presumed varicella zoster virus infection. She returned to the same provider three days later and the rash was noted to now involve the interdigital aspects of her hands and feet. Permethrin cream was prescribed due to concern for scabies. The lesions continued to worsen and the patient developed a fever and sore throat eight days after the eruption onset. She was subsequently instructed by her primary care provider to go to the emergency department for further evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, she complained of severe pruritis and painful oral lesions but denied having any painful skin lesions, skin sloughing, or any anogenital lesions. On exam, she was tachycardic to 131 bpm but was afebrile, normotensive, and in no acute distress. Cardiovascular and pulmonary examinations were unremarkable. Cutaneous examination revealed numerous erythematous discrete papules and minimal blanching on the bilaterally distal extremities, face, and neck ().

During the 1st cycle, grade 3 nausea and vomiting developed from day 3 of chemotherapy. Thus fasting, parenteral nutritional support, and hydration with intravenous administration of metoclopramide and lorazepam were given. During the 2nd cycle, neither nausea nor vomiting but grade 3 diarrhea (8-10 stools per day) developed from day 4 and he was admitted to hospital on day 6.

Laboratory examinations including white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein were within normal limits. Fasting, parenteral nutritional support and hydration with oral loperamide, starting with 4mg followed by 2 mg every 2 hr, were done.

His chief complaint was pain in the upper front region of jaw associated with front teeth.\nDuring history taking, the mother reported that the patient's \u201ccrises\u201d began at 6 years of age. Since then, there have been frequent episodes in which he turned his eyes up, shook, stiffened, contorted his body, and clenched his fists. She could not ascertain if there was any loss of consciousness, during these episodes. She had consulted a pediatrician and a neurologist for evaluation of his general and neurological evaluation. Neurological examination reports revealed that, the patient presented with some spontaneous myoclonic jerks of right and left arms. The diagnosis of right and left focal epileptic fits, which were secondarily generalized was made. Language and learning difficulties were diagnosed as the patient had been repeating his fifth grade for 5 years. Medical reports also revealed that the patient was initially on carbamazepine 200 mg twice/day and risperidone 1 mg/day for 6 years. The drug therapy was changed at the age of 12 years by discarding the risperidone and increasing the carbamazepine dosage to 600 mg/day. The mother did not understand that a diagnosis of epilepsy had been made because of her lack of education. Patient's routine hematological investigations were within the normal limits.\nAt first dental visit patient was extremely anxious about the dental clinical environment.

Spine operation was planned and electrodiagnosis (EDX) was conducted to determine the exact location of lesion and to differentiate peripheral nerve lesions before surgery in another clinic (Table ).\nThe patient had been experiencing foot drop for 9 days and initial EDX results revealed abnormal spontaneous activity (ASA) in the left tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL), and extensor hallucis longus (EHL). These findings suggested that the patient's foot drop was more likely due to peroneal nerve injury than lumbar radiculopathy. ASA, such as fibrillation, usually appears within 5 to 6 weeks after the onset of the lesion in radiculopathy.[ Consequently, the surgery was cancelled.\nThe next day, the patient was referred to our outpatient clinic for peroneal neuropathy.

On physical examination, muscle manual testing (MMT) of the TA and EHL revealed a trace grade, while the peroneus muscle showed poor plus grade. There were no signs of TA or peroneal muscle atrophy.

In 2015, a baby was delivered by caesarean section in the breech position, weighing 3900 g. She had no significant past medical history, and her antenatal care had been uneventful. On August 9, 2018, at 19:15, she was admitted to our hospital due to a pregnancy of 9+ months and irregular contractions for 4+ hours. Periodic uterine contractions occurred every 6\u20138 min. The patient was not accompanied by abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding and had intermittent term after contractions. Clinical examination showed that her body temperature was 36.7 \u00b0C, blood pressure was 102/65 mmHg, pulse rate was 100 bpm, and oxygen saturation was 100%. Blood tests showed mild leucocytosis (16.61 \u00d7 109/L), normal platelet count, normal coagulation test, and haemoglobin of 102 g/L. Vaginal examination showed the cervix was tightly closed; no vaginal bleeding or fluid was found. The ultrasonography indicated that the foetal head was located above the uterine cavity, the foetal size was consistent with the gestational age, the placental position was normal, and the scar thickness of the previous caesarean section was approximately 0.2 cm. Uterine contractions declined after admission. During admission, the patient was clinically and biochemically stable, and daily cardiotocograms showed a reassuring foetal heart rate pattern. Because of the patient\u2019s progressive anaemia (blood tests revealed a slow decline in haemoglobin to 93 g/L, 87 g/L) and sudden increasing abdominal pain, ultrasound was used but did not show ruptured abdominal fluid. An urgent laparotomy was performed and revealed a massive haemoperitoneum caused by the rupture of the uterine posterior wall. A haemoperitoneum with approximately 1 liter of blood was recovered. The lower uterine segment was intact and not ruptured. A boy with a body weight of 2900 g was delivered. Apgar scores",

The patient complained of progressive hearing impairment and fullness of the right ear. She had no history of otitis media or previous trauma to the ear. On physical examination, the right tympanic membrane was not visible because of a mass that was completely obstructing the EAC. Right-sided hearing measured using pure tone audiometry was 55 dB hearing level, with an air-bone gap of 45 dB, demonstrating moderate, conductive hearing loss (). The patient had a normal hearing threshold in the left ear.

A roentgenogram showed a giant tumor in the left thorax (Figure ). The heart appeared to be compressed towards the right side. He had no other chest complaints, such as cough, chest pain, and dyspnea. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a well-circumscribed homogeneous mass, which compressed the descending aorta (Figure ). The hematological and biochemical findings were normal. Bronchofiberoscopy showed stenosis of the left lower lobar bronchus from extraluminal compression. Bronchoscopic cytology revealed no abnormal findings and no evidence of bronchitis. CT-guided biopsy demonstrated fibrotic soft tissue without evidence of malignancy but the appearance of the specimen did not have enough diagnostic strength. Spirometry showed the following results: vital capacity, 2.4 L (49% of predicted); forced expiratory volume in a second, 1.7 L (42% of predicted). Results of blood gas analysis were also within normal limits. The patient was referred to our institution for surgical treatment of a suspected SFT.\nLeft posterolateral thoracotomy through the fifth and eighth intercostal spaces was performed for the resection of the tumor. We choose the fifth intercostal space as our initial Thoracotomy site. Upon entering the pleura we could easily visualize the encapsulated circumscribed gigantic tumor. The tumor was large (20 cm \u00d7 19 cm \u00d7 15 cm), extended from the thoracic aperture to the diaphragm, and caused atelectasis of the lower lobe of the left lung.

In addition, a wide-spreading scarring alopecia-like lesion was observed on the whole scalp. The size of the nodule was approximately 32 mm in diameter. Skin biopsy from the nodule revealed a dermal infiltration composed of atypical keratinocytes with dyskeratotic cytoplasm (Fig. ).

Abdominal examination was negative for hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, abdominal tenderness, or rebounding pain. There were no signs of lymphadenopathy. A clinical diagnosis of acute gastritis was made, and the patient was given proton pump inhibitor and discharged.\nTwo days later, the pain started to radiate toward the back, and the patient started to suffer from severe thoracic back pain. Four days later, the pain started to radiate toward both lower limbs with the subtle beginning of the weakness of the lower limbs and progressed within a few hours later to inability to walk, with intact neurological function of the upper extremities.\nHe denied any history of trauma, recent history of viral illness, or illicit drug use. On neurological examination, the patient was found to have bilateral numbness and motor impairment in the lower limbs with muscle strength of 2/5. Hyperactive patellar and Achilles reflexes were observed. Pain and light touch sensation were objectively normal; there was no bowel or urinary incontinence. The straight leg raise test was negative bilaterally.\nMagnetic resonance imaging revealed a space-occupying lesion in the spinal canal at the T6/T7 level without detection of any lesions elsewhere []. Because of suspected metastasized tumor, further investigations were undertaken.

First physical examination found a heart rate at 124/min and blood pressure at 80/45 mmHg without response after 1-L crystalloid fluid expansion. The patient had a polypnea at 28 cycles/min without other respiratory distress sign. The abdomen was tense and painful to the palpation. First laboratory blood test showed a hyperlactatemia-related metabolic acidosis with a pH at 7.21, a PCO2 at 24 mmHg, a bicarbonate level at 14 mmoL/L, and a lactate level at 9 mmoL/L. Abdomen and pelvis computed tomography (CT) scan with injection of contrast material showed a voluminous liver abscess [, Panel A], consistent with the diagnosis of liver abscess-associated septic shock. Rapidly, the patient developed respiratory and hemodynamic failure with the need of mechanical ventilation, and continuous norepinephrine infusion up to 8 mg/h. An empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy consisting of piperacillin/tazobactam 4 g fourth a day and one injection of 8 mg/k of gentamicin (480 mg) was administrated for up to 3 weeks. The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy surgery for microbiological sampling and drainage of the liver abscess. In the early postoperative course, the patient demonstrated crepitation of the thoracic and cervical region consistent with the diagnosis of SE. A second CT scan confirmed the presence of massive SE extending from the abdomen to the head associated with a pneumoperitoneum [, Panels B to D]. Of note, SE was found neither during the first physical examination at ICU admission nor on the first CT scan. There were no arguments, for upper airway injuries or pneumothorax.

    "original_text": "A 70-year-old man with antecedent of follicular lymphoma in complete remission presented at the Timone University Hospital (Marseille, France) in 2016 for a squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharyngeal region. The patient categorically refused any treatment, including preservative surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or supportive care.\nOne year later, he was addressed to our palliative care unit by the hand-surgery department after attempting suicide. The patient explained his action by the fear of suffering. No depressive state was diagnosed by our psychiatrists. Despite persistence fear of suffering, the patient rejected the idea of suicide because of his family, but still wanted to die and asks for assistance. Information on Claeys-Leonetti law was given, especially on assisted-suicide banishment and on the possibility to relieve suffering with adapted treatments.\nOne week after discharge, the patient was readmitted to our department for dyspnea and anxiety. Symptoms were managed by appropriate treatments (oxygen and low dose of midazolam in an anxiolytic purpose). Despite stabilisation, the patient was afraid of dying suffocated and asked for deep and continuous palliative sedation until death. Apart from the fear he expresses, the patient has no symptoms of anxiety, depression or pain after the introduction of appropriate treatments. On the other hand, he clearly states that he refuses to live again knowing that his death is approaching and that he is apprehensive of suffering. He says he wants to rush his death.

After performing core needle biopsy, she had been diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma grade II in the upper outer quadrant of her left breast. Accordingly, this tumor was characterized as negative by immunohistochemistry for estrogen and progesterone receptors, but it resulted as positive for HER2 and Ki67 positive in >25% of tumor cells.

    "original_text": "We herein describe a 42-year-old woman with HCM caused by p.Phe244Leu in MYH7 who presented with an approximately 1-week history of recurrent palpitations while eating. At 40 years of age, she had visited our hospital for a consultation regarding her condition because her mother had developed a cerebral infarction caused by atrial fibrillation and HCM. The family history showed that her uncle (the brother of her mother) had severe heart disease (details unknown) and died suddenly in his early 40s. An ECG at that time showed sinus rhythm with ST-T changes suggesting left ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography revealed localized mild hypertrophy of the interventricular septum with no findings of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The patient requested genetic analysis of HCM (approved by the Bioethical Committee on Medical Research, Kanazawa University, and with written informed consent), and we detected p.Phe244Leu in MYH7 in both the patient and her mother (Figure ).\nWe then examined the patient every 3 months, although she was asymptomatic and therefore required no medication. At 42 years of age, however, she reported episodic palpitations that occurred while eating. She also had a near-syncopal feeling in the first few days of the onset of palpitations. A physical examination was unremarkable, and her baseline thyroid function was within normal limits. An ECG and echocardiographic examination revealed findings similar to those of her prior examinations, including her left atrial size. The interventricular septal wall dimension was 13 mm. A 24-hours Holter ECG recording revealed brief runs of atrial tachycardia temporally associated with her symptoms during swallowing (Figure ). The tachycardia lasted 5-29 beats, while the ventricular rate varied from 150 to 200 beats per minute.

He has been diagnosed as having left choroid melanoma three years earlier. His first noticed symptoms are imbalance and left eye visual deterioration. Examination of the left funds revealed moderately large partly melanotic and partly amelanotic choroidal melanoma. The melanoma bisected the fovea of the left eye, and it had a base of 15 mm and a thickness of 4.5 mm as assessed by ultrasonography. He was screened for distant metastasis. Blood tests and imaging inform of CT scans were unremarkable at the time. He received brachytherapy using an 18 mm iodine-125 radioactive plaque, which easily covered the base of the melanoma. Subsequently, he has been monitored by an ophthalmologist regularly and a month before this presentation melanoma thickness had reduced to 2.9 mm. The vision was corrected, right eye 6/6 and left eye 6/9. On examination, apart from T8\u2013T12 spinal tenderness, there were no neurological abnormalities detected. His initial CT scan showed a compression fracture of T10 vertebrae with associated retropulsion of the superior fracture fragment of approximately 3.5 mm and a canal stenosis at that level; findings were confirmed on MRI spine. MRI spine also showed disseminated spinal metastasis at various vertebrae without any additional spinal cord compression. He was commenced on steroids and underwent T10 laminectomy and debulking along with T8 to T12 pedicle screw fixation. He was planned for palliative radiotherapy on recovery. Histopathology from T10 vertebral body was suggestive of metastatic melanoma and immunohistochemistry showed strongly positive SOX10, MITF, HMB45, and S100 confirmed metastatic melanoma.

Three weeks before referral to our endocrinological surgery unit she developed a swelling of her head and neck lymph nodes. Her past medical history included surgical removal of a benign breast tumor 22 years ago. Her family history was unremarkable regarding any endocrinological or thyroid disease. Besides her obesity she was suffering from reflux disease and hypertension. She had a regular pulse of 68/per minute and blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg under antihypertensive medication. Her muscle tone was reduced. She had observed a change of her voice and had lost 20 kg of weight within the past 4 months. A thyroid scintigram showed multiple confluencing cold nodules which were highly suspicious for malignant neoplasm of both thyroid lobes and regional lymph node metastases along both jugular veins. Clinical exam and sonography showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes of the head and neck. Pre-operative serum calcitonin was 5.3 pg/ml (normal range 0.8\u20139.9 pg/ml). Based on the history, clinical presentation and the scintigram we suspected an anaplastic thyroid carcinoma and performed a radical oncologic thyroidectomy with bilateral modified neck-dissection and resection of the right internal jugular vein and the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Intraoperatively the tumor was tightly adherent to the surface of the trachea. Because of the impressing clinical picture a fine needle aspiration was not performed prior to surgery. In the authors' point of view it would have had no prognostic effect at this advanced stage of disease. A pre-operative pentagastrin test was also not performed as clinical presentation made the presence of an anaplastic carcinoma highly suspicious. Surprisingly, histopathology showed a pT3 L1 V1 R1 N1b low-differentiated medullary-thyroid carcinoma with massive lymphangiosis and haemangiosis carcinomatosa. Immunhistochemistry revealed weak positive staining for calcitonin and carcinoembryogenic antigen (CEA) (Figure",

Examination revealed a left breast lump of about 4 cm in the greatest dimension along with an axillary lymphadenopathy that was mobile. After a discussion, patient was operated on with left modified radical mastectomy. Histopathologic examination of the tumor revealed a disease consistent with T2 and N2. She had no metastases elsewhere (M0). Out of the 22 dissected axillary nodes, 5 were positive for malignancy. On the immunohistochemistry (IHC), the tumor was triple negative (negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Her2/neu). Postoperatively, she received adjuvant chemotherapy with 4 cycles of Adriamycin (60 mg/m2), and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2), followed by 4 cycles of paclitaxel (175 mg/m2). For the highnodal positivity consistent with N2, she was planned to have radiotherapy to the left chest wall. She received externalbeam radiotherapy (EBRT) to a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions starting 4 weeks after the completion of the 24-week chemotherapy course. There was no radiation recall phenomenon. Before the commencement of radiation, she had no lesions on the chest wall on the skin elsewhere.\nApproximately 9 months after the completion of radiation (the last active therapy for the cancer), the patient was found to have a depigmentation on the left chest wall congruent with area of radiation delivery. She had no pruritus in these areas. She had no previous history or family history of vitiligo or any autoimmune diseases. She had been a case of hypothyroidism with thyroxine replacement therapy. Her TSH had been in the desired range.\nThe hypopigmented lesions had clear cut margins. They coalesced and persisted in all subsequent follow-up examinations. None of the lesions were raised. They were of no definite shapes. There were no telangiectasia. Biopsy or additional testing of autoantibodies could not be performed as the patient did not consent. shows the",
