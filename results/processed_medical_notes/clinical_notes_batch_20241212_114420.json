Primary tumor pathology showed a 5 cm moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (T3N1bMx, KRAS wild type, MSS/MSI-L intact protein) in the splenic flexure. Staging computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CAP) was performed and showed 3 liver lesions with elevated blood levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) of 8 ng/ml. Therefore, the patient underwent chemotherapy and was started on oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and bevacizumab. The CT CAP was repeated after completing the course of treatment and showed that he had some response to chemotherapy. The patient was then kept on maintenance chemotherapy (bevacizumab & Xeloda) and referred to our hospital for possible further management after completing a total of 12 cycles of therapy.\nIn our hospital, the patient was re-evaluated with a CT CAP and hepatic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The liver MRI showed a lesion in segment 7 posteriorly, measuring 1.5 \u00d7 2.1 cm, a lesion in segment 6, measuring 3 \u00d7 3 cm, and another suspicious small lesion in segment 4A. These lesions were slightly larger than the lesions on previous images, and a positron emission tomography (PET) CT scan confirmed the marginal progression of the disease in the liver (Fig. ). In October 2017, a multidisciplinary decision was made to proceed with the parenchyma-preserving wedge resection with the possibility for a major resection if necessary. Preoperative CT of the abdomen with volumetry showed an estimated volume of the possible future liver remnant (left liver lobe) of approximately 51% (Fig. ).

Another CT of the chest showed progressive bi-pulmonary infiltration but no pulmonary embolism. Subsequently sufficient oxygenation was delivered by combined ECMO treatment and lung protective ventilation.\nDuring his stay in the intensive care unit the patient underwent recurrent episodes of cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity (PEA, Fig. , Fig. ) that were not associated with hypoxemia as he was on full ECMO support.

The patient\u2019s pain resulted in walking with a limp. Physical examination was notable for joint pain in both hips with active and passive motion, which worsened with weightbearing.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the bilateral hips was ordered prior to surgery, which further supported findings consistent with left SCFE (Figure ).\nSubsequent clinical follow-up initiated by his primary provider and the referred endocrinologist were notable for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone above 160 mcIU/mL, a low level of free thyroxine, and an elevated serum thyroperoxidase antibody level of 765 IU/mL, findings consistent with hypothyroidism likely secondary to Hashimoto thyroiditis. Further history obtained from the endocrinologist revealed symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism: fatigue, constipation, increased sleep, and problems with losing weight but without cold intolerance.

The tumor was histologically solid, with hemorrhage, necrosis, scarring, and pseudocapsule formation, and infiltrated into the renal parenchyma. The tumor spread to the right renal vein, but no infiltration into the inferior vena cava was observed. He didn't receive adjuvant chemotherapy following the nephrectomy. Postoperatively, he did not present with any symptoms and received regular follow-up with chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) every three months. There were no confirmed recurrence and metastasis until March 2020, when he visited our hospital complaining of right chest pain and dyspnea. At this time, CT scan revealed right pleural effusion and multiple pleural masses (C and D). There were no abnormal radiologic findings in the other organs. He had no smoking history, no past medical history, and no asbestos exposure. We suspected the following possibilities: metastasis from RCC, malignant pleural mesothelioma, and synovial sarcoma. For investigation and diagnosis, we performed two pleural effusion tests before surgery, but both cytological results were class I. After one month, there were no new abnormal radiologic findings, but we confirmed that the tumors obviously grew on CT (E and F). Finally, we performed intrathoracic tumor resection under general anesthesia and diagnosed histologically as pleural metastasis from clear cell type RCC (D\u2013F). Thoracoscopy showed multiple reddish, soft, bleeding encapsulated tumors (). The pleural fluid cytology had no malignant cells. A total of eight bleeding tumors were completely resected, with the largest measuring 5.0 \u00d7 3.8 \u00d7 2.2 cm.

The medical history for the patient revealed no relevant contributory conditions. The clinical examination revealed facial asymmetry evidenced by an enlargement in the right posterior region of the mandible, and the patient also reported fatigue and weight loss. Intraorally, a discrete swelling in the buccal mucosa extended to the retromolar space []. The panoramic radiograph revealed a multilocular ill-defined radiolucent lesion on the right side, expanding to the body, angle and ramus of the mandible []. The computed tomography scan evidenced a hypodense area causing destruction of the vestibular and lingual bone cortical areas. Such area involved the body, angle and ramus of the mandible []. The lesion's aspiration was negative. An incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia, and a tissue sample was removed from the interception zone of the ramus and body of the mandible. Results of microscopic analysis revealed fragments of malignancy presenting as compact sheets of atypical diffuse infiltrate of plasma cells. The neoplastic plasma cells presented as varied in size with eccentric nuclei, rounded and irregular formats.

However, she still had sharp and shooting pain in the right frontal region. The pain was so severe that she could not sleep at night and touch her hair. Eighteen days after the symptoms occurred, she collapsed due to dizziness. One month after initial onset of symptoms, the patient was admitted to the otolaryngology department of our hospital and received steroid pulse therapy for sudden left hearing loss. In addition, the patient was referred to a pain clinic. When the pain physician asked the patient about her symptoms, she said that the right forehead hurt the most. No typical rash was observed in the patient's ear or the area of pain. There was no history of a rash or trauma (Figure ).\nThe patient had no previous diagnosis.\nThe patient had no significant family history.\nNo neurological abnormalities were observed. The patient\u2019s symptoms were not provoked by neck movement or pressure over tender points in the neck and did not worsen with the Spurling\u2019s test.\nThe result for varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-IgM (titer 2.7) was positive in a test conducted to determine the cause of sudden hearing loss. The test was performed 23 days after the onset of pain. When she was referred to the pain clinic one month after the occurrence of symptoms, VZV-IgG and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were performed to precisely determine the patient\u2019s condition.

In addition, he believed that sexual activity he had with his wife was being filmed and then spread on pornographic websites.

Informed written consent for the nerve block was obtained and visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0-10, was explained to patient.\nIn the operation theater, standard monitoring was established. Anesthesia was induced with thiopentone and tracheal intubation was facilitated with succinylcholine. Neuromuscular blockade was achieved with vecuronium and anesthesia was maintained with O2 and N2O using controlled ventilation. The right side of the face was prepared for mandibular nerve block with lateral extraoral approach [].\nAn 18-gauge i.v. cannula was inserted at midpoint of lower border of the zygomatic arch and was advanced perpendicular to face until it contacted the lateral pterygoid plate. The length of the cannula outside the skin was marked and cannula was redirected slightly posterior to reach behind the posterior border and was advanced further by 0.5 cm. The needle from the cannula was withdrawn and 18G epidural catheter was threaded. Catheter was tunnelled subcutaneously and the filter was attached to its other end []. For surgical analgesia, a bolus dose of 4 ml of 0.25% bupivicaine was given through the catheter. Fentanyl 1mg/ kg i.v. was given only when there was more than 20% increase in heart rate or blood pressure above base line. The surgery lasted for 2 h. At the end of surgery, neuromuscular blockade was reversed and the trachea extubated. Following extubation, the patient was conscious and pain free and then shifted to ward.

At the age of 3 years, it was discovered that she suffered from short-term memory loss, although her long-term memories remained intact. At the age of 4 years, she began to lose sphincter control and was no longer able to control urination or defecation. She had shown normal motor development until 4 years of age, at which point she began to develop ataxia (fear of going downstairs) and weakness while walking. Atonic and myoclonic seizures also began to affect her at this age and could not be completely controlled despite the use of three anti-epileptic drugs (topiramate, levetiracetam, and valproate). Over the course of the subsequent year, her motor skills continued to decline, as she went from having difficulty walking to being limited to crawling. At 5 years old, she was completely unable to stand or sit, and was found to have very poor concentration and a very short attention span. Moreover, she had almost no expressive language, only vocalizing and echoing single words or screams with unclear sounds. She was incapable of imitating or playing with other children. At 5 years old, her mental age according to the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale was below the age of 2 years and her IQ was below 35.\nShe was born by spontaneous delivery after a healthy 40-wk pregnancy with a typical birth weight of 3.5 kg and no postnatal complications.

The DUS finding was suspicious for an acute arterial thrombosis but did not reveal any focal irregularities. Consequently, a computed tomography (CT) scan was urgently obtained but it did not show any arterial complications. However, it serendipitously revealed a 2.4-cm lesion on the upper pole of the renal allograft which was not detected during the back-table or ultrasonography monitoring. A biopsy of the lesion was performed, and its histology revealed an epithelial proliferation of large cells with finely granular cytoplasm and medium round nucleus vesicular acidophilus, arranged tubules, and alveoli and cords immersed in a connective tissue stroma. This picture was consistent with oncocytoma. However, because the eosinophilic variant of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (RCC) may morphologically resemble renal oncocytoma, immunohistochemical staining was performed using Ki-67 antibodies and RCC antigens.

The pregnancy was conceived via in vitro fertilization by 37 years old nullipara woman. Up to 35 weeks of gestation, the mother of the patient used nadroparin and acetylsalicylic acid as a treatment for a thrombophilia with protein S deficiency. There was no other remarkable family history and all previous standard pregnancy follow ups were unremarkable.\nAs pregnancy was conceived via in vitro fertilization and thus regarded high risk, the woman was referred to our medical center (Children\u2019s Clinical University Hospital in Riga, Latvia) for fetal echocardiography at 20 weeks of gestation, resulting in the diagnosis of Ebstein anomaly and right-sided aortic arch. The tricuspid valve was noted to be dysplastic and apically displaced with mild regurgitation. The size of the right ventricle was decreased, and aortic arch was coursing to the right of trachea (). Further follow-up visits were done once a month up to the delivery, with no remarkable changes in the condition.\nThe patient was born at 40 weeks of gestation in spontaneous vaginal delivery weighing 3450 g, having a length of 55 cm and an Apgar score of 9/9. At day 4, patient was transferred to our medical center for further evaluation. Physical exam revealed acrocyanosis and systolic murmur, findings of other organ systems were without any significant deviations from the norm.\nChest x-ray, electrocardiogram, Holter monitoring, transthoracic echocardiography, abdominal ultrasonography, neurosonography, karyotyping, and genetic testing for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome were done. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed the prenatal diagnosis of Ebstein anomaly and right-sided aortic arch. The electrocardiogram showed a partial right bundle branch block.

Childhood was unremarkable for medical conditions, starting at the age of 17 she had recurrent episodes of prolonged abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting. During multiple admissions to the emergency department, abdominal X-rays showed repeatedly intestinal obstruction. No further investigation regarding the cause for this abdominal pain was undertaken until the age of 24. During an abdominal gynecological laparatomy -conducted because of recurrent abdominal pain and dysmenorrhoe- multiple polypoid pedunculated lesions on the large bowels were seen (see Figure ), biopsy was not carried out because the lesions were well vascularized. On surgical abdominal exploratory laparotomy about 50 fibromatous tumors were found and removed from the serosal surfaces, small and large bowels, omentum and from the uterus.

In addition, in 2001, a right-sided localised ductal breast cancer in situ was identified and was treated surgically with a partial mastectomy. Secondary to her lymph node dissection, she developed lymphoedema of her left arm, which had been continuously treated with compression stockings.

CT scan of the thoracolumbar spine revealed severe kyphosis of T10-T11 secondary to anterior collapse of the T11 vertebral body. She received intravenous steroids and was evaluated for surgical intervention. She eventually underwent T11 corpectomy, fusion of T10-T12, implantation of biomechanical device at T11, anterior instrumentation of T10-12, and posterolateral fusion of T8-L3. Bone biopsy revealed evidence of osteomyelitis. She was started on a 42-day course of antibiotics. After surgery, she was noted to be increasingly lethargic and confused. Rapid response was called when she developed a complex partial seizure with secondary generalization. The seizure was terminated upon administration of intravenous Ativan. She was given a 1500 mg loading dose of Keppra followed by 500 mg twice daily maintenance dose. EKG monitoring during the seizure episode revealed sinus bradycardia, which eventually progressed to a 10-second sinus pause, approximately 20 seconds after seizure onset (). She had 2 more similar seizure episodes during the same day. In each seizure episode, she would develop sinus bradycardia, followed by sinus pauses a few seconds after seizure onset. Interictal EKGs revealed normal sinus rhythm. She was started on a dopamine infusion and transferred to the ICU. EEG revealed periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges and a single seizure emanating from the right posterior temporal region (). The seizure observed during the EEG focally originated from the T6 area and then had secondary generalization. It lasted around 75 seconds and clinically manifested as blank staring.

She was asymptomatic from a neurosurgical standpoint and had no known history of malignancy. Her neurological examination was unremarkable.\nThe initial CT spine scan demonstrated a cervical 7 vertebral body fracture and bilateral laminar fractures.

MRI revealed a heterogenous contrast-enhancing extradural mass originating in the left cervical 6 and 7 facet joint with extension into the soft tissues of the neck and epidural space without cord compression. The mass encircled the left vertebral artery (Figure ). CT angiography (CTA) of the neck showed a dominant left vertebral artery. A metastatic workup was negative.\nInitial management\nThe patient first underwent surgical repair for scalp avulsion and degloving without complication.

The patient accepted that he could hear the voices of his demised father and grandfather. He would hear these voices 8\u201310 times throughout the day, from outer objective space. The patient had a history of opioid dependence and was treated with tablet tramadol. However, he continued to use tablet tramadol 50 mg, 5\u201310 tablets per day in a dependent fashion continuously for the last 3 years, and the last dose was 36\u201348 h before onset of current complaints. There is no history of delirium or seizure and no history of psychiatric illness. General physical examination and neurological examination were within normal limits. Mental status examination revealed second-person auditory hallucinations, and higher mental functions were within normal limits and absent insight. All routine blood investigations and contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the head were within normal limit.\nUrine screening with poly-kit for substance was positive for tramadol (>100 ng/ml). However, it was negative for benzodiazepines and cannabis. Baseline clinical opiate withdrawal scale (COWS)[] score was 19 and subjective opiate withdrawal scale[] was 30.

A computed tomography scan obtained at the time of her initial presentation showed curvilinear subcortical calcification and sulcus effacement, predominantly in the right temporal lobe ().

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) performed to evaluate the possibility of a vascular lesion, revealed a DAVF of the isolated right transverse sinus as well as cortical venous reflux (). Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrated a DAVF with an isolated right transverse sinus, supplied by the transosseous branches of the bilateral occipital artery, and the petrosquamous branch of the right middle meningeal artery as well as dural branches from the right vertebral artery. There was retrograde cortical venous reflux (CVR) via leptomeningeal veins from the temporal lobe ().

The patient, after signing informed consent, underwent three attempts of epidural analgesia with a Tuohy needle of 18 Gauge. Suspecting accidental puncture of dura mater, they modified the anesthetic technique and started intravenous administration of Remifentanil. Moreover, induction of labor was carried out, with vaginal delivery after 1 h and 15 min. After 10 h from the initial attempt of epidural anesthesia, the patient begins to complain of symptoms as orthostatic headache and irradiated neck pain. The pain increases progressively, affecting the entire rachis.

However two weeks after admission his general conditions deteriorated with increasing neurological abnormalities. His temperature suddenly increased again to 39\u00b0C. Pain burning and numbness increased in the legs and the same symptoms appeared in the hands. He complained of asymmetrical weakness of the distal parts of the legs and small hand muscles, worse on the left. Marked oedema of feet and toes appeared which spread over the lower legs. There was a change of skin of feet toes and lower legs.\nThe pulse was 96, the blood pressure increased to 160/90 mmHg. The patient was normally orientated in place and time. Cranial nerves were normal. Chest and abdomen were normal. The flexors of the neck were spared. All the small muscles of the hand were severely atrophied and a moderate atrophy of the distal part of forearms was seen. Muscular strength was measured by MRC scale (grade 1-5): shoulder girdle, deltoid, upper arms and extensors of the wrists, grade 5; extensors digitorum communis and flexors of the wrists, grade 3; interossei volaris and dorsalis and lumbricales, grade 1-2, with both side involved, more clearly on the left.

Her peripheral blood smear showed leukocytosis with a WBC of 93,500/microliters, and the bone marrow picture revealed a predominance of blast cells. The blasts were negative for peroxidase, alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase and PAS. A diagnosis of AML, M0 was made, based on the FAB criteria. She was treated with 3+7 induction therapy, where daunorubicin was given in a dose of 60mg/m2/day for 3 days and cytarabine in a dose of 100 mg/ m2/day for 7 days. Post induction remission chemotherapy bone marrow evaluation confirmed the achievement of complete haematological remission. Subsequently she received high dose cytosine arabinoside in a dose of 3 gm/m2/dose. After 9 days of this high dose chemotherapy she developed mucosal toxicities and high fever with cough during the hospital course. This febrile episode was associated with neutropenia with absolute neutrophil count 500 mm3. So empirical antimicrobial therapy with cefepime and amikacin was started. Although there was a slight decrease in her temperature and moderate improvement in her general condition, she developed sudden tachypnea, dyspnea, fever, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and acute respiratory distress on the sixteenth day for which she had to be put in a ventillator. Blood, urine and nasopharyngeal swab cultures were negative. Radiological investigations revealed the presence of bilateral consolidations. Pulmonary CT scan was performed which showed bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrations suggesting fungal or bacterial pneumonia. There was also no sign of pericardial involvement. Diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) was done on the basis of isolation of an Aspergillus species from the sputum and from bronchoalveolar lavage samples. The admission electrocardiogram (ECG) had revealed normal sinus rhythm. Basing on the laboratory diagnosis she was administered a single loading dose of 70",

He was diagnosed as having intracranial hemorrhage of the left basal ganglia and temporal lobe. After 3 weeks, he was offered rehabilitation services for the auditory problem of being unable to differentiate voices, music, and environmental sounds. His past medical history included hypertension and right basal ganglia intracranial hemorrhage 13 years previous. There has been no definite sequelae of previous stroke. In the neuroimaging studies 2 weeks after the onset of the stroke, a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed intracranial hemorrhage of the left basal ganglia and temporal lobe area and a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed a moderate to severe perfusion decrease and impaired vascular reserve in left temporal lobe ().\nHe was an alert patient but, he did not follow oral commands or respond to environmental sounds. His verbal repetition and writing to dictation were severely defective with phonemic substitutions. Neuropsychological evaluations were performed 3 weeks after the onset of stroke. He obtained a score of 4/30 on the Mini Mental State Exam of Korea (MMSE-K) with verbal communication. He was diagnosed as having cognitive dysfunction. But he could comprehend written and gestural communication. A language assessment using the Korean Version of the Western Aphasia Battery (K-WAB) revealed that he had significant deficits in auditory comprehension, repetition, and writing to dictation, despite the presence of good reading, fluent speech, and spontaneous writing, without evidence of aphasia.

The patient later revealed all symptoms being preceded by an episode of persistent substernal chest discomfort that she managed at home without contacting her primary physician. In the emergency department, she was found with electrocardiographic evidence of a recent acute myocardial infarction (Q in precordial leads V1\u2013V4 with ST elevations and T-wave inversions). She was diagnosed with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction, pretreated with aspirin 325 mg, and clopidogrel 600 mg and urgently underwent coronary intervention with a drug-eluting stent to an occluded intermediate artery. The rest of the coronary arteries were without stenoses. Echocardiography 24-h later showed akinetic anterior and lateral wall with an estimated ejection fraction of 40%. After initial clinical improvement, the patient abruptly deteriorated on the third day with onset of acute pulmonary oedema and cardiogenic shock. At this time, the electrocardiogram did not show any dynamic changes of the ST-T segments or any arrhythmias. Repeat coronary angiography was without any further stenosis and re-evaluation with echocardiography revealed new severe mitral regurgitation and no other abnormalities that could lead to shock, such as pericardial effusion\u2014tamponade or ventricular septal defect (VSD). Clinical examination at the time revealed an elderly female in moderate distress, requiring supplemental oxygen (60% FiO2) for maintenance of a saturation of 92\u201393%, with orthopnoea, jugular venous distension, and bilateral inspiratory crackles on lung auscultation.

The angiogram excluded the presence of obstructive coronary atherosclerosis. After ergonovine administration, left circumflex coronary artery spasm was induced (Timeline table), and it was associated with chest pain and electrocardiographic changes with characteristics similar to those of spontaneous episodes. Since then, the patient continued to experience rare (one/year) and responsive to sublingual nitrates VA episodes while she was on chronic verapamil (240 mg/day) and isosorbide mononitrate (50 mg/day).

He complained of deep right upper quadrant and right flank at rest and right upper limb pain, without evidence of ecchymosis or lacerations on his chest or abdomen. Some superficial abrasions were visible on his right elbow and his right lower quadrant. Physical examination revealed mild tenderness to deep palpation in his right upper quadrant and right flank.\nThere were no abnormal signs on his blood analysis, metabolic or coagulation panel. Urinalysis revealed mild microscopic hematuria (20\u201326 erythrocytes per field vision). Chest, spine and pelvis plain radiography was negative for fractures or any other abnormal findings.

The pain was constant and dull, and started 2 hours prior to admission with no obvious inducible factor. The patient\u2019s past medical history was unremarkable except mild weight loss during the recent 5 months. Physical examination revealed a palpable abdominal mass in the left upper abdominal quadrant with tenderness, and the patient\u2019s hemodynamic condition was unstable with systolic arterial blood pressure only 85 mmHg and heart rate 110 beats/minute. After initial fast fluid resuscitation (1,000 ml hetastarch 130/0.4 NaCl), the hemodynamic status of the patient became stable. Peripheral blood count revealed anemia (hemoglobin 10.0 g/dl) and thrombocytopenia (platelets 90 \u00d7 109/l), but it did not reach disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Results of other laboratory examinations had not been reported to us before the operation due to the emergency. Abdominal ultrasonography showed an enlarged spleen filled with irregular nodules, multiple hepatic solid lesions and moderate accumulation of peritoneal fluid. Abdominal paracentesis was performed with blood fluid aspirated from the peritoneal cavity. These findings were further confirmed by an abdominal computed tomography scan (Figure\n), demonstrating a heterogeneous, low-density signal within the splenic parenchyma, with variable degrees of contrast enhancement as well as intra-abdominal hemorrhage originating most possibly from the spleen. Meanwhile, there were multiple low-density lesions with enhanced rim in the liver.\nLaparotomy revealed a huge spleen actively bleeding and an abnormal liver with several metastatic foci. We did observe a fissure of the capsule of the spleen with a size of 6 cm (length) \u00d7 2.5 cm (depth) in the lower pole of spleen. Two liters of blood had been collected from the peritoneal cavity. Splenectomy was performed. During the procedure, the patient received 4 units of concentrated red blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma.\nThe spleen was 1,650 g in weight, 19 cm \u00d7 16",

The MRI also detected lymph node enlargement in the left axilla ().\nA positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed an area increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the upper inner quadrant of the affected breast with faint uptake by the lymph nodes in the left axilla, but no other metastatic lesions were found.\nThe patient underwent a modified radical mastectomy in October 2009. Grossly, there is a 3.0 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 1.4 cm sized ill defined dark brown hemorrhagic spongy mass in the upper outer quadrant of breast. Microscopically, the mass composed of epithelioid areas, spindle areas and necrosis. The epithelioid areas are made up of large rounded cells of high nuclear grade which are arranged in sheets or rudimentary vascular channels (). The spindle areas show vasoformative growth with complex anastomosing channels (). These neoplastic channels are irregular in shape, freely intercommunicating with one another in a sinusoidal fashion. The mass shows high mitotic count (14/10 HPF), high nuclear grade and necrosis, the diagnosis is angiosarcoma, grade 3 in World Health Organization classification. There is no lymph node metastasis. On immunohistochemical staining, the tumor was negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2",

There were two bites, one that lacerated the lower lip that was still connected to the face by a small, lateral pedicle and one that amputated more than half of the upper lip. The defect crossed the philtrum medially and extended laterally to the nasolabial fold (). No other injuries were afflicted to the patient. The patient was referred to the Sahlgrenska University Hospital and arrived at the Department of Plastic Surgery 90 min after the trauma. The amputate, measuring 4.5 \u00d7 3 cm, had been kept in a hypothermic state (). Emergency replantation surgery was initiated. Peroperatively, a 1 mm superior labial artery was identified laterally on the amputate and was microsurgically anastomosed to the proximal stump of the superior labial artery using 10\u20130 S and T sutures. The ischemia time was approximately 4 h and 45 min. Even after reperfusion, no veins suitable for anastomosis could be identified. One nerve was identified, but it was to damage to repair. The lip was sutured in three layers: the mucosa, the orbicularis oris muscle, and finally, the skin, which was loosely sutured to allow bleeding and lessen the risk of hematoma. The lip rapidly turned blue as a sign of venous congestion. A leech (Hirudo medicinalis) was applied to the lip in order to achieve venous drainage and it immediately regained adequate skin color and became less swollen (). The lower lip was also sutured in three layers and was adequately vascularized through the right inferior labial artery during the whole procedure. During first night, leeches were applied every 45 min, and thereafter, the interval was extended, guided by the color of the lip; day 2 every 90 min, day 3\u20135 every 2 h, day 6\u2013",
