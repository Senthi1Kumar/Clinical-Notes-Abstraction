The deformity occurred following a fall from 10 feet height when he sustained an injury of his right forearm. He was initially managed by an osteopath with cleaning, dressing and splint immobilization. No radiographic documentation was carried out at that time. The pain subsided and splint was taken out after 6 weeks. His parents noticed a deformity of the forearm at this time, but did not pursue any further treatment. As the deformity gradually worsened, the child was taken to medical center 4 months after the injury where he was evaluated with radiographs and treated with distal ulnar shortening to correct the forearm deformity []. After 6 weeks of immobilization the child resumed regular activities. He noticed further progression of deformity with pain and difficulty while writing. At this point, he came to our center 1 year after the initial injury. The history was suggestive of punctured wound over the volar aspect on the ulnar side just proximal to the wrist crease, which healed uneventfully with regular dressings.

She had a history of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma, diagnosed 7 months prior to admission, at an outside hospital. The patient was healthy otherwise and reported no radiation exposure or any family history of thyroid cancer. The initial work-up at the time of discovery of the right thyroid nodule included fine needle aspiration and core biopsy, with findings consistent with poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The patient then underwent a total thyroidectomy and central neck lymph node dissection. The pathologic diagnosis from the outside hospital reported a 2.8 \u00d7 2.4 \u00d7 1.1 cm tumor in the right thyroid without extrathyroidal extension or lymph node metastasis. However, both capsular invasion and extensive vascular space invasion were noted. Based on the tumor size, tumor extension and lymph node status, the tumor was designated as Stage II (pT2 pN0 pMx). IHC staining showed that the tumor cells were positive for thyroglobulin and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1). An immunostain for p53 was also performed at the outside hospital and showed a small focus (< 1 cm) with p53 positivity, suggesting a diagnosis of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.\nAt our institution, the diagnosis was revised, based on review of both the primary thyroid tumor and the current lung metastases. Both tumors were remarkable for biphasic malignant components: the carcinoma and the sarcoma. The carcinoma component showed a poorly differentiated microfollicular type thyroid carcinoma, composed of sheets and islands of tightly packed thyroid follicles with dense colloid. The tumor nuclei were small and round with vesicular chromatin, resembling those of typical poorly differentiated follicular thyroid carcinoma. Admixed with the epithelial component were malignant spindle cells with small round blue cell type morphology. Focally, rhabdomyosarcoma-like cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm were appreciated. No heterologous cartilage or bone components were identified. The IHC staining performed at the outside hospital showed that the thyroid carcinoma (epithelial) component was positive for thyroglobulin, PAX8 and TTF1 (Fig. ). The sarcoma",

He first noticed significant weakness when he was in the 10th grade. He had gone hunting and had maintained a squatting position for a prolonged period of time (around 45 minutes). When he woke up the next morning, his legs were extremely weak with no associated pain. The weakness was apparently isolated to his legs. During the first workup, his creatine kinase (CK) level was elevated to approximately 600 units per liter (U/L). Over the following month, he slowly regained 75 percent of his prior strength. He denied having back pain and had normal bowel and bladder functions. Shortly after the event, he underwent a neurological assessment. He had two normal lower limb nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyographies (EMGs), as well as normal repetitive nerve stimulation. A muscle biopsy taken from the thigh muscle was within normal limits. His CK levels ranged from 600-900 U/L. His weakness remained fairly stable after the initial episode. Four months after the first episode, he went to the beach. He had another episode of weakness during that trip. He did not describe any specific triggers such as hot or cold exposure or specific foods such as carbohydrate ingestion. Between the ages of 14 and 20, he experienced periodic lower limb weakness about once a month. Then he had fewer and fewer episodes until age 28 (2018). Between April of 2018 and October of 2018, he experienced more paralytic episodes, and he did not experience full recovery between those episodes. He had significant weakness for a few days. Then, his strength gradually improved, but he did not return to full strength.

She first experienced a right sided subtrochanteric fracture following a low trauma injury at the age of 20 years (), for which she underwent internal fixation. Thereafter, she experienced a left intertrochanteric femur fracture at the age of 22 years, 2 months prior to the current presentation.\nShe had an interesting past medical history. She was diagnosed to have a left side nephroblastoma at the age of 8 years, for which she underwent left side radical nephrectomy followed by chemotherapy. Thereafter, at the age of 14 years, she developed a right sided facial swelling and was found to have a maxillary tumor which was described during the surgery as a well-circumscribed mass lesion in the left maxilla, eroding the anterior wall of maxilla and lateral nasal wall. She underwent partial maxillectomy for this, and histology revealed features suggestive of fibrous dysplasia.\nShe did not have a history of chronic steroid use, hypogonadism, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and exposure to cigarette smoking to suggest secondary causes for osteoporosis. She had neither any features of malabsorption nor inadequate exposure to sunlight to suggest a vitamin D deficiency causing these fractures. The histology of bone biopsies was negative for metastatic deposits.\nShe did not have a family history of hyperparathyroidism, renal, or uterine tumors. There was no past history or family history suggestive of MEN 1. Her general and systemic examinations were normal apart from the healing fracture sites.\nHer investigation findings are summarized in .\nHer investigations revealed high total calcium and urinary calcium excretion, with low serum phosphate level.

She reported an episode with profuse spontaneous bleeding located at the palatal gingiva in the maxilla between the left central and lateral incisor. The patient had no other known medical or oral conditions except for breast cancer, which was treated with 12 weekly infusions of paclitaxel and trastuzumab (T-T) every three weeks prior to her scheduled mastectomy. Her last infusion of T-T was six days prior to the incidence of the intraoral bleeding. The patient reported spontaneous bleeding from her mouth as she was getting dressed in the morning, which occurred before brushing her teeth or receiving any oral stimulus that may cause gingival bleeding, and became very concerned as the bleeding was profuse and difficult to control. A complete clinical oral examination was performed by a periodontist within an hour of the bleeding incident. The probing depths of teeth adjacent to the bleeding site were within normal limits, ranging from 2 to 3 mm, and no visible plaque was detected. A periapical intraoral radiograph from the anterior maxillary area revealed no signs of bone loss or other signs of pathology (, , and ). The patient has no previous history of periodontal disease, no trauma to the area and no para-functional habits, excellent oral hygiene, and there was no evidence of increased pocket probing depths or gingival inflammation or infection noted. There were neither reports of pain nor discomfort. The patient reported previous episodes of minor epistaxis that started after initiating treatment with the PT regimen, but no prior history of gingival bleeding.

    "original_text": "A 37-year-old woman referred to our clinic with complaints of neck swelling since the past 2 years, which was tender and had infectious secretions after a few months. This problem was first seen only during eating and got slightly better with traditional herbal remedies. After a year, previous treatments did not work, and the patient was annoyed by a permanent pain. In clinical examinations, a solid swelling was observed in the right lateral region of the neck under the jaw angle, and regional lymphadenopathy was evident (Figure ). Suppuration secretion was not clearly visible in the mouth. A stiff and painful swelling was seen in the mouth near the Wharton duct (Figure ). After taking panoramic view, sialadenitis was diagnosed to have occurred due to sialolith in the right submandibular gland (Figure ). Regarding the chronicity of sialadenitis and the history of infectious secretions in the submandibular gland, the selective treatment was removal of the gland by surgery. However, to prevent possible injuries such as damage to the marginal mandibular nerve and skin scar after healing, it was preferred to use a more conservative treatment. The risk of recurrence of the lesion was explained to the patient. Due to the presence of stones above the mylohyoid muscle, it was decided to remove it by intraoral approach. After initial medical evaluations, the patient was placed under general anesthesia and stone was removed through a longitudinal cut along the duct of the salivary glands. Our goal was to cannulation the salivary gland duct, which was done using a pink peripheral venous catheter with an external diameter of 1/1 and an internal diameter of 0/8 (Figure ).

    "cleaned_text": "a 37-year-old woman referred to our clinic with complaints of neck swelling since the past 2 years, which was tender and had infectious secretions after a few months. this problem was first seen only during eating and got slightly better with traditional herbal remedies. after a year, previous treatments did not work, and the patient was annoyed by a permanent pain. in clinical examinations, a solid swelling was observed in the right lateral region of the neck under the jaw angle, and regional lymphadenopathy was evident (figure ). suppuration secretion was not clearly visible in the mouth. a stiff and painful swelling was seen in the mouth near the wharton duct (figure ). after taking panoramic view, sialadenitis was diagnosed to have occurred due to sialolith in the right submandibular gland (figure ). regarding the chronicity of sialadenitis and the history of infectious secretions in the submandibular gland, the selective treatment was removal of the gland by surgery. however, to prevent possible injuries such as damage to the marginal mandibular nerve and skin scar after healing, it was preferred to use a more conservative treatment. the risk of recurrence of the lesion was explained to the patient. due to the presence of stones above the mylohyoid muscle, it was decided to remove it by intraoral approach. after initial medical evaluations, the patient was placed under general anesthesia and stone was removed through a longitudinal cut along the duct of the salivary glands. our goal was to cannulation the salivary gland duct, which was done using a pink peripheral venous catheter with an external diameter of 1/1 and an internal diameter of 0/8 (figure ). first, the catheter was placed into the wharton duct by a needle. then, the needle was removed and the catheter remained in the duct. several back and forth movements were performed in the direction of the duct to remove the obstruction, and the orifice of wharton was sutured to the floor of the mouth.",

At the time of consultation this man was an inpatient in a mental health facility. He was admitted following a second episode of psychosis, with auditory hallucinations and some atypical features (a body dysmorphic delusion). Motor examination was normal except for mildly impaired eye movements. He was on a moderate dose of atypical anti-psychotic medication but his neurologic examination was reported to be normal prior to initiating medication. He was somewhat reluctant during neuropsychological examination and performed poorly in a range of measures, over a broader range of cognitive domains than one would expect for a typical, early, HD patient.

This illustrates some of the difficulties in incorporating psychiatric symptoms into the diagnosis of clinical HD. Since these psychotic episodes occurred in his early twenties, they could potentially be due to schizophrenia rather than HD.

    "original_text": "An 11-year-old African American boy presented to the emergency department at our institution for an injury to his left knee which he sustained during basketball. He sustained the injury when trying to take off to shoot the basketball. Physical examination and radiographic evaluation confirmed a displaced tibial tuberosity fracture (). Based on Ogden classification, the fracture pattern was Type III B [].\nThe patient was taken to the operating room within 12 hours of his presentation, and open reduction and internal fixation of the tibial tuberosity fracture were performed using two 4.0 mm cannulated screws (). Postoperatively, an above-knee cast was applied for 4 weeks. Following cast removal, he started physical therapy for about 6 weeks for range of motion exercises and strengthening of his leg. The fracture healed uneventfully, and 6 months later, he was discharged to full activities without restrictions, with advice to follow up if needed.\nThree years later, he presented to our clinic with a progressive deformity and anterior knee pain, which was limiting his ability to play football, basketball, and skateboarding. Physical examination in standing and supine position revealed 30 degrees of hyperextension of the left knee compared to 5 degrees of hyperextension of the knee on the right side (). He had tenderness to palpation around the tibial tuberosity. Evaluation of the lateral radiograph revealed closure of the anterior aspect of proximal tibial physis and tibial tuberosity physis with hardware in situ.

    "original_text": "A 76 year old woman with a history of left flank bulge for 6 months presented with left-sided back pain in the same area for two months. She had no previous surgery or trauma in that area. On physical examination she had a 6 \u00d7 5 cm reducible bulge at the posterolateral part of left flank below the 12th rib. A CT scan showed herniation of retroperitoneal fat and descending colon through the fascial defect at the left superior lumbar triangle (). We planned the laparoscopic TEP approach for herniorrhaphy of this superior lumbar hernia, Grynfeltt hernia.\nUnder the general anesthesia the patient was placed in a full right lateral decubitus position with a lumbar roll in place. A 2 cm transverse incision was made over the hernia defect of the already reduced hernia which was below the 12th rib along the mid axillary line. The retroperitoneal fat was detached first with blunt dissection by an index finger and then with smooth instrument to create space in the retroperitoneal cavity. An 11 mm trocar was inserted and the space was expanded by a balloon dissector (Tyco Healthcare, Norwalk, CT, USA). Under the direct visualization with a 30\u00b0 10 mm scope, three 5 mm trocars were inserted anteriorly along the anterior axillary line approximately 5 cm apart (). Then, the 11 mm trocar was removed and the wound was plugged with gauze to maintain the pneumoretroperitoneum.

    "original_text": "A 33 year old male patient presented with complaints of pain in the anteromedial aspect of the right knee. The pain had been ongoing for the last 4 years, but increased in severity for the last 8 months. The pain was exacerbated by movement of the knee joint, particularly when getting up from a chair and climbing or descending stairs. The patient described hypersensitivity in the infrapatellar region and was unable to wear tight fitting trousers, as even the slightest touch aggravated the pain. The patient was otherwise fit and well, with no history of trauma or surgery to the knee. Physical examination revealed a positive Tinel's sign on the medial aspect of the right knee, approximately 6 cm proximal to the joint line. Pressure over this area reproduced the patient's pain, which he described as \u201cshooting\u201d in nature.\nRadiographs of the knee joint revealed no bone abnormality. A magnetic resonance scan revealed early degenerative changes within the posterior horn of medial meniscus and a Grade I injury of the medial collateral ligament. The patient was started on a course of physiotherapy and analgesics, but these measures failed to relieve the pain. In view of the specific point tenderness on examination, we considered nerve entrapment or neuroma a possibility and, therefore, decided to explore this area.\nAt surgery, the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve was found traversing the sartorius muscle at the site of maximum tenderness and making a tight angle on its way to the skin of the infrapatellar area [Figures and ]. We identified this as the likely cause of pain and partially divided the sartorius muscle in order to free the nerve, so that it lay in a straight line course without any tension or points of compression [].

    "original_text": "An 85-year-old Caucasian male was admitted after sudden onset of expressive aphasia and weakness in both legs lasting 20 seconds. He was athletic, self-reliant and had no cognitive impairment. During the last 28 years, he had experienced 8-10 heterogeneous episodes of acute neurological symptoms, such as central facial palsy, hemiparesis, and non-fluent aphasia, lasting from seconds to 3-4 hours. Precerebral duplex and electrocardiography (ECG) were performed several times with normal results, and EEG registration and 24-hour Holter monitoring had been normal. Previous MRI scans showed no abnormal restricted diffusion, as seen in acute cerebral infarcts, but infarct sequelae in the left temporal lobe and both thalami. Several years later, three additional infarct sequelae were detected in the cerebellum. The patient was treated with platelet inhibitors, and medications and dosages were adjusted after new episodes. There was no suspicion of lack of compliance. Except from age, migraine, and previous smoking, with cessation 35 years ago, he had no known risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. On the current admission, he presented with reduced motor speed in his left arm and leg. Electrocardiography and Holter monitoring showed no signs of atrial fibrillation. CT and MRI revealed multiple, cortical infarct sequelae in the anterior and posterior circulation territories of both hemispheres, and MRI also detected two acute embolic infarcts in the right occipital lobe and one in the left parietal lobe (Figure ).

    "original_text": "A 56-year-old previously healthy female presented with spontaneous vertigo that had first appeared more than 2 weeks earlier. She had experienced left-sided facial palsy 2 months previously. A bedside examination showed spontaneous right-beating nystagmus that became stronger during rightward gaze or in darkness without visual fixation, and positive rightward head-impulse signs indicative of acute left vestibulopathy, in addition to preexisting complete left facial palsy. The initial MRIs revealed segmental enhancement in the left facial and vestibular nerves at the distal auditory canal (). The findings of serological and CSF evaluations for infectious and autoimmune disorders were normal.\nThe patient was diagnosed with an inflammatory disorder of uncertain origin that involved the left internal auditory canal. She initially took oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg for 7 days. The dosage was then rapidly reduced over the following 4 weeks due to excessive weight gain, formation of a moon face, nervousness, and stomach irritation. The spontaneous nystagmus disappeared, but she still suffered from fluctuating dizziness. Follow-up MRIs obtained 4 months after the onset showed stable lesions in the left auditory canal and newly developed contrast-enhanced lesions in the left olfactory groove and right high-cervical lymph node (). The findings of the second evaluations for autoimmune and infectious disorders were also normal, and a histopathological evaluation performed at the right neck lymph node revealed chronic granulomatous inflammation without evidence of tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, or malignancy such as lymphoma ().\nThe patient was finally diagnosed with cranial IIP and started on azathioprine with short-term prednisolone. Her symptoms remained stable while taking azathioprine, and a second follow-up MRI obtained at 7 months after the onset showed mild improvement of lesions involving the left olfactory groove and internal auditory canal ().

There was a firm, nontender mass palpable in the floor of left orbit just below the inferior orbital margin. The swelling measured about 4 cm in diameter with the surface appearing normal []. Visual acuity, visual field, and eyeball movements were normal. There was no regional lymphadenopathy. A small nasal polyp was noted on the left nasal cavity. Palpation revealed it to be tender and soft.\nThe intraoral inspection revealed her oral hygiene to be poor. Malaligned dentition with calculus debris and mobility was seen. There was an intraoral swelling seen at the palatal region measuring about 5 cm in diameter extending from 24 to maxillary tuberosity region. On palpation, it revealed to be tender and hard to firm [].\nOcclusal radiograph and orthopantomogram revealed the presence of minute radiopaque structures resembling calcifications in an ill-defined hazy radiopacity in the left maxillary sinus suggestive of the residues of the eroded bone [Figures , and ].

A computerised tomography (CT) colonography was performed and excluded any colonic pathology but did identify that the common bile duct was mildly dilated with a diameter of 8 mm, although no clear cause was found. Some reactive celiac lymph nodes were also seen and so the patient underwent an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) scan to exclude a malignancy.

Since the tumor and abdominal lymphadenopathy were the only manifestation of sarcoidosis and no other signs of organ involvement were present, he received no immunosuppressive treatment. The abdominal lymphadenopathy had been stable over time. Nine years before presentation, he was referred to our nephrology clinic to determine the cause of chronic kidney disease. His serum creatinine level was 1.2 mg/dL and he had proteinuria of 0.4 g per day. Hematuria was not present. Renal biopsy revealed six globally sclerotic glomeruli among all 34 glomeruli (18%) and some residual glomeruli with segmental sclerosing lesions, but no involvement of sarcoidosis. He was diagnosed with primary FSGS. Since the proteinuria was mild, he did not receive immunosuppressive treatment.\nOne year after that, the patient experienced palpitations and was diagnosed with complete atrioventricular block. Coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis of the coronary arteries, and he underwent pacemaker implantation.

No obvious wounds were evident on physical examination. Laboratory data showed mild elevation of D-dimer (2.7 \u00b5g/mL), but other parameters were almost within normal limits. Despite stable vital signs and no signs of chest injury, the physician decided to conduct computed tomography (CT) of the head and chest without contrast, based on the history of chest trauma and the unexplained symptom of nausea. No abnormalities were seen on head CT, but massive pericardial effusion was demonstrated on CT of the chest and dissection was suspected in the ascending aorta (). Aortic dissection was considered as a cause of pericardial effusion. The patient was transferred to our institute for further evaluation. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed an aortic dissection localized at the ascending aorta with massive pericardial effusion (). A three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of preoperative CT demonstrated dissected and dilated ascending aorta with a maximal diameter of 44 mm ().

However, MTX-associated nausea and fatigue led to discontinuation of MTX after 6 months of treatment. Instead, sulfonylurea had been added to VBL, but again, nausea limited the applicability of this combination and treatment was provided as single agent sulfonylurea.\nTwo years after the initial resection, a symptomatic tumor recurrence was detected while receiving medical treatment. Local recurrence involved the right brachial plexus, which was incompletely resected for the purpose of function preservation.\nSystemic therapy was reconvened with MTX and vinorelbine, which achieved symptomatic improvement of pain with disease stabilization as best response on MRI. However, the treatment was not sustainable because of grade 1 nausea and fatigue and led to treatment discontinuation after 4 months.\nWithin 4 months, the patient complained of recurrence of grade 1 tumor pain and the MRI showed gradual tumor growth. At this time, radiotherapy was not considered appropriate given the young age and the proximity to the plexus nerves, instead medical treatment was discussed with the patient. Re-challenge with chemotherapy was not preferred by the patient, and an individual approach to medical treatment was sought. Based on the hyperperfusion of the patient\u2019s tumor and the promising results of sorafenib in DF, we implied future treatment with bevacizumab 15 mg/kg q3wks., given the excellent tolerability profile of this agent.\nDuring the course of treatment, tumor pain disappeared and the patient experienced functional improvement.

The patient was a snake charmer by occupation. The patient had a history of alcohol addiction for 15 years and had a history of repeated failed attempts to quit alcohol addiction in the past. On examination, pulse was 88 beats per minute, regular in rhythm and volume, having no special character, blood pressure was 120/70 mm of Hg and there were no signs of any bleeding tendencies. The patient was conscious and irritable, deep tendon reflexes were normal, bilateral plantar were flexor and there was no neuro deficit.\nThe abdomen was soft and non-tender, heart sounds were normal, the chest was bilaterally clear.\nThe patient\u2019s whole blood clotting time was normal, random blood sugar was 80 mg/dl and the rest of the laboratory investigations including complete blood count, renal function test and liver function test were within normal limits. Upon providing injectable thiamine and 25% dextrose 100 ml, the patient improved clinically and became conscious and oriented. The patient then provided a history of snake venom addiction which began four months back, when he got divorced from his wife. It started as an addiction to snake bites which provided him the high sensation that he was using as an alternative to alcohol to reduce his alcohol consumption.

Soon after, her bleeding ceased spontaneously, and she was admitted to the internal medicine service for further workup.\nOnce admitted, the patient underwent urgent endoscopic investigations which revealed scarring of esophageal varices that had been previously treated with sclerotherapy.

Shortly after, the patient experienced another episode of substantial hemorrhage through her ostomy and underwent emergent coil embolization to several branches of her stomal varices, achieving temporary hemostasis.\nThe patient experienced two recurrent episodes of major bleed in the days following embolization that required urgent transfusions before spontaneous hemostasis. Throughout her admission, the patient was assessed and closely followed by our general surgery team.

Since the tumor and abdominal lymphadenopathy were the only manifestation of sarcoidosis and no other signs of organ involvement were present, he received no immunosuppressive treatment. The abdominal lymphadenopathy had been stable over time. Nine years before presentation, he was referred to our nephrology clinic to determine the cause of chronic kidney disease. His serum creatinine level was 1.2 mg/dL and he had proteinuria of 0.4 g per day. Hematuria was not present.

He was diagnosed with primary FSGS. Since the proteinuria was mild, he did not receive immunosuppressive treatment.\nOne year after that, the patient experienced palpitations and was diagnosed with complete atrioventricular block. Coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis of the coronary arteries, and he underwent pacemaker implantation. Whether sarcoidosis contributed to the complete atrioventricular block was unclear. The abdominal lymphadenopathy and the dyskinesia of the ventricular septum were stable and did not progress over time.\nThe patient was stable for eight years, until when he started to suffer from sporadic gait and right face numbness that occurred and resolved within a day every few weeks.

Since the tumor and abdominal lymphadenopathy were the only manifestation of sarcoidosis and no other signs of organ involvement were present, he received no immunosuppressive treatment. The abdominal lymphadenopathy had been stable over time. Nine years before presentation, he was referred to our nephrology clinic to determine the cause of chronic kidney disease. His serum creatinine level was 1.2 mg/dL and he had proteinuria of 0.4 g per day. Hematuria was not present. Renal biopsy revealed six globally sclerotic glomeruli among all 34 glomeruli (18%) and some residual glomeruli with segmental sclerosing lesions, but no involvement of sarcoidosis. He was diagnosed with primary FSGS. Since the proteinuria was mild, he did not receive immunosuppressive treatment.\nOne year after that, the patient experienced palpitations and was diagnosed with complete atrioventricular block. Coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis of the coronary arteries, and he underwent pacemaker implantation. Whether sarcoidosis contributed to the complete atrioventricular block was unclear. The abdominal lymphadenopathy and the dyskinesia of the ventricular septum were stable and did not progress over time.\nThe patient was stable for eight years, until when he started to suffer from sporadic gait and right face numbness that occurred and resolved within a day every few weeks.

She had a history of chronic LBP and lumbar radicular pain on both sides since 2015. Over the last year, she had been pharmacologically treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. Her medical history included hypertension and an old cerebrovascular accident, for which she was taking ginko.\nShe had recently complained of severe back pain and radicular symptoms around the distribution of the L5 nerve root. Neurological examination results were normal with a bilateral motor strength of 5/5 in the lower extremities. Her blood tests were all in normal ranges. She agreed to stop taking ginko during her visit for treatment. She laid prone and a pillow was placed under her lower abdomen. The TFESI was performed under fluoroscopic guidance, with a 22-G Tuohy epidural needle at both intervertebral foramen between the L5 and S1 levels. After penetrating the skin, there was no evidence of intravascular uptake or intrathecal distribution. We injected 3 ml of contrast on both sides, but the anterior spreading did not work well, so we decided to inject another contrast to check anterior spreading. As soon as the contrast was injected to the left, she complained of extreme pain and the fluoroscopy image showed the contrast spreading well. The lateral view showed the contrast to be anterior spreading ().\nDuring recovery, she continuously complained of pain and an inability to move. For pain relief, 25 mg of intravenous pethidine was administered, but the pain did not improve.

    "cleaned_text": "an 86-year-old female was diagnosed with moderate spinal stenosis in the l2-l5 lumbar spine region. she had a history of chronic lbp and lumbar radicular pain on both sides since 2015. over the last year, she had been pharmacologically treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. her medical history included hypertension and an old cerebrovascular accident, for which she was taking ginko.\nshe had recently complained of severe back pain and radicular symptoms around the distribution of the l5 nerve root. neurological examination results were normal with a bilateral motor strength of 5/5 in the lower extremities. her blood tests were all in normal ranges. she agreed to stop taking ginko during her visit for treatment. she laid prone and a pillow was placed under her lower abdomen. the tfesi was performed under fluoroscopic guidance, with a 22-g tuohy epidural needle at both intervertebral foramen between the l5 and s1 levels. after penetrating the skin, there was no evidence of intravascular uptake or intrathecal distribution. we injected 3 ml of contrast on both sides, but the anterior spreading did not work well, so we decided to inject another contrast to check anterior spreading. as soon as the contrast was injected to the left, she complained of extreme pain and the fluoroscopy image showed the contrast spreading well. the lateral view showed the contrast to be anterior spreading ().\nduring recovery, she continuously complained of pain and an inability to move. for pain relief, 25 mg of intravenous pethidine was administered, but the pain did not improve. an mri scan was performed within three hours which revealed a large amount of epidural and subdural hematoma at the lower t-l spines and sacrum with cord compression at the t spine ().\nphysical examination showed that lower extremity motor function was a grade 5/5 and anal sphincter tone was normal. under fluoroscopy-guided, the procedure was performed with the patient in a prone position with an 18-g tuohy needle inserted at the",
