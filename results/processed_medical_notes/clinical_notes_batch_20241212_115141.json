When she was 24 years old, the first episode of macroscopic hematuria and proteinuria (1.0 g/g Cr) occurred just 1 day after tonsillitis with a high fever. After treatment with antibiotics, all symptoms disappeared except for microscopic hematuria. Because such episodes recurred several times and there was continued microscopic hematuria without proteinuria, the patient underwent tonsillectomy when she was 26 years old. However, even after tonsillectomy, microscopic hematuria persisted, and she repeatedly had episodes of macroscopic hematuria and proteinuria following pharyngitis with a high fever. She had a renal biopsy under real-time ultrasonographic guidance with a 16-gauge automated biopsy device and was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy. The histology showed crescent formations in 2 out of 16 glomeruli, but she refused steroid therapy. Before being discharged from our hospital, evidence of only slight renal subcapsular bleeding in the left kidney could be found on routine ultrasonography. Three months after the renal biopsy, she had sudden macroscopic hematuria without any symptoms, which lasted for 3 days. After that, the macroscopic hematuria disappeared but the amount of microscopic hematuria was clearly increased as compared to before her renal biopsy. In the urinary sediment, red blood casts were always present and comprised of 20\u201340% dysmorphic red blood cells. Since an enlarged left renal pelvis was newly recognized on ultrasonography, enhanced computed tomography (CT) was performed and she was diagnosed with an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in the lower pole of her left kidney (fig. ).

These complaints started around 4 months back, when his father was looking for a bride. Prior to this, he reported never having had sexual ideas and his friends tried to give him advice on how to show sexual prowess to a woman on her first night. That night when he went to sleep he felt some shadow crawling over his body and he had spontaneous ejaculation. This was first time such thing had happened to him. His father reassured him that night. Next two nights also he had spontaneous ejaculation at night and this terrified the patient that all his semen may have drained out and consequently, his ability to impregnate a woman and his energy to carry out physical work had been depleted significantly. His friends had advised him to masturbate and told him to continue the technique to get semen out at least once a month. To his dismay, he found that he was unable to do as there was \u2018no rigidity\u2019 in the penis. When questioned about the nature and importance of semen, he said that semen is important for producing children and having a family but added that he had no idea where it came from. He consulted a Siddha practitioner for his problems and was told that if semen was not coming out through its proper channel, it would fill other body fluids and also come out in the saliva. That doctor took sample of saliva in small bottles and told the patient that after testing he had come to the conclusion that they are containing sperms.

There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion.

To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily.

Indeed, in 2008, the patient was operated on by a fully endoscopic neuronavigation-guided EEA [, , , , , , , , , , ]. Thanks to the working angle and the better visualization offered by the EEA, we were able to maximize the tumor resection preserving at the same time craniovertebral junction stability and avoiding posterior fixation with his relative complications [, , , , , , , , ]. Indeed, the lesion was completely removed, but during the drilling of the surrounding healthy bone, there was a little tearing of the left ICA. Local control of the bleeding was challenging, but it was obtained by using topic hemostatic agents and balloon catheter for nasal tamponade. Immediately after surgery, the patient underwent angiography disclosing a pseudoaneurysm originating near the inferior meningohypophyseal trunk, which was successfully treated by embolization with coils (Fig. ). After 2 days of intensive care unit stay, the patient was transferred to our department, showing no neurological deficit and no signs of CSF leak or other CSF disturbances [, , ]. The nasal tamponade was removed 4 days after surgery, and no bleeding was observed coming out from the nasal cavity. The patient was dismissed and sent home 1 week later. Histologic evaluation of surgical specimens revealed the aspect of a giant cell tumor with no infiltration of the surrounding bone [].\nRadiation therapy was not performed.

The patient was anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin during the procedure. The intervention went uneventfully and the arteriotomy site was closed with an Angio-Seal vascular closure device. The patient recovered well and was discharged after 2 days and was commenced on dual antiplatelet therapy.\nOne week following his cardiac intervention, he was noted to have a pulsatile mass in his right groin with an associated bruit. He underwent a Duplex arterial ultrasound scan, which showed a bilobed pseudoaneurysm (superficial aneurysm measures 20 mm in transverse diameter with a shallow neck 0.8 mm; deep aneurysm measures 12 mm in transverse diameter which extends off a 6 mm neck) arising just lateral to the femoral artery puncture site [].\nHe went on to have an ultrasound-guided percutaneous injection of the pseudoaneurysm with thrombin. The procedure proved to be extremely challenging due to rapid blood flow and the wide pseudoaneurysm neck (6 mm). Following 10 min of direct sonographic probe pressure, complete occlusion of the superficial pseudoaneurysm was observed but a small residual fleck of flow on power Doppler was evident to suggest an incomplete occlusion of the deep component of the pseudoaneurysm []. This was confirmed on repeat Duplex ultrasound scan the following day [].\nThe patient refused surgical repair and was offered a novel approach using an Angio-Seal vascular closure device. Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the \u201coff-label\u201d use of this device.

The problem severely impacted his lifestyle and mobility due to impaired sitting ability. The problem bothered the patient so that he would request an amputation if the position of the knee joint could not be corrected.\nOn physical examination, the knees had no passive movement and both ankles were fixed in equinus position (Figure ). A burn scar was seen on the lateral aspect of the right knee. Distal posterior tibialis and dorsalis pedis pulses were palpated and were symmetric. On neurologic examination there were no voluntary contraction in his spastic lower limbs and complete sensory deficit was evident.

In the past he was operated due to perforated gastric ulcer. He also had arterial hypertension, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease and pulmonary hypertension, a history of smoking, he suffered an ishemic stroke in the past. He was urgently operated on the same day. Segmental resection of small bowel with end-to-end anastomosis was performed and the hernia defect was closed with direct sutures, without prosthetic mesh because the bowel was resected. There were no surgical or other complications after surgery and he was discharged from hospital after 8 days. 5 days later he was admitted to the hospital again due to early recurrence of ventral hernia. The content in hernia sac could however be reduced back to his abdomen. Laboratory findings showed leucocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP - 148 mg/l). Intestinal winding with a thickened wall up to 5 mm was found at the location of the ventral hernia by ultrasound examination.

Her mother noted two previous surgeries on that area performed at a county hospital. The first one, eight years ago, was performed due to right thigh swelling and fluctuance. These symptoms were initially suspected to be caused by pyomyositis of the vastus lateralis. A small longitudinal incision on the lateral side of the thigh was done and a purulent cyst was evacuated. Samples were sent for microbiological, cytological, and pathological examination. The laboratory reports were not evaluated properly by the treating surgeon, and the girl was discharged from the hospital with recommendations for oral antibiotics to treat pyomyositis. A month after the operation, purulent wound drainage appeared. The child was continued to treated with oral antibiotics and underwent frequent dressing changes, until complete wound closure was achieved. However, 10 months later, swelling, pain and purulent drainage reappeared at the place of the initial incision. The patient underwent repeated surgical incision and evacuation of what was considered to be a recurrent subfascial abscess. After surgery, the patient was instructed to continue with antibiotics and to dressing changes while waiting for wound closure. Unfortunately, her wound was not completely closed. For the next seven years, she suffered from monthly purulent drainage accompanied by moderate swelling and dull thigh pain that was most intense a few days before the appearance of drainage. During that period, there were no complaints about fever or malaise.\nPhysical examination and initial considerations\nSeven years after the second surgery, physical examination performed at our institution showed a chronic wound on the lateral right thigh with mild drainage and local erythema. Palpation was slightly painful; however, there was full, painless range of motion of the hip and knee. A swab was taken for microbiological examination and an initial laboratory work-up was done.

She was previously well with no known medical, surgical or genetic problem. On physical examination, the patient had a congested facial appearance, with a large hard fixed anterior neck mass. She was ambulating well with neither features of respiratory compromise nor signs and symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Initial differentials include a large multinodular goiter or thyroid malignancy. Chest radiography showed a widened mediastinum. In view of the large nature of the mass, we opted for a computed tomography (CT) of the neck and thorax instead of an ultrasound neck, as the CT scan would be able to delineate the anatomy of the mass in relation to its surrounding structures. The CT thorax showed a huge anterior mediastinal tumour with mass effect to the surrounding structures associated with multiple cervical and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (). The thyroid, however, is grossly normal on the CT scan. The differential diagnosis has subsequently shifted to primary mediastinal lymphoma. A core biopsy of the neck mass was taken under ultrasonography guidance and histopathological examination showed nests of tumour cells, scant cytoplasm and salt and pepper chromatin. The tumour cells were diffusely positive for synaptophysin, chromogranin and the Ki-67 proliferative index is 50%. These constellations of finding were suggestive of high-grade small cell NETs.\nAs her tumour was unresectable, she was referred to our oncology team for chemotherapy. She had first completed 6 cycles of Etoposide and Cisplatin. However, the response was poor and she subsequently underwent a further 3 cycles of Irinotecan and Carboplatin.

    "cleaned_text": "a 26-year-old female presented to the breast & endocrine clinic after being referred from a district hospital with an increasing anterior neck swelling over a period of 6 months with symptoms of superior vena cava syndrome. she was previously well with no known medical, surgical or genetic problem. on physical examination, the patient had a congested facial appearance, with a large hard fixed anterior neck mass. she was ambulating well with neither features of respiratory compromise nor signs and symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. initial differentials include a large multinodular goiter or thyroid malignancy. chest radiography showed a widened mediastinum. in view of the large nature of the mass, we opted for a computed tomography (ct) of the neck and thorax instead of an ultrasound neck, as the ct scan would be able to delineate the anatomy of the mass in relation to its surrounding structures. the ct thorax showed a huge anterior mediastinal tumour with mass effect to the surrounding structures associated with multiple cervical and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (). the thyroid, however, is grossly normal on the ct scan. the differential diagnosis has subsequently shifted to primary mediastinal lymphoma. a core biopsy of the neck mass was taken under ultrasonography guidance and histopathological examination showed nests of tumour cells, scant cytoplasm and salt and pepper chromatin. the tumour cells were diffusely positive for synaptophysin, chromogranin and the ki-67 proliferative index is 50%. these constellations of finding were suggestive of high-grade small cell nets.\nas her tumour was unresectable, she was referred to our oncology team for chemotherapy. she had first completed 6 cycles of etoposide and cisplatin. however, the response was poor and she subsequently underwent a further 3 cycles of irinotecan and carboplatin. follow up ct showed stable disease initially, but had turned into a disease progression a few months later. she subsequently underwent radiotherapy to the neck and mediastinum with a total of 30 gy in 10 fractions.\nrestaging ct scan showed enlarging anterior mediastinal mass with multiple new",

On arrival, his GCS was 3, and he was being ventilated via bag valve mask by EMS. He was promptly intubated for airway protection. His vital signs were stable. On further exposure, he had an approximately 3 cm stab wound to his left anterior chest, medial to the nipple line, at approximately the level of the 7th rib. Otherwise, he was noted to have ecchymosis of the occiput and superficial lacerations to his right flank. Also concerning was a fixed and dilated left pupil. A pan CT scan revealed a left subdural hematoma with bilateral frontal hemorrhagic contusions and 5 mm of midline shift. Additionally, he was found to have a moderate left-sided pneumothorax and associated left anterior 7th rib fracture for which he underwent chest tube placement with resolution of his pneumothorax (). A cerebral oxygenation monitor and drainage device was placed by neurosurgery revealing an elevated opening pressure of 31 mmHg. At this time, there was also concern for possible diaphragmatic injury given the location of his stab wound and imaging findings; however, in the setting of his elevated intracranial pressures, he was deemed unsafe for the OR and admitted to the neuro ICU for further monitoring.\nOn hospital day 0, his routine workup included a negative COVID-19 nucleic amplification assay. His intracranial pressure was controlled using mannitol and hypertonic saline bullets while he was started on levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis. Repeat CT imaging the following day showed stability in his intracranial bleeds and a decrease in midline shift. His mental status improved, and he self-extubated on hospital day 3.

    "original_text": "A 58-year-old male patient presented with a one-week history of bloody otorrhea from the right side. In the past 34 years, the patient had undergone four surgeries to remove the masses from his right parotid gland. Histopathologic examinations performed after the first three surgeries indicated the presence of benign pleomorphic adenomas. The latest surgery was performed nine months ago to remove a 3.3 cm mass from the parotid gland. Following this surgery however, a histopathologic examination revealed a true malignant mixed tumor (carcinosarcoma) composed of poorly differentiated carcinoma and osteosarcoma. Immunohistochemical studies were positive for P53, Ki67, and vimentin, weakly positive for cytokeratin, and negative for Actin and the S100 protein. The patient was given adjuvant radiotherapy after the latest surgery and was doing well except for symptoms associated with irradiation.\nThe patient underwent a follow-up high-resolution CT scan of the temporal bone for the presented symptoms and showed extensive opacification of the right mastoid air cells, posterior petrous bone, middle ear, and the external auditory canal. The imaging appearance raised the suspicion of a recurrent tumor. Excisional biopsy of the external auditory canal mass was performed and confirmed the diagnosis of a recurrent true malignant mixed tumor.\nDuring this hospitalization, a chest radiograph indicated the presence of patchy opacities in his left lower lung field () not seen in previous chest radiographs; this warranted a CT scan for further characterization. A CT scan of the chest showed parenchymal consolidation with some amorphous calcifications (); hence, the possibilities of fungal infection or granulomatous disease were considered initially.

Laboratory tests showed nephrotic range proteinuria and the patient was hospitalized after being diagnosed as having preeclampsia. The pregnancy was terminated by cesarean section. She developed a fever and respiratory distress on postoperative day two. Antibiotic treatment was initiated with a diagnosis of pneumonia. The patient experienced increased respiratory distress during the follow-up period and was transferred to the intensive care unit with a suspected diagnosis of acute respiratory failure. The patient was connected to non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV). A thorax CT scan showed symmetrical consolidated regions in the basal and perihilar segments of both lungs, with air bronchograms pronounced in the dependent regions, in addition to minimal pleural effusion in both lungs and a global increase in heart size. The upper lobes of both lungs and the middle lobe of the right lung were conserved, and the findings were consistent with pneumonia on the background of pulmonary edema. The patient was given bronchodilators and diuretic therapy, but a follow-up thorax CT showed an increase in ground-glass opacities so the patient was intubated due to worsening respiratory distress. Laboratory investigations performed at that stage indicated hypoalbuminemia and anemia.\nHer C-reactive protein (CRP) levels decreased under antibiotic treatment and respiratory parameters improved shortly after initiation of mechanical ventilation. She was therefore extubated and supported by NIMV. But her proteinuria was 18 g/day and she was transferred to another center to be followed up by the nephrology department. There, the patient once more experienced respiratory distress and developed peripheral cyanosis. She was re-intubated and monitored in the intensive care unit. A repeat thorax CT showed pneumothorax, which was minimal on the left side (less than 5%), and pneumomediastinum.

On physical examination, swelling and venous distention in the left side of the neck were noted, together with dilated vein collaterals in the upper left hemithorax. Chest x-ray detected a mass in the upper anterior mediastinum, causing narrowing and right-side deviation of the trachea. Blood tests were normal, including thyroid function tests. The patient medical history was unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced CT-scan of the neck and thorax showed a mass in contiguity with the left thyroid lobe and extending in the upper mediastinum, consistent with an intrathoracic ectopic goiter (A, B). An ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the mass was performed through the neck, but histological examination found red blood cells. The echographic appearance of the mass was also consistent with a goiter.\nSurgical resection was indicated. Prior to surgery, arteriography was performed which showed a predominant blood supply from the neck and no significant feeding arteries coming from the mediastinum (A, B). Therefore, a cervical approach was preferred instead of a thoracic approach. UM and AS performed the procedure. A low transverse collar incision was performed. The mass appeared to be encapsulated, adherent to the surrounding structures but without signs of tissue infiltration. The thyroid gland was normal and the lesion appeared to be separated from the left thyroid lobe. The superior pole of the mass was clearly visible but the rest of the lesion extended deeply into the upper mediastinum. After ligation of the feeding vessels in the neck, gentle blunt dissection by finger and pledget was accomplished within the capsule, to achieve an adequate mobilization of the mass. Finally, the mass was delivered from the mediastinum and completely removed through the cervical incision. No significant bleeding occurred from the mediastinum.

On initial laparoscopic evaluation of pelvic contents, visible vermiculation of bilateral ureters was noted as well as suspected findings of endometriosis-like lesions covering the pelvic peritoneum. The pelvic peritoneum was excised with sparing of the urinary bladder. Careful ureterolysis was performed bilaterally, during which the distal left ureter was found to be partially denuded, spanning 2 cm in length (). An intraoperative urologic consultation was requested, and denuded ureteral injury was confirmed by urology on laparoscopic evaluation. Given no evidence of ureteral laceration or obvious extravasation of urine from left ureter, no cystoscopy or contrast studies were performed. A 2 cm x 12 cm AmnioFix membrane was wrapped three times around the left ureter using laparoscopic robotic assistance (Figures and ). The procedure was completed without anesthesia complications and the patient was discharged on postoperative day one in stable condition.\nThe patient was seen by her gynecologist on postoperative day six after experiencing lower urinary tract symptoms and was subsequently started on PO antibiotic therapy. However, her symptoms did not improve, and she developed new left flank pain which brought her back to the hospital for further evaluation on postoperative day seven. She underwent noncontrast CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrating moderate left hydroureteronephrosis to the level of the distal ureter. She underwent cystoscopy with left retrograde pyelogram demonstrating 1.5 cm distal ureteral stricture with moderate hydroureteronephrosis (). Continued contrast injection showed a small amount of extravasation from the vicinity of the narrowed ureteral segment (). However, the site of extravasation could not be delineated.

He was managed with blood glucose control by using insulin injections. However, a fever accompanied by increasing white blood cell and leucocyturia indicated an infection requiring antibiotics. A simple CXR revealed pneumonia and pleural effusion in both lower lung. Considering the aged patient also presented with edema with limbs and hypoproteinemia, a single-lumen CVC was introduced into the right subclavian vein to maintain robust and secure intravenous access, by an experienced physician.\nThe patient was placed in the supine position and the right subclavian vein was punctured, blood was easily aspirated, and the guide wire was inserted through the needle without any resistance up to 20 cm and the needle was removed. After dilating the skin and subcutaneous tissue, a one-lumen catheter was pushed in along the guide wire and inserted to a depth of 15 cm using the Seldinger technique. No resistances were felt during the initial insertion of both the guide and the catheter, and we confirmed aspiration of venous blood through the catheter. After insertion, the patient complained no obvious symptoms. Moreover, there was no noticeable resistance, arrhythmia, or changes in vital signs were observed during the initial insertion.

However, in her previous pregnancy 3 years prior to this index presentation, the patient developed chest pain in the late mid-trimester. Evaluation at that time revealed aortic valve insufficiency and aortic dilation. She was intentionally delivered by preterm cesarean delivery at 30 weeks to avoid worsening hemodynamics should the pregnancy continue. The patient was placed on postpartum oral contraceptives but was again found to be pregnant.\nWhile receiving care by maternal fetal medicine specialists at an outside institution for this pregnancy, an MRI revealed worsening aortic dilatation that progressed from a 4 cm baseline up to 5.1 cm. The dilatation involved not only the aortic root, but also the level of the right pulmonary outflow tract, and a 15 cm segment of the descending aorta (). Transthoracic echocardiogram additionally revealed new moderate aortic insufficiency with normal ventricular function, normal atrial sizes, and a normal mitral valve. The patient developed progressively worsening chest pain and dyspnea to the point that she had symptoms with her activities of daily living. After also being diagnosed with hypertension she was started on a beta blocker. Due to her declining cardiac status and the concern for acute aortic dissection or rupture, she was referred to our medical center for further evaluation at 20-week gestation.\nThe patient and her husband were extensively counseled about the risks of continuing pregnancy versus termination of pregnancy (TOP) via induction of labor or dilation and evacuation (D&E), with subsequent aortic repair. Anesthesiology, cardiology, and cardiothoracic surgery services were involved in the discussion with the patient and her obstetrician.

Treatment was initiated with vancomycin without clinical improvement. The patient was subsequently admitted to an outside facility 1 week prior to transfer with a CT scan of the abdomen demonstrating pancolitis (). The patient had no clinical improvement with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole. He further described persistent abdominal pain, night sweats and a 11 kg weight loss.\nOn transfer to our facility, the patient had persistent bloody diarrhea. On physical examination the patient was afebrile and had diffuse abdominal discomfort. Initial laboratory studies revealed an elevated CRP, 41 mg/L, with a decreased albumin, 2.5 g/dL. Flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed demonstrating active colitis, without rectal sparing, and containing granular mucosa with a complete loss of vascular pattern (). Pathology revealed active colitis without changes of chronic colitis and without evidence for cytomegalovirus infection (). Stool culture on admission returned positive for Klebsiella oxytoca while repeat C. difficile PCR toxin assay following transfer was negative.\nGiven the presence of acute colitis and concern for antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis secondary to K. oxytoca, antibiotics were withdrawn with clinical improvement in stool frequency.

The patient had a five-year history of hypertension, denied any history of smoking and drinking, and had a family history of lung disease. On 2 November 2017, she had undergone reserved mastectomy for right breast cancer followed by axillary lymph node dissection at the Department of General Surgery of Beijing Friendship Hospital. Postoperative pathology showed infiltrating ductal carcinoma in the right breast and metastases in 1\u201320 right axillary lymph nodes. The chest computed tomography (CT) examination showed multiple nodules in both lungs; metastasis was not excluded. The nodule in the apical segment of the upper lobe of the right lung was larger but was not confirmed as malignant. Whole-body positron emission tomography (PET)-CT examination further showed that the nodule in the apical segment of the upper lobe of the right lung was larger; the lesion was considered to be malignant, thus indicating a strong possibility of peripheral lung cancer. No abnormal increase in F18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) metabolism was found in the other pulmonary nodules and mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. Follow-up observation was recommended.

However, before the presentation here, the patient went to his primary care physician with a complaint of chronic dry intermittent cough for the last four weeks and pain in his right eye associated with changes in his vision. His outpatient labs revealed that the patient had high levels of serum calcium as well as an acute kidney injury (AKI). He was hence referred to an ophthalmologist and a nephrologist by his primary care physician. The ophthalmologist diagnosed him with iritis, which was prominent in his right eye and progressed to his left eye. His outpatient workup by the nephrologist revealed high calcium and low parathyroid hormone. The laboratory testing for multiple myeloma, HIV, and hepatitis all came back negative. Furthermore, several imaging studies were performed to screen for a malignancy considering high calcium in the setting of low parathyroid hormone. An ultrasound of the abdomen and bladder were negative for any masses; the CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed were negative for any masses or lymphadenopathy. Considering all these findings, the patient was instructed to go to the ED for an elective kidney biopsy. On initial presentation to the ED, he endorsed being completely asymptomatic and his vital signs were within normal limits. His initial laboratory studies (Table ) were significant for AKI and mild hypercalcemia, whereas the urinary analysis revealed proteinuria (100 mg/dL) (Table ). Sarcoidosis was high on the list of differential diagnoses due to the combination of iritis, chronic dry cough, and laboratory findings. The nephrology and pulmonology teams consulted in the hospital both recommended a kidney biopsy.

    "cleaned_text": "a 30-year-old male with no past medical history was instructed by his nephrologist to present to the emergency department (ed). however, before the presentation here, the patient went to his primary care physician with a complaint of chronic dry intermittent cough for the last four weeks and pain in his right eye associated with changes in his vision. his outpatient labs revealed that the patient had high levels of serum calcium as well as an acute kidney injury (aki). he was hence referred to an ophthalmologist and a nephrologist by his primary care physician. the ophthalmologist diagnosed him with iritis, which was prominent in his right eye and progressed to his left eye. his outpatient workup by the nephrologist revealed high calcium and low parathyroid hormone. the laboratory testing for multiple myeloma, hiv, and hepatitis all came back negative. furthermore, several imaging studies were performed to screen for a malignancy considering high calcium in the setting of low parathyroid hormone. an ultrasound of the abdomen and bladder were negative for any masses; the ct scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed were negative for any masses or lymphadenopathy. considering all these findings, the patient was instructed to go to the ed for an elective kidney biopsy. on initial presentation to the ed, he endorsed being completely asymptomatic and his vital signs were within normal limits. his initial laboratory studies (table ) were significant for aki and mild hypercalcemia, whereas the urinary analysis revealed proteinuria (100 mg/dl) (table ). sarcoidosis was high on the list of differential diagnoses due to the combination of iritis, chronic dry cough, and laboratory findings. the nephrology and pulmonology teams consulted in the hospital both recommended a kidney biopsy. we also sent in laboratory studies for other possible causes of these symptoms such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. the following day a kidney biopsy was performed. the 25-hydroxy vitamin d levels were found to be low. results for antinuclear antibody (ana), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody",

We obtained radiographs of the femur, which demonstrated a soft tissue shadow in the posterior thigh with some apparent calcifications within the mass (). We then ordered a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which showed a large, heterogeneous soft tissue tumor abutting the neurovascular structures of the posterior thigh ( and ). Based on the concerning imaging, we moved forward by obtaining a core needle biopsy of the mass. The biopsy findings suggested the mass to be a hyalinizing tenosynovial giant cell tumor. Because the imaging and clinical history did not match well with our suspicion that his was a soft tissue sarcoma, we decided to move forward with a wide excision of the tumor, prepared for the possibility that final pathology would prove this mass to be a sarcoma. On the day of the procedure, a preoperative pregnancy test was ordered as is routine and the serum \u03b2-hCG was positive at 1122 IU/L. The patient reported that she was in menopause and had not had sexual activity in nearly a year. She denied any symptoms of pregnancy. The decision was made to proceed with surgery, understanding that there was a possibility that the tumor was secreting this hormone. The tumor was resected with a wide margin and sent for histopathologic evaluation (). Sections from the resection specimen showed a proliferation of spindle cells and pleomorphic nuclei. By immunohistochemistry, there was strong staining of tumor cells for \u03b2-hCG. The morphologic and immunophenotypic features were consistent with an unclassified pleomorphic sarcoma with ectopic \u03b2-hCG production ( and ).
