Consequently, three years later, she underwent open surgical revision which was converted to an open RYGB with concomitant cholecystectomy. She had lost over 100 kg since the first bariatric procedure (166 kg preoperatively to 63 kg on presentation).

On arrival, her vital signs were within normal limits. Her physical exam was remarkable for bilateral lower extremity pitting edema extending to the hips and an otherwise unremarkable exam. A chest x-ray disclosed no cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion or pleural effusion. Her last echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 60% with no wall motion abnormalities.\nDuring the admission, the patient received intravenous bumetanide with significant improvement. However, she developed waxing and waning episodes of confusion, and on day 3 of her hospitalization became overtly encephalopathic. She was disoriented to person, time, and space, with bizarre affect as well as incoherent speech, unable to recognize her close relatives. On physical exam patient was lethargic and had asterixis.

    "original_text": "A 32-year-old male patient reported to the outpatient department with a chief complaint of a painless, slow growing swelling in the maxillary anterior teeth region for the past 6 months. The swelling was initially small in size and had increased with time to attain the present size. There was no associated history of trauma and pain. The medical history was noncontributory. Extra oral examination revealed diffuse swelling in the anterior region of the maxilla. Anteriorly, the swelling extended from the tip of the nose to 2 cm lateral to the left ala of the nose posteriorly, and superiorly extending up to 3 cm inferior to the left inner canthus of the eye, and inferiorly it extended to the lower border of the upper lip. The swelling caused mild deviation of the tip of the nose to the right side with obliteration of the left nasolabial fold. On palpation, the swelling was nontender and firm in consistency []. Intraoral examination revealed a well-defined solitary swelling in the region of the maxillary vestibule measuring 3.5 cm2 \u00d7 3 cm2 in size. It extended from 11 to the distal line angle of 23. The swelling obliterated the labial mucobuccal fold superiorly and inferiorly it extended to the region of the alveolar mucosa. The overlying mucosa was intact and of the same color.

He became noncompliant with his treatment prior to this relapse. Upon admission to the hospital, the patient was hyperverbal and presented with pressured speech and flight of ideas. He had manifested aggressive, threatening behavior, and insomnia for the past seven days. The patient was started on lithium carbonate to stabilize his mood and paliperidone to ameliorate his symptoms of mania and psychosis. The results of his comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid panel, complete blood chemistry, and HbA1c tests were within reference ranges. He responded rapidly to the above combination and stabilized. His schizoaffective bipolar type 1 condition was in remission. We monitored his lithium levels weekly with a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and thyroid panel every six months. During hospitalization, the patient developed a compulsive urge to drink an excessive amount of fluids which was managed by daily weight monitoring and water restriction. For the past eight months, the patient developed a compulsive urge to eat excessive amounts of food and had a rapid gain of 40 lbs. Despite various trials of behavioral modifications and therapies, we were unable to control above this compulsive consumption behavior. The patient urgently needed pharmacological intervention to prevent further weight gain, comorbidities, and metabolic syndrome. He was started on TPM for mood stabilization and compulsive excessive food intake. His lithium levels, HBA1c, thyroid panels, CMP, and complete blood count (CBC) all were within reference ranges prior to the TPM administration (Table ).\nHis kidneys were functioning within reference levels.

Three weeks prior to his presentation, he had an upper respiratory tract infection. Clinically the patient was euthyroid.\nOn examination, his pulse rate was 105 beats per minute and regular and his blood pressure was 145/85mm Hg. Thyroid examination showed a tender small goiter. He had no retrosternal goiter, bruits, or cervical lymphadenopathy. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. Laboratory values showed an elevated serum free T4 and free T3 and a suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) []. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 80mm in the first hour. His white cell count was 8.54 \u00d7 109/L with a normal differential. The blood film showed occasional hypersegmented neutrophils.\nInitial clinical diagnosis was SAT. To confirm the diagnosis, a 99mTc scan was completed, which showed a focus of intense uptake in the region of the inferior pole of the right thyroid lobe with markedly suppressed uptake of the remainder of the thyroid []. The imaging finding was consistent with a toxic adenoma.

    "original_text": "A 61-year-old woman was seen in a clinic complaining of fever and dyspnea lasting 2 weeks. She was diagnosed with left pneumonia by computed tomography (CT) and referred to our institution. At the time of presentation, she had dyspnea and a fever over 38 \u00b0C. Her Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score was 2, and her Hugh-Jones classification was IV. Rhonchi were evident in the anterior chest. Laboratory studies showed an increased inflammatory response. All tumor markers were within normal limits. The chest X-ray revealed an infiltrative shadow in the lower left lung field. CT imaging showed a solid left main bronchial tumor with carinal involvement. Cartilage destruction was apparent, and the boundaries between the tumor and the esophagus and descending aorta were unclear (Fig. ). Therefore, tumor infiltration into the esophagus and descending aorta was suspected. We diagnosed her with obstructive pneumonia due to a tracheobronchial tumor. For the purposes of securing the airway, performing a tissue diagnosis and evaluating the extent of tumor progression, rigid bronchoscopy was initially performed. The tumor almost completely occluded the left main bronchus, and tumor hemorrhage was evident. By coring out the tumor, the left main bronchus was reopened, and detail of the involved area was revealed. The tumor originated from the left main stem bronchus and occupied almost the entire left main stem bronchus.

He was tachypneic with bilateral crepitations and decreased breath sounds in the right infrascapular region. He was admitted and treated with injection ampicillin for the respiratory infection. On the next day, the rashes increased and appeared on the chest and upper extremities with increasing congestion of eyes. He was thought to have measles as he had contact with a person who had similar illness few weeks back near his home. He was treated with vitamin A, oxygen by face mask, nebulized salbutamol and intravenous fluids. Since fever spikes were persistent and TLC was elevated (21,000/cu.mm) with neutrophilia (90%), antibiotics were changed to injection ceftriaxone after test dose. After a period of two hours he was found to have increasing rashes with audible wheeze, loose stools and vomiting. By this time the rash was found throughout his body with clearing from face. Salbutamol nebulizations were increased in frequency and the child was monitored closely.\nOver the next eight hours child became better, was able to sit up comfortably with minimal distress and he was taking oral feeds. The rashes appeared less prominent. He received the second dose of injection ceftriaxone that afternoon and following that he felt dizzy, vomited and began to have distress.

Two-and-a-half months before the current presentation, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected in the nasal discharge. The cat had been treated with nebulization and several oral antibiotics sensitive to P. aeruginosa by a referring veterinarian; however, clinical signs did not improve and gradually worsened in the treatment period.\nOn day 1, the complete blood count, blood biochemical analysis, and radiographic examination for the skull revealed no specific abnormalities. A thoracic ultrasound identified hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), while an abdominal ultrasound did not find any masses and lesions suspicious of neoplasm. To further elucidate the cause of nasal signs, head, chest, and abdominal CT and rhinoscopy were carried out on day 1 under general anesthesia. Head CT in the transverse plane revealed that the nasal cavity was filled with soft tissue material suspicious of nasal discharge (), and the frontal sinus was partly filled with the same material (). There were no contrast effects in either area (). Head CT in the mid-sagittal plane revealed slight nasopharyngeal swelling in the dorsal portion, but there were no abnormal contrast effects, osteolytic changes, or lymphadenopathies (). Chest and abdominal CT did not show any lymphadenopathies and masses in the body. After the nasal cavity was cleansed with saline several times, it was examined by anterograde and retrograde rhinoscopy. Anterograde rhinoscopy found only a little nasal discharge, while retrograde rhinoscopy detected a little nasal discharge and slight swelling of the nasopharyngeal mucosa but without masses ().

The mass was a hard, smooth and 7 mm diameter, and was resected with narrow safety margin as diagnosis of a benign mesenchymal tumor. The histological diagnosis was chondromyxoid tumor, which is unusual, but that was not finally confirmed. After 4 years, he noticed a painless, mass gradually increasing in the same part, and consulted our oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic in January 2007.\nThe patient was healthy, with no family history of similar symptoms. The mobile pedunclated mass located at the center of the dorsum of tongue. The mass about 20 mm in diameter was firm in consistency, and had reddish and lobulated surface (Figure A). Ultrasonographic findings revealed a soft tissue mass in the tongue, which was 20 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 10 mm in size (Figure B). An incisional biopsy was performed based on the initial clinical diagnosis of soft tissue tumor of the tongue, and histological findings suggested a benign mesenchymal tumor as a possible diagnosis.\nUnder general anesthesia, the tumor was extirpated with a safety margin of about 3 mm. Macroscopically, the tumor was solid and lobular with a grayish white cut surface, and measured 20 mm at the greatest diameter (Figure C). Histologically, the tumor was located in subepithelial connective tissue and proliferated in a multinodular fashion (Figure A). The mass was relatively well circumscribed but not encapsulated.

An emergency upper endoscopy revealed a feline esophagus and a linear esophageal tear. No biopsies were taken at that time due to acute bleeding. The esophageal tear was treated with epinephrine and three surgical clips. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed four weeks later. Histological sections of the esophagus showed basal cell hyperplasia and intraepithelial eosinophils greater than 20/HPF.

His daily medications included 7.5 milligrams of prednisone, 6 milligrams of Tacrolimus, and 720 milligrams of mycophenolate sodium.\nThe cutaneous examination showed individual and grouped, erythematous-based vesicles located in a dermatomal distribution on the left side of his abdomen, and more than 20 individual lesions in a diffuse, nondermatomal distribution on his body. Initial polymerase chain reaction testing of a lesional swab was positive for varicella zoster virus and negative for herpes simplex virus. He was started on 10 mg/kg of intravenous acyclovir three times per day for disseminated herpes zoster involving multiple dermatomes but without organ or central nervous system involvement.\nAfter seven days of intravenous antiviral therapy, his VZV-associated lesions had nearly resolved (Figure ).

Carotid and vertebral artery Doppler ultrasonography, performed during pre-operative preparation of the patient, revealed no pathology in either the carotid or vertebral arteries.\nAfter preparation, the patient was taken into the operating room for coronary bypass surgery. Peripheral venous and radial artery catheterisation was completed prior to general anesthaesia. Following the administration of general anaesthesia, the head of the patient was placed 15 degrees below the whole body, which was in the Trendelenburg position, and he was turned to the left. He was stained and covered under sterile conditions.\nThe puncture was made by an anaesthetist, using a 18-G needle, through the apex of the triangle composed of the sternal and clavicular parts of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. During puncture, the blood was established not to be bright in colour or pulsatile, and a 12-F \u00d7 15-cm double-lumen catheter was inserted using the Seldinger method. However, the blood from the catheter was bright and pulsatile, and so the catheter tip was attached to a transducer. From the arterial trace and the arterial nature of the blood sample taken, it was assumed that carotid artery catheterisation had been performed.\nDoppler ultrasonography was carried out in the operating room on the patient under general anaesthesia. It was observed that the catheter was not in the carotid artery, and therefore the carotid artery was accessed by surgical exploration through an incision at the catheter tip. It was established from ultrasonography that the catheter had advanced deeper towards the cervical vertebrae.\nIn the ensuing minutes, brain, and head and neck surgeons were invited to the operating room. With neck dissection, the anterolateral view of the C5\u2013C6\u2013C7 vertebrae was accessed. It was seen that the catheter had entered through the C5\u2013C6 disc",

She had been diagnosed with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) 3 years prior. The clinical symptoms at the time of PAN onset were fever and myalgia, but no other clinical symptoms were observed. At that time, her serum ANCA was negative. We had carefully discussed with some pathologists for the possibility of an ANCA-negative AAV at the time of diagnosis of PAN.

Histological findings of the biceps muscle biopsy, which showed muscle damage by MRI, showed necrotizing vasculitis of the medium-sized artery without small or capillary lesions. Furthermore, there were no abnormalities in the urine findings, which are often seen in MPA, nor were there any findings suggesting glomerular lesions. Based on the above findings, the patient was diagnosed with PAN, a necrotizing vasculitis confined to medium-sized arteries.

    "original_text": "A 31-year-old female patient presented with a complaint of severe pain in the upper front teeth since 1 week. The pain was pricking, sharp shooting, and spontaneous. The patient gave history of trauma 9 years ago with two to three previous episodes of intermittent severe pain and swelling, which subsided on medication with analgesics and antibiotics.\nClinical examination revealed an Ellis\u2019 and Davey's Class III horizontal fracture of the maxillary left central incisor. Both central incisors were discolored and the related labial mucosa was tender on palpation. The central incisors and the left lateral incisor were also tender on percussion. Examination of occlusion revealed a decreased overjet and overbite.\nBoth central incisors and the right lateral incisor tested nonvital and radiographic examination revealed a fracture line involving pulp in the upper left central incisor with a diffuse periapical radiolucency of size approximately 1 cm diameter, involving the roots of the maxillary left central and lateral incisors. Root canal treatment was thus indicated for the maxillary central incisors and right lateral incisor. The upper right central incisor was planned to be restored with a heat-pressed glass ceramic jacket crown, whereas the fractured upper left central incisor was to be restored with a single-unit all-ceramic post\u2013core\u2013crown restoration.\nRoot canal treatment was carried out for all three teeth as described in Case Report 1. The teeth were irrigated with 2% chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide was placed as intracanal medicament for a period of 3 weeks. Once the drainage from the canals ceased and patient was asymptomatic, obturation of the root canals was carried out with gutta-percha and AH-plus resin sealer by lateral condensation technique.\nAfter 2 weeks, post space preparation was carried out for the upper left central incisor and tooth preparation was done for both central incisors for all-ceramic jacket crowns. Subsequent impression and CAD/CAM fabrication procedures for the restorations were similar to those described",

Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 5.0 cm diameter infrarenal AAA and a 3.0 cm diameter right IIA aneurysm as well as a HSK ().

She was nonsmoker and did not have any chronic disease. Her dyspnea and hypoxemia were getting worse and she was accepted to ICU. Noninvasive mechanical ventilation (MV) was used for initial treatment but hypoxemia was worsened; hence, she was intubated and invasive MV was used. On her physical examination, we auscultated mild crackles bilateral on lower lung zones. Her chest X-ray showed bilateral nonhomogenous infiltration at middle and lower zones (). While initial fraction of inhaled oxygenation (FiO2) was 80% on MV, her PaO2 was 65 mmHg and lung protective MV strategies were applied. An appropriate fluid replacement, antibiotics, and other medical treatments were applied. Undergoing MV, FiO2 level was decreased gradually and she was weaned from MV on her fifth day of ICU stay and MV. After weaning, we observed that her oral secretions increased and her left nasolabial sulcus wiped out. On her neurological examination, abnormal findings were not found except left facial paralysis. We did not study out any pathological imagination neither on her cranial computed tomography (CT) nor on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Peripheral facial paralysis (PFP) was diagnosed and intravenous steroid treatment 1 milligram per kilogram (methylprednisolone) was added to her therapy by neurologist. At the same time, dermatological lesion occurred and, on her dermatologic examination, oedema on her face, pustular lesions on her skin, and fissure on her tongue were detected; therefore labium mucosal biopsy was taken and mucositis was reported ().

With the arrival of the emergency physician on site, the patient had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15 with stable hemodynamics and was subsequently transferred to our emergency department by helicopter.

Her GCS was 15 and primary surveys ABCDE including log roll revealed no pathologic findings. With stable vital signs, a secondary survey was performed. Since the patient was fully alert without any distracting injuries, and did not complain of any neck pain, the Stifneck was opened. Careful examination of the C-spine revealed no pain on palpation of the Proc. spinosi. She could actively turn her head to more than 45 degrees bilaterally and lift the head in a supine position without eliciting any neck pain. During the secondary survey we performed a complete neurologic exam according to the ASIA criteria. Motor function was graded according to the muscle strength scale with a score from 0 to 5 and there were no pathologic findings.

The pain developed after frequent ankle sprains and a splint was applied 1 year prior to her visit. For her medical history, she had received surgical treatment for neurofibromatosis 20 years ago. The pain intensity was 10/10 on the visual analogue scale (VAS), and the nature of the pain was squeezing, bursting and tingling. The patient showed allodynia and hyperalgesia in her left ankle and there was edema, skin color change and trophic change of the skin. We carried out various examinations including left ankle MRI, bone scan, autonomic nervous system function test, quantitative sensory test, electro-diagnostic study and diagnosed her as CRPS type 1.\nAfter the CRPS diagnosis, we carried out various treatments including oral medications, lumbar sympathetic ganglion block, and common peroneal nerve block. After these treatments for 8 months, the edema and allodynia decreased, and the pain intensity was 4-6/10 on the VAS.

He also complained of diminished night vision which was stationary and non-progressive. His vital parameters and general physical examination was noted to be within normal limits.\nOcular examination revealed a visual acuity of 6/36 (OD) and FCCF (OS). The pupillary reactions were sluggish in both eyes. The remainder of the anterior segment examination was noted to be normal. Fundus examination (Fig. a, b) showed presence of widespread outer retinal atrophy with visible choroidal vessels and peripheral sub-retinal scarring. The left eye shows evidence of foveal atrophy. A small peripheral rim of normal retina, around 1 disc diameter in size, was noted on indirect ophthalmoscopy.\nWe initially considered a diagnosis of choroideremia, retinitis pigmentosa and scarred posterior uveitis. There was no family history of nyctalopia and an evaluation of his siblings revealed a normal retina. The blood-work on uveitis also came out to be negative.\nWe once again reviewed the past medical history and upon detailed inquisition the patient divulged a history of a suicide attempt 10 years ago. He stated that he had consumed the chemical used in the iodination of salt after which he noted the diminished vision in both eyes.\nWe carried out an OCT evaluation (Fig. c, d) of the patient which showed evidence of outer retinal atrophy with associated sub-foveal scarring which was more pronounced in the left eye.

The procedure was uneventful until about two weeks after when she started to develop toothache, with sudden left-sided frontotemporal headaches radiating down her face, ear and neck, left ear fullness associated with hearing loss, and left orbital pain with blurry vision. She returned to her dentist and was given 10 days of amoxicillin for suspected sinus infection. Her symptoms worsened and she presented to emergency department (ED). In the ED she was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Her physical exam was remarkable for left conjunctival injection with tenderness along the left side of the orbit and pain with lateral/upward/downward gaze ocular movements. Her right eye was normal in appearance. She had reduced hearing in her left ear when compared to her right, mild mastoid tenderness on the left with no edema or fluctuance with serous amber colored effusion in the left middle ear with no evidence of otitis media. The tympanic membranes bilaterally appeared intact with no effusion in the right middle ear. Her neurological exam was unremarkable with no focal neurological deficits. The rest of her physical exam was unremarkable. Initial labwork was significant for an elevated white count of 11.4 cells/mm3 (4-10.5), and computed tomography (CT) of the head did not show any abnormalities. Given her aural fullness and hearing loss, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and internal auditory canal was performed, which showed thrombosis of the left transverse and sigmoid sinus (Figure ). A magnetic resonance venogram (MRV) was performed as per neurology recommendations, which re-demonstrated occlusion of the left transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus, and internal jugular vein (Figure ). A CT scan of the internal auditory canal performed at the time showed fluid in the middle ear and multiple left mastoid sinus air",

The patient\u2019s history showed acute onset of fever up to 38.5\u00b0C accompanied by rigor, neck stiffness, vomiting and confusion lasting 3 days. He had initially presented to the emergency department of a rural hospital, where he underwent basic laboratory evaluation. An emergent computed tomography (CT) brain scan did not demonstrate any abnormal findings. The patient was considered for a lumbar puncture due to marked nuchal rigidity.
