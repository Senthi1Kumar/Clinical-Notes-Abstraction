    "original_text": "A 77-year-old Japanese man consulted our hospital with a 1-month history of right alar swelling with hard pain as his chief complaint. A physical examination revealed a submucosal tumor with an intact and smooth surface in the right nasal vestibule. The result of biopsy was suspected malignancy. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a round lesion 1 cm in length in the right nasal vestibule close to the pyriform fossa edge of the right maxillary bone (). He had severe pulmonary dysfunction due to recurrent end stage lung cancer and diabetes. The expected remainder of his life would be half a year. Therefore, his very poor condition precluded general anesthesia. To relieve the nasal pain, shorten the stay in the hospital and improve the quality of life (QOL), we performed minimally invasive surgery under local anesthesia. In the operation, nasal vestibular tumors arising from the bone surface of the pyriform fossa could be resected using a right alar incision approach combined with a right gingival incision approach. After removing the tumors, a right alar flap was used to cover wounds with exposed bone (). Histopathology of the specimen indicated poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (). These cancer cells could be found in the submucosal areas in the nasal vestibule, but not on the surface or in the epithelial layers. The edges of the resected tumor did not show cancer cells. Postoperatively, the right nasal pain soon disappeared. The patient was discharge from our hospital 4 days after the operation. Two months later, findings in CT scan revealed widespread destruction of the maxillary bones. We consulted pathologists and radiologists. As a result, it was thought that maxillary bone metastasis from lung carcinoma had caused submucosal swelling of the nasal vestibule. The evidence was as follows. In the histopathological examination, cancerous areas were located in the submucosa but not in the upper layer, and the operative findings confirmed that cancer tissues had generated from the surface of maxillary bone. Moreover, the patient had undergone lung cancer surgery four years before. The histopathological characteristics",

The patient reported a previous medical history of right mastectomy due to breast cancer followed by chemoradiotherapy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis ten months earlier. In the beginning of the operation after injection of anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, the patient developed pneumothorax which led to postponing the cholecystectomy. The pneumothorax was treated by inserting a thoracic drainage tube. After removing the thoracic drainage tube, chest X-ray and CT scan of the thorax were performed, but there was no evidence of diaphragm defect or herniation. \u0391 laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed four months later under general anesthesia with no complications. On admission to our department, the patient was febrile, pale, had considerable usage of accessory respiratory muscles, and had abdominal distention. On physical examination, the right lung presented decreased sounds during inspiration, while the abdomen was distended with diminished bowel sounds and peritonism. The blood exams were within normal values, while the arterial blood analysis demonstrated increased lactic acid levels and compromised pO2 values. Chest X-ray revealed that the right lung was totally suppressed by the intestine and suggested that due to intestinal transposition to the thoracic cavity, a functional right pneumonectomy had occurred (). CT scan of the thorax and abdomen detected a right diaphragm defect and herniation of the small intestine, which was also ischaemic due to venous circulation occlusion (). Urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed, and it revealed a diaphragm defect of 10 \u00d7 2 cm extending from the anterior side of the right diaphragm to the posterolateral side. Almost all the small intestine and part of the transverse colon were extending to the right thoracic cavity through the defect and were ischaemic and immobilized due to venous stasis. The herniated part of the small intestine and transverse colon were separated from the lung and retracted into the abdominal cavity, whereas the diaphragmatic defect was closed by direct suturing with Prolene 2-0",

Prior to admission, his symptoms had been well controlled with azathioprine for maintenance therapy. A chest x-ray demonstrated right upper and left lower lobe pulmonary opacities, and a subsequent CT scan revealed multiple pulmonary nodules with associated hilar lymphadenopathy.

There were no perioperative complications. The chest tube, which was placed routinely for the treatment of potential pulmonary air leak, was removed on post-operative day two after no air leak was identified. The pathology demonstrated necrotic neutrophilic nodules without granulomas, which were consistent with pulmonary manifestations of his UC.

The pain was intermittent, colicky in nature and associated with nausea and vomiting. She denied any history of fever and there had been no change in her bowel habits or urinary symptoms. For several months she had been followed up regularly at the gynecology clinic due to the lower abdominal heaviness and distension. Her gynecological history revealed a nulliparous woman with no vaginal bleeding. Her medical history was significant for epilepsy since childhood, which was well controlled by medication, and a laparoscopic appendectomy one year ago. On examination, she was alert and conscious. Her vital signs were stable. Her abdomen was distended with a palpable pelvic-abdominal mass that was hard, non-tender and slightly mobile. Her liver and spleen were within the normal range and she had normal bowel sounds. No lymph nodes were enlarged and digital rectal examination revealed no abnormalities.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen and pelvis showed a pelvic/abdominal mass adjacent to the distal small bowel loops separate from the uterus and ovaries, heterogeneously enhancing, measuring roughly 65 \u00d7 99 mm with multiple areas of necrosis (Figure ). A CT scan of her chest showed indeterminate multiple bilateral subpleural 2 mm to 4 mm lung nodules, too small to biopsy.\nThe case was discussed by the multidisciplinary tumor board and the advice was to confirm the diagnosis to eliminate the possibility of an ovarian origin of the tumor because of its very close proximity.\nSurgical exploration was indicated due to the finding of a large mass that was composed of a cystic and also a large solid component that needed to be investigated to eliminate the possibility of lymphoma or tuberculosis, which is quite common in our population. However, there was some radiological confusion about the origin of this mass and to some colleagues it was necessary to confirm it with a histological biopsy",

She was a mother of two sons with a history of contraceptive injection use for 5 years and suffered from type II diabetes for 4 years with routine insulin treatment. She presented with a left breast mass that had appeared several months ago. In the past 3 months, the mass grew quickly and developed a 15 \u00d7 15 cm inflammatory wound. A core needle biopsy was performed in the district hospital on June 2018 on this unresectable lesion. Pathology tests revealed ductal invasive breast cancer. An immunohistochemistry test revealed a positive estrogen receptor at 90%, a negative progesterone receptor, a negative Her2 and 75% of KI 67 expression and a poor histology grade. Her referral process to our clinic was slow because of the convoluted administration. During this process, she developed a cough. When presented in our clinic for chemotherapy she had shortness of breath. The clinical and imaging examination revealed a moderate pericardial effusion, a pleural effusion, pneumonic and subpleural type pulmonal metastases (Figure ) and bone metastasis in the form of a wedged fracture in the 12th thoracic vertebra. The pericardial effusion progressed significantly and she very quickly developed a life-threatening cardiac tamponade (Figure ). She was then referred to the cardiology ward. Echocardiography revealed a massive pericardial effusion with flying heart and collapsed right atrium and right ventricle. To release the pericardial fluid, a pericardial window procedure was immediately applied. A chest tube was placed within the pericardial cavity to drain the pericardial fluid from the pericardial space. Further, cytology examination confirmed that both the pericardial effusion and the pleural effusion contained metastatic breast cancer cells. One week after the pericardial window procedure she recovered from the severe dyspnea and all the devices were then removed. A total deep vein thrombosis in her right popliteal vein was also identified and treated with unfractionated heparin followed by 20 mg daily oral rivaroxaban.\nWe then considered a palliative chemotherapy treatment despite her low performance (",

She had noticeable deformity of the upper arm and was neurovascularly intact distally. Radiographs were obtained which demonstrated a four-part proximal humerus fracture and dislocation of the left glenohumeral joint (). The patient was admitted, and on hospital day 3, she underwent open reduction internal fixation of her proximal humerus fracture dislocation (). A deltopectoral approach was utilized for this procedure. Venous bleeding was controlled with electrocautery. The cephalic vein was properly identified during the dissection and was not injured. There were no other intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful hospital course and was discharged on postoperative day two on 325 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily for DVT prophylaxis. On postoperative day five the patient returned to our outpatient clinic complaining of increased swelling and discomfort of the left upper extremity. Physical exam showed increased swelling with pitting edema and an intact neurovascular exam. An upper extremity duplex ultrasound was obtained which demonstrated occlusive thrombosis in the cephalic and deep brachial veins of the left forearm. The patient was referred to our Vascular Medicine service and anticoagulation therapy was initiated with enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily for two days followed by rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 21 days. Follow-up examination demonstrated improvement in symptoms and reduction in swelling. The patient was then transitioned to long-term prophylaxis using rivaroxaban 20 mg daily for eight weeks. A repeat upper extremity duplex ultrasound was obtained showing resolution of the DVT. She completed the remainder of her therapy with aspirin 81 mg daily for 16 weeks at which time her symptoms had completely resolved.

Prior to entering the inferior vena cava, the common iliac vein normalized. Using intravenous ultrasound, measurements were taken and a 14 x 60 mm Luminexx stent was deployed at the area of stenosis. The stent was noted to have migrated upward into the inferior vena cava and a buttressing of this stent with a 16 x 40 mm Wallstent was placed to ensure adequate apposition. Unfortunately, this caused further migration upward into the IVC and a 14 mm Atlas balloon was used to help secure the migrated IVC stent. The area of stenosis was no longer stented given this migration. Therefore, stenting of the left common iliac vein stenosis was ultimately achieved with a 14 x 80 mm Luminexx stent (). The patient was started on warfarin with heparin bridging postoperatively. Early ambulation and the routine use of elastic stockings were encouraged following the procedure. The following day the patient complained of severe abdominal pain and an abdominal x-ray revealed only two stents located in the abdomen ().

The abdominal pain was localized in an area ranging from the right upper to the right lateral abdomen. The patient had undergone cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis as a 32-year-old in Latin America and had moved to Japan for work approximately 3 years prior to his initial visit to our hospital.

He did not experience abdominal pain immediately after his return to Japan, but, as noted above, he started to gradually feel pain in the right lateral region about 2 months prior to presentation.\nHe first visited another hospital emergency department 1 month after onset of the pain. Initially, gastrointestinal tract spasm was suspected, and he was treated with tiquizium bromide. Though the medication partially relieved his abdominal pain, most of the pain persisted. The result of a workup by a urologist was negative, even though nephrolithiasis was suspected. His abdominal pain was exacerbated upon changing posture, and thus it was suspected to be of somatic rather than visceral origin. Abdominal pain persisted despite treatment with loxoprofen sodium hydrate, and any cause of abdominal pain was not detected on further evaluations, including hematologic laboratory analysis, urine analysis, gastroscopy, or abdominal computed tomography (CT). Finally, he was referred to our hospital for further examination.\nThe results of screening for depression were negative, and the patient did not have symptoms such as loss of interest, depressed feelings, or any specific changes of surrounding conditions, such as family or work environment changes.

The patient had a history of chronic alcohol consumption exceeding 400 mL of ethanol per week for the past 20 years. There was no history of steroid intake or trauma. One year before presentation, she had undergone a bipolar hip replacement for avascular necrosis of the left hip. She referred to our hospital due to the right knee pain. Radiographs revealed no destruction of the articular surfaces of the right knee, but increased radiodensity was evident in the proximal half of the tibia extending from the joint line (). MRI demonstrated large demarcated regions of abnormal signal intensity in the proximal half of the tibia and medial femoral condyle, with features of osteonecrosis (). A bone scintigram showed the abnormal uptake in the right hip, and the right and the left knee joints (Figures , , and ). A full blood screen including autoantibodies, a clotting profile, ALP, and AMY gave normal results (). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and C viruses and antibodies were negative. The patient complained that she had often felt mild pain in her right hip and left knee joint after a short walk. Physical examination of the right hip and left knee revealed no abnormality. However, radiographs demonstrated increased radiolucency in both, and MRI revealed demarcated regions of abnormal signal intensity in the central portion of the right femoral head with typical features of osteonecrosis (). Left knee MRI showed multiple demarcated bone marrow abnormalities with double-line sign in the distal shaft of the left femur, compatible with bone necrosis ().\nThe patient was instructed to maintain only partial weight-bearing with wheelchair mobilization for eight weeks and then to return gradually to full weight-bearing over the next two months.

Her pregnancy was further complicated by a known right ovarian mass, history of endometriosis which was managed conservatively, as well as infertility. Both first and second pregnancies were conceived via in vitro fertilization by frozen embryo transfer. Her first pregnancy was otherwise uncomplicated, however resulted in primary CS for nonreassuring fetal heart tracing. No pelvic pathology was noted during that CS. The patient was first diagnosed with a right ovarian mass during her second pregnancy while on IVF treatment. The patient declined the option of removing the mass due to possibility of damaging the nearby ovarian tissue during removal of the mass and thus worsening her infertility. The IVF treatment was successful. The transvaginal ultrasonography performed during the early pregnancy suspected the right ovarian mass as endometrioma or desmoid tumor ().\nThe mass was kept under surveillance by performing periodic ultrasound imaging. Due to the change in mass characteristics and increase in size, the patient was referred to a Gynecologic Oncologist during second trimester. Considering the high risk pregnancy, recommendation was made to follow the mass with sequential ultrasound with the removal of the mass at the time of repeat CS as long as the mass did not change in size or configuration during the pregnancy and patient remained asymptomatic. Unfortunately, the patient developed pre-eclampsia with severe features at 32 weeks of gestation. Upon admission, she was given magnesium sulfate infusion for seizure prophylaxis and corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity. The Maternal-Fetal-Medicine specialists recommended delivery at thirty-four weeks of gestation unless there were new signs of maternal or fetal instability. However, three days after the admission, she underwent an emergency cesarean section due to recurrent severe blood pressure changes which were unresponsive to intravenous antihypertensive medications.\nDuring cesarean section, extensive adhesions were noted at the level of adipose tissue, rectus muscle, and anterior surface of the uterus, which were densely adhered to",

A computed tomography of the neck with contrast at the time showed two confluent masses in the right axillary and right supraclavicular regions encasing the right subclavian and axillary vein, the internal mammary artery, and narrowing of the lower internal jugular vein. Patient was subsequently diagnosed with primary mammary carcinoma of the axilla with metastasis. The patient was evaluated by the oncology and radiation oncology services and underwent multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Her course of chemotherapy was complicated by thrombocytopenia and metastatic disease progression. The patient was determined to be a nonsurgical candidate. Gradually, her pain of the right upper extremity worsened, and the patient was started on opioid therapy. Despite titration of her oral medications to extended release morphine 90 mg two times a day, immediate release morphine 30 mg every 2 to 3 hours, methadone 5 mg daily, and gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, her pain control remained suboptimal. She was referred to our pain clinic for further management of her intractable pain.\nOn presentation, the patient reported a constant 10/10 pain on the numeric pain rating scale (NRS) of the right proximal humerus, right anterior and posterior shoulder, and right supraclavicular region. The pain was reported as dull, aching, burning, and electric in nature. Her pain was worsened by passive and active range of motion, and the pain at its best was a 7/10 with oral medications. Patient also reported progressive weakness of the entire right upper extremity.

After that, an MRI brain showed that the optic glioma was very extensive in the brain parenchyma, to the point it was extending from both optic nerves through the optic chiasm and to the whole optic pathways bilaterally (). Moreover, it was extending to intraventricular system and to the sella and suprasellar region. Patient was managed and treated in the paediatric intensive care unit with conservative treatment for the head injury. The patient ended up with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 8/15.\nDue to his poor neurological status, with this extensive optic glioma, it was decided by paediatric neuro-oncology tumour board that there is no further treatment that can be offered to him. During his follow-up, he was found to have a significant increase in his head circumference which reached up to 74 cm. The brain MRI was repeated and showed progression of the tumour size and the hydrocephalus; therefore, a VP shunt was inserted.

The patient had mild tenderness and swelling of the right cheek. Head computed tomography revealed mild mucous membrane swelling and effusion in both sinuses ( left). Because recurrence of cellulitis with sinusitis was suspected, cefditoren pivoxil treatment was initiated. However, because the pain persisted, he visited our department.\nPhysical examination revealed no abnormal findings except right cheek tenderness in the area that corresponded with the region supplied by the second branch of the trigeminal nerve (the maximally nerve). Although marked tenderness was evident, no point with hyperalgesia, where a light touch elicited severe pain, was observed. No facial paralysis or oral disorders were observed. Blood examination revealed no abnormal findings. Recurrence of sinusitis was suspected. Based on the physical examination and laboratory tests, the patient was clinically diagnosed with TN.

The patient had undergone cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis as a 32-year-old in Latin America and had moved to Japan for work approximately 3 years prior to his initial visit to our hospital.

He did not experience abdominal pain immediately after his return to Japan, but, as noted above, he started to gradually feel pain in the right lateral region about 2 months prior to presentation.\nHe first visited another hospital emergency department 1 month after onset of the pain. Initially, gastrointestinal tract spasm was suspected, and he was treated with tiquizium bromide. Though the medication partially relieved his abdominal pain, most of the pain persisted. The result of a workup by a urologist was negative, even though nephrolithiasis was suspected. His abdominal pain was exacerbated upon changing posture, and thus it was suspected to be of somatic rather than visceral origin.

Initially, gastrointestinal tract spasm was suspected, and he was treated with tiquizium bromide. Though the medication partially relieved his abdominal pain, most of the pain persisted. The result of a workup by a urologist was negative, even though nephrolithiasis was suspected.

Thrombosis of the anterior tibial artery and a 20-cm-long segment of the artery's crushed intimal structure were observed, along with a similarly damaged vein.

    "original_text": "A 92-year-old man was referred to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery on a two-week wait basis for assessment of an ulcer on the tongue (). History revealed that the ulcer had been present for two months, was painful and causing discomfort while swallowing. The patient had lost seven kilograms of weight in one month, and he attributed this to the inability to eat due to pain. He had no significant relevant medical history. Social history revealed that he had been a pipe smoker for many years and took moderate amounts of alcohol on a regular basis.\nClinical examination of the head and neck region revealed a 3 cm diameter indurated ulcer of the left posterior dorsum of the tongue. This ulcer was highly suspicious of malignancy. Examination of the neck revealed an ipsilateral solitary lymph node of 4 cm diameter in level 3 region. The patient was informed of the possible diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. He underwent urgent incisional biopsy under local anaesthesia, and the histopathology report was suggestive of an adenocarcinoma (). Additional immunohistochemistry performed on the specimen demonstrated that the adenocarcinoma expressed cytokeratin 20 but lacked cytokeratin 7. In addition, the large bowel marker CDX2 was positive, whereas the pulmonary marker TTF1, the thyroid marker, thyroglobulin, and the prostate marker, PSA, were all negative. This suggested that the presenting oral lesion was the first sign of a possible distant metastasis of a primary bowel carcinoma.\nThe patient underwent further investigations; chest X-ray, MRI head and neck, and CT chest and abdomen. The CT demonstrated a sigmoid carcinoma with local lymphadenopathy and also evidence of distant metastasis to right axillary, hepatic, intrapulmonary, retroperitoneal, brain, and bony disease to the thoracic vertebra. This patient was discussed in the head and neck multidisciplinary team meeting and subsequently referred to colorectal team for treatment.

He had not received treatment because he was asymptomatic. Eight months earlier, he experienced chest discomfort after eating and visited our hospital. His past history is pediatric asthma. The diameter of his middle esophageal diverticulum was 47 mm, and the accumulation of contrast medium was observed in the diverticulum. A gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a diverticulum in the right wall located 30 cm from the incisor row (Fig. ), and the diverticulum mucous membrane was partially covered by adherent white matter that was unstained with iodine (Fig. ), and narrowband imaging which revealed type A. We performed a biopsy, and the pathological findings of the endoscopic biopsy were atypical epithelium and no malignant findings. We confirmed the function of the lower esophageal sphincter, and the esophageal body peristaltic wave was observed to be normal using high-resolution manometry. We decided to perform a thoracoscopic diverticulectomy based on his symptoms and the possibility of malignancy suggested by the atypical epithelium. Surgery was performed with the patient placed in the prone position and four trocars inserted into the right thoracic cavity. A 12-mm trocar was inserted into the fifth intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. Only the left lung was ventilated, and a pneumothorax in the right chest was created using CO2 gas at 6 mm. Twelve-mm trocars were inserted into the seventh and ninth intercostal spaces at the level of the inferior scapular angle.

The patient had undergone cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis as a 32-year-old in Latin America and had moved to Japan for work approximately 3 years prior to his initial visit to our hospital.

Initially, gastrointestinal tract spasm was suspected, and he was treated with tiquizium bromide. Though the medication partially relieved his abdominal pain, most of the pain persisted. The result of a workup by a urologist was negative, even though nephrolithiasis was suspected. His abdominal pain was exacerbated upon changing posture, and thus it was suspected to be of somatic rather than visceral origin.

Over the last 1 month, the severity of the pain was so bad that the patient had to stand all the time and sitting or decubitus position was not tolerable even for 1 min. His sleep was so miserable that he had been taking small naps in that standing position leaning onto some support. He had carcinoma rectum for which he underwent abdominoperineal resection 8 years ago. There was history of smoking prior to that. After the surgery, he had been leading a near normal life driving auto rickshaw for a living until he developed the present problem. There were many gangrenous ulcers over his right thigh and leg. A computed tomography-angiogram was done previously that showed a thrombus in the right common iliac artery measuring about 9.5 cm extending up to the right superficial femoral artery with a near total occlusion of the lumen and poorly developed collaterals. He was scheduled for a conventional peripheral angiogram for deciding on the further plan. However, he could not lie down in the catheterization laboratory due to severe pain and was referred to our Department of Pain Management. We initially tried a conservative approach with a combination of oral pregabalin, diclofenac, paracetamol, and tramadol as per the standard dosage protocol for 2 days. When there was no satisfactory pain relief, we planned epidural analgesia. However, the problem here was the positioning. Patient was not able to tolerate either sitting or lateral decubitus position even for 1 min. He was somewhat comfortable only in the standing position. Considering the special situation, though not conventional, we decided to place the epidural catheter",

The diameter of his middle esophageal diverticulum was 47 mm, and the accumulation of contrast medium was observed in the diverticulum. A gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a diverticulum in the right wall located 30 cm from the incisor row (Fig. ), and the diverticulum mucous membrane was partially covered by adherent white matter that was unstained with iodine (Fig. ), and narrowband imaging which revealed type A.

She reported acceleration in the growth of the mass in the recent months. She also complained of pain and occasional bleeding from the mass. There was no personal or family history of breast cancer. The patient had noticed the mass more than one year before presenting but had sought help of alternative medicine (homeopathy) in her village and was on homeopathic medication for almost a year. The size of the lump did reduce initially, but she did not notice any improvement after a year of therapy; instead the mass grew more rapidly and erupted through the skin. She delayed medical attention because she was not comfortable discussing her condition. She sought help when the mass erupted through the skin and caused pain.\nPhysical examination presented a hanging mass which was ulcerated, having irregular surface and nodular appearance, occupying the lower and outer quadrant of the right breast (). The right breast was asymmetrically drawn down by the mass, which was firm in consistency and was found attached to the underlying structures by a stalk-like process. The mass bled on touch. There was no discharge from the nipple and retraction of nipple was also absent. There were no signs of skin involvement or axillary lymphadenomegaly. The left breast was normal.\nThe patient was subjected to diagnostic investigations which included routine as well as imaging and cytological modalities. Blood examination revealed no abnormality except mildly elevated ESR and all other parameters were within normal limits. Ultrasonography reported the mass as an exophytic growth with heterogeneous echotexture and vascularity. Chest X-rays and abdominal ultrasound were performed which showed no abnormality.

She presented to a local community hospital and was examined by a neurologist. Physical examination revealed an exaggerated deep tendon reflexes and sustained clonus of extensor plantar responses. Ophthalmologic examination was normal. A spinal tap was performed in the neurologist office with a 22 gauge Quincke spinal needle between the third and fourth lumbar spaces after the first attempt with free flow of clear cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). This fluid was analyzed for IgG, albumin, and oligoclonal banding to confirm the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS), and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was also obtained. All laboratory tests confirmed the diagnosis of MS. Patient returned home with follow-up appointment in 2 days. She later developed severe headache 10 hours after returning home. Headache was more localized to the back of the head and worsened with ambulation. Patient returned to the neurologist office the next day and was prescribed acetaminophen with bed rest. Nevertheless, she continued with severe headache on ambulation. In addition, she experienced dizziness and neck stiffness for the next 7 days. Follow-up evolutions and repeat physical examination revealed similar findings. Patient family remained concerned and decided to travel to the USA for additional treatment and consultation. She completed an 18 hours flight from her home town to the USA in a sitting position. At the completion of her journey, she experienced severe occipital and frontal headache associated with nausea/vomiting with neck stiffness and back pain. The pain intensity increased particularly during aircraft takeoff. Upon landing at airport, she had to be transported by a wheel chair to her car.

The diameter of his middle esophageal diverticulum was 47 mm, and the accumulation of contrast medium was observed in the diverticulum. A gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a diverticulum in the right wall located 30 cm from the incisor row (Fig. ), and the diverticulum mucous membrane was partially covered by adherent white matter that was unstained with iodine (Fig. ), and narrowband imaging which revealed type A. We performed a biopsy, and the pathological findings of the endoscopic biopsy were atypical epithelium and no malignant findings. We confirmed the function of the lower esophageal sphincter, and the esophageal body peristaltic wave was observed to be normal using high-resolution manometry.

During this appointment, the patient reported an uneventful initial recovery followed by an on-going pain and swelling in the posterior aspect of his knee, which started around 9 months after his surgery. He noted that the symptoms had evolved to a more constant background ache with consistent activity related pain alongside more stiffness over the last month.\nThe pain triggered his attendance to a community hospital on multiple occasions. The patient reported no specific history of trauma, but he remembers tripping while walking around the time of onset of recurrent symptoms. He complained of variable pain at the back of his knee which would ease, but never fully resolved. The main area of discomfort was around the medial hamstring tendons. At every attendance to the community hospital, he was assessed and reassured that this was most likely to be a hamstring strain and consequently, discharged with analgesia without any requirement of further investigation or discussion with our arthroplasty department.\nAt the 1 year follow-up appointment, radiographs (Fig. 4) were obtained which indicated that the polyethylene inserted was in fact dislocated posteriorly toward the popliteal fossa, into soft tissues adjacent to the neurovascular bundle, with consequent direct contact of metal components.\nClinical examination revealed a moderately swollen knee with a minimal effusion, with the affected limb noted to be in a greater varus alignment at the knee compared to the other leg. The range of motion was 10\u2013125\u00b0 with no noted major instability, and the varus was not fully correctable.

    "cleaned_text": "a 62-year-old man attended his routine 1 year follow-up consultation following an uncomplicated ukr with a mobile bearing. during this appointment, the patient reported an uneventful initial recovery followed by an on-going pain and swelling in the posterior aspect of his knee, which started around 9 months after his surgery. he noted that the symptoms had evolved to a more constant background ache with consistent activity related pain alongside more stiffness over the last month.\nthe pain triggered his attendance to a community hospital on multiple occasions. the patient reported no specific history of trauma, but he remembers tripping while walking around the time of onset of recurrent symptoms. he complained of variable pain at the back of his knee which would ease, but never fully resolved. the main area of discomfort was around the medial hamstring tendons. at every attendance to the community hospital, he was assessed and reassured that this was most likely to be a hamstring strain and consequently, discharged with analgesia without any requirement of further investigation or discussion with our arthroplasty department.\nat the 1 year follow-up appointment, radiographs (fig. 4) were obtained which indicated that the polyethylene inserted was in fact dislocated posteriorly toward the popliteal fossa, into soft tissues adjacent to the neurovascular bundle, with consequent direct contact of metal components.\nclinical examination revealed a moderately swollen knee with a minimal effusion, with the affected limb noted to be in a greater varus alignment at the knee compared to the other leg. the range of motion was 10\u2013125\u00b0 with no noted major instability, and the varus was not fully correctable. there was moderate tenderness in the medial proximal tibia and distal femur as well as tenderness and focal swelling in the medial aspect of his popliteal fossa and medial hamstring tendon area.\nthe patient underwent a surgical exploration which revealed that both the femoral and tibial components were severely abraded, with consequent severe metallosis within the synovium. the polyethylene insert was encapsulated in thick fibrous tissue in the posterior soft tissues at",

No history of trauma or hereditary involvement was reported. The patient showed a straight profile and a symmetric face without abnormal findings in extraoral examinations. Clinical intraoral examinations revealed permanent dentition with poor oral hygiene and multiple caries. The molar relationship was Angle class I in both sides. Maxillary and mandibular arcs were U-shaped with both midlines on (). In the anterior maxillary region, we came to the rare finding of twinning in both central incisors. Both centrals showed an abnormally large mesiodistal width. No lateral incisor existed in the right maxillary region. Instead, a mesiodistally large central existed with a dental projection on its palatal side extending from the cingulum and ending at a small groove in the incisor edge (Figures and ). At the left side of the anterior maxilla, both central and lateral incisors existed. The left maxillary incisor also showed a large mesiodistal width with a large groove on the palatal surface that extended up to the incisal edge (Figures and ). There was no tooth mobility and no tenderness to percussion and palpation tests. A severe response to cold and electric tests was observed in the anterior maxillary incisor teeth. History taking revealed that he has had a previous endodontic treatment of a maxillary premolar in the same department.
