Physical examination showed swelling of the left ankle joint, extensive tenderness, normal skin temperature, and limited range of motion for ankle plantar flexion and dorsi flexion. Venous blood test showed no abnormalities in ESR, CRP, and blood routine. Radiograph and MRI suggested hyperplasia of synovial tissue in the articular cavity and epiphyseal injury of the distal tibia. Ankle arthrocentesis was conducted, and a small amount of turbid liquid was drained. No diagnosis of ankle TB was suggested. Preoperative diagnoses were (1) traumatic ankle synovitis and (2) epiphyseal injury of the left distal tibia. We initially planned to perform articular cavity debridement; however, when we conducted the surgery, we saw obvious hyperplasia of synovial tissue and the cartilage was obviously damaged; TB was highly suspected. Considering that the patient was still a child, ankle arthrodesis was not suitable in this case. Therefore, we only performed articular cavity debridement after obtaining the tissue sample for biopsy. Pathological examination confirmed ankle TB, and the result was also positive for TB-PCR. The patient was prevented from weight bearing for 6 weeks postoperatively; anti-TB treatment of rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide were given orally; his nutrition was strengthened. Regular follow-ups were conducted. The swelling of the posterior malleolus was gradually relieved.

Although there were purulent ascites, remarkable redness, and edema of both the small intestine and bladder wall throughout the lower abdominal cavity, there was no perforation of the gastrointestinal or urinary tract (). Intraoperative Gram staining of purulent ascites in the abdominal cavity showed the presence of Gram-positive cocci.

He also had a history of anxiety and mood disorders, and had been taking clonazepam, 1 mg 4 times daily since 1999. At transplant evaluation, the patient had solid psychosocial support (family and counseling) and had a consistent ten year adherence to his MMT, including negative toxicological screens. The UCDMC transplant team determined that it would be in the patient's best interest to continue his MMT pre and post transplant.\nThe patient had a MELD score of 15 at the time of transplant. He tolerated the operation well with no major complications during surgery, although he did require more intraoperative anesthesia than the average non-MMT patient. Post-operative pain management during hospitalization required consultation with pain specialists and the doses of hydromorphone and morphine were higher than the average non -MMT transplant patients. On post-operative day six, the patient resumed a normal diet; his pain was managed with oral narcotic analgesics; he was fully ambulatory and was discharged from the hospital. Immediately post-transplant, the patient's methadone was 100 mg daily.\nIn June 2001, the patient showed biopsy proven recurrent HCV in the transplanted liver. There were no signs of rejection. The patient was continuing MMT ~80 mg daily and was compliant with his immunosuppressive therapy and transplant follow up care. In January 2002, the patient began HCV treatment using an escalating regimen of INF combined with RBV.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a tumor around the external iliac artery to the femoral artery just below the right abdominal wall (Fig. ). Fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed, and the findings were suggestive of DTF. In the 18th week of pregnancy, resection of the DTF was performed. Surgical biopsies of the tumor revealed a DTF and suggested a positive margin of the pelvic wall. Immunostaining was positive for \u03b2-catenin and negative for estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors (Fig. ). RT after surgery was not possible because the patient was pregnant.\nAt 3 years after surgery, marginal recurrence of DTF in the right pelvic wall was diagnosed by MRI. Cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor treatment was given for 1 year. However, MRI showed enlargement of the recurrent tumor measuring 6.8 \u00d7 10.0 cm in size (Fig. ), and swelling of her right leg occurred. Computed tomography showed severe right hydronephrosis (Fig. ). Her laboratory values included a serum creatinine level of 0.75 mg/dL.

She presented at our centre within an hour of injury, with left elbow tenderness and deformity. The hand was warm and fingers were pink with capillary refill time (CRT) less than 2 seconds. Radial and ulnar pulses were not palpable but weak signal was detectable by Doppler ultrasound. Pulse oximetry over the fingers ranged from 80-90%. Sensation and gross motor function were intact. Radiographs () showed a posterolateral dislocation of the elbow.

The elbow joint was immobilized with forearm in neutral position and 45 degrees flexion with a backslab, and was increased to 90 degrees flexion once swelling subsided. Post-reduction radiographs () showed a concentric reduction of the elbow joint. After reduction, pulses were not palpable but detectable by Doppler, pulse oximetry over fingertips rose to 100%. Neurovascular status remained the same while patient was in the ward.\nFour days later, she was re-examined and it was noted that the distal pulses were still not detectable by Doppler device, even though fingers were pink with CRT <2 seconds.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 68-year-old man with a 30-year history of hypertension and regular hemodialysis for 11 years who had undergone forearm arteriovenous fistula surgery to treat end-stage renal disease 9 years prior. A long-term hemodialysis catheter (14.5F/23 cm, BARD) had been placed in the right internal jugular vein for hemodialysis 2 years prior. 2 days before the current visit, the hemodialysis cuff catheter ports caused blood oozing during hemodialysis, and the right cuff catheter was pulled out to stop the blood oozing. 1 day before the current visit, a cuff catheter was placed in the patient's left internal jugular vein for hemodialysis. Using the Seldinger puncture technique, the operation was performed under DSA in an interventional radiology room. The cuff catheter was introduced via smooth introduction and positioning of the guidewires. After dilator and guidewire removal, the catheter was inserted into the left internal jugular vein with the removal of the peel-away sheaths (). The patient reported mild pain in the left side of his chest during catheterization.

Extravasation was also detected around the aneurysm in the PDA (Figure A), but no liquid was retained in the peritoneal cavity.

The aneurysm in the PDA accompanied by leakage of the contrast-enhanced agent had a diameter of 9.3 mm. IVR hemostasis was completed by PDA coil embolization. Subsequent SMA arteriography showed several collaterals other than embolized PDA perfusing the proper hepatic artery (Figure B). After IVR therapy, blood chemical analysis was monitored for several weeks, revealing that transaminase level was not elevated and hepatic infarction was considered negative. Obstruction of the duodenal passage resulting from the hematoma was observed for a few weeks; however, bypass surgery was not required as the obstruction was completely relieved as the hematoma was naturally and gradually absorbed.\nIn this case, collateral perfusion pathways from the SMA developed to compensate for the reduced CA blood flow due to MAL compression, and the aneurysm might have generated in the PDA due to the abnormal changes in hemodynamic flow.

The patient had a history of hypertension and left renal urolithiasis. CT showed a heterogeneous left upper pole renal tumor (5.3 cm in diameter). A laparoscopic radical nephrectomy was performed in May 2008. Left adrenalectomy and lymph node dissection were not performed because the CT scan showed no adrenal gland invasion or lymphadenopathy. The histological evaluation of the tissue revealed a clear cell renal cell carcinoma and negative surgical margins (pathological stage, T2N0M0). Three years after nephrectomy, following a cerebrovascular accident, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score changed from 0 to 2. No tumor recurrence (CT scan was performed every 6 months) was found until 51 months later. A CT scan detected two nodules in the renal fossa (1.8 and 0.9 cm, respectively). Retroperitoneal exploration confirmed recurrent clear cell carcinoma with microscopically positive surgical margins. Lymph node dissection was not performed because of severe adhesion around the aorta. Lymph nodes that could be detected by palpation were not identified during the surgery. Four months after excision, an abdominal CT showed a nodule (1.6 cm) over the right adrenal gland. At that time, tumor target therapy was not covered by the national health insurance in Taiwan. Therefore, because of economic reasons, the patient could not afford the treatment until 2013. A repeat CT evaluation confirmed the disease progression of the adrenal metastasis (2.1 cm). The patient was treated with sunitinib (37.5 mg/d) for 4 weeks, but the treatment was discontinued because of gastrointestinal side effects and fatigue.

He was taking donepezil for three years, initially for the period of a few weeks, 5 mg a day, then 10 mg a day in the evening. No symptoms indicating improper drug tolerance have been reported. He was referred for medical consultation due to sleep disturbances which had been intensifying for about four months. The amount of his night\u2019s sleep was decreased as he was waking up frequently at night, which was accompanied by increased daytime sleepiness. The patient fell asleep many times during the day, actually every time he was left alone. Excessive sleepiness and slightly increased irritability were observed also during the examination. It was noted that the patient was taking short naps even when the examiner was trying to talk to him and during the physical and psychometric examination. The patient demonstrated the sleep attacks which were similar to those seen in narcolepsy.\nThe severity of cognitive dysfunction was assessed as moderate. The patient scored 16.87 points in the MMSE scale (corrected by Mungas et al) and 32 points in the ADAS-cog scale. Basic biochemical tests, blood cell count and electrocardiogram did not reveal any clinically significant abnormalities. The MRI scan revealed no focal signs apart from the generalised cortical atrophy located mainly in temporal lobes. Initially, only the time of donepezil administration was changed from evening to morning; however, during the four-week follow-up period, no differences were observed with respect to the presented sleep disorders. During the following examination, methylphenidate was added in the initial dosage of 5 mg in the morning (extended-release tablets CR). As the carer reported, after the following four weeks the daytime sleepiness decreased, but it was still observed.

However, while the lump gradually enlarged, some symptoms, including gait disturbance, memory disturbance, and decreased activity, appeared and progressed rapidly, so his family members took him to our hospital. The subcutaneous lesion was an elastic hard, painless mass, but with normal colored skin. Blood examinations showed no immunodeficiency, virus infections, or other abnormalities. Computed tomography (CT) showed tumors with high density both in the subcutaneous and intracerebral regions of the left cranial vault, but no abnormalities in the skull bone (Fig. ). On conventional magnetic resonance imaging, T2-weighted imaging demonstrated the intracerebral tumor with high signal intensity surrounded by widespread edema in the white matter, leading to a midline shift (Fig. ). The tumor showed strong high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted imaging (Fig. ). T1-weighted imaging with contrast media homogeneously enhanced both circumscribed subcutaneous and intracerebral tumors and showed a finding that mimicked the dural tail sign (Fig. ), but there were no obvious changes in the skull structure. Based on the imaging findings, the tumor was suspected to be a meningioma, metastatic brain tumor, or malignant lymphoma.\nTo make a histological diagnosis, a craniotomy was performed under general anesthesia.

The local hospital diagnosed them by biopsy as leukoplakia, but did not treat them.\nThe patient came to our hospital as the situation worsened. On a physical examination, her face was symmetrical and not swollen. Extensive white lesions, with multiple peaks on their surfaces, were seen over the right bucca, which were coarse and tough on palpation, but with no congestion or erosion. A white patch like crepe paper was apparent on the C5-7 buccal gingiva and vestibular sulcus. An even white patch, with a soft mucosal texture was present on the left buccal mucosa, along the line of occlusion. White patches occurred from the palatal gingiva, close to A6-7, to the midline. Some white patches, similar in size to rice grains or soybeans, appeared over the lingual rim on both sides and the dorsum. A biopsy of the most affected part of the right bucca showed that the condition was verrucous leukoplakia with mild to moderate dysplasia (Figure ). By combining the characteristics of the oral lesions and the pathological changes, a primary diagnosis was drawn of either OVL or PVL. Because the patient rejected the surgery proposed by a maxillofacial surgeon combined with P53 biotreatment, we proceeded as follows: 1) an overall physical examination was suggested to exclude any hidden malignant tumour; 2) the patient's immunity was enhanced, and retinoic acid and nystatin were given as topical therapy; 3) close surveillance was undertaken, with periodic checks upon request. The physical examination revealed that the patient only suffered from chronic superficial antral gastritis, and no malignant tumour was found",

She had no history of periconceptional tobacco smoking, alcohol intake, radiation exposure, or intake of other supplements and drugs. She had no clinical problems during the early period of the current pregnancy; however, she did not undergo an ultrasound examination during the first trimester. At 36 weeks of gestation of the current pregnancy, a routine ultrasound examination revealed an abnormal number of umbilical cord vessels. A fetal ultrasound examination was performed using a GE Voluson\u2122 E10 ultrasound machine (General Electric Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan) with a 3.5-MHz convex-array transducer. The examination revealed the coexistence of a four-vessel part and a three-vessel part within the free loop of the umbilical cord (Fig. ). The fetal insertion site of the umbilical cord comprised four vessels (two arteries and two veins), whereas the placental insertion site comprised three vessels (two arteries and one vein). The blood flow was demonstrated in both veins by two sonographic specialists in maternal fetal medicine, and the flow was similar in each vessel. However, we were unable to prenatally detect the exact point at which the umbilical cord changed from a four-vessel to a three-vessel cord. The intra-abdominal umbilical vein was a single vessel that was connected to the ductus venosus and returned to the right atrium (Fig. ). No other sonographic congenital abnormalities were detected on fetal ultrasound screening performed in accordance with the recommendations of the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology [].\nAt 38 weeks of gestation, a healthy female neonate weighing 2726 g was delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery.

The medical history was unremarkable and did not have any history of daily medication. No gross facial asymmetry was evident. She had no abrasions on the lower or upper lip. Her temporomandibular joints were functioning within limits and with no clicking, pain, or any abnormal mandibular deviation. On intraoral examination, the patient had a complete set of primary dentition and had moderate oral hygiene, with mild plaque deposits at the gingival margins. There was a fracture in the right maxillary canine (tooth number 53) with the oblique fracture line extending subgingivally (). Radiograph (IOPA) taken in the right anterior region of the jaw (tooth number 53) revealed evidence of fracture line running 2 mm below the cementoenamel junction and involving the pulp ().\nThe treatment options and prognosis for tooth 53 were discussed with the patient's mother. Preoperative photographs were taken, and local anaesthesia was administered (2% xylocaine with 1 : 80,000 adrenaline) on the buccal and palatal aspects of tooth 53. The mobile tooth fragment was extracted, and the remaining tooth structure was surgically extruded using a maxillary anterior forceps (). Occlusion was checked to ensure that there are no occlusal interferences. Acid etching of tooth numbers 51, 52, 53, and 54 was done. The bonding agent was applied, and a semirigid splint was placed and stabilised using a flowable composite ().

She has had a slowly enlarging growth on her left breast for the past two years, which initially started as a small papular lesion in the nipple areolar complex. Most recently, the mass became ulcerated with active serous discharge; however, due to the lack of health insurance, the patient did not seek any medical attention. For the past two days prior to presentation, she developed significant bleeding and oozing from the ulcerated mass, forcing her to report to the ED. There was associated localized breast pain, but no weight loss, fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, back pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, cough, blurry vision, nor headaches.\nShe had no prior personal or family history of skin and breast cancers. She had no history of excessive exposure to sunlight, radiation exposure, arsenic ingestion, or a history of immunosuppression.\nPhysical examination reveals an elderly female in no apparent distress. Vital signs were stable apart from an elevated blood pressure of 164/85 mmHg. Examination of the left breast revealed a large fungating mass of >10 cm in size, occupying most of the mid and outer breast with a distortion of the nipple areolar complex (). There were several open wounds with active bleeding and a foul smell. The area of erythema was noted. There were palpable left axillary lymph nodes. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nThe provisional diagnosis was breast cancer with possible metastasis. Subsequently, the patient underwent workup to further characterize the mass and assess for metastasis. Computer tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was positive for a large, partially enhancing heterogeneous mass in the left breast and a calcified granuloma in the right lung field, in addition to mildly enlarged left axillary lymph nodes.

    "original_text": "Case 1 was a 15-year-old African American adolescent boy who was admitted to the hospital for rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement treatment, and hypertensive crisis. Before the first VR gaming session, early mobility therapists noted that the patient was not very responsive to physical therapy. He was asleep or lying down most of the day and did not communicate much with the hospital staff. His therapist noted that he was very interested in trying the VR gaming. His mother stated that he could spend many hours a day playing video games at home, but he had no prior experience playing VR games. His favorite console games were racing or sports games. Case 1 completed 4 video gaming sessions.\nIn session 1 (October 26, 2020), he completed 22 minutes of play. He had the most success and spent the most time playing a semiactive narrative game (Wolves in the Walls). He was very focused and engaged with the game and completed an entire chapter of the story within the game. The game required minor head or neck movements and active reaching and chopping movements of the arms. He tried a more active game, Beat Saber, using the WalkinVR software. The interventionist boosted case 1\u2019s arm movements and increased the reach using the WalkinVR software, which allowed case 1 to successfully chop the boxes, but case 1 had difficulty keeping up with the rhythmic arm movements to successfully chop the boxes in the virtual world. The therapist reported that difficulty chopping was likely due to arm pain caused by rhabdomyolysis. At the end of session 1, case 1 requested to play boxing or racing for his next session. The hospital staff were amazed at how active and engaged case 1 was during the session. The nurse and therapist noted that this was the most awake they had ever seen him, as he slept most of the day.

The symptoms gradually worsened, causing difficulty in sleeping. A plain radiograph of the sacrum showed a slight abnormality of irregular cortex of the first sacral (S1) vertebra to the ala (). Computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor that occupied not only the left side of the S1 vertebra to the ala but also the spinal canal. Destruction of the bone was seen clearly in the left posterior ilium with a discontinuous cortex. The destruction was less obvious in the anterior cortex of the S1 vertebra, and the cortex was scalloped with remodeling, which is characteristic of benign bone lesions (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a lobulated lesion in the left sacrum with a homogenous low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and a high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. The tumor in the spinal canal compressed the cauda equina. Furthermore, the tumor extended along the S1 nerve root to the anterior sacrum, with the shape of a dumbbell in the enlarged S1 anterior foramen (). A needle biopsy was obtained from the posterior ilium. The histopathological diagnosis was a low-grade conventional chondrosarcoma (grade I). Because bone destruction was seen mainly in the posterior ilium, the tumor was assumed to originate from the ilium extending to the sacrum. After careful observation of our patient, the posterior iliac chondrosarcoma was found to have occurred on the anterior surface of the iliac tuberosity.\nThe tumor was preferentially resected en bloc. However, the lesions were extensively located in the bone. Taking into consideration the age of the patient, the pelvic ring was preserved. The lesion was resected in several blocks, and the tumor remaining in the bone was curetted. The patient was placed prone during the surgery.

The surface of the mass was uneven, hyperemic, and erosive, and ulceration was formed. The pathologic biopsy result was squamous cell carcinoma. The chest CT examination indicated the obvious thickening of the middle thoracic esophageal wall and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum (). On November 4, 2016, the patient accepted chemotherapy with cisplatin (40 mg, days 1\u20133) and docetaxel (120 mg, day 1) for one cycle. Five days after chemotherapy, the patient suddenly felt a sharp, tearing pain in the right chest, associated with fever, and the highest body temperature was up to 40\u00b0C. The thoracic CT indicated inflammatory changes in the lower lobe of the right lung and homolateral pleural hydropneumothorax. Iodine oil imaging of the upper gastrointestinal tract showed a fistula opening in the anterior right wall of the middle thoracic esophagus. The contrast agent slowly leaked into the thorax through the opening, confirming the occurrence of esophageal fistula due to the rupture of esophageal cancer. On that day, the patient was admitted for the insertion of a drainage tube into the thoracic cavity and placement of a duodenal nutrition tube to maintain nutrient intake. On November 26, 2016, an esophageal covered stent was placed into the esophagus through gastroscopy to block the fistula, and the patient was started on a liquid diet after 24 h. Considering the poor general condition of the patient (performance status score 3), who was unable to tolerate intravenous chemotherapy, treatment with oral fluorouracil (75 mg/twice daily) was started for four cycles, 21 days per cycle. During the treatment, the patient was in a stable condition, the diet was basically normal, and his weight was up about 4.5 kg.

Her pain originated following a fall onto her shoulder having been knocked off of a pushbike during a collision with a motor vehicle. The primary complaint was of pain, making the patient's work as a machinist difficult. She also complained of a visible but subtle deformity of her acromioclavicular joint resulting in problems keeping the strap of her bra in place.\nClinical examination in the outpatient clinic revealed an obvious acromioclavicular joint dislocation with palpable crepitus on reduction, dynamic instability on clinical testing, and painful movements above 90 degrees of forward flexion and abduction. Radiographs confirmed a diagnosis of grade II ACJ dislocation []. As she presented with a symptomatic shoulder, she was counseled for an elective ACJ reconstruction. This was a chronic ACJ dislocation and the indication for operation was pain with dynamic instability on clinical examination. At operation, she underwent an uncomplicated ACJ reconstruction using the synthetic ligament technique. Bone quality appeared normal intraoperatively and a chronic grade III injury was noted at time of operation in contrast to the preoperative imaging. Immediate postoperative radiographs were entirely satisfactory.\nFirst follow-up appointment at 2 weeks postoperatively demonstrated no obvious clinical concerns, good wound healing, and no signs of infection or of failure of reconstruction. For the first six weeks postoperative, she undertook passive shoulder exercises under the supervision of the physiotherapists with movement restricted to less than 90 degrees of forward elevation and abduction. At six weeks, this was increased to active range of movement exercises. Follow-up appointment at six weeks revealed no clinical problems and her preoperative symptoms had completely settled.\nAt 3-month follow-up, the patient reported a firm, painful lump that had developed in the region of the screw.

No face or upper extremity edema was found in physical examination. Enhanced chest computer tomography (CT) showed a size of 5.6*4.3 cm mass in anterior mediastinum, which was enhanced in the artery phase (Fig. ), and it had no clear boundary with left innominate vein and SVC. The CT report suggested high possibility of thymoma. Echocardiographic examination did not reveal any abnormality. Thymoma was diagnosed and he received operation in our hospital through median sternotomy on July 2019. During the operation, a dark red and saccular mass was found in anterior mediastinum with slight pulsation. The mass had no clear boundary with left innominate vein and further exploration revealed they were connected with each other. The membrane of the mass seemed to be very thin and easily bled when touched. Left innominate venous aneurysm with part of SVC involved was highly suspected.\nThe venous aneurysm was resected with the proximal and distal end of the left innominate vein blocked (Fig. ). However, the majority of the left innominate vein wall was involved and only a little part of vessel wall was left after the venous aneurysm was resected, which made the reconstruction of the left innominate vein necessary. Because of the misdiagnosis and lack of abundant preoperative preparation, we decided to take pericardium as material for repairment and reconstruction.

Emergency medical services were called at the nursing home and the patient was reportedly hypoxic with oxygen saturation in the 70s on room air with subsequent development of agitation and lethargy after the seizure. The patient was transferred to an outside hospital's emergency department (ED), where additional tonic-clonic activity was noted. She subsequently developed hypotension with a blood pressure of 52/36 mmHg that was refractory to crystalloid intravenous fluid resuscitation. Central venous catheter (CVC) was placed and norepinephrine was started for persistent hypotension. Labs were notable for leukocytosis, troponin elevation, and low mixed venous saturation on CVC venous blood gas. The patient was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care facility cardiac intensive care unit for evaluation of cardiogenic shock.\nUpon arrival, the patient was alert and following commands, but disoriented. She was still requiring supplemental oxygen and norepinephrine for hypotension. Given the concern for cardiogenic shock, a stat bedside transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained, which demonstrated a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. The patient was urgently taken to the cardiac catheterization lab for pericardiocentesis with a drain placement. This yielded 580 ml of hemorrhagic fluid with rapid improvement in hemodynamics following drainage. During the pericardiocentesis, fluoroscopy demonstrated two embolized fragments of the IVC filter within the right ventricle (RV). Review of past imaging revealed that the embolized fragment was visualized on computer tomography (CT) of the chest one year and one month prior to presentation.

Upon an objective examination, the thyroid gland appeared to be mildly enlarged (more on the right side of the neck) with a hard consistency, but mobile relative to the underlying tissues. The only comorbidity was a mental illness.\nAn ultrasound (US) of the neck was immediately performed and revealed a multinodular retrosternal goiter, for which the larger nodule in the right lobe presented with a diameter of approximately 6\u202fcm and complete ring calcification. The goiter extended into the upper mediastinum and was lying on the aortic arch.\nDue to the goiter\u2019s retrosternal configuration, we performed a CT scan of the neck and thorax. The scan showed the posterior dislocation of the epiaortic vessels and lateral dislocation and compression of the pharynx. The large nodule described previously based on US exhibited a mixed type of calcification; in fact, in the context of a large egg-shell calcification, multiple spots with microcalcifications were observed (A and B).\nGiven the notable dimensions of the goiter, its symptomatic disposition and the extreme calcification of the nodule, we chose to avoid an ultrasound-guided ago-biopsy due to the low probability of obtaining a good tissue sample and the consequent diagnosis, and in agreement with the patient\u2019s endocrinologist, we decided to directly perform a standard thyroidectomy through a cervicotomy.

Routine laboratory examination revealed no abnormal findings, and no leukocytosis and no eosinophilia was detected in the peripheral blood. Plain radiographs of the right femur showed multiple irregular radiopaque densities (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple elongated tubular tracts in subcutaneous tissue of thigh. Lesions showed low signal intensity on T1-weighted images, and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images ().\nSpecial laboratory investigations and ultrasonographic examination were not performed, because the patient decided to undergo surgery rapidly to clarify the etiology of the tumorous lesion and we did not suspect spargana infection.

She was diagnosed as having a left isomerism with inferior vena cava (IVC) interruption, dextrocardia, complete AVSD with single atrium, ventricular septal defect, and bilateral superior vena cava (SVC). She was diagnosed at another hospital at 10 years old due to symptoms of dyspnea on exertion. Because she showed severe pulmonary hypertension at that time, she was diagnosed as being in an inoperable state at another hospital. After discharge from the hospital, she did not visit any hospital for 10 years. After entrance into the University at the age of 20, she visited another hospital to check her medical status. She was diagnosed again, was not to be operated on, and prescribed with oral furosemide and digoxin. She visited our hospital again to get a secondary opinion. When she visited our hospital, she complained of exercise intolerance (difficult to climb 2 floor stairs, NYHA class III). On examination, she showed a palpable systolic impulse at the second left intercostal space with a grade of 3/6 systolic murmur and 2/6 diastolic murmur at the lower and upper left sternal border, respectively.\nA chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly and a dilated main pulmonary trunk and proximal branch PA (). An echocardiogram revealed that an inlet VSD was closed by an aneurysm and there was another 5 mm apical muscular VSD. From the cardiac computed tomography (CT), the MPA was measured to be 73 mm on the axial plane at the level of aorticopulmonary window (). A cardiac catheterization showed a mean PA pressure of 64 mmHg, a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 13.9 wood units at room air. The systemic arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) was measured to be 83% at room air. After oxygen (10 L/min) was supplied, the mean PA pressure was 60 mmHg, PVR was 8.3 Wood units",

The pain in both legs was aggravated with walking and relieved with rest, symptoms typical of neurogenic claudication. The patient reported that he had been shot in the left lateral side of the back on 1 year ago. We determined on physical examination that the wound on the left flank had already healed (). At the time that he was shot, the patient had no other complaints, except for pain at the entrance wound. At that time of gun shut, he had to have absolute bed rest and conservative treatment because of a liver injury caused by the gunshot. After several months of treatment, his liver was healed enough to ambulate and walk; however, he needed a cane to walk. After he started walking, he began to experience continuous radiating pain on both lower extremities.\nOn neurologic examination, dorsiflexion of the ankle and big toe on the right leg revealed mild motor weakness (Grade IV). The patient also complained of numbness on the right lower limb; however, patellar and Achilles reflexes were normal. On admission, his ESR and CRP were elevated slightly. Other laboratory findings were normal. A mild degree of voiding difficulty was detected, although that symptom did not bother the patient.\nPlain radiographs revealed a round, radiopaque mass in the spinal canal at the L3-4 level (). Non-contrast reconstructed CT images of the lumbar spine were taken after admission, which revealed that the bullet-shaped mass was within the spinal canal, pointing cephalic at the L3-4 interspace (). The bullet within the spinal canal was located in the intradural space, compressing the nerve root ().\nBecause of his claudication and pain, we decided to surgically remove the bullet from the spinal canal.
