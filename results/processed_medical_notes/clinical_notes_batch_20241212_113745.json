His medications upon admission were fluoxetine 20 mg every morning for depression, nortriptyline 25 mg at bedtime for sleep and depression, quetiapine 50 mg at bedtime and every 6 hours as needed for anxiety, prazosin 1 mg at bedtime for nightmares, pramipexole 0.5 mg at bedtime for restless legs syndrome, terazosin 5 mg at bedtime for benign prostatic hypertrophy, atenolol 50 mg daily, and spironolactone 50 mg daily, for hypertension. He had been on all these medications for at least 6 months, with no reported adverse effects. He had smoked 2 packs of cigarettes per day for the past year, and had previously smoked four packs per day, for about 30 years. The patient's diagnosis of restless legs syndrome was made before any treatment he received for mental illness, and was not thought to be a medication adverse effect. His laboratory studies were negative and he did not have anemia (his hemoglobin level was 13.5 just before his enrolment in the treatment program).\nThe patient ceased using alcohol 1 month before entering the treatment program. He denied using any alcohol throughout the duration of the residential program, and no such evidence was found to the contrary by his health care providers. Three weeks before completion of the program, he was prescribed varenicline for smoking cessation, at the manufacturer recommended titration.

The patient tested positive for COVID-19 and exhibited mild unspecified respiratory symptoms. He was subsequently discharged home to recover in isolation per the CDCs COVID-19 response protocols. One week later, the patient returned to the ED for ongoing symptoms and was admitted requiring supplemental oxygen for hypoxia. Upon admission to the hospital, the patient was noted to have difficulty standing and ambulating. Two days into his inpatient stay, the patient developed urinary retention issues requiring intermittent catheterization. Three days later, he developed facial weakness and numbness. The clinical diagnosis of GBS was suspected and subsequent EDX studies reported AIDP. The patient was treated with a five-day course of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG). Three days after the completion of his IVIG treatment, the patient noted improvement with right upper extremity anti-gravity strength.\nThe patient was transferred to inpatient rehabilitation with significant proximal lower extremity weakness.

She had gone to her primary care physician, who performed a chest X-ray and urged her to come to the hospital. Upon presentation at the emergency department, her oxygen saturation was above 95% on room air, and she was not in any respiratory distress, but her exam was significant for decreased breath sound on the right. A chest X-ray confirmed a large right-sided pneumothorax with small pleural effusion. A chest tube was inserted on the right side for the resolution of the pneumothorax, and subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed bilateral diffuse bullous disease of the lung with multiple cysts (Figure -). The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for right thoracoscopic wedge resection of a lung bleb and talc pleurodesis. Gross examination of the specimen revealed several dilated air-like spaces ranging from 0.2 cm to 0.4 cm in size. The hospital course was complicated by postsurgical pneumonia, but she recovered fully and was discharged to home with only minimal symptoms of dyspnea on exertion. Upon further investigations, she was found to have multiple small lesions of angiomyolipoma on the right kidney with diffuse retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. One of the lymph nodes was biopsied, and pathology revealed predominantly spindle cells positive for HHF35 and smooth muscle actin, consistent with the diagnosis of leiomyoma. At the eight-month follow-up at the pulmonology clinic, her pulmonary function test (PFT) showed normal vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), but moderately reduced diffusion capacity, which may also be related to LAM. At her 12-month and 24-month follow-up visits, her PFT results showed improvements in peak flow and diffusion capacity, and the patient continues to report no symptoms other than minimal dyspnea on exertion.",

Three months earlier, she had caries filled in the same region. Intraoral examination revealed that tooth #13 had an existing distal occlusal composite restoration. Tooth #13 showed sensitivity to pulp test and no sensitivity to palpation and percussion. Radiographic examination showed distal a filling shadow close to the pulp and a fully developed root and closed apex (). On the basis of the results of the clinical and radiographic examinations, the diagnosis for tooth #13 was chronic pulpitis.\nAn informed consent was obtained from the patient and her parent for regenerative endodontic treatment.

He was started on a first-line systemic therapy of bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP). Bleomycin (30 units) was administered on days 2, 9 and 16; etoposide (100 mg/m2 intravenously) on days 1 to 5; and cisplatin (20 mg/m2 intravenously) on days 1 to 5 every three weeks for a total of four cycles.

Following chemotherapy, the patient achieved a complete response to treatment with resolution of the SVC syndrome. His anterior mediastinal mass decreased substantially in size, with a complete normalization of the standardized uptake value (SUV) by computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET); his beta human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-HCG) level decreased from 5452 to an undetectable level; and his alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level remained within the normal range. He tolerated the chemotherapy without any adverse side effects.\nThree months after the treatment, he presented at the emergency department at Stony Brook University Medical Center, having suffered from progressive shortness of breath for three days but without any other obvious precipitating factors. He was not on any medication and he did not have any gastrointestinal symptoms. Physical examination revealed tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia and decreased breath sounds with fine crackles bilaterally. Chest X-ray showed a right lower lobe infiltrate. Interestingly, his eosinophil count had increased from a baseline level of 2% to 10%, although his total white blood cell count was within the normal range. Subsequent CT of his chest showed extensive patchy ground-glass opacities in the right upper lobe, middle lobe and left lung without evidence of any pulmonary embolism (Figure ). He was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin empirically for community acquired pneumonia. Because he did not respond",

FNA were performed twice prior to the visit to our hospital, but the results of the cytological evaluations at both instances were atypia of undetermined significance (AUS). The patient had no clinical symptoms and the laboratory results were in normal range. Ultrasonography, performed at our hospital, revealed the presence of a relatively well circumscribed mass (2.2 cm in diameter) with microcalcifications on the right lobe of the thyroid gland (Fig. a). Additionally, another FNA conducted at our hospital. The cytologic evaluation showed some follicular cells with enlarged nuclei and pale chromatin pattern. However, the cytologic findings were not sufficient to diagnose a specific tumor, thereafter we diagnosed the cytologic specimen as AUS (Fig. b). Subsequently, the patient underwent right hemithyroidectomy for diagnostic and treatment purposes.\nThe results of the cytology could not confirm whether the mass was benign or malignant. Hence, histologic evaluation of a frozen section using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was performed. A relatively well-circumscribed mass comprising cells that were mostly arranged in a trabecular or solid sheet-like pattern and intersected by homogenous eosinophilic material was noted (Fig. ). The tumor cells consisted of amphophilic cytoplasm and round to oval-shaped nuclei with condensed chromatin and indistinct nucleoli (Fig. b). The eosinophilic material was suspected to be amyloid deposition and the mass was diagnosed as a medullary thyroid carcinoma. Neck lymph node dissection was additionally performed due to the results of the frozen biopsy. And the patient has been warned that if the results of permanent biopsy was confirmed to medullary thyroid carcinoma as of the frozen biopsy, total thyroidectomy is necessary.\nSubsequently, a permanent section obtained from the patient was evaluated.

There were no other associated symptoms. Clinical examination revealed a nontender swelling on the left posterior part of tongue. The mass was firm in consistency, oval in shape, and had an intact mucosal covering, not associated with ulceration, and was not attached to any underlying tissue. Neck examination revealed palpable ipsilateral submandibular and jugulodigastric lymph nodes. A clinical diagnosis of hemangioma was suspected. CT angiogram revealed a left sided highly vascular lesion. Three months later, the patient came back with symptomatic dysphagia, chewing difficulty, and difficulty in breathing especially while sleeping, and CT scan showed a slight increase in the size of the mass.\nSince the possibility of tongue cancer could not be ruled out in the presence of alarming compressive symptoms, incisional biopsy was planned. During the procedure, a significant bleeding was encountered which was difficult to be controlled with diathermy, local anesthesia, pressure packing and surgicel. Thus, it was decided to abort the procedure after hemostasis was completely secured, and the patient was extubated without any complications. Following incisional biopsy, selective embolization of the left lingual artery achieved a near complete devascularization of the mass. Then the patient was sent back for lip-split, mandibulotomy for access and excision of the left tongue tumor. Suturing on the muscle and in the mucosa was performed with 2-0 Vicryl and 3-0 Vicryl and the defect was closed primarily. Postoperative period was unremarkable.\nThree weeks after excision of the tumor, radiological evaluation was performed using PET/Scan and neck MRI.

Her medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes and arterial hypertension and was negative for eye surgery and systemic autoimmune disease. The patient denied recent ocular trauma, night sweats, fevers, skin rashes, or joint pains. Examination revealed visual acuity of 7/10 in the right eye and hand motion in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination showed large necrosis at the surgical site of pterygium excision with many small and large purulent appearing subconjunctival abscesses with a conjunctival and scleral injection of the left eye (Figure ). There was a slight Tyndall phenomenon in the anterior chamber and moderate corneal edema with a number of blood vessels in the cornea and iridocapsular synechiae. Extraocular motility examination revealed mild limitation of abduction in the left eye with normal adduction. Intraocular pressure was normal. Fundus examination was not possible because of corneal edema. The right eye was in perfect condition. A general physical examination was performed, and there was no evidence of systemic vasculitis or arthritis. Surgical debridement of all the subconjunctival abscesses was realized. A culture specimen of this tissue was obtained and was negative. Associated systemic conditions were investigated with chest X-ray and blood tests, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), complete blood count, serum uric acid, syphilis serology, serum antibody screen (rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, anti-DNA antibodies), circulating immune complexes, all of which were normal, apart from a mildly elevated ESR at 18mm/h. At this stage, the patient was suspected as having scleritis following pterygium surgery without any sound argument for infectious or autoimmune origin. In view of the foregoing and because of the poor prognoses of both presentations, the patient was started on high-dose intravenous steroid therapy: methylprednisolone 1000 mg/d for three days in combination",

However, there was minimal drain output and little swing. Subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest detected a left diaphragm rupture with a large diaphragmatic hernia where most of the left thorax was replaced by intra-abdominal contents (Fig. ). A decision was made for emergency laparotomy to repair the diaphragmatic hernia. The patient was intubated in the emergency department prior to transfer to the operating theatre. While no ventilation problems were noted during transfer, the patient\u2019s abdomen was seen to become progressively more distended to a point where it became tight and tympanic on percussion (Fig. ).

The large hernia containing spleen, stomach and small bowel was reduced and the posterolateral diaphragmatic defect was repaired with a non-absorbable suture. This was followed by a left thoracotomy that identified a superficial laceration in the left upper lobe of the lung which was repaired with Prolene sutures and re-enforced with tissue glue.

Post discharge, she was off antibiotics, but continued heroin and methamphetamine and was taking multiple dose of ibuprofen in addition for pain control. On admission, her physical exam was notable for severe tenderness in her right hip, marked bilateral lower extremity edema and multiple deep, circular, punched-out looking atrophic scars involving all extremities at prior skin popping (subcutaneous injection of illicit drugs) sites. Pertinent laboratory data included chronic anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, WBC count of 10.23 k/uL and a platelet count of 395 k/uL. She had negative HIV, Hepatitis B antibodies and elevated Hepatitis C antibody with undetectable Hepatitis C viral load. Her basic metabolic profile noted a sodium of 140 mmol/L, potassium of 3.5 mmol/L and a creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL (estimated glomerular filtration rate of 17 ml/min) which was a significant rise from the normal creatinine levels a month earlier. Her urine analysis noted >500mg/dL proteinuria with a protein/creatinine ratio of 28.25. She had no monoclonal proteins on serum or urine electrophoresis. CT scan of her right hip noted marked degenerative changes in the right hip, with right acetabular protrusion and cortical disruption of the medial acetabular wall. She was diagnosed with right hip osteomyelitis and was in acute renal failure with evidence of nephrotic range proteinuria. She was placed on antibiotics (daptomycin) and underwent hip arthroscopy with irrigation and debridement along with lavage shortly after admission.

She was a non-smoker and had a family history of breast cancer and prostate cancer. Physical examination demonstrated a 3 \u00d7 3 cm mass in the 10 to 11-o\u2019clock position in the superior aspect of the left breast and a 2 cm lymph node in the left axilla. Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy performed in February 2005 demonstrated an estrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu)-negative invasive mammary carcinoma of the left breast [modified Black\u2019s nuclear grade 1 (well differentiated)], carcinoma in situ, low grade, solid type, without necrosis). CT scans indicated no evidence of metastasis; however, fine-needle aspiration of the left axilla lymph nodes demonstrated metastatic carcinoma consistent with the primary breast tumor.\nIn March 2005, the patient was enrolled on a clinical trial that included weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy for 12 cycles followed by six cycles of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide. Four months later, imaging studies indicated a reduction in tumor size. In September 2005, she underwent a left skin-sparing total mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection followed by delayed reconstruction using a submuscular tissue expander. Then, from October to December 2005, she underwent post-operative adjuvant radiation therapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions to the left central chest and left lateral chest wall with an additional 10 Gy boost to the tumor bed). She also intermittently received Tamoxifen between 2005 and 2008. In December 2006, imagining studies demonstrated bone metastasis and the patient was treated with radiation therapy and anastrozole plus fulvestrant from December 2006 to March 2014.

It started gradually, progressing to 7/10 intensity over the previous three months. It was episodic, triggered by heat, lasted from two to ten hours and relieved by external cooling. It radiated from his ankles to toes bilaterally and was associated with warmth, redness, and swelling. The patient had developed significant functional impairment including inability to run/walk long distances as these activities triggered his symptoms. He had been immersing his feet in cold water and cooling them in front of the air conditioning for 4-6 hours a day to alleviate his symptoms. One week prior to presentation, he had developed painful blisters on both feet expressing serous fluid. He denied fevers, chills, trauma, purulent discharge, bleeding, similar previous episodes or family history of a similar rash. His primary care physician prescribed gabapentin which did not relieve his symptoms. The patient had no complaints of the upper extremities or digits. On presentation, vital signs were stable, patient was afebrile. The physical examination was unremarkable except for edema, erythema, and tenderness to palpation on light touch on both feet and ankle. No motor and sensory changes were noticed. Pulses were palpable bilaterally. .\nDifferential diagnosis included acute infection i.e. cellulitis secondary to repeated cold water immersions and dry air cooling as well as secondary erythromelalgia from autoimmune disorders, sexually transmitted infections and myeloproliferative syndromes. Consequently, Rheumatology service was consulted, and recommended work-up for secondary causes of EM.

A CT scan revealed an aortic dissection (Stanford type B) combined with a massive aneurysmal dilatation, and the intimal tear site was nearly 2 cm from the left suclavian artery. Because the aortic aneurysm involved an aortic arch, the proximal landing zone was less than 1 cm wide (). Because of his age and the characteristics of the lesion, there was the possibility of further operation related complication (perioperative mortality, morbidity, stroke, paraplegia etc.) and the patient did not want open surgery; we therefore decided to perform TEVAR rather than open surgery. The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory and an arteriotomy for the left femoral artery was performed under general anesthesia. The 035 inch wire was placed in the ascending aorta and the left subclavian artery through the left radial approach. The aortogram confirmed a large aortic aneurysm adjacent to the origin of the left subclavian artery. Two thirds of the origin of the left common carotid artery was covered by the proximal part of a 40\u00d7160 mm SEAL thoracic aortic stent (S&G biotech, Seongnam, Korea) to achieve an adequate landing zone. Another 40\u00d7130 mm SEAL thoracic aortic stent (S&G biotech, Seongnam, Korea) was deployed in the first aortic stent graft with a 7 cm overlapped segment to protect against disconnection of the aortic stent grafts. After selection of the left common carotid artery using a 5 Fr Judkin right catheter through the gap between the stent graft and the left carotid artery, we passed a 035 inch Amplatz stiff wire into the left carotid artery through the right femoral artery. An 8\u00d760 mm SMART nitinol stent (Cordis, Hialeah, FL, USA) was then deployed into the left common carotid artery. The final angiogram showed excellent",

    "original_text": "A 68-year-old asthmatic male patient presented to our center with 12 days history of melena. He denied any previous episode of melena or hematochezia or bleeding from another site. The patient did not have any other associated symptom, and had no other co-morbidities, or medication use. Upon referral, he was uncomfortable and looked pale. He was vitally unstable, with a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg and a pulse rate of 120 beats/min. The examination revealed the presence of clotted blood on the anal verge, and some tarry stool on digital rectal examination. The hemoglobin level was 7.7 g/dl, the hematocrit was 22.8, and the blood urea nitrogen was 8 mg/dl. The prothrombin time and the partial thromboplastin time were normal.\nResuscitation was performed with transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells and intravenous fluids. He was admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring. After admission and stabilization, upper and lower endoscopies were performed without demonstrating the bleeding site. They only revealed clotted and red blood throughout the colon.\nTechnetium-labeled red blood cell bleeding scan was done to localize the site of bleeding. This scan showed no evidence of early focal increased uptake in the abdomen to indicate active gastrointestinal bleeding during early images, but in the delayed images, it revealed that there was a focal uptake in the right and transverse colon. After that, capsule endoscopy was also performed without findings. As the angiography became available, the patient underwent selective angiography without findings noted at that time. These tests were inconclusive because they were performed while the episodes of bleeding ceased.\nAfter 8 days of conservative management and negative investigations to define the cause of the bleeding, a sudden drop in hemoglobin level from 10.8 mg/dl to 6.9 mg/dl occurred over 12 h, which mandated operative management. Exploratory laparotomy was performed. Extensive jejunal saccular pouches were found 10 cm",

His blood pressure was 70/30 mm Hg and pulse rate 120 per minute. The right radial pulse was impalpable due to a compound fracture of the arm. There was a 4-cm wound in the right sixth intercostal space in the midclavicular line. The abdomen was tense and tender all over. Abdominal ultrasonography was positive for hemoperitoneum. A right-sided intercostal drainage tube was inserted for hemopneumothorax.\nExploratory laparotomy was carried out. Two liters of blood were found in the peritoneal cavity. The liver was lacerated and actively bleeding. The gallbladder was found injured; cholecystectomy was done. Suturing of the liver did not control the bleeding. Thus, a decision was made to insert perihepatic packs. Two gastric perforations were repaired. A 6 cm \u00d7 3 cm \u00d7 2 cm shrapnel was found anterior to the first part of the duodenum (). A drain was left near the Morrison's pouch.\nThe vascular surgeon explored the lacerated wound of the right arm and found that the ulnar artery was completely transected at the bifurcation of the brachial artery. Reconstruction was accomplished using a brachio-ulnar reversed saphenous vein graft.\nOn the first postoperative day one liter of blood was recovered from the abdominal drain. On the third postoperative day and before shifting the patient to the operating theatre for packs removal, CT of the abdomen was done; showed a 3 cm \u00d7 1.8 cm IHPA of the left hepatic artery (). Hepatic angiography confirmed the presence of the IHPA emerging from a side branch of the left hepatic artery (). Microcoil embolization of both afferent and efferent loops of the aneurysm was done (). The perihepatic packs were removed on the same day. There was mild oozing",

    "original_text": "A 56-year-old male, 168 cm tall and weighing 71 kg, with a traumatic right rotator cuff injury, was scheduled for arthroscopic reconstruction surgery under general anesthesia. This patient had a history of diabetes mellitus and was taking oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin. For several years, he experienced recurrent episodes of severe left ocular pain and increased IOP, which later resolved. On close ophthalmic examination, he was diagnosed with Posner-Schlossman syndrome. There was mild epithelial edema of the cornea with a few keratic precipitates, and his cup/disc ratio was 0.5 with no visual field change. During the acute crisis period, the measured IOP in his left eye was above 30 mmHg and the IOP in his right eye was 13 mmHg. His symptoms were relieved after applying eye drops containing dorzolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, and prednisolone acetate, but frequently recurred. Three weeks before his scheduled surgery, the IOP in his left eye rose again and he became extremely anxious about the operation. After consultation with an ophthalmologist, we decided to measure the patient's IOP intraoperatively using portable tonometry, and obtained informed consent from the patient for this perioperative risk.\nPreoperative laboratory findings, including hemoglobin concentration, liver function and coagulation tests, and arterial blood gas analysis, were normal, as were chest X-rays. The patient had a left axis deviation and an incomplete right fascicular block on electrocardiography and a mild restrictive pattern on pulmonary function test without any significant symptoms. In the morning of the day of surgery, the patient received 7.5 mg of midazolam per os. Before entering the operating room, his vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 133/75 mmHg, a heart rate of 82 beats per min, and an oxygen saturation of 99%. Two drops of 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride were applied to each eye, and IOP was measured by portable tonometry (Tono-Pen Avia, Ametek, NY, USA) ().",
