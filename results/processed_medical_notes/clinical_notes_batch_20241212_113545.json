On physical examination, tenderness, swelling, angulation, and crepitus on right upper arm were noticed. Radiographs of the arm revealed a humeral shaft fracture with intramedullary patchy signs of osteoporosis []. After correlating with history, physical examination and radiographs, a diagnosis of pathologic fracture shaft humerus was made. Bone scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right arm were then performed. Bone scan revealed mild nonspecific uptake intensity on shaft of humerus []. No other skeletal abnormalities were noticed on the scan. On MRI, T1-weighted image showed medium intensity at the bone marrow, and high signal intensity at the same area was shown on T2-weighted image. Findings also revealed cortical bone erosion and heterogeneity around fracture lesion with multiple bone absorption []. MRI findings suggested avascular tumor such as hemangioendothelioma or hemangioma. Blood parameters such as calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcine, and calcitonin were all within normal range. Rheumatoid factor was negative. Patient then underwent the curettage with biopsy with open reduction and internal fixation using Limited Contact Dynamic Compression Plate (LC-DCP, Synthes\u00a9, Paoli, [PA], USA) on June 2005. Intra operative findings revealed a fibrotic mass located in the medullary cavity and signs of cortical thinning. Histopathological result was chronic inflammation with vascular proliferation. Therefore, he wasn\u2019t diagnosed as Gorham's disease. 7 months postsurgery, the patient consulted the emergency room complaining of right upper arm pain that occurred while trying to stand up after leaning on his right side.

    "original_text": "A 78-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes mellitus, presented to our emergency setting with complaints of recurrent bouts of abdominal pain and fluctuating fevers for the previous two weeks. The patient reported that the pain is a new manifestation of a previously dull aching pain that had waxed and waned over the last decade. His description alluded to a pain that was sharp and intermittent with localization in the right upper quadrant. He could not attribute the intermittent nature of his predicament to any aggravating or relieving influences. The pain was associated with fluctuating low-grade fevers (99\u00b0F-100\u00b0F), anorexia, and an associated 13-pound weight loss, which culminated in a visit to our clinical setup.\nFurther interrogation disclosed that the patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 2003. The ensuing year was relatively pain-free but was followed by recurrent bouts of right upper quadrant pain, albeit less upsetting than his current presentation.

She reported to the outside center with a 7-month history of progressive fatigue, hemoptysis, splinter hemorrhages and diffuse joint pain that involved both knees, hips, and left wrist. At the outside hospital her severe anemia persisted despite 9 units of PRBC transfusions. She underwent extensive assessment including esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy. EGD revealed gastric lesions consistent with AVMs while colonoscopy was negative. A bronchoscopy was negative but CT imaging showed liver and lung lesions of unknown etiology. On presentation to our center, vitals and physical examination were unremarkable. Initial blood work was remarkable for anemia, thrombocytopenia and hypokalemia. Repeat EGD and capsule endoscopy revealed active bleeding in the duodenum secondary to diffuse mucosal vascular lesions. Due to persistent bleeding she was transferred to the intermediate care unit (IMC) for closer monitoring. She continued to receive transfusions of PRBCs, FFP, cryoprecipitate, and platelets on a daily basis. During her hospitalization, she received a total of 4 EGD, 2 capsules and a push enteroscopy with similar findings of blood in the stomach, duodenum and small bowel with scattered AVMs, which were repeatedly cauterized.

Initial evaluation showed a left atrial mass and a separate mass adherent to the mitral valve for which the patient underwent surgical resection and mechanical mitral valve replacement. The diagnosis of noninfectious hypereosinophilic granulomatous disease was made by histopathologic evaluation. The patient underwent treatment with imatinib mesylate and a 5-month steroid course, which eventually led to complete resolution of eosinophilia, residual masses, and symptoms.\nIn December of 2009, the patient presented to an outside facility with fevers, night sweats, and weight loss and was diagnosed with subacute mechanical valve endocarditis from Streptococcus viridians. TTE noted multiple large vegetations at the four and five o'clock positions of the mechanical valve. The patient underwent a second mitral valve replacement using a 29 mm St. Jude mechanical valve, with a cross-clamp time of 85 minutes and total bypass time of 132 minutes. Intra-operative TEE was performed without mention of aortic valve injury or regurgitation. Pathology review of the prosthetic valve vegetations showed focal necrosis with fibrinous exudates without prominent eosinophilia. A two-day postoperative TTE report noted new mild to moderate aortic insufficiency. His postoperative course was significant for atrial flutter and mild congestive heart failure symptoms.

The local temperature was raised. The range of motion was terminally restricted in flexion and was associated with pain. No deformity was noted, however, mediolatera instability was present. Patient was neurologically intact and distal pulsations were well felt.\nRadiologically, there was osteolysis over the anterior femoral cortex, posterior femoral condyles and under the tibial base plate []. Complete hematological study and urine microscopy revealed no significant abnormality besides elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (75 mm at 1 hour) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (84 mg/l).\nKnee joint aspiration was carried out under sterile conditions.

A right middle cerebral artery infarct was diagnosed. He was treated with thrombolysis and made a good recovery. An echocardiogram at the time showed a thickened interventricular septum (1.3 cm), a mildly dilated left ventricle, and impaired systolic function with an estimated ejection fraction of 40\u201350 %.\nHe had a normal birth and childhood. There were no other specific medical issues. The family is non-consanguineous of English background. He has three siblings\u2014an elder brother in his 50s with type 2 diabetes and two younger sisters, in their 40s. None of his siblings have known cardiac disease. A paternal grandfather died from a myocardial infarction aged 63 years. A paternal aunt had a valve replacement. There is no other cardiac history within the family.\nHe remained well until aged 50 years when he developed palpitations, sweatiness and chest pain whilst driving. He was found to have ventricular tachycardia with presyncope and ECG showed sinus rhythm with markedly poor lateral R wave progression (Fig. ).

He had a background of hypothyroidism, hypertension and benign prostate hypertrophy. His initial imaging and swab test confirmed COVID-19. The patient was placed on a trial of continuous positive airway pressure to support his deteriorating oxygen saturation. However, after a week of supportive therapy, he was transferred to the ICU and was supported with mechanical ventilation and proning. The proning protocol used involves patients being proned for up to 18 hours a day ().\nWhile in ICU, the patient\u2019s recovery was impacted by a Klebsiella-positive pneumonia, and a subsequent CT scan showed multiple pulmonary emboli. This was treated with low molecular weight heparin. During the second week in ICU, the patient\u2019s critical care team identified anisocoria. They reported a left relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) with no new neurology or squint on gross assessment. There was no significant ocular history prior to this, and the patient\u2019s ICU team booked a CT scan of the head and accompanying venogram, which did not highlight any notable pathology and ruled out venous sinus thrombosis.\nAn ophthalmology review was requested: on bedside examination the patient appeared orthophoric and a ptosis assessment was difficult to assess as the patient was in a sedated state. Pupillary inspection revealed a notable anisocoria; the left pupil was measured at 6 mm and was fixed with no change in light or dark/dim lighting (). The right pupil was 3 mm in light and 4 mm in dark assessment. Assessment of the left pupillary reflex identified no direct or consensual response and an RAPD.

He was previously fit and well, a nonsmoker with an alcohol intake of approximately 10 units per month. The accident, in which his motorcycle collided with an oncoming vehicle, caused him to sustain multiple significant injuries including unstable pelvic fractures and femoral fractures. He had bilateral pneumothoraces, extensive pulmonary contusion, and a splenic hemorrhage. He presented in extremis with signs of hypovolemic shock. He was intubated and resuscitated using local major hemorrhage protocols to achieve a blood pressure of 159/93, receiving ten units of packed red cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma in the emergency department.\nHe underwent an emergency laparotomy and splenectomy and was subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit, where he became increasingly hypoxic with features of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This culminated in him receiving veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) from day 15 of his admission for 21 days. He returned to theater on day 21 for a massive haemothorax which required an emergency thoracotomy. After being decannulated from the ECMO circuit, he was stepped down to the general intensive care unit on day 36 and was transferred to the ward on day 55 before being discharged after a 4-month admission including a prolonged rehabilitation and recovery period.\nAfter presentation and commencement of ECMO, there was a relatively modest change in liver function tests. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increased from 55 to 143 IU/L between day 1 and day 6 of hospital admission and no persistent alanine transaminase (ALT) rise until after decannulation.

On arrival to the emergency room, he was requiring 6 L/min oxygen via nasal prongs to maintain saturations greater than 90%. Chest X-ray and chest computed tomography (CT) () suggested possible pneumonia overlying interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension. CT and ultrasound showed small left axillary lymph nodes unamenable to biopsy. Abdominal ultrasound was grossly normal. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with presumed pneumonia and started on antibiotics, antiviral agents, inhaled corticosteroid, and bronchodilator therapy, with enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.\nOver the next 5 days, the patient's oxygen saturation was kept above 90% with 8\u201310 L/min oxygen via nonrebreather mask. Barriers to diagnosis included inability to produce sputum despite induction, high oxygen demands contraindicating bronchoscopy, small lymph nodes unamenable to biopsy, and intolerance of supine position needed for perfusion scans. The patient was transferred to the Thoracic Surgery service for a surgical lung biopsy on day 6. However, the patient experienced right-sided chest pain, diaphoresis, and tachycardia of 160 beats per minute, followed by a convulsive episode with no postictal symptoms. After transfer to the intensive care unit, mean systemic arterial pressures were found to be low, with transient reduction to as low as 40 mmHg when the patient coughed or spoke. Transthoracic echocardiography () showed a dilated right ventricle with globally reduced systolic function. Right ventricular systolic pressures were shown to be 170 mmHg.

After two weeks, the lesion had become larger measuring 8 \u00d7 7 cm associated with anemia (hemoglobin = 9 mg/dl) and thrombocytopenia ( platelet count of 96 \u00d7 103 /\u03bcl). The platelet count decreased day by day and reached to 50 \u00d7 103 /\u03bcl and the mass occupied about 60% of arm length and circumference (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not considered for the neonate because no MRI was available in the medical center and the patient's condition did not allow him to be referred to another center for MRI. He was transferred to ICU receiving oral prednisolone 5 mg /kg /day, but the platelet count didn\u2019t rise and fell below 30 \u00d7 103 /\u03bcl. He then received 15 cc/kg platelet and intravenous methyl prednisolone (60mg/50cc DW, during three hours for five days). No rising in platelet count occurred. Meanwhile, the hemoglobin dropped to 4gr/dl. Despite platelet and packed red blood cell transfusions, no improvement occurred. So, subcutaneous injection of alpha interferon (5U/kg every other day) was considered as the next step. However, it was discontinued because of lack of effectiveness. In addition, the lesion was aspirated and the bulky mass was reduced in size but after 24 hours, it returned to its previous dimensions. The aspirated fluid was bloody and the pathology report was negative for malignancy. The patient became candidate of receiving vincristine, but his parents did not permit this treatment. However, the persistence of life-threatening thrombocytopenia needed further management. The alternative opinion was operation. Finally surgery was done with me",

    "original_text": "A 2-months-old boy presented to the pediatrician for routine vaccination. Seizing the opportunity of this appointment, the parents mentioned their worries about constipation and failure to thrive. Poor height and weight gain compared to the child\u2019s age was observed falling from the 50th centile for height and weight to the 10th centile. Physical examination revealed abdominal distension in the right flank and hypogastrium and diminished bowel sounds. On rectal examination the ampulla was empty, while the anal sphincter had normal tone.\nInitially a plain radiograph and an ultrasound exam of the abdomen were performed. A dilated bowel segment was imaged, in the right flank, full of feces with a peripheral intraluminal slit of air displacing other bowel loops to the left. Absence of air in the rectum was also observed (). The ultrasound exam revealed a hyperechoic \u00abline\u00bb with posterior acoustic shadow, consistent with presence of air (). Subsequently, 48 h after rectal examination a fluoroscopic barium enema was obtained. The barium sulfate (BaSO) relative high-density suspension was preferred over water soluble contrast because of its ability for fine-detailed delineation of a possible transition zone. The preparation with laxatives was omitted. The barium was diluted with saline instead of water, to avoid increased water absorption by the bowel surface and subsequently was heated up to body temperature.

The patient was then transported to a local emergency department, and en route she was given one dose 1 mg lorazepam (0.02 mg/kg) for tremulousness, suspected to be seizure-related, with no response. Upon arrival to the outside emergency room, she was unresponsive, normothermic, tachycardic with a heart rate of 150 bpm and with mild hypertension and the blood pressure of 130/84 mmHg. She had symmetric and reactive pupils on examination. She received an additional 1 mg of lorazepam for ongoing tremulous movements with no response. She had an unremarkable brain computerized tomography scan and cerebrospinal fluid studies. She had normal electrolytes and liver function test. In addition, urine toxicology screen, blood alcohol, acetaminophen, and aspirin level were negative. She received a normal saline bolus, and a dose of ceftriaxone was then transferred to our PICU with a diagnosis of status epilepticus and possible meningitis. Just prior to transport, she was started on propofol infusion at 20 mcg/kg/min. At admission to the PICU, her physical examination was notable for normothermia, normotension, and tremulous motor activity. She had no response to painful stimuli but had a normal pupillary examination. Her propofol infusion was discontinued immediately and on follow-up assessment, she was able to localize to pain.

The mother stated that for the past 18 months the patient used to cry every month for a few days with abdominal pain. She was found to hit her abdomen with the pain in the recent months. Initially, the pain was relieved with oral analgesics, but later she required parenteral analgesics for pain relief. Prior to her referral to the hospital, she was reviewed by a urologist in another hospital who found a right-sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter and treated her with a double J-stent which relieved her loin pain.\nThe mother noticed gradual abdominal enlargement in her daughter who had never menstruated.\nOn abdominal examination in our unit, a pelviabdominal mass reaching the xiphisternum was found which was tense and tender with a smooth contour.\nAn ultrasound scan of the pelvis and abdomen revealed a blind upper vagina and bicornuate uterus with the right horn containing the hematometra and fundus reaching the epigastrium. The left horn was rudimentary and noncommunicating with the endometrial cavity. There was a right hemorrhagic tuboovarian mass 7 cm \u00d7 7 cm with multiple cysts in the ovary. The left ovary appeared normal.\nBoth the kidneys and ureters were normal. Pelviabdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the above findings. Intravenous pyelography was within normal limits.\nA decision to undertake a laparotomy was taken to relieve her pain caused by the hematometra. This was explained to the parents, and written consent was obtained for possible hysterectomy.\nExamination under anesthesia revealed a blind lower vagina that measured 1.3 cm.

According to the previous hospital\u2019s medical records, a 9-hole locking plate (APIS\u00ae, Gwangju, Republic of Korea) was used for the distal tibia, with three 5.0-mm locking screws for proximal fixation and six 3.5-mm locking screws for distal fixation. Under spinal anesthesia, a plate removal surgery was performed, following which the fibular plate was easily removed. However, five of the six distal locking screws were damaged, and they could not be removed with a screwdriver. This situation was explained to the patient during the operation, and we could confirm that the patient wanted to remove the plate irrespective of the amount of time required. At the time, a tourniquet was used for approximately 1 h, and screw removal was attempted using a conical extraction screw, but only one of the six screws could be removed.

After initial resuscitation, he underwent surgical repair of his injury with ileostomy and primary repair of bladder neck injury. The perineum was contaminated with rectal content. After debridement and hemostasia, a delayed closure was planned. Patient had a stormy course in the intensive care unit (ICU), with the delayed abdominal closure being followed by wound dehiscence, ventilator-associated pneumonia and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was managed with ventilator support, antibiotics, parenteral nutritional, and thromboprophylasix with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Despite his stormy course, he was recovering from ARDS and healing perineal wound; In the 3rd week of his ICU admission, he had sudden bleeding from the bladder neck manifesting as hematuria through Foleys catheter and pericatheter bleeding from the urethra. The bleeding was managed with surgical exploration of perineal wound and direct compression. He was transfused with two unit of packed red blood cell (PRBC), and 1 gm of TA was ordered. But, by mistake, the patient received 10 gm of TA as bolus, followed by 1 gm infusion for 8 hrs. Patient was stabilized and was doing well on a ventilator until the attending nursing staff noticed pallor and coldness of the right lower limb after 6-8 hours of TA administration.

She followed normal psychomotor development and experienced no remarkable illness until the age of 4 years and 2 months when her parents noticed a rapid weight gain (about 1 kg every 10 to 15 days) due to excessive eating (she required six to seven big meals/day). Later, they observed her to have alterations in body secretion (decreased tears when crying, decreased nasal discharge, unfavorable body odor, and decreased sweating) in addition to blue cold extremities, diarrhea alternated with constipation, polyuria, and polydipsia. Two months after the onset of obesity she had urinary incontinence during night sleep. Then, significant behavioral changes developed including: mood alteration, anxiety episodes, rage attacks, nervousness, and aggressive behavior, in addition to recurrent fatigue, social withdrawal, prolonged periods of sleep (12 hours continuously), and difficulty staying awake during the day.

He was otherwise healthy, aside from type II diabetes mellitus and a distant history of sarcoidosis. Physical examination, as well as contrast-enhanced CT scan of the neck, showed a large base of tongue mass that crossed the midline and projected into the suprahyoid epiglottis. There was a 4.6 \u00d7 3.4 cm mass representing a necrotic confluence of lymph nodes in right level IIA and IIB. Biopsy confirmed non-keratinizing, HPV-OSCC. Immunohistochemistry p16 testing was used for HPV diagnosis. PET/CT scan demonstrated bilateral level III lymphadenopathy, but did not show evidence of distant metastases. The patient was diagnosed with a cT4aN2c HPV-OSCC and referred to the institutional tumor board where a recommendation for definitive chemoradiation was made. Staging was according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Seventh Edition. The patient received 70 Gy in 35 fractions to the primary site and involved nodes, with 56 Gy to the uninvolved regional nodes bilaterally, including the bilateral lateral retropharyngeal nodes. Due to the patient\u2019s comorbidities the concurrent chemotherapy consisted of intravenous cetuximab given as a loading dose of 400 mg/m2 one week prior to the initiation of radiotherapy, followed by seven weekly doses of 250 mg/m2 concurrent with radiotherapy.

Examination and investigations found an uncomplicated umbilical hernia, liver cirrhosis and ascites. The patient was admitted by the medical team, who investigated the patient for two weeks, eventually diagnosing a case of hepatitis B infection and decompensated liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh grade B). After two weeks under medical care and multiple ascitic tapping, the patient responded with a sudden gush of clear fluid and spontaneous evisceration of the omentum from the umbilical hernia (Figure ). The patient was referred from the medical team as a case of spontaneous umbilical hernia rupture and leaking ascitic fluid with omentum evisceration.\nAn urgent laparotomy was performed after preparation of the skin with an antiseptic solution. Excision of the umbilicus and eviscerated omentum was done. Aspiration of all ascitic fluid and samples were sent for cytology, biochemical, and microbiology testing. All abdominal viscera were examined, but no evidence of the recanalization of the umbilical vein was found.\nAfter placement of an abdominal drain, a blunt dissection was done between the posterior rectus sheath and the rectus abdominus to facilitate placement of the polypropylene mesh in a sublay position. The posterior rectus sheath was closed using 1/0 non-absorbable polypropylene stitch. The mesh was placed over the posterior rectus sheath and below the rectus abdominus. The anterior rectus sheath was closed using 1/10 polypropylene stitch, and the skin was closed using clips.\nPostoperatively, the patient stayed in the ICU for five days and was then moved to a regular ward. She received prophylactic broad spectrum antibiotics and albumin.

The patient had undergone curettage, open reduction and internal fixation at district general hospital. Histopathological examination after first surgery suggested fibrous dysplasia. On physical examination, the lump was palpable on his postero-medial thigh. The lumps were firm and non-tender on palpation, fixated, and the size was around 14 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 11 cm ().\nThe patient underwent diagnostical procedures, including a blood test, plain radiograph, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Laboratory findings were within normal ranges. A shows the pre-fracture condition 3 years ago, while B shows the fracture line in the diaphyseal of the left femur. C shows femoral radiograph that revealed lytic geographic lesion at femoral diaphysis, cortical disruption, interrupted periosteal reaction, soft tissue mass, and internal fixation attached to the femoral bone. Femoral MRI indicated a tumor on femoral diaphysis that measured 20 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 14 cm and displayed low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images. T2-weighted images displayed a heterogenous lesion, containing areas of low to hyperintense area. Some area showed metal artifacts due to metallic implants (). The histopathological result from core biopsy suggested chondrosarcoma.\nThe patient underwent total femur resection with wide surgical margin. He was placed on supine position.

In recent years, she has not had any immune system-related serious illnesses and conditions, such as asthma, allergies, and atopic dermatitis. Because of her condition, she experienced psychological changes in the workplace. She was initially treated with mometasone furoate, a topical corticosteroid, and oral cepharanthine to enhance blood flow. Despite compliance to treatment, AA progressed to diffuse AA. Initially, she was treated with intralesional triamcinolone acetonide (40 mg) five times per week between January and February 2011; triamcinolone acetonide has a potency that is five times that of methylprednisolone. However, her symptoms persisted.\nShe was referred to the dermatology department of our university hospital in June 2012. The result of the pull test at the margin of the alopecic lesions was positive. As further treatment to resolve alopecia, narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy and squaric acid dibutylester (SADBE) as a local autoimmune treatment were administered as an outpatient for four courses between June 2011 and March 2013. Her response was erratic. Therefore, systemic corticosteroid pulse therapy was administered (). The first course of 1,500 mg corticosteroid therapy in the hospital was administered in May 2013.

She had a past medical history of type 1 diabetes with recurrent DKA and end stage renal disease secondary to diabetic nephropathy on intermittent hemodialysis.

The patient had a previous failed right arm AV fistula so the left arm was avoided in hopes of future recovery of the left AV fistula.\nTwo weeks later during the course of her admission, she continued to have episodes of DKA, and inadvertently her PICC line was dislodged, requiring removal.

Ultrasound examination of the patient's left internal jugular showed significant narrowing.

Before TKA, the patient had a 45\u00b0 flexion contracture and severe varus deformity, according to the patient's records. The patient's knee had dislocated when she first tried to stand and walk on the second day after surgery. The day after the dislocation, the patient was referred to our institute (figure ). We attempted closed reduction of the dislocated knee in the operating room, but this was unsuccessful. In the first operation, size 5 femoral and size 4 tibial components (Genesis II, Smith & Nephew) of a non-posterior-stabilized prosthesis with a size 11 liner were inserted. Paramedian arthrotomy was performed via the previous longitudinal incision, and the knee was exposed. Eversion and lateral dislocation of the patella were attempted; however, the surrounding soft tissues were very tight and further proximal dissection and patellofemoral ligament resection was required to enable patellar eversion and knee flexion to 90\u00b0. The liner was then removed. After placing the retractors in the appropriate sites, we observed that the lateral collateral ligament, arcuate ligament, and popliteus tendon were severely torn, with inadequate release of the medial structures, including the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and intact medial sleeve with pes anserine tendons. The tibia dislocated laterally, even in the absence of a laterally applied force. First, a periosteal elevator was used to strip the superficial MCL from the proximal tibia, up to the diaphyseal region. Subsequently, the insertion of the pes anserine tendon was released with a cautery. The posterior capsule was released from the top of the tibia and the back of the posteromedial femur with an electrocautery and the curved tip of the osteotome, respectively.
