Examination revealed a non-tender, firm 15 cm hemispherical lump occupying the whole of the right breast with peau d'orange appearance of the overlying skin and distortion of the nipple. The left breast was normal. There was no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy.

Physical examination was unremarkable. Full-body skin examination did not reveal any lesions of concern. Laboratory values, including liver function tests and tumour markers, were within normal limits. Computerized tomographic (CT) scan demonstrated a 5 cm abdominal mass located at the liver hilum, and displacing the body of the pancreas (Figures and ). Positron emission tomography (PET-CT) showed marked 18-FDG avidity in the area of concern (). A core biopsy was obtained under sonographic guidance. Histopathological examination proved it to be metastatic melanoma (Figures and ). The patient received dimethyl triazeno imidazole carboxamide (DTIC) chemotherapy for stage IV disease [\u2013]. Because of the presence of a single metastatic focus, relatively long disease free interval, and threat of mechanical interference with portal structures, should the disease progress; we favoured surgical clearance of the disease in the hope of achieving durable palliation and potentially prolonging disease-free survival (DFS). Moreover, harvesting melanoma cells would allow preparation of autologous cell vaccine to be combined with interleukin-2 therapy, to further increase the chances of successful treatment []. At surgery, there was a conglomerate of enlarged hard lymph nodes encasing portal structures of the hepatoduodenal ligament. The liver was normal in size and appearance. There was no gross evidence of additional metastatic disease. All grossly positive lymph nodes were surgically removed, without need of vascular inflow reconstruction or bile duct excision. Histopathologic examination of the resected specimen showed lymph nodes replaced by metastatic melanoma (Figures , , and ).

She had been followed up with irregular intervals. It had been more than a year since her last echocardiographic evaluation, and the mechanical valves were reported to be functioning normally at that time. In her medical history, there was an attempt for coronary angiography which was performed via right femoral arterial access ten months ago. Her coronary angiography was reported to be normal. Femoral cannulation was not performed at her cardiac operations.\nBeginning four months ago, she had complaints of exertional dyspnea, palpitation, right-sided abdominal tenderness, and pain at the right groin area. On physical examination, any cardiac murmur was not noticed. She had hepatomegaly and mild peripheral pitting edema. Physical examination of lower extremity revealed continuous bruit on the right groin with palpable thrill. Lower extremity peripheral pulses were weakened at the right side. Branham's sign was present.\nLaboratory evaluation did not reveal any abnormality but mildly elevated hepatic enzymes. Echocardiography was performed; mitral and tricuspid valves were reported to be functioning normally, and there was neither stenosis nor insufficiency. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions were normal. There was biatrial dilatation without any thrombus formation.\nWith the provisional diagnosis of peripheral AVF leading to a new onset right-sided heart failure, Doppler ultrasonography was performed and revealed right superficial femoral artery to common femoral vein fistulisation.

The initial impression was that the lump was consistent with sinus pericranii [].\nShe presented to an outside hospital 1 year later with left shoulder pain weakness and numbness of both lower extremities. On examination, power in both lower limbs was 4 out of 5 but there were no motor deficits in her upper limbs. There was mild sensory deficit to light touch and pain over her left cervical segment 8 (C8) and thoracic segment 1 (T1) dermatomes. There were no cerebellar signs or higher mental function deficits. No lymphadenopathy was clinically evident and biochemically there were no abnormalities. A contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of her cervical spine was done, which showed an extradural lesion extending from cervical segment 7 (C7) to thoracic segment 2 (T2) occupying the left posterolateral spinal canal. She underwent a C7 to T2 laminectomy, excision of lesion and instrumentation of the spine. The histological diagnosis was that of RDD.\nShe subsequently presented to our institute 2 months after surgery with numbness extending from her left mid torso to her left leg. A contrast MRI scan of the brain and spine was done. It showed enhancement in the first and second thoracic segments\u2019 left lateral recesses and neural foramina likely representing postsurgical changes in the absence of residual tumor.

The patient was planned for PFNA on a traction table.\nThe patient was positioned on a fracture table, and a closed reduction is done. Once a satisfactory reduction was achieved, the incision for standard PFNA was made. Once the nail was passed, the lateral incision for the blade was made. The bone was drilled with an appropriate drill, and keeping the tip-apex distance to be <25mm, a screw of size 90cm was chosen. On passing the blade, it was seen on the c-arm that the blade was greater than expected and would lead to joint penetration and hence, needed to be revised to a smaller size. For this, the blade was removed and a new blade of size 80cm was taken and driven along the same path. The surgeon felt resistance while reaching the end of the blade, and on seeing in the c-arm, a part of the previous blade was found to be inside the head and had been pushed further across the joint, due to the force by the new blade (Figure ).\nThe surgeon checked the part that had been removed earlier and found out that it was only the sleeve that had been removed, and the helical blade had broken and was left in situ. The surgeon decided to use a Watson Jones approach to open the fracture and expose the head and remove the helical blade with a nibbler (Figure , ).

Her medical history included two cesarean sections and moderately increased blood pressure (160/80 mm Hg), which was managed with ramipril. The blood pressure was 145/100 mm Hg on the day of surgery. During induction of anesthesia (with extradural injection of bupivacaine and epinephrine) and after application of mild pressure to the abdomen, the blood pressure increased suddenly to 266/167 mm Hg and, after abdominal incision, increased further to 288/180 mm Hg. Tissue preparation was stopped, and severe hypotension (blood pressure: 50/20 mm Hg) developed, which was managed with intravenous catecholamines. The operation was discontinued, and the patient recovered in the intensive care unit.\nAfterwards, the patient was referred to our department for further diagnostic evaluation. A detailed medical history revealed episodes of generalized weakness, shortness of breath, palpitations, and skin pallor, lasting approximately 2 minutes, which had occurred once or twice monthly during the previous year. Symptoms were worsened by sitting and improved by walking and deep breathing. Moreover, we learned that the patient had previously been hospitalized with increased blood pressure during pregnancy. The workup showed marked elevations in urinary excretion of methylated catecholamines (). Based on previously obtained abdominal computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, a team of radiologists, internists, and surgeons agreed that the pancreatic tumor resembled a pheochromocytoma extending from the left adrenal gland (). Thus, the patient was scheduled for lateral transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy.\nThe patient received preoperative doxazosin at a final dose of 4 mg four times daily for a 1-month period, which normalized blood pressure (110\u2013120/70\u201380 mm Hg). Because the tumor was well vascularized, we used a harmonic scalpel for the adrenalectomy. Immediately prior to ligation of the adrenal vein, blood pressure increased to 310/120 mm Hg, which was managed with intravenous sodium",

The left ICA showed a peak velocity of 595.2 cm/s, although the stenosis rate of area could not be counted.

Although carotid ultrasonography demonstrated bilateral ICA stenosis, preoperative CT of the brain showed no ischemic stroke with any neurological symptoms. On the basis of these findings, there was no indication for preceding carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting, and revascularization was selected performing OPCAB to avoid perioperative stroke. OPCAB was performed, using the left internal thoracic artery to graft the LAD, the saphenous vein graft (SVG) for the posterior descending artery of the RCA, and the SVG for the posterior lateral of the LCX. The anesthesia and operation times were 6 h 11 min and 4 h 11 min, respectively. He was hemodynamically stable during and after surgery. Four hours after the operation in intensive care unit (ICU), he regained consciousness from the anesthesia, demonstrating left-sided hemiparesis with sensory disorder.

Intraoral examination revealed a diffuse swelling in the posterior area of the left mandible. The overlying mucosa was erythematous, ulcerated and necrotic []. The panoramic radiograph showed a radiolucent lesion with ill-defined borders extending from the second premolar to second molar []. The incisional biopsy was performed, and the general pathologist's diagnosis was ameloblastoma. Other consulting reports from other General Pathology Departments were ameloblastic fibroma (AF), osteosarcoma and mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. Due to the first microscopic diagnosis (ameloblastoma), en bloc resection from the second premolar to the third molar was done and reconstruction was performed after 6 months using autogenous iliac bone graft stabilized using titanium mesh and plate. Two years later, she came back with a huge recurrent lesion and obvious facial asymmetry. Therefore, she was referred to an oral and maxillofacial pathology center for more investigation, and her primary biopsy specimens and previous histopathological slides were reviewed. Two slides (number 1, 2) of the primary lesion were present. Careful evaluation of slide number 1 showed scattered benign ameloblastic islands and dental papilla-like stroma with tumoral giant cells [Figures and ]. Hyalinization was seen around these benign islands []. Dentinoid material was also found near some odontogenic epithelial nests []. Slide number 2 revealed a highly cellular mesenchymal tissue with hyperchromatic and bizarre pleomorphic cells without any epithelial islands. The malignant counterpart was similar to a poorly differentiated round-cell sarcoma. Some eosinophilic materials, most likely dysplastic dentin, were also found in this malignant counterpart [Figures and ]. The eosinophilic material was osteoid-like, and in these areas, the histopathologic feature was very similar to fibroblastic osteosarcoma.

After a 6 week follow up clinic visit the fistula was still immature and a duplex scan, a second fistulogram with possible intervention were requested.\nFistulogram was performed via an antegrade approach from an access just proximal to the swing point.

Intake of androgenic medicine or the disorders of ovaries and uterus was not observed by a periodic medical examination. No pudendal deformity was clearly observed at birth, but lateral asymmetry of the pudendal region was noticed at about 4 years old. A child care worker pointed out that she pressed her heel to the crotch while sitting on her folded legs. After 5 years old, her mother confirmed that her clitoral hood clearly hypertrophied. After entering primary school, a teacher in charge pointed out that she pressed her crotch to a chair or bar, and the mother told her to stop it, but she repeated this behavior every day. When she strongly wanted to be absent from an overnight school trip at 9 years old, the mother brought her to the Pediatric Department. Various tests were performed suspecting disorders of sex development (DSD). On the first visit, the height was 132 cm and the body weight was 26 kg. The clitoral hood was enlarged.

Histologic review of the original specimens of the primary tumor and of all recurrences was performed. All the specimens exhibited overlapping morphology by showing a combination of hyperplastic synovia, a mononuclear cell proliferation organized in a nodular pattern of growth, scattered hemosiderin-laden macrophages, xanthoma cells and multinucleated giant cells. These findings met the diagnostic criteria for D-TGCT and we therefore confirmed the primary diagnosis. Because of pain and persistent joint effusion, the patient underwent another synovectomy at our institution, and the histologic evaluation of the specimen confirmed the diagnosis of D-TGCT without atypical features. In contrast with previous samples a greater amount of fibrosis was seen.\nTwo years later the patient presented again with painful swelling of the right knee associated with pain localized in the right hip.

She had a history of fibromatosis, but no previous history of trauma, operation or inflammation in this region. On physical examination, a 5-cm large pulsatile swelling with blowing bruit was found over the left cervical region and multiple fibromas were found in regions of face, neck, and trunk. Neurological examination revealed muscular strength of grade IV according to the \u2018manual muscle test (MMT)' grading system and hypoesthesia of right limbs, including touch and pain sensation. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) and DSA revealed a left high-flow internal carotid-jugular fistula at the first cervical level and twisted left internal carotid artery (ICA) (Figures ). Blood flow from the vertebrobasilar artery and right ICA via the circle of Willis supplied the left anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery and drained backwards into the petrosal segment of left ICA (Figures ).\nWe chose embolization of both the fistula and parental artery, because no appropriate covered stent could be used to pack the fistula in the condition of reservation of left ICA. The purpose of first endovascular treatment was to isolate the fistula, by blocking both the backward blood flow from right ICA and the forward blood flow from left ICA. A Headway-21 stent catheter was selectively inserted into the distal part of fistula in the segment of carotid cavernous sinus, meanwhile an Echelon-10 microcatheter was placed in the distal part of stent catheter. One LVIS 5.5*30 mm stent, with its characteristic relatively compact mesh, was used to cover the distal part of fistula to avoid coils being pushed into internal jugular vein and heart (Figure ). However, the 3.5 cm fistula could not be covered by the LVIS stent. Therefore, 10 coils were additionally used one by one",

Partial surgical resection was performed in August 2010 and the first pathologic diagnosis was astrocytoma grade II. He underwent chemotherapy with TMZ at a dose of 2,000 mg with cycles every 28 days for 5 days in the years 2011\u20132013, with no tumor regrowth until the beginning of 2015. At this time, he underwent MRI, which was used to compare the discrete extension of the signal alteration areas, especially the subinsular regions. In March 2015, he resumed chemotherapy with TMZ at a dose of 100 mg/day and the patient then lost 12 kg of body weight, which was associated with anorexia, insomnia, and depression. In May 2015, he suffered a seizure requiring hospitalization. In June 2015, the patient resumed the old chemotherapy regimen with TMZ (2,000 mg every 28 days for 5 days), and a follow-up with MRI; however, the tumor size continued to increase. In January 2016, the neuro-oncology team decided to discontinue treatment with TMZ considering the risk/benefit and planned a surgical re-approach. This was followed by chemoradiation and lasting 6 cycles of PCV associated with CBD. The CBD dosage was ranging from 300 to 450 mg/day.\nDuring chemoradiation, the patient had an excellent clinical performance, practiced sports and had few symptoms of fatigue and/or nausea.\nAt 1 month after the end of chemoradiation, control MRI (Figure ) was characterized by exacerbation and the ultra-precocious phenomenon of PSD with increased edema and inflammatory disease characterized by extensive areas of contrast enhancement associated with tissue hypoperfusion",

Serum creatinine level was within normal range at that time and therefore the anti-GBM antibody was not tested. The first renal biopsy revealed mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with fibro-cellular crescents in one out of 18 glomeruli, excluding one global sclerotic glomerulus (Fig. ), and deposition of IgA and C3 in mesangial areas by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. ). Weak but significant IgG deposition was also observed in glomeruli in the distribution somewhat different from IgA or C3 (Fig. ). The electron-dense deposits were observed in mesangial areas by electron microscopy. Therefore, the diagnosis was IgA nephropathy. Antihypertensive therapy was initiated, mainly with an RAS inhibitor. Eight months later, the patient\u2019s serum creatinine suddenly rose to 4.53 mg/dL (it was 1.04 mg/dL from the routine blood test 1 month before). Urinalysis showed 100 red blood cells per high power field and urinary protein excretion of 12.3 g/gCr (Fig. ). The serological tests that were performed to differentiate the cause of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis revealed the presence of anti-GBM antibody at the titer of 116 IU/mL and the absence of anti-nuclear antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. Laboratory findings on admission are summarized in the Table .\nAfter admission, treatments with hemodialysis, plasma exchange, and intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by oral prednisolone at the dose of 50 mg/day were initiated.

    "original_text": "A 64-year-old woman was referred to correct the prosthodontic restoration on the right maxillary first incisor with infraocclusion. This patient had been treated by implant therapy 20 years before. She was in good general health and did not present any contraindication to surgery procedure, but she had a high tobacco consumption, which she had decided to reduce. Clinical examination showed chronic periodontitis, the replacement of the right maxillary first incisor by an implant with infraocclusion, and a crown with a slight palatal position (Fig. ). Soft and hard tissues around the implant and osseointegration were stable. The facial skeletal pattern was normodivergent. The actual implant position was due to 20 years of continuous alveolar growth. Considering the good palatal implant positioning at the time of the surgery, 20 years before, the right axis was kept, without any buccal side effect movement. A new screwed restoration would have been possible, but the prosthetic rehabilitation to compensate for the infraocclusion would have led to a disappointing result, with too long a crown and an incorrect gingival line alignment. For this reason, periodontal treatment was planned first before orthodontic preparation and implant relocation at the right level using the OBS technique.\nOrthodontic preparation consisted of teeth alignment excluding implant and a .021x.025 SSW was placed on the maxillary and mandibular arches before surgery. When the alignment phase was completed, infraocclusion on the incisor prosthodontic crown was severely worsened, compared to the incisal edge of the adjacent teeth (Fig. A). Immediately before surgery, an overlay .016 Nickel-Titanium archwire was placed on maxillary teeth, including the implant.

Prior to his visit, imaging with X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by a biopsy were performed at an external center with a diagnosis of osteosarcoma (Figure 1). After presentation, his images and biopsy specimens were reassessed at our institution (per routine hospital policy) and the patient was diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma of the proximal femur. The mass was located at the intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric regions, accompanied by a minimally displaced pathological fracture at the femoral neck. Multiple metastatic nodules in his lungs were demonstrated on chest computed tomography (CT). The patient received six cures of vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (VIDE) as induction chemotherapy.\nAfter six cures of VIDE, the control MRI showed that the tumor shrank in response to chemotherapy, and was confined to the intertrochanteric region. With the femoral head epiphysis and the distal two-thirds of the shaft clear of tumoral involvement and the patient\u2019s growth potential in mind, we deemed the patient a good candidate for both joint and epiphysis-sparing biological reconstruction. A written informed consent was obtained from each parent.\nWith the patient lying supine under general anesthesia, an incision was made from the anterior superior iliac spine to proximal femur. The previous biopsy tract was excised. After exposure, the femoral shaft was cut with a Gigli saw. The proximal femur was exposed, and the hip capsule was opened.

    "original_text": "A four-year-old girl presented to the emergency service with painful left hip and fever. There was no previous relevant medical history. There were no other local or systemic symptoms, except for a cervical adenopathy. On physical examination, she walked with a limp, and movements of the left hip were painful (mainly external rotation), but not restricted. Blood exam revealed anemia (Hb 8.7 gr/dL), normal WBC, ESB of 123 mm, and reactive C protein of 149.7 mg/L. An initial X-ray to the pelvis revealed no changes. An ultrasound of the left hip was performed revealing small infusion and synovitis. Guided puncture was then performed being macroscopically compatible with reactive arthritis, and general and bacteriological tests were demanded. Because of the unusual characteristics of the pain, a CT scan to the abdomen and pelvis was performed revealing a left adrenal mass and retroperitoneal adenopathies in the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery ().\nDespite the painful complaints of the patient, no bone or articular involvement was found in the CT scan. No further alterations were reported in the thoracic CT scan or in peripheral blood smears. Bacteriological examination of the hip effusion was negative. MRI was also performed.

The patient\u2019s medical history revealed a cutaneous melanoma of the left dorsum diagnosed six years before she was referred to our dental service. The tumor was primarily treated by surgery and developed two local recurrences (one and three years following surgery, respectively), which were also managed by surgical resection. Disease progression was identified five years after the first treatment and confirmed by a computed tomography (CT), which revealed multiple organ involvement including the lungs, skin (subcutaneous nodules on the dorsum) and bone (osteolytic lesions in the iliac and femur bones, ribs, vertebrae, sternum and scapula).\nThe patient was undergoing a palliative treatment protocol based on dacarbazine, zoledronic acid and radiotherapy in the lumbar region (total dose of 20 Gy) and in the left supraclavicular fossa (total dose of 36 Gy) when she was referred to our dental facility. An extraoral clinical examination identified a pigmented subcutaneous nodule on the patient\u2019s dorsum, measuring 5 cm in diameter, and scarring from the previous surgical resections.\nThe patient\u2019s chief complaint was the loss of the dental crown of her upper left incisor. She denied oral pain or the existence of any relevant oral soft tissue lesion. Intraoral soft tissue examination revealed a nodule with an ulcerated surface and areas of telangiectasia, on the posterior left lateral border of the tongue, measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter, adjacent to a partial edentulous mandibular area (Fig. A). Based on the clinical features of the tongue lesion and on the patient\u2019s medical background, the diagnostic hypothesis included metastatic melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma and fibrous hyperplasia.\nAn incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia.

Upon examination, the patient\u2019s temperature was 38\u00b0C, the pulse was 86 beats per minute, the blood pressure was 103/53 mmHg and the respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute. Abdominal tenderness was identified in the right upper quadrant without rebound tenderness. The remainder of the examination was normal and the results are shown in . Abdominal CT scan revealed a cystic and solid mass with a size of 11.5\u00d78.3\u00d76.7 cm3 and a well-defined border, which involved the right lobe of the liver and had a non-homogeneous density (). The density was marginally and heterogeneously increased in the enhanced CT scan (). The clinical impression was that this mass represented a hepatoblastoma.\nSurgery was performed to resect the tumor. A right subcostal incision was made and, following entry into the abdomen, the ligamentum teres hepatis and falciform were incised. Examination of the future liver remnant and abdominal cavity revealed no evidence of tumor metastasis. The tumor had ruptured at the diaphragmatic surface and had adhered to the diaphragm. The surgical margin distance from the tumor was at \u22651 cm. The tumor was resected following the margins, until it was completely removed. A drainage tube was inserted under the right diaphragm and exited the body through the right abdominal wall. The abdominal wall was closed using standard procedures. During surgery, the patient had 300 ml bleeding and was transfused with 1.5 units of red blood cells.\nHistological examination revealed pleomorphically shaped tumor cells with marked nuclei and clear to the eosinophilic cytoplasm ().

Physical examination revealed cool moist skin, pulse rate of 84 per minute and blood pressure of 131/76 mmHg. Endoscopy showed marked duodenal obstruction, though the mucosa of the stenotic site seemed almost intact. The biopsy specimen obtained from stenotic site revealed regenerative mucosa without malignancy. Upper gastrointestinal contrast study showed smooth stenosis of the second part of the duodenum with a dilatation of the duodenal bulb due to elevated lesion of 3 cm in diameter (Figure. ). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a homogeneously enhanced mass of 2 cm in diameter with clear margin within the wall of the thickened duodenum. The tumor was low (poorly stained) on arterial phase and well enhanced on the equilibrium phase by contrast medium. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed low-intensity mass on T1-shifted phase and high-intensity on T2-shifted phase. No abnormal findings were shown in other abdominal organs. Under the diagnosis of duodenal carcinoma arising from descending portion of the duodenum, malignant lymphoma or gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the duodenum, pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. On postoperative histological examination, heterotopic pancreatic tissue was detected just from the submucosal layer to the proper muscular layer, which was consisted of numerous ducts without islets and acini, and thus diagnosed as Heinrich type III heterotopic pancreas. A transition to dysplastic ductal structures was well-differentiated adenocarcinoma cells proliferating diffusely in areas ranging from the submucosal layer to the subserosa, resulting in a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma arising from heterotopic pancreas in the duodenum (Figure. ). On microscopic examination, the involvement of lymph nodes No.13 was confirmed.

The pain was characterized as a dull ingravescence ache after onset despite conservative therapy. The deformity of left upper limb had strongly affected on her daily life. There was no history of trauma. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, anorexia, or weight loss were absent. Other skeletal examinations were normal.\nOn physical examination, multiple ill-defined swellings were palpated over the left upper limb. Some ecchymotic patches were distributed overlying the swelling. Range of motion of the left wrist was limited. No axillary lymph nodes were palpable. Laboratory investigations were normal apart from a mild elevation of the alkaline phosphatase.\nRadiological examination revealed expansile cortical thickening and sclerosis were apparently presented along the humerus shaft (). On computed tomography (CT), prominent periosteal reaction with intramedullary cortical destruction was correlated with the radiographic findings.

    "original_text": "Patient history\nThe patient was a 57-year-old female with recurrent breast cancer who presented to a community hospital with a chief complaint of bilateral thigh pain and weakness. She was initially diagnosed with left breast cancer at age 50. The cancer was determined to be estrogen receptor (ER) positive stage I, grade 1 breast cancer, and the patient underwent adjuvant chemotherapy [which included doxorubicin (adriamycin)] and mastectomy followed by tamoxifen for five years. This was then followed by letrozole for approximately two years. Seven years from her initial diagnosis, she developed left axillary lymphadenopathy and was given the diagnosis of biopsy-proven recurrent metastatic breast cancer ER positive 90%, progesterone receptor (PR) negative, HER2/neu negative, and she underwent a left axillary lymphadenectomy. Doxorubicin was recommended as an initial treatment course, however, the patient adamantly refused due to her concern for cardiotoxicity, even when it was offered at a lower dose. She was instead started on chemotherapy with docetaxel (taxol) and cyclophosphamide (cytoxan) every 21 days. The second cycle was given with pegfilgrastim (neulasta) to stimulate growth of white blood cells in the body and has the common side effect of ostealgia [].\nShortly after the second cycle of chemotherapy, the patient presented to the emergency center reporting significantly worse pain as compared to the first round of chemotherapy. She stated the pain began three days after chemotherapy treatment, and pain medications did not provide relief. Increased pain was noted with ambulation and palpation of thigh muscles. Her CPK was 3,607 units/L at the time of original admission for rhabdomyolysis.\nClinical presentation\nThe patient was referred to physical therapy (PT) after she was given a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, three days after admission.

    "original_text": "The second patient is a 72-year-old woman with a past medical history including hypertension, type II diabetes, and obesity, who presented with weight loss and steatorrhea. As her symptoms were suggestive of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and with the associated weight loss, she underwent a CT scan for additional evaluation. This demonstrated a suspicious 2.5-cm complex cystic pancreatic head mass with associated pancreatic gland atrophy and a dilated pancreatic duct. She was also noted to have fatty infiltration of the liver (although not overt cirrhosis) and ascites.\nShe was then referred for further evaluation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography demonstrated diffuse dilation of the pancreatic duct up to 7.5 mm with an associated cystic mass in the head of the pancreas, suggestive of main duct IPMN (). EUS was attempted, but was unable to be completed due to severe tortuosity of her esophagus. Positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrated heterogeneous metabolic activity within the pancreatic uncinate process and to a lesser degree within the body and tail. Additional workup included a paracentesis to evaluate the ascites, which was unremarkable and ultimately deemed secondary to poor nutritional status from her exocrine insufficiency. Laboratory results were within normal limits with the exception of tumor markers and a mildly low albumin (3.4 gm/dL). Carcinoembryonic antigen was elevated at 6.0 ng/mL, and CA 19-9 was elevated at 46.7 U/mL. She was placed on pancrelipase, which resolved her symptoms of exocrine insufficiency and helped improve her nutrition.\nDue to the concern for main duct IPMN, she was referred for surgical resection.
