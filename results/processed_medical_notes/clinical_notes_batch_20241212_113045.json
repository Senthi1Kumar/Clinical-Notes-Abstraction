Upon physical examination, the right elbow joint presented with a valgus deformity (carrying angle: 25\u00b0). No swelling was observed and no percussion pain was reported by the patient. The posterior cubital triangle of the right elbow was present. The range of elbow flexion and extension was 0\u00b0 to 120\u00b0. Rotation of the right forearm was limited; the range of supination was 60\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 (Fig. ). The circumference of the right mid-arm muscle was not different from that of the left arm. Myodynamia of the right arm also was normal. No other motion dysfunction was noted in the bilateral hand or wrist joints. Bilateral digital radiography (DR) of the elbows showed synostosis of the right proximal radioulnar joint as well as valgus deformity in the right elbow; no obvious abnormality was observed in the left elbow (Fig. ). A 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) scan showed dysplasia in the proximal part of the right ulna and radius as well as anterior dislocation of the radius head (Fig. ). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with congenital proximal radioulnar synostosis of the right elbow and right radial head dislocation.\nThe following surgical procedures were performed: arthrolysis of the right proximal radioulnar joint, proximal radius osteotomy, internal fixation with Kirschner wires, and reconstruction of the annular ligament of the radius.

No abnormal ligamentous instability of the knee was found. The McMurray test was negative for friction sounds, but caused recurrence of knee pain. No instability of the patella was found. The patient was a healthy male, 170 cm tall and weighing 62 kg, and he did not show abnormal alignment of the lower limbs, systemic bone disease, or hormonal abnormalities. A plain anteroposterior radiograph demonstrated a lucent region at the distal end of the lateral femoral condyle, and a lateral radiograph showed an additional lesion on the lateral surface of the trochlea in the patellofemoral joint (Fig. ). Three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) revealed a depression in the lateral femoral condyle and in the lateral surface the trochlea (Fig. ). A T2-weighted MRI revealed high signal curvilinear lines at the same sites, with an image of synovial fluid flowing within the subchondral bone. A discoid lateral meniscus was also found (Fig. ). Based on these findings, we suspected OCD and performed arthroscopic surgery on 25 March 2010.\nDuring surgery, a shallow fissure was found slightly behind the lateral femoral condyle, but without evident peeling or instability of the cartilage surface.

Clinical examination revealed acute urticaria involving only right side of face. Lesions of herpes labialis were also noted on her upper lips. There was no antecedent history of fever and drug intake but she travelled for few hours in sunlight for few hours and had a lot of physical and mental stress during that period. There was no history of urticaria, asthma and drug eruptions or contact dermatitis or food allergy in her past or family. She experienced \u201cfever blisters\u201d a few years ago with an episode of acute pharyngitis. She attained menopause 6 years ago and was not receiving any drugs including hormone replacement therapy. She was neither using any cosmetic creams on face nor did she ever visit a beauty parlor. There was no new soap or shampoo. Upper lip threading was never done. Her investigations including blood sugar, complete blood counts, and urinalysis were normal. Her urticaria resolved with hydroxyzine. We were not sure at this moment if the urticaria and herpes labialis were related.\nTwo months later, she again came with the similar presentation but her major concern this time was painful eruptions on upper lips at the same location as that in the past.

    "original_text": "A 22-year-old woman underwent a lower segment cesarean delivery for her fourth pregnancy two years before; she was transfused two units of blood for continuous vaginal bleeding. After delivery she failed to lactate, did not resume cycles and complained of fatigue. Three months before admission she complained of cough and intermittent fever with night sweats. She was seen at a primary health center where sputum was found positive for acid fast bacillus on multiple occasions, with no findings suggestive of tuberculosis on chest radiograph. The patient was started on antiitubercular treatment (ATT) in the form of isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide in appropriate doses. She felt more fatigue and weakness in the first week after starting ATT. On the tenth day she was found to be unconscious in the morning and was brought to the hospital. Examination in emergency revealed a sick, pale looking lady with a feeble pulse rate of 100 beats per minute and unrecordible blood pressure with a temperature of 99\u00b0F. She had breast atrophy and sparse axillary and pubic hair. She also had a systolic murmur at the mitral area suggestive of mitral regurgitation. Her deep tendon jerks revealed a marked delay in relaxation suggestive of hypothyroidism. In view of her postpartum hemorrhage (and need for blood transfusions), lactation failure, secondary amenorrhea, hypotension and features of hypothyroidism, a clinical diagnosis of Sheehan syndrome with adrenal crisis was made. The patient was given emergency treatment in the form of oxygen inhalation, intravenous fluids and a nasogastric tube was inserted. After taking a blood sample she was started on hydrocortisone 100 mg every 6 hours, levothyroxine 100 \u03bcg through the NG tube and ATT was continued.

    "original_text": "A 68-year-old Caucasian lady presented with left sided upper abdominal pain and left renal angle pain to her GP. The GP ordered lumbar X-rays of the spine, which had shown a possible 7 cm renal stone (). The pain had been occurring for several months and there were no exacerbating or relieving factors. The pain did not radiate and was not severe. She had no lower urinary tract symptoms importantly no haematuria or dysuria. Other medical problems included rheumatoid arthritis, SLE and controlled hypertension. She had no previous urological or surgical history. She was referred to a urologist for an opinion.\nLaboratory investigations showed a serum creatinine of 119 mg/dl and a urea of 8.1 mg/dl. Urinalysis was normal and her blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg. Her symptoms of back pain had subsided and on examination she had no loin pain. She was subsequently sent for a CT scan, which revealed that the substance of her left kidney had almost totally been replaced by a dense calcification. There was also calcification of the distal ureteric wall on the same side. Both of these findings are evident from the reconstructed CT image (). When she was subsequently reviewed again in clinic, it came to light that she had had TB in her chest at the age of 16. A diagnosis of TB \u201cauto nephrectomy\u201d was made. From the time of her original referral she had no further episodes of pain and it was felt that her symptoms had been due to musculoskeletal problems and not due to the TB kidney. A review of the present literature suggested that nephrectomy may be considered for patients that are hypertensive.

    "original_text": "An 80-year-old man was referred to our hospital for syncope caused by severe AS. Twelve years previously, he had undergone CABG that comprised bypass grafting of the left internal thoracic artery (LITA) to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and of the saphenous vein from the ascending aorta to circumflex branch. He had also undergone pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis 10 years prior to the surgery. Unfortunately, the details of the surgical procedure and findings were unknown because the surgery for pericarditis was performed at another hospital. Preoperative computed tomography indicated that the pericardium around the aorta and right-sided left atrial area were almost intact. However, severe adhesion appeared to be present from the anterior to diaphragmatic aspects of the heart. Echocardiography showed severe progressive AS with moderate aortic regurgitation. Other examination data were as follows: aortic valve area of 0.6 cm2, mean trans-aortic valvular pressure gradient of 86 mmHg, bicuspid aortic valve, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 70%. Although the patency of the LITA\u2013LAD graft was confirmed, computed tomography and coronary arteriography showed that the saphenous vein graft was occluded. We discussed the treatment strategy (TAVR or AVR) in a \u201cheart team.\u201d The heart team considered TAVR not to be suitable for his deformed bicuspid aortic valve. We decided to use a right parasternal minimally invasive approach, which is optimal for performing AVR to avoid median sternotomy-related injury, especially to the patent LITA\u2013LAD graft.\nA 7-cm right parasternal incision extending from the inferior edge of the second costal cartilage to the superior edge of the fourth costal cartilage was made (Fig. a).

    "original_text": "An 80-year-old man was referred to our hospital for syncope caused by severe AS. Twelve years previously, he had undergone CABG that comprised bypass grafting of the left internal thoracic artery (LITA) to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and of the saphenous vein from the ascending aorta to circumflex branch. He had also undergone pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis 10 years prior to the surgery. Unfortunately, the details of the surgical procedure and findings were unknown because the surgery for pericarditis was performed at another hospital. Preoperative computed tomography indicated that the pericardium around the aorta and right-sided left atrial area were almost intact. However, severe adhesion appeared to be present from the anterior to diaphragmatic aspects of the heart. Echocardiography showed severe progressive AS with moderate aortic regurgitation.

Palpation revealed a large 10 \u00d7 8 cm firm mass in the anterior neck, predominantly on the right side, and an immobile hard swelling over the scalp in the right parietal region. Contrast-enhanced CT imaging () performed previously showed a large enhancing mass involving the right lobe and isthmus of the thyroid gland with multiple subcentimetre nodules in bilateral lungs. Fine needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid mass revealed it to be a follicular neoplasm (Bethesda category IV). Based on this clinical information, a tentative diagnosis of metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma was made. The patient was planned for thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine therapy depending on the histopathology. She underwent right hemithyroidectomy in December 2014 under cervical block.

The patient had a history of diabetes mellitus, systemic hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.\nOn initial evaluation she had corrected visual acuity of 20/20 in both eyes and intraocular pressures were 20 and 18 mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively. Anterior segment examination of both eyes showed mild nuclear sclerosis. Fundus of the left eye was unremarkable except for mild peripheral RPE atrophy and no evidence of AMD. On funduscopy of the right eye, a pigmented choroidal nevus measuring 6 by 4 millimeters in basal dimensions and with overlying drusen was noted at the equator along the 10 o\u2019clock meridian.

Pain was steady and not aggravated by use. Examination revealed very mild dorsal swelling of the wrist, with tenderness over lunate. The range of motion was slightly restricted in all directions. A specific limitation on wrist flexion and radial deviation was observed. A scaphoid shift test was negative. Routine biochemical tests, blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were within normal limits. AP and lateral radiograph of the wrist revealed a radiolucent lesion measuring 11 mm in diameter at the center of the lunate with round margins (Figure ). There was no scalloping, septae formation or cortical thinning. Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the wrist revealed a round hypodense cystic lesion of 10 mm in diameter without septae formation (Figure ). Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging views on coronal fat-suppressed and axial and sagittal T2 weighted sequences have revealed a homogenous hyper-intense cystic lesion in the lunate with smooth and round contours (Figure ).\nA dorsal longitudinal incision of 6 cm was made on the ulnar side of the Lister's tubercle, extending proximally and distally through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. The extensor retinaculum was sectioned between the third and fourth compartments, parallel to the incision. The third and fourth compartments were connected. Tendons were retracted and the capsule was exposed. The capsule was cut open through an H-shaped incision, allowing the evaluation of the proximal part of the capitate and the lunate fossa. Curettage was performed by opening a dorsal 3 mm cortical window through the cartilage.

    "original_text": "A 71-year-old man complained of a two week history of right-sided abdominal pain that started after he began his first round of chemotherapy with R-CHOP with pegfilgrastim for mantle cell lymphoma. He presented to the emergency department (ED) after he developed severe (9 out of 10) right lower quadrant abdominal pain, approximately 17 days after starting chemotherapy. A physical examination in the ED revealed tenderness most pronounced in the right lower quadrant, with guarding and rebound pain. Lymphadenopathy was also noted in the cervical and supraclavicular regions. Imaging by CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis revealed an enlarged appendix with disruption of the appendiceal wall and small foci of gas and fluid consistent with a contained perforation. No associated mass or tumor was observed in the imaging studies. Peripheral blood was collected and sent for complete blood count, which demonstrated a normocytic anemia with a relative neutrophilia.\nThe patient's mantle cell lymphoma had been recently diagnosed on the basis of involvement of bone marrow and cervical lymph nodes. Imaging studies revealed widespread lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. The mantle cell lymphoma expressed CD5 and kappa light chain restriction by flow cytometry and expressed Cyclin D1 by immunohistochemistry.

Volume control with drugs, such as diuretics, was unsuccessful and he was started on hemodialysis. Thereafter, he received various antibiotics for bacterial infections, including pneumoniae and urinary-tract and catheter-related infections. Simultaneously, he had continuous watery and sometimes bloody diarrhea, the etiology of which was considered to be CDAD due to a positive stool test for CD toxins.

    "original_text": "The case is a 69-year-old female patient with angina pectoris. Her previous history was unremarkable apart from bilateral cosmetic implantation of breast prosthesis many years ago. Coronary angiography revealed mild changes in the left coronary artery and a significant stenosis in the right coronary artery (RCA). A relatively large SB, which was the right ventricular branch, emanated from the stenosed region of the RCA. The stenosis was dilated with an undersized balloon followed by implantation of a bare-metal stent-type driver 4.0 \u00d7 24 mm with a pressure of 14 atmospheres (). This resulted in acute right coronary perforation and profound dye (blood) extravasation (). The stent balloon was inflated instantaneously at the perforation site with a relatively low pressure for a period of about 2 minutes whilst preparing a PTFE-covered stent. The immediate and prolonged balloon inflation reduced the dye extravasation markedly () and prevented development of cardiac tamponade. The largest available PTFE-covered stent 3.5 \u00d7 19 mm was successfully implanted. The covered stent was then postdilated with a 4 mm noncompliant balloon with a pressure up to 22 atmospheres. This successfully sealed the perforation with complete cessation of dye extravasation and restoration of normal anterograde flow (). The graft stent intelligibly resulted in the SB occlusion. Repeated echocardiography revealed moderate pericardial effusion but no signs of early or late cardiac tamponade.

Examination revealed a patient in septic shock with generalised abdominal rigidity. A chest radiograph demonstrated a moderate volume of sub-diaphragmatic air. Following resuscitation and initiation of intravenous antibiotics, diagnostic laparoscopy demonstrated widespread faecal peritonitis and a midline laparotomy was performed. A 3-mm perforation of the proximal sigmoid colon was demonstrated, with no evidence of diverticulum nor other colonic abnormality. The procedure was complicated by extensive bleeding from the tissues and an iatrogenic defect in the ileal mesentery, resulting in ischaemia of 10 cm of terminal ileum. Given this, the decision was made to oversew the sigmoid perforation with interrupted PDS sutures, resect and anastomose the ischaemic ileum, and perform a defunctioning loop ileostomy. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, where he made a satisfactory recovery and was extubated on day 3.\nFrom the third postoperative day, serous fluid was noted on the abdominal dressing; however, the wound remained intact. He was transferred to the ward, ileostomy function commenced and enteral feeding started. On postoperative day 9, he was noted to have a complete wound dehiscence and was taken back to theatre for assessment. There was wide separation of the fascial edges, with exposed intestine. The wound was cleaned and a negative pressure dressing applied, with Mepitel (Molnlycke\u2122) used as the interface between the sponge and the intestine. On postoperative day 11, small bowel effluent was noted in the suction container. In theatre, four small bowel fistulae in a superficial bowel loop were demonstrated (Fig. ), and a negative pressure dressing was reapplied to manage the new fistulae.

An abdominal CT scan showed a 4.5 \u00d7 4.1 cm periampullary mass arising from the pancreas without evidence of metastatic disease. Interestingly, the CT scan also showed the colon to be in a dorsal position in relation to the SMA (). Laboratory analysis revealed normal liver function tests and serum CEA level but an elevated CA 19-9 level. At operative exploration, the entire transverse colon was found to be retroperitoneal and lies dorsal to the SMA and SMV. The duodenum coursed anterior rather than posterior to the mesenteric vessels. The SMA lies further to the right than normal and the SMV\u2013portal vein confluence lies further to the left than usual. Inspection of the duodenum and head of the pancreas revealed a firm mass in the head of the pancreas. A classic pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. The anterior placement of the duodenum made division of the jejunum beyond the ligament of Treitz relatively easy. The tumor dissected nicely away from the SMA with no uncinate process of the pancreas present. Our standard procedure is to bring the jejunal limb for reconstruction up in a retrocolic position, through a defect made in the transverse mesocolon to the right of the middle colic vessels. This limb is used to create the pancreaticojejunostomy, hepaticojejunostomy, and gastrojejunostomy. Due to the retroperitoneal position of the transverse colon, we brought the jejunal limb up in an antecolic position. Pathology revealed a moderately differentiated PDA with all surgical margins being free of tumor and 1 out of 11 specimen lymph nodes was positive for metastatic disease. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged to home on postoperative day 5. The patient eventually developed recurrent disease and died 34 months postresection.",

She underwent left-sided above the knee amputation and excision of the intrapelvic masses. Eight months later, enlarging pulmonary nodules were resected. She was treated with sirolimus (rapamycin) and remained disease-free for eight months until a pulmonary nodule and two inguinal masses were noted. In 2007, at age 37, she was referred to our hospital and treated with sorafenib for four months with mixed response. She subsequently began on sunitinib 37.5 mg daily. Interval restaging scans showed no evidence of progressive disease for 15 months. She had significant interval progression of a right-sided pelvic mass while she temporarily stopped sunitinib in the perioperative setting of resection of painful metastatic nodules near the amputation stump (Fig. a, b, and c). Given that the drug had a significant role of controlling the disease, her sunitinib was restarted in combination with sirolimus (rapamycin).

History of two years of gutka chewing with placement of the gutka quid in the lower labial vestibule was reported. On examination, a portion of the root of mandibular left lateral incisor was visible through a gingival and alveolar bone fenestration on the labial surface (). The fenestration was oval in shape, measuring approximately 4 \u00d7 2 mm in diameter. The area was free of pus and calculus, and the surrounding gingiva appeared whitish in color. All probing depth measurements around the tooth were within the normal limit, and the fenestrated area could not be probed through the gingival sulcus.

Two weeks earlier, she had discovered a local swelling in her right breast, located behind the nipple. There was no retracted nipple, nor excretion from the nipple. The skin had been red for a while, but this had disappeared spontaneously. The woman was postmenopausal, had given birth to 4 children to whom she had breastfed two. Her family history is relevant for breast cancer, her daughter had breast cancer when she was thirty-five years old. The patient history mentioned a cholecystectomy, hysterectomy and appendectomy and hypertension and atrial fibrillation. She had used some medication against hypertension, an anticoagulant and a tranquilizer.\nPhysical examination revealed an elastic swelling, located centrally in the right breast, measuring about five centimetres across, without fixation to the skin or pectoralis major muscle fascia. The tumour appeared malignant. No abnormalities were observed in the left breast, nor in axillar or supraclavicular lymph nodes. A digital mammogram was performed and showed a mass of 32 millimetres with spiculated margins, positioned five centimetres behind the nipple. Ultrasound of the lesion confirmed this. The radiologist classified the mass as a suspicious abnormality (figure ). A fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the swelling was taken. The pathology report confirmed the presence of a malignancy. The pathologist described atypical epithelial cells with polymorphism of the nucleoli, and the conclusion was adenocarcinoma of the breast. An additional ultrasound of the right axilla was performed. It showed a lymph node of 1.5 centimetre, without pathological characteristics. The patient and her family were informed thoroughly about the different treatment possibilities.

Patient was then transferred to Upstate University Medical Center for higher level care and was evaluated by the ophthalmology service 18 hours after symptom onset. She underwent lateral canthotomy and cantholysis at the outside hospital 6 hours prior to arrival, due to severe pain and concern for orbital compartment syndrome; however patient endorsed complete loss of vision 12 hours prior in her left eye. She had no ocular trauma or history of intravenous drug abuse. However, she noted to have a two-month history of intermittent left abdominal pain and diarrhea, along with an abdominal computed tomography (CT) reporting diverticulitis. On presentation, examination revealed an edematous, erythematous, and proptotic left eye with severely restricted extraocular movements (). The anterior segment exam revealed diffuse conjunctival injection, mucopurulent discharge from superotemporal globe (), diffuse corneal edema and haze, and extensive fibrin in the anterior chamber. The dilated exam was limited due to corneal edema, diffuse anterior chamber reaction, and dense vitritis. Ophthalmic ultrasonography revealed a subluxed lens with diffuse vitritis (). Orbital CT confirmed no retained intraocular foreign body () or occult penetrating injury.\nUpon admission, patient's blood and specimens from ocular mucopurulent discharge were sent for gram stain and culture.

According to the assessment of otorhinolaryngology, a resection was possible in principle but would have been accompanied by enormous physical defect and face distortion due to the requisite removal of bilateral medial canthi and glabella. The patient rejected the surgery and tried to gain information about RT. Consultation with the radiation oncology team of the university hospital close to his home led to recommendation of a combined CRT or proton beam therapy (PBT). The patient preferred the latter, after he became educated about the more vehement toxicities of conventional RT with photons, such as necessity of artificial nutrition owing to pharyngitis, malfunction of sense of smell and taste, deafness of left ear, and blindness in 2-5 years. Consequently, he contacted three particle therapy institutes in Germany but obtained refusal from two for the following reasons: The benefit of particle therapy for SNSCC was not completely clarified and could not be offered out of clinical trials.

Laboratory results were within normal limits. During an ultrasound examination of her abdomen, an anechoic lesion in her upper left abdomen was revealed. In a further investigation with computed tomography (CT), a well-defined hypodense cystic 7.08 \u00d7 6.05 cm mass with mild enhancement was noted (Fig. ).

    "original_text": "A 10-year-old boy was referred to our centre because of recent onset of hearing loss and tinnitus of the right ear. He complained about blurry vision. His medical history was unremarkable apart from treatment with methylphenidate because of ADHD. Physical examination of the ear, nose and throat showed no abnormalities apart from an abnormal Weber test to the left, and an asymmetric reaction of facial nerve. The audiogram showed a sensorineural hearing loss of the right ear, with a downsloping audiogram and complete loss of higher tones indicating damage to the acoustic nerve. The MRI scan of the brain showed a large extrinsic tumor in the right cerebello-pontine angle with severe compression and displacement of the brainstem (Fig. ). The tumor could be removed in two successive surgical sessions. In the first surgery, the tumor mass could be taken out almost completely except for a very adherent remnant on the vertebral artery and a second separate tumor on the other side. In spite of the close involvement of the lower cranial nerves, all these nerves could be saved anatomically and functionally as monitored intraoperatively. Pathological examination of the tumor showed a clear cell type meningioma, WHO grade II (Fig ).

History revealed that the patient had a traumatic fall for1 day before in open ground. On intraoral examination, an oblique complicated crown-root fracture was seen extending into the cementum in the left maxillary central incisor (tooth number: 21) []. The remaining coronal fragment was found to be mobile hanging on to the tooth structure. The patient reported the pain on palpation and percussion. Further examination revealed that there were no injuries to the supporting tissues, lacerations over the lips, or any swelling in and around the region of trauma. Intraoral periapical radiograph revealed two accompanying fracture lines, one extending up to 2 mm into the alveolar crest on the mesial half and the other running from the midline 1 mm into the cementoenamel junction; with a closed apex []. In this case scenario, a regular fragment reattachment procedure would not be possible as there was extensive subgingival involvement. Traditional treatment plan would be extraction, but the patient's parents were not willing for the extraction, and hence, hence, intentional reimplantation with extracoronal fragment reattachment was adviced to the patient and the parent. After obtaining the consent from both the patient and the parents, the treatment was done as follows.\nIn the first visit, the mobile fragment was removed and stored in isotonic saline solution, till it was reattached. Pulp extirpation was done, and calcium hydroxide closed dressing was given (Calcicur\u00ae\u2013 VOCO, Germany) followed by the medications.
