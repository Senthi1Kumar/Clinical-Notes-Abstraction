When he was discharged from the hospital after successful unrelated PBSCT, he experienced increased nausea and vomiting, and poor oral intake. He was subsequently admitted to receive intravenous amino acid resuscitation (Trophamine) and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). When he was admitted, jitteriness on bilateral upper extremities was observed for a brief time while he was receiving intravenous amino acid resuscitation and TPN therapy. Under the impression of Wernicke's encephalopathy, intravenous thiamine replacement was done. Although his thiamine level came out to be normal (6.9 \u00b5g/dL; reference range: 2-7.2 \u00b5g/dL), we kept thiamine replacement therapy for one week since his oral intake was very poor. Then we changed intravenous thiamine replacement into oral replacement for one more month to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not performed since his thiamine level was within normal range then. Since he had no apparent neurological symptoms and his oral intake improved, we discontinued thiamine prophylaxis at discharge. The patient visited the outpatient clinic for reappearing nausea, vomiting and poor oral intake, and received TPN and intravenous amino acid resuscitation on a regular basis. Nonetheless, his symptoms did not improve and his general weakness increased.

    "original_text": "A 44-year-old male presented to the surgeons office with an approximately two-month history of pain along the anterior aspect of the elbow. An MRI was ordered which demonstrated a near-full thickness tear of the distal biceps tendon. Surgery was performed 1 month after presentation and approximately 3 months after the onset of symptoms. At the time of surgery, there was high grade, near-full thickness tear of the tendon just proximal to the insertion site. The torn tendon fibers were retracted to the level of the elbow crease. Repair was performed via a single incision anterior approach with fixation achieved using both cortical fixation button and a biotenodesis screw.\nBeginning on postoperative day 4, the patient was noted to have numbness along the dorsal aspect of his thumb, index, and middle digits as well as mild weakness of wrist extension. The patient complained predominantly of loss of function of his thumb. When symptoms failed to resolve with conservative therapy, an EMG was performed which showed evidence of conduction loss in the distribution of both the deep and superficial radial branches.\nApproximately 4 months after the surgery and 7 months after the initial injury, a second MRI was performed () which demonstrated an edema-like pattern within the supinator and extensor carpi radialis brevis muscles consistent with denervation. No muscle atrophy was noted. As with the first case, a single anterior scar was identified with no evidence of a posterior incision. Artifact from the area of the cortical fixation button was noted in proximity to the plane of the traversing PIN, but without effacement of the nerve or surrounding fat plane.

On clinical examination, extra cusp was detected at the palatal side of upper right lateral incisor extending from cement-enamel junction to incisal edge, which was confirmed to be a talon cusp (Fig. ). No caries were observed and gingiva around the affected tooth was healthy. There was no interference in occlusion as the corresponding lower tooth was located at a lingual position. Moreover, it did not cause irritation to the tongue during speech and mastication. The patient also did not suffer discomfort due to this tooth. A few months ago, he noticed that this tooth was slightly larger than normal and unsightly. However, he did not consult with any dentist at that time due to lack of pain and discomfort. His family members do not have this dental anomaly. The tooth responded well during pulp vitality test including cold test and electric pulp tester.

A few months earlier, the patient had complained of pain, numbness and paresthesia in the left hand, affecting in particular the first three fingers at night. She had no history of cardiovascular diseases, arteriopathy, diabetes, smoking, or other vascular risk factors.\nShe was clinically diagnosed with CTS, which was confirmed by electromyography of the left upper limb.

Clinical picture favored dengue fever with the classic repertoire of symptoms. Since the patient had taken mefenamic acid, a non steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) for myalgia for a few days, her complaint of fever for only one day at presentation suggested an erroneous timeline and a late presentation. Rest of the systemic examination was normal and clinically there was no evidence of leakage of fluid in the chest and abdomen on presentation.

He was diagnosed with WHS after birth. Although he had slight mental retardation, he was able to ambulate and perform simple commands. No specific problems were noted on the transthoracic echocardiography, although ventricular premature beats were present on the preoperative electrocardiogram. His blood tests and chest X-ray did not show any abnormal findings.\nOn the physical examination, the patient had facial features identical to patients with typical WHS. The Greek warrior\u2019s helmet appearance, characterized by a prominent glabella, hypertelorism, micrognathia, low-set malformed ears, and a down-turned mouth, was present (). Although mouth opening was more than 3 fingers and neck extension had no limitation, his mandible was small and relatively pushed backward (). His tooth alignment and dental hygiene was under poor condition, and Mallampati score was class II. He had undergone an inguinal herniorrhaphy under general anesthesia two years prior without any complications. The information about the previous general anesthesia was limited because it was dependent on the memory from patient\u2019s mother, but any complication has not occurred during anesthetic management including endotracheal intubation. However, as a long anterior-posterior diameter of chest was noticed on computed tomography (), difficult intubation and airway management were anticipated.\nAfter entering the operating room, the hemodynamic status of the patient was stable with blood pressure of 115/91 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats/min, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

He had no subjective symptoms prior to the day of admission, and no past medical history other than hypertension, which was managed with medication. The patient called an ambulance 3 h after the onset of symptoms and was able to get into the ambulance unassisted. He was transported to a nearby hospital. At the hospital, he developed hemoptysis and hypoxemia with severe forced breathing and tachypnea. He was tracheally intubated and transferred to our emergency department by air ambulance helicopter 6 h after the onset of symptoms.\nOn examination in our emergency department, a coarse crackle with right lateral dominance was audible. A small volume of blood was continuously suctioned through the tracheal tube, although bronchoscopic examination did not reveal any source of bleeding. The patient\u2019s blood pressure was 132/87 mmHg, pulse was 109 beats per minute and body temperature was 36.7 \u00b0C. He was mechanically ventilated with spontaneous breathing at a rate of 14 breaths per minute under sedation.

The perianal skin lesion of the patient was coincidentally found during her perineal skin preparation before she underwent an operation for urinary incontinence in December 2015. The patient complained of itching and stinging sensation in the perianal and perineal area. On physical examination, a 7 \u00d7 8-cm erythematous perianal skin lesion with slightly elevated patches, erosion, and brownish pigmentation was noted. The patient had applied imiquimod cream on the lesion for 2 months before visiting our institution, but no certain improvement was reported. Two pathology slides from the referring hospital were reviewed again. Paget cells in the epidermis were confirmed, and positive immunohistochemical(IHC) stain for cytokeratin 7 (CK7) and negative IHC stain for human melanoma black-45 (HMB-45) were also confirmed (). A chest posterioranterior radiograph and abdominoperineal computed tomography revealed no distant metastasis or pathologic lymphadenopathy. A colonoscopy revealed 3 polyps without any coexisting rectal malignancy. After evaluation, a multidisciplinary team including a colorectal surgeon, a dermatologist, a radiation oncologist, an oncologist, and a radiologist decided to perform wide excision and flap surgery for the skin defect.\nOn April 28, wide excision and flap surgery were performed. On the day before the operation, the dermatologist conducted mapping biopsies with local anesthesia to obtain adequate safety margins in advance (). However, despite the repeated mapping biopsies, the excision line for the area around the vulva and the vaginal orifice could not be determined. Therefore, the excision line for that area was determined by intraoperative frozen section analysis.\nOn the day of the operation, the patient was placed in lithotomy position under general anesthesia.

    "original_text": "A 34-year old male presented to our ophthalmology clinic with the sensation of a foreign body in his left eye. While performing his job as a blacksmith, he suddenly felt something hit his left eye. Ophthalmological examination showed visual acuity of 20/20 with pinhole correction in both eyes. Intraocular pressure was 11 mmHg in the left eye and 14 mmHg in the right eye. Both pupils were round, regular and equally reactive to light and accommodation.\nSlit-lamp biomicroscopic examination of the left eye showed that there was an intrastromally embedded metallic foreign body with a free posterior edge extending outwards at the 1 o\u2019 clock position. Significant eye redness was noted over the entire bulbar conjunctiva, which was more prominent in the limbus just behind to the entry site of the foreign body. An overlying corneal epithelial defect and localized surrounding corneal edema were noted at the point of foreign body entry. The foreign body had a free exit edge that was protruding outwards. It was not possible to visualize the entire route of the foreign body through the cornea because of localized surrounding corneal edema. The inside edge of the foreign body appeared to enter the anterior chamber via completely penetrating the cornea (Fig. ). Gonioscopic examination was not performed due to the potential for the free posterior edge of the foreign body to be pushed into the anterior chamber.

The pain exacerbated after eating and was accompanied with abdominal distension, belching, and reduced flatus. The patient referred was taking traditional Chinese medicine that temporarily relieved the symptoms. She had previous history of hypertension with a poor control. She underwent colonoscopy examination in a local hospital and verbally reported no pathologic findings. The positive findings at the physical examination were the mesogastric tenderness and an enlarged spleen.\nThe blood laboratory examination reported only mild hypokalemia; the urinary and stool reports were normal. The enhanced computerized tomography showed splenomegaly, the jejunal wall with edema and a narrowed lumen, enlarged lymph nodes, mesenteric edema; the liver cleft was widened with atrophy of the right liver lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes; calcification and periportal fibrosis signs were compatible with hepatic schistosomiasis (Figures \u2013).\nAt the moment of the double balloon enteroscopy, the patient's blood pressure was not stable and we could not reexamine the colon. The upper enteroscopy showed at 150 cm distal to the Treitz ligament a 3.0 x 2.0 cm size ulcer with bottom white coating, peripheral mucosal hyperemia, and edema occupying 2/3 of the lumen so that the endoscope could not pass through. Four biopsies were taken from the ulcer (Figures \u2013).

The patient's body weight at admission was 40 kg. He suffered from ischemic bowel disease, having undergone massive resection of small intestine and ileocecal valve. He had to cope with 40 cm proximal jejunum () and 70 cm distal colon remaining. Postoperatively his body weight was 34 kg (hospital day 3). He lost weight from 54 kg to 34 kg in 4 months and developed severe malnutrition.\nIn the postoperative period PN was used immediately for nutrition support and electrolyte imbalance correction. Enteral feeding began 10 days later and antidiarrheal drugs (loperamide 2 mg bid) were used for treatment of diarrhea. Diet progress was clear liquid diet (continue feeding 30 mL/hr for 2 days), diluted elemental diet (continue feeding 700 kcal/day for 3 days), and normal concentration elemental diet (continue feeding 1200 kcal/day for 20 days) to polymeric formulas diet (continue feeding 1200 kcal/day for 5 days). The patient has tolerated oral soft diet and supplement 40 days later. We gave him home PN as regular recommendation and loperamide after being discharged from hospital.\nThis patient complied with low oxalate and minimizing intraluminal fat diet.

The pain occurred while he was taking a casual walk in the evening. The pain intensity gradually worsened over the next few hours. The patient also noted progressive swelling of the calf of the right leg, gradually extending to the ankle. He denied trauma and could not recall a history of animal or insect bite. There was also no recent history of immobility. He was on no medication, either prescription or over-the-counter. The symptom onset was spontaneous and unprecipitated. The patient sought initial pain relief and self-medicated with codeine-paracetamol 30/500 mg and ibuprofen 400 mg. Failure to achieve adequate pain relief, along with evolution of symptoms with the development of numbness on the same side below the knee, prompted the patient to seek medical assistance.\nOn clinical examination, the patient appeared to be in severe pain. He was afebrile with normal hemodynamic parameters, with a pulse rate of 85 beats per minute. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements were 133 mmHg and 76 mmHg, respectively. Oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. His National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) was 0 based on clinical assessment. Systemic clinical examination was normal. On examination of the lower limbs, the right calf measured 45 cm in circumference and the left calf measured 44 cm in circumference. On visual assessment there was no rubor or blisters. However, the skin appeared tense and stretched. The right leg and calf were tender to the touch. The right-sided dorsal and posterior tibial pulses were present and capillary refill time was < 2 seconds, which was normal. The anterior and peroneal compartment was visually tense, which was more evident with toe movement. A reduction in sensation to light touch was also noted.\nBedside venous blood gas analysis revealed a normal pH of 7.4 and a normal electrolyte profile,",

    "original_text": "Case 2 This was a 63-year-old male who presented with fatigue and dyspnea in the spring of 1995. He was investigated for his anemia and found by ultrasound to have multiple cystic structures within the peritoneal cavity. The CT scan confirmed the presence of multiple peritoneal masses associated with a large amount of intra-abdominal ascites (Figure ). At laparoscopy the abdominal cavity was filled with mucin. Biopsy and histopathological examination of the peritoneal mass confirmed the presence of PMP. Cytoreductive surgery inclusive of a right hemicolectomy was performed, followed by intra-peritoneal chemotherapy. The patient had been doing well for 4 years. Then, he complained of increased abdominal girth and coughing, and a CT scan showed recurrence of extensive amount of multiloculated material throughout the abdomen and pelvis. Therefore, the second debulking surgery was performed on September 1999. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged in a stable condition. In June 2002, he had the third debulking surgery for recurrent disease. In February 2003 he died from a myocardial infarction \u2013 an unrelated cause.\nThe gross appearance of the PMP was similar to the previously described case. A diagnosis of PMP originating from a mucinous neoplasm of low malignant potential (M-LMP) originating in the appendix from the hemicolectomy specimen of 1995 was confirmed microscopically. The lesion had prominent papillary architecture with mild to moderate nuclear atypia (Figure ). Foci of pseudomyxoma extraperitonei were also observed in sections of the skin. The tumor cells from the next two debulking specimens showed similar histological features as the first one with no obvious progression from the original state of the bland epithelium \u2013 no significant increase in the degree of atypia, cellular proliferation, increased nuclear hyperchromasia, abnormal mitoses or the presence of signet ring cells representing a case of DPAM variant of PMP arising from a borderline or low malignant potential (LMP) mucinous neoplasm of the appendix.",
    "cleaned_text": "case 2 this was a 63-year-old male who presented with fatigue and dyspnea in the spring of 1995. he was investigated for his anemia and found by ultrasound to have multiple cystic structures within the peritoneal cavity. the ct scan confirmed the presence of multiple peritoneal masses associated with a large amount of intra-abdominal ascites (figure ). at laparoscopy the abdominal cavity was filled with mucin. biopsy and histopathological examination of the peritoneal mass confirmed the presence of pmp. cytoreductive surgery inclusive of a right hemicolectomy was performed, followed by intra-peritoneal chemotherapy. the patient had been doing well for 4 years. then, he complained of increased abdominal girth and coughing, and a ct scan showed recurrence of extensive amount of multiloculated material throughout the abdomen and pelvis. therefore, the second debulking surgery was performed on september 1999. the patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged in a stable condition. in june 2002, he had the third debulking surgery for recurrent disease. in february 2003 he died from a myocardial infarction \u2013 an unrelated cause.\nthe gross appearance of the pmp was similar to the previously described case. a diagnosis of pmp originating from a mucinous neoplasm of low malignant potential (m-lmp) originating in the appendix from the hemicolectomy specimen of 1995 was confirmed microscopically. the lesion had prominent papillary architecture with mild to moderate nuclear atypia (figure ). foci of pseudomyxoma extraperitonei were also observed in sections of the skin. the tumor cells from the next two debulking specimens showed similar histological features as the first one with no obvious progression from the original state of the bland epithelium \u2013 no significant increase in the degree of atypia, cellular proliferation, increased nuclear hyperchromasia, abnormal mitoses or the presence of signet ring cells representing a case of dpam variant of pmp arising from a borderline or low malignant potential (lmp) mucinous neoplasm of the appendix.",

Following surgery, the patient complained of paresthesia and loss of taste in the anterior two thirds of the tongue (). The anesthesia record showed that she underwent general anesthesia for open reduction and internal fixation of the left distal radius fracture. She had no remarkable past medical history. Pre-operative laboratory tests and chest radiography were normal, and pre-operative physical examination determined her degree of airway difficulty to be Mallampati Class I. Anesthesia was induced with an intravenous injection of propofol (120 mg) and rocuronium (50 mg). A size 7.0 mm inner diameter endotracheal tube was easily and atraumatically inserted on first attempt, under direct visualization, using a No. 3 Macintosh blade laryngoscope. The endotracheal tube cuff was inflated to a cuff pressure of less than 25 cmH2O and a 90 mm Guedel oral airway was inserted on the left side of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube was secured by tape at the right mouth angle. The patient was positioned supine with her head rotated 30 degrees to the right. The endotracheal tube remained in situ for 170 minutes. Anesthesia was maintained with 2\u20133% sevoflurane in 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen. There were no adverse events during anesthesia maintenance. At the end of the surgery, tracheal extubation was performed when the patient opened their eyes and responded to verbal commands. One hour after the surgery, the patient reported tongue paresthesia and loss of taste in the anterior two thirds of the tongue (). She had no difficulty in moving her tongue. No other complications, such as dysphasia, dysphonia, or sore throat, were observed. In addition, there were no abnormal findings, such as hematoma or swelling of the oral cavity. After consultation with an otorhinolaryngology surgeon, bilateral lingual nerve injury was diagnosed, based on the clinical presentation of the",
