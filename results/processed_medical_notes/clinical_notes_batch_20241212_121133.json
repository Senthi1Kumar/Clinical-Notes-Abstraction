Prior to presentation to our hospital, he had bilateral double J stent (DJS) insertion and left extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy followed by FURS and laser stone fragmentation of the left renal stones. Subsequently, he sought medical advice in our facility. Non-contrast CT scan showed multiple bilateral renal stones. In the left kidney, there were 3 stones distributed to middle and lower pole calyces with a stone burden of approximately 3.0 cm as measured using the CT scan. In the right kidney there were also three stones, two in middle calyces and one in the pelvis with a total stone burden of 3.2 cm. After stopping the aspirin for seven days, he underwent simultaneous bilateral FURS and holmium laser lithotripsy and insertion of bilateral DJS under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The surgical procedure took 125 min (65 min for the left side followed by 60 min for the right one) and the procedure was similar in both sides. Following insertion of a hydrophilic tip guidewire (Sensor, 0.038 in), a ureteral access sheath (Inner diameter: 12 Fr, Length: 55 cm) was inserted and the tip was located approximated at the level of ureteropelvic junction. Karl Storz flexible ureterorenoscope (8.5 Fr) was used. During the procedure the normal saline was allowed to run from the bag (approximately 80 cm above the level of the patient pelvis without a pump) and the outflow of saline from around the scope was observed throughout the procedure.

    "original_text": "A 67-year-old male patient diagnosed with stage IV pulmonary adenocarcinoma was first treated with 6 cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed followed by a maintenance regimen. Progression occurred within fourteen month after the start of the initial treatment. Consequently, second-line nivolumab was initiated at a dose of 3 mg/kg every two weeks.\nAfter thirteen doses of nivolumab, the patient complained of irritated red eyes without visual impairment. He did not exhibit skin involvement, arthralgia or urinary tract or digestive symptoms. The conjunctiva swab test was negative, and no improvement was observed with antibiotic ocular drops. The ophthalmologist\u2019s examination revealed bilateral sterile conjunctivitis with no signs of uveitis or retinal lesions (Fig. a). The patient was treated with topical steroids with partial improvement.\nA few days later, he developed fatigue and progressive dysphagia which became severe after two months followed by rapid 10-kg weight loss without symptoms of associated colitis or gastritis. At that point, the main differential diagnosis was esophageal infection, tumor progression with gastrointestinal (GI) upper tract involvement, paraneoplastic syndrome [] or an atypical checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse event. Of note, the patient had no history of personal or familial autoimmune disease, conjunctivitis or upper digestive tract abnormality prior to nivolumab treatment.

On examination, he was tachycardic at 137 beats per minute and hypotensive at 68/53 mmHg. The patient was given intravenous 0.5 mg of adrenaline and started on a noradrenaline infusion during resuscitation. Ultrasound scan done in the Accident and Emergency Department showed a large amount of intra-abdominal free fluid.\nA CT mesenteric angiogram showed a large volume hemoperitoneum and active contrast extravasation in the region of the greater omentum (Figures and ). The source of the haemorrhage was initially not discernible. However, after careful comparison with a previous CT scan done 3 years earlier, a long aberrant omental artery demonstrating a cockscrew pattern arising from the left gastro-epiploic artery was noted terminating in a large fat containing structure within the lower right abdomen.\nA catheter angiogram was performed with a view to identify and embolize the bleeding vessel. Angiogram performed from the splenic artery confirmed the presence of an active haemorrhage from an aberrant artery which extended from the splenic hilum down to the right iliac fossa (). The artery terminated in a small cluster of abnormal cockscrew shaped vessels. Successful embolization of the artery was performed using coils and N-Butyl cyanoacrylate (glue). The patient remained haemodynamically stable and recovered well.\nThe CT scans were reviewed again in view of the abnormal vasculature in the right iliac fossa. It was noted that there actually was a large lipomatous lesion in the right iliac fossa. It had grown slightly in between the CT scans and was causing displacement of the small bowel loops.

The patient has a past medical history of hepatitis C and is an active intravenous heroin abuser who admitted to using heavily the prior evening. Upon returning home he and his family stated that the eye looked normal. He slept for 12 hours and woke up with extreme left eye pain. He did report being hit in the area around 2 weeks prior but denied any more recent trauma to the eye.\nOn initial examination the visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and light perception in the involved left eye and tonometry was 38 mm Hg. The left eyelids were erythematous and edematous. The globe was proptotic with limited motility. There were extensive chemosis and trace subconjunctival hemorrhage. The cornea was diffusely edematous without an epithelial defect. The anterior chamber had a complete hyphema. The right eye examination was normal.\nThe patient was afebrile and had no leukocytosis. HIV testing was negative. Initial CT orbits displayed periorbital soft tissue swelling without evidence of orbital fractures or sinus disease (). He received a dose of intravenous ampicillin and sulbactam and was discharged home on a course of topical prednisolone, atropine, dorzolamide, and timolol all twice a day. The following day the patient has no light perception in the left eye with a keratitis developing along with increasing pain, proptosis, and now almost complete ophthalmoplegia.\nA repeat CT of the orbits identified retrobulbar fat stranding and thickening of the posterior sclera (). There was also now a focus of soft tissue density in the vitreous ().

The patient\u2019s male sibling had died of colonic cancer, but we had no information as to whether he also had GS. This patient had been transfused with 12 units of whole blood suspension before being referred to our center, and had a final hemoglobin level of 8 g/dL, a creatinine value of 2.9 mg/dL, an albumin level of 2.1 g/dL and a total bilirubin level of 6.3 mg/dL. An endoscopic examination failed to detect any abnormalities, with the exception of duodenal polyposis. Colonoscopy was attempted, but no higher than the rectosigmoid region was reached due to bleeding. Upon physical examination, the patient was noted to have a mass with a size of 30 cm \u00d7 20 cm, which originated from the right flank region and was partially fixed to the abdominal wall. There were also multiple lesions (likely lipomas) with a size range between 3 cm - 7 cm on the abdomen, thoracic wall, and axilla (Figures -). There was a mass lesion compatible with an osteoma in the left mandible (Figure ). Conventional celiac and mesenteric angiographies that were performed to detect the hemorrhagic focus showed no extravasation that was indicative of bleeding. The patient\u2019s hemodynamic and biochemical parameters improved, but since he had persistent signs of mild periotinits, a decision was made to proceed with surgery. Upon the request of the patient, the mass lesions on the abdominal and thoracic walls were the first to be excised. A midline incision was then performed, and approximately 500 cc of seropurulent fluid was drained.

    "original_text": "A 12-year-old girl presented with Ewing sarcoma of the left pelvis (PI-II). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (4 courses of ifosfamide + etoposide and 4 courses of vincristine + doxorubicine + cyclophosphamide) was administered, and the extra-skeletal mass disappeared on MRI. Wide excision and reconstruction were performed. We planned osteotomy including the load surface of acetabulum assisted by a computer navigation system and reconstruction using a frozen bone autograft. The patient\u2019s tracker was placed on the iliac crest; the error after registration was within 1 mm. Subsequently, by pulling the lower limbs, a gap of approximately 2 cm was made in the joint space and osteotomy was performed without dislocation of the hip joint (Fig. ). In this case, navigation was particularly helpful in osteotomy of the acetabulum. Although osteotomy under direct view is possible via dislocation of the hip joint, it involves the risk of femoral head necrosis, and this cannot be confirmed from the cartilage surface. In addition, X-ray image alone cannot provide the orientation. Reconstruction was performed using plates and an artificial bone graft and autograft (normal iliac bone) to fill the cavity for the defect of the load surface of acetabulum after tumor curettage. The resection margins were free of tumor, and this was pathologically confirmed in a small sample collected from preserved host tissue. Pathological evaluation of curettage of cancellous bone indicated almost total necrosis of the tumor, which was classified as grade III/IV according to the Rosen and Huvos evaluation system [].

The fetal status was noted to be RHD positive on amniocentesis.\nOn her initial evaluation at 19-week gestation at our center, the middle cerebral artery (MCA) Doppler revealed a peak systolic velocity (PSV) of 2.37 MoM. There was mild ascites and cardiomegaly.\nAfter counseling the patient underwent the first in a series of combined intravascular/intraperitoneal intrauterine transfusions (see ). The ascites and cardiomegaly resolved after the second transfusion.\nThe fourth transfusion was complicated by an episode of transient bradycardia with spontaneous recovery after removal of the procedure needle from the umbilical vein. On a preoperative ultrasound prior to her sixth procedure, thrombosis of one of the umbilical arteries was noted (see ). A review of earlier ultrasounds indicated two patent umbilical arteries although visualization of the cord was not specifically undertaken postoperatively after the fourth procedure or before and after the fifth procedure. Based on the reassuring status of the fetus, a decision was made to continue serial intrauterine transfusions. Antenatal testing was initiated with weekly biophysical profiles and daily kick counts.\nIn addition to fetal anemia, this pregnancy was complicated by diet controlled gestational diabetes and mild polyhydramnios with an AFI of 29. The estimated fetal weight at 35 weeks ultrasound was 3193gms (87th %ile).

There was no active bleeding. The clot was easily unroofed and biopsied, and hemostasis was subsequently obtained. At this point, the general surgery team was consulted. Of note, the patient had stopped taking Warfarin for catheter-related deep vein thrombus three days before his episode of hematemesis and his INR level was subtherapeutic on presentation.\nEvaluation\nDue to the large size of the identified mass, the patient was at increased risk for severe recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding and malignancy. This prompted a relatively short timeline from diagnosis to surgical intervention. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest without intravenous (IV) contrast; and a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and IV contrast was obtained to assess for potential metastases (Figure ). The abdominal imaging demonstrated a 5.0 cm heterogeneous mass involving the posterior wall of the gastric fundus without obvious extension into nearby tissues such as the spleen, splenic vessels, or pancreas. There were no findings suggestive of metastasis in the chest nor pelvis. The EGD tissue biopsy of the ulcer demonstrated mucosal gastritis.

A lesion with an induration of 7 \u00d7 10 mm was found on the right tongue (Fig. A). There was an irregular surface and ulceration in the lesion. He was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the right tongue via pathological examination in August 2015 (Fig. B). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a contrast region with a width of 18 mm and a depth of 11 mm in the longitudinal direction of the tongue (Fig. C). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and contrast-enhanced CT showed no evidence of cervical lymph node metastasis. From the examination results, he was diagnosed with tongue cancer of the right side (cT2N0M0, at stage II). The patient underwent a partial tongue resection and supraomohyoid neck dissection in September 2015. For the resection, a safety margin of 10 mm was set from the tumor, and the depth of resection was 10 mm from the tumor throughout the circumference. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma, and the surgical margin was negative at all sites. After the operation, he was observed in our outpatient department. In November 2016, he had abdominal pain and bloody stool symptoms and consulted a family clinic. Since he was diagnosed with intussusception, he was referred to our gastroenterology department. Contrast-enhanced CT was performed and showed a contrast region in the terminal ileum (Fig. A). A lower gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed, and a tumor was found near the terminal ileum. Malignant lymphoma was suspected based on the histological examination results. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed accumulation in the terminal ileum (Fig. B).

During his physical examination, a mass was palpated on the upper right abdominal quadrant. Upon ultrasonography, a right adrenal mass measuring 86 \u00d7 83 mm was detected, and the patient was hospitalized for further investigation and treatment. The mass was evaluated by the endocrinology department for identification. Upon abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a 90 \u00d7 65 mm hypervascular solid mass originating from the right adrenal gland and extending to the right hepatic lobe was observed, with intense contrast uptake on postcontrast images (Figures and ).\nThe rectal examination findings and PSA values of the patient, whose father had been diagnosed with prostatic carcinoma, were within the normal limits. A routine laboratory examination and chest X-ray findings were unremarkable. To evaluate the endocrine activity of the mass, the 24-hour vanyl-mandelic acid, metanephrine, and normetanephrine levels in the urine and the urinary free cortisol levels were measured; all results were within the normal limits. As the patient was not hypertensive, aldosterone and renin levels were not determined, and the lack of relevant clinical findings rendered the measurement of sex steroids useless. In light of these findings, laparoscopic adrenalectomy was planned for the patient. Bleeding foci blurred the vision during laparoscopic dissection; thus, we switched to the open adrenalectomy technique. The mass, which had not infiltrated into adjacent structures, was completely dissected, and the specimen was sent for histopathological examination ().\nThe postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged with due recommendations on the 3rd postoperative day.

The patient received first-line therapy with single agent pembrolizumab for 10-months with excellent response at which time a restaging CT indicated abnormalities of the thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies. He carried no prior history of fracture, and no spinal metastases were identified. A comprehensive review of his outside imaging revealed an age-indeterminate T12 compression fracture sustained prior to ICI with an adjacent T11 compression deformity appearing after approximately 10 months of pembrolizumab therapy. Increased prominence of biconcave deformities of the vertebral bodies were also noted during therapy, indicating osteopenia (Fig. ) []. Given the patient\u2019s response to therapy, pembrolizumab was discontinued after 12-months, though he was referred to the Metabolic Bone Center for continued skeletal evaluation and management. At the time of evaluation, his laboratory testing showed calcium and vitamin D deficiency. Markers of bone formation and resorption were considered normal for the patient\u2019s sex and age and not suggestive of a high bone loss state. Bone density testing revealed only low bone density at the hip, but no frank osteoporosis. Following optimization of calcium and vitamin D status through diet and supplement, the patient retuned to clinic with updated laboratory testing. His biochemical profile indicated improved calcium and vitamin D indices as well as stable markers of bone formation and resorption. Repeat bone density testing also revealed no significant change of bone density in the hip or spine.

The patient\u2019s medical history was significant for glioma resection and radiation therapy 8 years before presentation, without evidence of recurrence. After several years, she began experiencing excessive tearing of the left eye, followed by generalized redness. These symptoms began approximately 2 to 3 years before presentation. Diplopia began 6 weeks before presentation. She subsequently underwent a limited functional endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) at a different facility for suspected infection. Pathology results were nonspecific. On our examination, the patient had strabismus, generalized redness, and moderate ptosis of the left eye, with an otherwise nonfocal neurologic examination result. According to the patient, ptosis and redness worsened over the past year. She had slight exotropia of the left eye and did not have pain or a history of orbital trauma.\nA review of previous imaging demonstrated a chronic inflammatory change in the left medial orbital wall and sinuses for several years before presentation. The last computerized tomography (CT) before the operation at a different facility documented erosion of the left medial orbital wall, with loss of the fat plane separating the wall from the medial rectus, and again identified a soft-tissue density in the medial orbit (). Magnetic resonance imaging after the procedure revealed dehiscence of the left lamina papyracea, enlargement of the ipsilateral medial rectus, thickening of nasal mucosa along the medial orbital wall, and a lesion of the left sphenoid sinus (). A CT detected decalcification of the left lamina papyracea. Nasal endoscopy demonstrated crusting and a bulging of the medial orbital wall, with purulent discharge into the nasal cavity (). Cultures from nasal mucosal swab and tissue biopsy were positive for pansensitive Candida tropicalis. Symptoms failed to resolve after treatment with fluconazole.\nThe patient was referred to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of new onset strabismus.",

After a neurologist examination a head computed tomography (CT) angiogram was performed revealing opacification of the left mastoid cells with a bony lesion at the anterior aspect of the external auditory canal (Figure ).\nThe lesion was suspicious for fibrous dysplasia. One month after the start of his symptoms, he was admitted to the otolaryngology ward for the evaluation of long-standing dizziness and imbalance. Physical examination showed a clinical presentation of serous otitis media for which a myringotomy was done. Tuning fork tests and an audiogram confirmed a left mixed hearing loss (Figure ). A fistula test on the left showed a right beating nystagmus, and caloric testing was normal. Posturography was indicative of both peripheral and central involvement. There was no other cranial nerve deficit. Oral prednisone 60 mg once daily was started for a week and betahistine for symptomatic relief. Repeated audiometry showed a gradual worsening of asymmetric left sensorineural hearing loss (Figure ).\nSeven years later the patient was re-evaluated with a head CT and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for new onset of left otalgia and pain radiating to the temporomandibular joint. The bony lesion at the anterosuperior aspect of the external auditory canal increased in size to 18 mm and extended into the middle cranial fossa floor, with no dural invasion (Figure -).\nDuring otoscopic examination it was noted that the external auditory canal had become obstructed by anterior bulging. A biopsy was taken by the transmeatal approach. The pathology result of the soft white tissue came back as cholesteatoma.

The patient was referred by his respiratory physician to the palliative care team for consultation asking for advice on ongoing management of his dyspnea in the community. From the patient's perspective, shortness of breath was the main symptom concerning him. Before admission he had been on continuous home oxygen at 6L/min.The oxygen was delivered through two oxygen concentrators run in series. He did have portable oxygen bottles but no longer used them as he became house bound before his admission. His recent usual oxygen saturations (SaO2) were between 75 and 85%. He lived with his wife and had been essentially house bound for several months. He was able to mobilize short distances limited by his breathlessness. He had not been receiving any additional community nursing services; his wife had been assisting him with all his care needs.\nHis medication list was as follows: Seretide 250/ 25 mcg two puffs twice daily; tiotropium daily; clopidogrel 75 mg daily; aspirin 100 mg daily; bisoprolol 1.25 mg daily; furosemide 40 mg daily; oxycodone immediate release 5 mg two-hourly as required and atorvastatin 80 mg daily\nHe was reviewed by the hospital's consulting palliative care physician who recommended low dose immediate-release oral morphine as required for dyspnea and who also arranged for the patient to be linked with the Gold Coast's community palliative care team once he was discharged.\nDuring the patient's hospital stay an MET (Medical Emergency Team) call occurred due to an episode where his SaO2 dropped to around 60%.

A large sacral mass was detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the patient was referred to the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Tottori University (Yonago, Japan) for evaluation and treatment. A physical examination revealed a diphasic elastic hard mass, measuring 8 \u00d7 3 cm in diameter with a smooth surface, in the sacral and gluteal regions. The mass was fixed to the sacrum and not adhered to the skin. The results of the neurological assessment were normal, with the exception of bowel dysfunction. Radiographs showed an osteolytic lesion in the sacrum, and MRI revealed a large tumor and compression of the rectum (). An open biopsy was conducted and histology of the specimen confirmed the diagnosis of a chordoma. Sacral amputation at S2 was performed along with resection of the soft component of the tumor. Adhesion to the presacral membrane was not prominent. The surgical margin was minor, although microscopically the margin was identified as R0. Adjuvant radiotherapy was initiated two months postoperatively due to an infection that was associated with catheter use and surgical wound dehiscence. An infection of the sacral region was revealed following radiotherapy (60 Gy), which was treated via curettage and administration of an antimicrobial agent. The patient was subsequently discharged.\nNine months postoperatively, the patient complained of back and left shoulder girdle pain. MRI revealed multiple low intensity areas in the thoracic spine (4th, 5th, 7th, 10th and 12th vertebrae), and the spinal canal narrowed at the 4th and 5th thoracic vertebrae ().

Plain and single-phase CECT scans were examined once per year. CECT, performed during a regular follow-up examination when the patient was 79 years of age, revealed a mass of 25 mm in diameter in segment 7 of the liver with uniform contrast. Ultrasound revealed a nodule with an unclear border and irregular shape and fairly hyperechoic signals. CT and ultrasound examination showed no splenomegaly. Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) was performed as liver metastasis of carcinoma of the renal pelvis was suspected, but no uptake of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was observed at the lesion site. As the EOB-MRI findings were suggestive of FNH, a conservative approach with regular follow-up examinations was taken. At 80 years of age, the patient developed acute myocardial infarction and his left ventricular ejection fraction (32%) was severely decreased. No changes were noted in the nodules until the patient was 87 years of age when EOB-MRI revealed a nodule of 12 mm in diameter exhibiting the same findings behind the existing FNH. The nodule was found to have increased to 20 mm in size on EOB-MRI performed when the patient was 88 years of age, and a nodule of 9 mm in diameter was also observed on the border of the right lobe. When the patient was 89 years of age, EOB-MRI again revealed 1 new nodule on the right lobe and 1 new nodule on the left lobe of the liver. Subsequently, a liver biopsy was performed (Fig. ).

She presented to the emergency room with a three-day history of left upper quadrant abdominal pain, fatigue, one episode of non-bloody, non-bilious emesis and fever to 102 F. Physical examination noted a well-healed abdominal midline scar but did not elicit abdominal tenderness or palpable mass. Abdominal plain film was significant for a mass within the left flank (Figure \n). White blood cell count was elevated to 17.54 103 uL, the hematocrit was 31.2 and platelet count was 279 103 uL. A CT scan showed the spleen to be located in the left flank, vertically oriented with the hilum facing laterally (Figure \n). There was loss of all parenchymal architecture and a thin rim of capsular enhancement, indicative of global infarction. A thickened and swirled appearance of the splenic hilum was observed with a cuff of fat surrounding the poorly enhancing splenic vessels, consistent with a torsed splenic pedicle. Significant edema was also found around the splenic region. The previously known intestinal malrotation had not changed. The supra hepatic inferior vena cava was markedly displaced anteriorly as is typically noted in with children a history of large omphaloceles. Due to the delayed presentation (3 days following onset of symptoms) and imaging features suggestive of global infarction of the spleen, we discussed the management options with the child\u2019s parents and opted to proceed with non-operative management. Supportive care was provided until the abdominal pain resolved. She was immunized against encapsulated organisms and placed on daily prophylactic penicillin. She was tolerating a regular diet without fever or emesis by the time she was discharged home on hospital day 5. The family was counseled about the risks of overwhelming sepsis in the absence of a functioning spleen and to return for",

No relative afferent pupillary defect was observed. Upon slit-lamp examination, punctuated epithelial erosion was observed on the cornea of the right eye. Hypoesthesia to light touch in the right malar area, which is the domain of the zygomaticofacial nerve, was also confirmed. The patient\u2019s tear film breakup time was 5 s in the right eye and 7 s in the left eye. The findings of Schirmer I test were 5 mm for the right eye and 10 mm for the left eye. The results of the Schirmer II test, which measures the degree of reflex tearing by irritating the nasal cavities, were 4 mm for the right eye and 12 mm for the left. The computed tomographic (CT) image obtained at the dental clinic immediately after the surgery confirmed a Le Fort I fracture across both pterygoid plates and both maxillary sinuses. Although pterygoid plate fracture were visualized bilaterally, the severity of the fracture was much worse on the right side in the present case (Figure \n).\nTo improve the patient\u2019s symptoms, an ophthalmic ointment and preservative-free artificial tears were prescribed for the right eye, and her progress was monitored. The patient continued to experience decreased tearing in the right eye, but overall, the symptoms had improved 6 months after the surgery.
