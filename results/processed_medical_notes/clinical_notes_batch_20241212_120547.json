The main concern of parents and the patient was the presence of malocclusion, which created esthetic and psychological problems.\nMedical history and records revealed the presence of a SR syndrome, which was diagnosed 9 months after patient\u2019s birth, when she was hospitalized for dystrophy, anorexia and a persistent high fever. According to her medical history, growth hormone was never administered to the patient during her childhood.\nDuring the clinical examination the patient presented a short stature (142 cm), leg asymmetry of 4 cm, smooth clinodactyly and a small size of the fifth finger in both hands. No mental retardation was noticed.\nExamination revealed a triangular face with low set moderately protrusive asymmetrical ears, the right being in a lower position than the left. The mandible was small, the corners of the mouth were turned down, and the upper central incisors were moderately exposed. The lateral facial view revealed a convex profile. Panoramic radiography showed the presence of all permanent teeth (Fig. ). However, the patient presented delayed dental eruption.

Further history revealed that she had had five previous episodes of urinary calculi requiring surgery or lithotripsy. She was also discovered to have had a first degree atrioventricular block and was currently awaiting pacemaker insertion. There was no family history of thyroid/parathyroid disorders or history of previous radiation. Physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations revealed hypercalcemia (2.89 mmol/L), hypophosphatemia (0.78 mmol/L) and elevations in parathyroid hormone (PTH) (15.2 pmol/L). Bone mineral density studies revealed cortical bone osteoporosis.\nA 99mTc-sestamibi scan did not reveal any abnormality. An exploratory parathyroidectomy was then arranged and the right and left superior parathyroid glands were removed, along with a localized biopsy of the left inferior parathyroid gland. The right upper gland was 1 cm in diameter and was thought to be an adenoma. No inferior right parathyroid gland was identifiable. She subsequently remained hyperparathyroid and underwent re-exploration and removal of the previously biopsied left inferior gland. Again, a right inferior gland was not identified and a right thyroid lobectomy to locate a possible intra-thyroid adenoma was performed. The final pathological analysis of the removed thyroid lobe did not identify any parathyroid tissue within the thyroid parenchyma, but there was normal parathyroid tissue in the paratracheal fat removed at the time. Parathyroid hormone levels continued to remain persistently elevated. Although subsequent MRI and CT scans remained negative, PET-CT scanning showed a 3 cm region of uptake in the right parapharyngeal region behind the thyroid cartilage at the level of the arytenoids.

Panoramic and periapical radiographs showed a carious lesion on the teeth extending into the subgingival area, but the radiographs did not show a bony destructive lesion in the left maxillary posterior region (). Since the endodontic treatment of subgingival carious lesions cannot be guaranteed to be successful, extraction was considered. However, BRONJ was a concern because the patient had been administered pamidronate for two years, followed by zoledronate for five years, to treat multiple myeloma. Moreover, the patient did not accept extraction as a treatment option, so tooth extraction was postponed. This patient had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma (IgG kappa type) nine years previously and had undergone multimodal examinations and treatment at the Wonkwang Medical Hospital. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma was based on multiple tests, including serum and urine protein electrophoresis, bone marrow biopsy, and radiographs of the bones commonly involved in multiple myeloma. Plain pelvic radiographs showed diffuse decreased bone density and a compression fracture (wedge deformity) of T12 (). Skull radiographs showed a characteristic punched-out appearance ().

She was diagnosed with mild dementia and was admitted to a convalescence hospital but was not prescribed any medications. Despite the patient's ability to self-care at the onset of symptoms, she was unable to take care of herself or walk at the outpatient visit. Brain CT revealed bilateral subdural hygroma or bilateral CSDH with the loss of sulci markings on the cerebral hemispheres. Brain atrophy was also observed (). Considering the rapid progression of symptoms, surgery was performed to treat the bilateral lesions. CSDH can often be misdiagnosed as a subdural hygroma on brain CT. However it was thought be SDH due to reddish brown fluid with clots in the operation filed. The patient underwent evacuation through 2 burr holes (one at each parietal eminence) and catheters were placed into the subdural space through both the holes to prevent further blood accumulation. The vital signs, including BP, were normal during surgery. The patient showed improvements in cognitive and motor functions postoperatively. There was no catheter drainage on the first two days postoperatively; however, 400 cc of subdural fluid with CSF and blood was drained from the right side drainage catheter over a 24-hour period on postoperative day 3. The patient did not exhibit any changes in the neurologic symptoms, but complained of intermittent headache. An emergency brain CT scan revealed a newly developed hemorrhage in the right subdural space and a small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage (). CSF overdrainage was considered a possible cause of the remote hemorrhage; therefore, we removed the drainage catheters. When we reviewed the previous images, suspected arachnoid cysts were observed in the right temporal lobe (). One month after the surgery, a follow-up CT scan showed absorption of the hemorrhage and the area where the suspicion of the arachnoid cyst was disappeared.",

There was no history of trauma and her past medical history was otherwise unremarkable. Four months prior, she had undergone bilateral knee intra-articular high molecular weight hyaluronic acid injections. Physical examination of her right knee revealed full but painful range of motion and tenderness especially on the medial compartment. Radiographs of the knee revealed radiographic characteristics of osteoarthritis including joint space narrowing and sclerosis (). The patient underwent total knee arthroplasty for management of knee osteoarthritis. Intraoperatively, there were extensive arthritic changes in all three compartments.

She was otherwise fit and well, had no significant past medical history and was not on any regular medications.\nBased on the examination findings, the list of differential diagnoses included: pyoderma gangrenosum, cutaneous vasculitis, infection and malignancy. A 4-mm punch biopsy was arranged from the edge of the lesion, which was reported as an invasive BCC. Routine bloods and a vasculitis screen were unremarkable and wound swabs did not show any significant growth. Clinicopathological correlation was not consistent with a morphoeic BCC and therefore a repeat incisional biopsy was arranged. This showed a large, endophytic tumour displaying both basaloid and squamoid areas. This unusual finding could represent either a \u2018collision\u2019 tumour or a BCC with some squamous differentiation, as in BsC.\nWithin 4 weeks of presentation, the lesion had increased in size to 36 \u00d7 48 cm. In association with this rapid expansion, the patient started to experience severe lumbosacral pain radiating down the left leg. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed tumour invasion into the paraspinal muscles, posterior lumbar vertebrae and even the spinal canal in places (Fig. ).\nImaging and histopathology were urgently reviewed at a tertiary centre multidisciplinary team meeting. The diagnosis of BsC was confirmed. Due to the advanced nature of the tumour, it was deemed inoperable and no conventional palliative therapy was available.

Physical examination revealed mid-upper abdominal tenderness. Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed that the gallbladder wall was significantly thickened, and further examination was recommended to exclude the possibility of a malignant tumor ().\nLaparoscopic exploration and omental biopsy were then performed. The volume of ascites in the abdominal cavity was about 1500 mL. Miliary gray-white nodules were found in the liver, omentum, abdominal wall, and pelvis. The nodules in the greater omentum were obtained for analysis, and the frozen sections were sent for pathological examination. The pathological findings revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The diagnosis was established based on the presence of gallbladder cancer with abdominal metastasis combined with the patient\u2019s medical history and auxiliary examination results. After the operation, the patient was treated with gemcitabine + oxaliplatin + tiggio capsules for two cycles and albumin-bound paclitaxel combined with oxaliplatin for four cycles with an unknown dosage, and the curative effect was judged as a partial response (PR). Radical cholecystectomy + intestinal adhesiolysis + laparoscopic exploration + omental excision were performed in November 2017. During the operation, gallbladder consolidation, invasion of the serosa, dense adhesion between the serosa and transverse colon, and hepatic surface adhesion were observed; no other obvious metastases were observed in the abdominal cavity. Postoperative pathologic examination revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with infiltration of cancer tissue at the incision margin.\nIn April 2018, whole-body positron emission tomography\u2013CT showed postoperative changes of gallbladder cancer, low-density mass lesions with an abnormal increase in fluorodeoxyglucose metabolism in the operative area, and tumor recurrence involving the left lateral lobe of the liver and hepatic flexure of the colon.

    "original_text": "A 51-year-old male presented with the chief complaint of dysphagia for over 30 years. Eight years ago, the patient was diagnosed with esophageal achalasia, and balloon dilation was performed several times in a previous hospital, but it was not effective. Endoscopic findings before POEM showed a narrow esophagus in the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) region and severe circumferential esophagitis in the esophageal body due to stasis. In addition, there was a slightly depressed, reddish lesion suspected to be cancerous in the mid-thoracic esophagus. Histological diagnosis of the biopsy specimen prior to POEM was esophagitis (non-cancerous part) (). However, early esophageal cancer was highly suspected. We expected secure diagnosis of the lesion by reducing the inflammation of esophageal mucosa by the POEM procedure. Thus, we performed myotomy from the distal side of the lesion, and the patient planned to undergo endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) procedure after POEM. We selected a posterior method for POEM, as there was severe scarring on anterior wall in the lower esophagus. During the POEM procedure, it was very difficult to create the submucosal tunnel because the mucosa adhered to the muscles (). Therefore, we inserted an endoscope into the extraesophageal space through a tear in the musculature (). Both the inner circular muscle and longitudinal muscles were pulled and divided carefully using a Triangle Tip knife to prevent mucosal damage outside of the esophagus (). The total length of myotomy was 8 cm (the gastric side was 1 cm).\nAfter POEM, LES opened and patient\u2019s dysphagia improved.

The Glasgow coma scale score on admission was a 4T, as the patient had decerebrate posturing. Her eyes deviated downward with non-reactive, pinpoint pupils. Informed consent was waived due to the patient's neurological presentation. A CT scan of the head revealed a calcified lesion in the right cerebellar cortex with an acute intralesional hemorrhage and adjacent subdural hematoma. Effacement of the fourth ventricle with associated obstructive hydrocephalus was also noted (Figure ).\nAn emergent right frontal external ventricular drain was placed in the emergency department as a temporizing measure. The opening pressure was over 30 cm H2O (Figure ).\nA CT angiogram of the head and neck to rule out underlying vascular lesions was unremarkable. The patient was then taken to the operating room for surgical decompression. A paramedian suboccipital craniotomy was performed on the right side. The dura was opened and a subdural hematoma was quickly encountered and evacuated. An intra-axial cerebellar tumor rapidly presented as the dissection proceeded and a significant amount of intratumoral hemorrhage was noted. A gross total resection was undertaken (Figure ).\nA very small amount of tumor was purposefully left on the brainstem in an effort to avoid significant morbidity from an injury to the lower cranial nerves and the vertebral artery branches that were involved within the tumor. Final pathology of the tumor revealed a pilocytic astrocytoma (Figures -).\nThe patient was following commands on the first postoperative day and was extubated a few days later.

    "original_text": "A 44-year-old female presented with pain in the lower back radiating to the right leg. Her symptoms first developed three years ago. When she walked for 10 minutes, her pain was aggravated and accompanied by numbness with a cramping sensation in the right leg. There was no weakness or sensory changes. No abnormal signs were seen on physical examination. For three years, she had been treated with oral medication and three sets of epidural steroid injections. The effect of the third epidural steroid injection did not last for more than one month. Moreover, PEA with the Racz catheter did not effectively reduce her pain level. The patient continued to complain of pain with a score of 8 on the NRS and she could not walk for more than ten minutes. His functional score on the ODI was 64. Her lumbar MRI revealed central disc extrusion at the L4-5 level with central canal stenosis, and bilateral L5 nerve root compression.\nWe planned PEA and decompression with the inflatable balloon neuroplasty catheter, and prepared as described above. A caudal epidurogram showed a filling defect from the central epidural space at the L4-5 level to both L5 intervertebral foramina (especially the preganglionic area).

The mother gives history of her child inserting a foreign object in the nose 1 day ago while she was playing outside the house with other children. On examination, the child had high-grade fever and foul smelling brownish fluid discharging from the left nostril. There was also swelling and redness noted over the left nostril extending to the left cheek. Anterior rhinoscopy examination revealed a round metallic looking object embedded in the anterior aspect of the left nasal cavity. An X-ray of the lateral view of the face was done which revealed a round looking foreign object embedded in the left nasal cavity []. The patient was then referred urgently to the Department of Otolaryngology, Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, for further management after the attempt of removal of the foreign body failed. On examination, there was swelling around the left alar region of the nose which was extending to the left cheek. The skin in that region appeared inflammed. The nose was examined using an endoscope, which revealed a button battery embedded in the cartilaginous portion of the nasal septum in the left nasal cavity. The mucoperichondrium of the septal cartilage appeared eroded. The child was admitted with a diagnosis of button battery in the left nostril with left facial cellulitis.

He was diagnosed as gallbladder stone and admitted to our hospital for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Preoperative electrocardiography was within normal limit, and chest X-ray showed no pathologic abnormality. He was consulted to cardiovascular department because surgeon heard a continuous cardiac murmur and ordered echocardiography for a preoperative evaluation. The echocardiography showed normal ejection fraction (64%). The mitral inflow E/A ratio was 1.63, and E/E' ratio was 12.0. The valvular morphology and function was normal.

The pain of the patient often occurred at night and it was not related with daily or sporting activities and most commonly felt at rest. Her symptoms started insidiously and she did not mention any trauma. She had been smoking 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, and she did not suffer from any medical condition. Furthermore, no hereditary disease was found in the patient's family history.\nPhysical examination revealed no abnormal findings. Her blood tests were all normal, including all the inflammatory markers. The patient underwent plain radiograph examination and a 21-millimeter-diameter cystic lesion was observed in the long axis of the calcaneus. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination was applied for the confirmation and it showed 22 \u00d7 20 mm intraosseous cystic lesion at the posterior part of the calcaneus which revealed hypointense signal on T1-weighted images and hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images (). The contrast-enhanced MRI was not available for this patient.\nAlthough the lesion was radiologically benign, extended curettage and iliac bone grafting were planned to exclude the malignancy risk that may be caused by smoking history. The operation was performed under spinal anesthesia. After bone grafting from the right ilium was completed, tourniquet was applied to the right thigh. A lateral approach to the calcaneus was used. After opening a 10 \u00d7 10 mm valve from the lateral aspect of the calcaneus, the cyst was excised and the cyst walls were debrided by burr.

CT scan of the chest revealed signs concerning septic pulmonary emboli. She was also found to have severe sepsis and was transferred to the coronary care unit for further management.

Clindamycin was added for synergism, given her extensive septic pulmonary emboli. Repeat blood cultures revealed the same organism for 3 consecutive days. Her respiratory status continued to worsen, and she was consequently intubated. No source other than intravenous drug use (IVDU) was found to be the cause of the bacteremia. Due to the size of the vegetation and persistent bacteremia despite appropriate medical therapy, cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for the possibility of surgical intervention, but the patient was deemed a poor surgical candidate due to her poor nutritional state and hemodynamic instability.

However, about an hour after de-clamping, the patient suddenly complained of severe respiratory distress, cough with foamy sputum, and vomiting. Immediately the chest tube was clamped to stop drainage. With oxygen saturation measured 75%, oxygen was administered to the patient via an oxygen mask, but no improvement was observed.

The admission report indicated that, in the morning, the patient had experienced paraesthesia restricted to the left side of his face and the left arm. The patient also showed motor control deficits characterized by spontaneous and unrestrained levitation of the left arm. The patient's daughter indicated that the ocular trauma had resulted from an abrupt uncontrolled movement of the arm that occurred suddenly while the subject was getting dressed. It should be noted that the patient was unaware of the consequences of the movement as he suffered from visual impairment. The abrupt movement resulted in a severe blast-like contusion that eventually led to the surgical removal of the eye. On admission, the patient was vigilant and alert, the neurological examination showed moderate (+3) weakness in the left superior and inferior limbs, mild paresis, of central origin, of the cranial nerve VII, and absence of sensory deficits. The finger-to-nose test revealed the presence of segmental ataxia restricted to the left arm. Neglect was absent. The patient had an uncontrolled, spontaneous levitation of the left arm that persisted even when performing distraction manoeuvres. The patients reported that he felt that the limb was extraneous and disturbing to the point he asked to have the arm tied to the bed. We did not observe paroxysmal limb movements. During the first day of hospitalization, the patient was neuroradiologically examined with a computed tomography (CT) brain scan that was negative for signs of recent or ongoing ischaemic or haemorrhagic events.

    "cleaned_text": "on february 2018, an 80-year-old right-handed man was admitted to our neurological ward as a consequence of movement disorders leading to self-inflicted contusive trauma to the left eye. the admission report indicated that, in the morning, the patient had experienced paraesthesia restricted to the left side of his face and the left arm. the patient also showed motor control deficits characterized by spontaneous and unrestrained levitation of the left arm. the patient's daughter indicated that the ocular trauma had resulted from an abrupt uncontrolled movement of the arm that occurred suddenly while the subject was getting dressed. it should be noted that the patient was unaware of the consequences of the movement as he suffered from visual impairment. the abrupt movement resulted in a severe blast-like contusion that eventually led to the surgical removal of the eye. on admission, the patient was vigilant and alert, the neurological examination showed moderate (+3) weakness in the left superior and inferior limbs, mild paresis, of central origin, of the cranial nerve vii, and absence of sensory deficits. the finger-to-nose test revealed the presence of segmental ataxia restricted to the left arm. neglect was absent. the patient had an uncontrolled, spontaneous levitation of the left arm that persisted even when performing distraction manoeuvres. the patients reported that he felt that the limb was extraneous and disturbing to the point he asked to have the arm tied to the bed. we did not observe paroxysmal limb movements. during the first day of hospitalization, the patient was neuroradiologically examined with a computed tomography (ct) brain scan that was negative for signs of recent or ongoing ischaemic or haemorrhagic events. the ct scan only showed the presence of an old malacic lesion in the right occipitoparietal region. a second ct brain scan, performed 24 h later (fig. ), revealed an ischaemic lesion localized in the right thalamus. the patient showed signs of cognitive impairment when tested with",

    "original_text": "The proband is a 14-year-old previously healthy female born to nonconsanguineous healthy parents who was admitted for having fever, fatigue, lower quadrant abdominal pain, and vomiting. Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) revealed significant hydronephrosis consistent with a right ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction, for which she underwent ureteral stent placement on hospital day 2. Her postoperative course was complicated by continued abdominal pain and fever, as well as an episode of rectal prolapse. Of note, she also endorsed an episode of rectal prolapse months prior to presentation which was manually reduced at home. On hospital day 6, due to continued fevers, abdominal and pelvic MRI was obtained. This study revealed a pelvic fluid collection concerning abscess; CT guided transgluteal drainage performed by Interventional Radiology resulted in 150ml cloudy yellow fluid. The etiology was believed to be an infected urinoma caused by instrumentation during stent placement and she was treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole.
