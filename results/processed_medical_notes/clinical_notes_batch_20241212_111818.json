Pathology examination of the biopsy materials of the swelling excluded malignancy and the patient was scheduled for a parotidectomy operation with a diagnosis of benign Whartin tumor.

In the three years prior to development of the current tumor, the patient received kaletra (lopinavir and ritonavir) and tenofovir; viral load was undetectable (<40 copies/ml) and CD4 count was 220/uL around the time of diagnosis.\nThe patient subsequently developed cough and had a CT scan of the chest, which disclosed bilateral pleural thickening, and an incidental right adrenal mass lesion, with no other abnormalities detected. The patient was then referred for a core needle biopsy of the right adrenal mass, performed under CT guidance. Following pathological diagnosis (see below), the patient underwent clinical staging via CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, and a PET scan. As shown in , imaging studies characterised a bi-lobed, inhomogeneous mass in the right adrenal gland involving the right adrenal lateral limb and body, measuring 4.6 cm in greatest dimension, with a normal left adrenal gland. The PET scan disclosed a 5.5 cm hypermetabolic focus within the right adrenal gland with no evidence of other hypermetabolic foci elsewhere in the body.

He was diagnosed with EB during a genetic consultation that he had received before getting married at the age of 28 years. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with RDEB at the age of 38 years. Application of a strong external force to the skin results in blister formation as early as 15 min. In June 2012, he presented to a nearby hospital with epigastric pain, where he was diagnosed with cholelithiasis and cancer in the transverse colon and was referred to our hospital. In September 2012, transverse colectomy and cholecystectomy were performed via laparotomy, followed by an uneventful postoperative course. In April 2013, a liver metastasis (S2) was detected. The lesion was a solitary tumor measuring \u22642 cm and was treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in June 2013, again followed by an uneventful postoperative course. In September 2015, a recurrent tumor was detected at the site of RFA, with suspected invasion into the diaphragm. He was then admitted to our hospital for curative open surgery. On admission, although no active blistering was noted, pigmentation and scars due to recurrent blistering were noted especially in the extremities and back. Most fingers in both hands were club-shaped, with a few intact fingers.

He was treated with arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using semitendinosus and gracilis (HT) graft fixed with 15 mm closed-loop button on the femur and 25 mm \u00d7 8 mm titanium screw on the tibia and medial meniscus balancing. Post-operative radiographs confirmed well-fixed button and good tunnel positions (). The patient was started on knee rehabilitation, closed chain exercises, and full weight-bearing.\nTwo months after the surgery, the patient met with a road traffic accident and fell from a moving motorcycle with twisting injury to the same knee. The patient presented to us 7 days later with severe pain, even on slight movement, moderate effusion in the right knee with an inability to bear weight. Lachman and varus and values stress test were positive. An anteroposterior radiograph revealed a double joint line sign of lateral femoral condyle with the button sunk inside the lateral femoral cortex. Oblique radiograph confirmed a fracture passing through the femur tunnel with the button inside the fracture (). MRI showed a spiral displaced fracture of the lateral femoral condyle (), intact but lax graft fibers, and a button artifact inside the fracture line with intact medial collateral ligament and lateral collateral ligament ().\nArthroscopy assisted fracture reduction and internal fixation with an assessment of graft and possible salvage were planned. Arthroscopy revealed an intra-articular spiral fracture of the lateral femoral condyle involving the femur tunnel with intact graft fibers trapped into the fracture site making the fracture reduction difficult.

His physical exam was remarkable for a holosystolic murmur at the apex, radiating to the axilla. He was alert and oriented to self, but not to place or time. Cranial nerves were grossly intact with no focal neurological deficits. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis and mild hyponatremia. A computed tomography scan of the head did not show any acute intracranial hemorrhage. A lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid analysis did not suggest meningitis; however, the patient was started empirically on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed large area of infarction in the left frontal, left parietal, and left caudate body, suggestive of a cardio-embolic source (Figure ). An echocardiogram revealed a large, mobile, vegetation (1.5 x 1.5 cm) on the mitral valve likely affecting the anterior and posterior leaflets with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation (Figures -). Blood cultures were sent to the lab, which later grew Streptococcus agalactiae.

Five years later, the patient received surgical treatment for a herniated spinal disc at levels L5-S1. Due to adjacent segment degeneration, the patient underwent L5-S1 spinal fusion two years later (Figure ).\nIn 2013, the patient underwent implantation of an IADP and received ITMS with satisfactory pain relief (Figure ).

Pain in the foot began in 3 years ago and it also developed gradually in her lower leg and back. Fracture of the right femur and osteopenia was detected on general radiographs. She underwent conservative treatment and diagnostic workup. She was diagnosed as osteomalacia and took calcium and phosphate. On past medical history, the patient underwent a endoscopic surgery for sinusitis with polyp at 7 years ago. She had no remarkable family history. Nasal endoscopy revealed a smooth pinkish hard mass filling the left nasal cavity. It was extended to superior nasal meatus and made lateral displacement of nasal septum and middle turbinate (). No abnormalities were noted in physical examination of other head and neck area. Nasal computed tomography revealed a expansile hypervascular tumor with dimensions of 3\u00d73\u00d71 cm located in the left nasal cavity and posterior ethmoid sinus. The mass demonstrated a scattered calcification and expansive bony destruction (). Laboratory examinations before surgery showed hypophosphatemia, normocalcemia, high serum alkaline phophatase, normal parathormone, normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Subsequently, the patient underwent a biopsy, the histology revealed findings that were highly suggestive of fibroma. On the basis of these findings, the patient didn't undergo selective angiography prior to surgery. We performed wide excision with about 5 mm free margin via endoscopic route under general anesthesia. It was difficult that we dissect the mass because of adhesion to skull base and sphenoid sinus. There was significant bleeding during the excision and the amount of bleeding was around 300 mL, but hemostasis was readily obtained with bipolar cautery and packing.

However, the patient was lost to follow-up. In April 2011, he visited our hospital again with complaints of acute shortness of breath. At that time, a large amount of pleural effusion and a 17 \u00d7 15-cm huge mass were observed on the chest radiograph, and a transthoracic needle biopsy and thoracentesis were performed accordingly. The tumor was diagnosed again as a solitary fibrous tumor, and surgical resection of the tumor was recommended. However, the patient refused to undergo the operation. When he visited our hospital to undergo positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT), loss of consciousness developed suddenly while a blood sample was taken in the fasting state. Thus, he was admitted to the emergency room, and his blood glucose level was 38 mg/dL on admission. An examination of his medical history showed that the medication for diabetes mellitus was started 4 years ago, and this medication was stopped 2 years ago. According to the most recent chest CT scan, the size of the solitary fibrous tumor in the right hemithorax had increased to 18.5 \u00d7 14.5 cm, and a large amount of pleural effusion was observed (Fig. a-b).

He complained of paresthesias and pain in his right foot for the previous three weeks. The foot pain had reached the point at which he could no longer complete his daily occupation as a custodian. Physical exam revealed the lack of a palpable pulse on either the dorsalis pedis artery or the posterior tibial artery on the right side. Femoral pulses were 2+ on both the right and left sides. The initial ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement in the office was approximately 0.3. Further angiography showed occlusion of the above-knee popliteal artery and subsequent reconstitution of flow into the below-knee popliteal artery, as well as multiple stenoses in the superficial femoral artery. Biphasic waveforms were present in the right common femoral artery, profundal artery, and superficial femoral artery proximally. The right mid-superficial femoral artery, posterior tibial artery, and dorsalis pedis waveforms were monophasic. At that time, he was started on Atorvastatin and scheduled for a right-sided femoral angiography with possible stenting. During the procedure, his right common iliac artery was found to have about 90% stenosis with both external and internal iliac artery patent, with no disease. The findings in the right leg during the procedure showed both the right deep femoral artery and superficial femoral artery patent. The distal right superficial femoral artery, however, showed 80% stenosis in multiple segments.

Neurological examination showed symmetrical weakness and wasting of distal muscles of lower limbs with absent tendon reflexes, mild weakness of hand muscles with reduced tendon reflexes in upper limbs. Fasciculations were observed in muscles of thoracic and lumbo-sacral regions. Hoffmann and Babinski signs were absent. The use of two sticks was required for walking. Sensory examination in all limbs, bulbar and respiratory functions were normal. The ALSFRSr score was 39. Motor and sensory nerve conduction studies revealed reduction of compound muscle action potential amplitudes and mild slowing of motor conduction velocity in lower limbs. No alterations were detected in upper limbs. EMG examination showed acute and chronic severe denervation signs in lumbar-sacral and cervico-brachial bilateral multiple myotomes, and in thoracic paraspinal muscles, whereas muscles of cranial district had normal EMG pattern. MEP study showed absolute reduction amplitude of responses only in lower limbs with normal central conduction time in all districts. Autonomic and cognitive functions were spared. Brain and total spine MRI were normal. Blood creatine kinase levels were normal and CSF examination showed mild increase of albumine level.

    "original_text": "A 20-year-old male presented to a major hospital with a history of intermittent severe abdominal pain which commenced at approximately 7 years of age. The pain was characterized by a diffuse cramping quality, with greatest severity in the supra-pubic region, and was relatively stable throughout its course. In the days prior to this presentation, the pain had increased in frequency and severity. The patient had been previously investigated with ultrasonography, which yielded no significant abnormality. There was no significant past medical or surgical history and he was on no regular medications.\nThe only notable clinical finding was tenderness in the supra-pubic region. There was no evidence of peritonism. Routine blood tests were normal. Abdomino-pelvic computed tomography (Fig. ) demonstrated a moderate amount of free fluid on the right side of the abdominal cavity and appendiceal thickening. A testicular ultrasound yielded no significant abnormality. Due largely to the unexplained CT findings, the patient was consented for a diagnostic laparoscopy.\nLaparoscopy revealed an accessory intra-abdominal cyst encapsulating the entire length of small bowel (Fig. ) and the large bowel to the mid-transverse colon.\nA large volume of ascites was also noted. The sac appeared morphologically similar to peritoneum. It enclosed the entirety of the small bowel from a point approximately 5 cm distal to the duodeno-jujenal flexure to the mid-transverse colon. The sac also encased the corresponding vascular supply, including the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and its major branches.

In 2014, a complete excision was performed in the glabella and zygomatic region due to skin melanoma.\nThe ocular history included primary acquired melanosis with atypia in the right eye after surgical excision of conjunctival lesions in 2015. The family history was positive for XP (two paternal uncles with XP, died at 10 and 12 years of age due to melanoma cutaneous).\nOn examination, the best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 and 20/40 in the right (RE) and left eye (LE) respectively. Biomicroscopy showed a reddish mass in the temporal conjunctiva of RE with adjacent pigment. In the left eye she presented with a pigmented mass in the temporal conjunctiva with involvement of the limbus. Episcleral blood vessels were wide and tortuous in the temporal part of both eyes []. The anterior chamber was normal, gonioscopy was normal, intraocular pressure was 14 mmHg in each eye, fundus exams were normal. Regional lymph nodes were not palpable.\nShe was treated by surgical excision with no touch technique with surgical margins of 3 mm in RE and 5 mm on LE because of clinical suspicion of conjunctival melanoma. Involved epithelium was removed using absolute alcohol. Three freeze-thaw cycles of cryotherapy were applied to conjunctival margins after excision.

After magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination, a preliminary diagnosis was made of malignant mass in the shoulder joint. A tru-cut biopsy was performed, after which she underwent surgery for aggressive fibromatosis. Despite radiotherapy treatment for 6 months after surgery, her condition gradually worsened. During follow-up, an MRI study was carried out for suspected recurrences and, as a result, she was referred to our hospital with a diagnosis of recurrence of soft tissue tumor.\nOn physical examination, a deltopectoral incision scar, swelling, and superficial skin lesions, which were probably secondary to radiotherapy, were observed (). Neurological examination showed hypoesthesia and loss of temperature sensation in the left shoulder. Range of motion for passive movements was significantly higher than for active movements. Passive shoulder abduction was 45\u00b0, forward elevation was 40\u00b0, external rotation was 15\u00b0, and internal rotation was at the gluteal region. Muscle strength around the left shoulder joint was determined as 2-3/5. All the hematological investigations were within normal limits, on the basis of which syphilis and diabetes were ruled out. Radiographs of the shoulder joint showed destruction of the humeral head, osteolysis in the glenoid cavity, and areas of calcification on the soft tissue (). Shoulder MRI revealed marked fluid collection, intra-articular synovial hypertrophy, destruction of the humeral head, and a large lobular irregular mass formation (). The preliminary diagnosis at our clinic was neuropathic arthropathy of the shoulder joint. Cervical MRI was obtained to investigate the etiology.

Multiple gastric biopsies were taken, which under microscopy showed markedly hyperplastic mucosa with evidence of chronic ulceration; there was no evidence of malignancy. Computerised tomography (CT) revealed a well-defined homogenous mass measuring 5 \u00d7 5.6 cm projecting within the lumen, arising from the medial wall of the body of the stomach ().

She had been taking vitamin K antagonists, which were switched to low-molecular-weight heparin, and she was treated with magnesium sulfate and intravenous antihypertensive drugs. A primary caesarean section under general anaesthesia was performed at 30 weeks of pregnancy due to fetal distress, delivering a growth-restricted, premature girl of 920 g. Postsurgery the mother developed severe postpartum haemorrhage with a total of 5000 mL blood loss, and treatment was complicated by her anticoagulation therapy.

She had pleural effusion and thrombocytopaenia. She was later transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) due to deterioration of her condition, and echocardiographic examination revealed severe left ventricular dysfunction with mild dilatation of the ventricles. ECG showed a sinus tachycardia with low voltages in the extremity leads and a QS pattern in V1\u2013V3 (). Coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries and she was diagnosed with PPCM. She soon went into cardiogenic shock with high lactate levels, and when high dosages of inotropes could not stabilise her extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was started. Heart failure medication was started, which stabilised her condition, and after 15 days the ECMO could be removed. ECMO was complicated by cannula-related severe ischaemia of her right foot, which had to be amputated. She was transferred to a rehabilitation clinic after hospital discharge.\nBecause of the combination of multiple venous emboli, pre-eclampsia with proteinuria, pleural effusion and the thrombocytopaenia, the patient was referred to an immunologist, who diagnosed her with antiphospholipid syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).",

Physical examination revealed an indurated lesion with a diameter of 14 millimeter. There were no signs of enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. This has been confirmed by ultrasound of the inguinal region. A biopsy of the penile lesion was taken, which showed suspicion for malignancy. Since further specification was not possible, a second biopsy was taken.

Her history included mild hypothyroidism and right upper lobectomy for lung carcinoma 11 years previously. For 2 years, she had complained of shortness of breath when lying in the left lateral decubitus position. She had felt dyspnea after mild exercise for 9 months. Recently, she had a sense of abdominal fullness. Although administration of diuretics was started, her symptoms did not completely improve, and she was referred to our department for surgical treatment. The follow-up chest X-ray showed a gradually protruding right-side shadow of the cardiac silhouette, and the cardiothoracic ratio on the chest X-ray reached 88% (Fig. ). The electrocardiogram showed AF with low fibrillatory wave amplitude. Echocardiography showed an enlarged right ventricular (RV) cavity and mild paradoxical motion of the ventricular septum. The tricuspid valve had no findings of an organic and constructive abnormality, with no severe tethering. The annular size of the tricuspid valve was 50 mm, and the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion was 21 mm (Table ). Repeated preoperative cardiac catheterization showed slightly elevated wedge pressure with mild pulmonary hypertension, although LV function was preserved with a cardiac index of 4.0 (Table ). There was no L-R shunt disease. Computed tomography (CT) findings showed that the maximum size of the RA reached 121 mm (Fig. ). The change in dimension of the RA by CT showed that the size of the RA increased with time (Fig. ). Blood tests showed no liver dysfunction.\nSurgery was performed via median sternotomy. The pericardium was extremely thin on the RA side without any defect. There was no adherence in the pericardial cavity.

Abdominal ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic lesion with a maximum diameter of 40 mm in the left lobe of the liver (Fig. ). Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a lesion with coexisting low- and high-density areas in segment III of the liver. The lesion was adjacent to the stomach antrum and had a maximum diameter of 55 mm, with enhancement at the edge. The lesion contained air and a high-density linear object measuring about 24 mm (Fig. a, b). We suspected a liver abscess secondary to gastric perforation caused by a foreign body. The patient underwent abscess drainage and removal of the foreign body using five-port laparoscopic surgery. Adhesions had formed between the liver and reticulum due to inflammation (Fig. a). We confirmed pus leakage, performed lysis of adhesions, and found a fish bone inside the reticulum (Fig. b\u2013d). The fish bone was removed laparoscopically.

Retrospectively, she showed sudden onset of transient chest pain and dyspnea approximately 2 months before the surgery. Except for that, she had an unremarkable medical history, such as any recent/previous injury or intravenous drug injection to her extremities. The laboratory data were within normal limits.

Since the patient requested surgical resection of the aneurysms, a longitudinal skipped incision was performed below the aneurysmal nodules and along the course of left cephalic vein (). Multiple cystic and bead-like appearing venous aneurysms were present, measuring 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 mm3 or 16 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 14 mm3, respectively ().\nOn the scanning magnification of one aneurysm (), its transverse section showed that a localized and abnormally dilated venous lumen was filled with mixed stratified thrombi, surrounded by variably thinned medial wall with focal, markedly reduced or absent medial smooth muscle layer and elastic fibers. Elastica van Gieson (EVG) staining clearly revealed complete loss and focal dissection of medial to adventitial elastic fibers in the variably thinned aneurysmal wall (). Correspondingly, intimal fibromuscular thickening was partially recognized, accompanied by increased or decreased elastic fibers () and associated with variously degenerated and fibrous change by the Masson\u2019s trichrome or alcian blue staining.

Initial evaluation showed a well-defined cortical lesion (2.5 cm \u00d7 2 cm) in right fronto-parietal region with perilesional edema in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain and an enhancing renal lower polar mass measuring about 10 cm \u00d7 6 cm on computerised tomography (CT) of abdomen with subcentimetric parenchymal nodules in basal lung filed largest measuring 7 mm. Renal biopsy confirmed the primary to be clear cell carcinoma (ISUP grade 2).\nAs per the recommendation by the multidisciplinary tumour board, the patient was treated with radiation therapy (single-fraction frameless stereotactic radiosurgery to the brain lesion 13 Gy) for brain lesion followed by sunitinib therapy at an oral dose of 50 mg daily for 4 weeks on and 2 weeks off. Dexamethasone 16 mg was also given daily, which was progressively decreased until discontinuation during the following months.\nMRI of the brain (March 2014) revealed complete remission of the tumour (). Computerised tomography of abdomen (April 2014) revealed a reduction in the size of renal mass (). The patient underwent laparoscopic radical nephrectomy in April 2014. By February 2017, there was complete remission of brain and chest metastasis, but was found to have a lesion in the right kidney, for which the patient underwent radiofrequency ablation in March 2017. The procedure was uneventful and the patient was put on regular follow-up.\nThe patient developed chronic renal failure with serum creatinine level reaching 6.8 mg/dL and proteinuria. As a result, sunitinib was reduced to 25 mg OD (duration of therapy 40 months) and later changed to sorafenib 200 mg BD (on sorafenib for 21 months till last follow-up).

Her case papers of first surgery done 10 years back were not available. On physical examination a lump in right lumbar region just lateral to previous paramedian incision was palpated. Rest of the abdomen was unremarkable.\nUltrasonography showed multicystic complex mass in right lumbar region measuring 25\u00d78\u00d77 cm. Computed tomography scan abdomen and pelvis () showed a 25\u00d710\u00d76.5 cm sized well defined non enhancing lobulated multiloculated cystic lesion in right paracolic gutter on lateral aspect of ascending colon. Inferiorly it was abutting the lateral wall of urinary bladder. Similar morphology lesions were seen in pouch of Douglas and mesentery. All these finding were suggestive of recurrent lymphangioma.\nPatient was subjected to surgery with a retroperitoneal approach as majority of the mass was retrocolic in position. Incision was taken below and parallel to 12th rib extending from posterior axillary line and going anteriorly towards umbilicus by keeping the patient in left lateral position. Initially retroperitoneal component of lesion was dissected out from kidney and ureter and lastly from retro peritoneal surface of colon. During this peritoneum was opened and the intra peritoneal component including pelvic component was completely removed. Intra operative finding showed a cystic multiloculted mass loosely attached to serosal surfaces of the ascending colon extending into pelvis with intra peritoneal extension into pouch of Douglas.

Renal biopsy at that time showed thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). He was temporarily treated with plasmapheresis and was started on hemodialysis, which was later switched to peritoneal dialysis. After multiple episodes of fever and polyarthritis he was diagnosed with adult onset Still's disease (AOSD) and treatment with anakinra 100 mg on alternating days was started, which was later increased to the standard dose of 100 mg daily when renal function spontaneously increased. Four years after anakinra was started, this patient received a renal transplantation from a living related donor. He was started on immunosuppressive therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), tacrolimus and prednisone. Anakinra 100 mg daily was continued without interruption, only a single dose was skipped at the day of transplantation. After transplantation, kidney function improved rapidly and he could be discharged from the hospital 7 days postoperative. In the first year after the transplantation he experienced only two minor infections: an abscess located at an old drain entry site was drained 2 months after the transplantation and he was admitted for 5 days 6 months after the transplantation because of an upper respiratory tract infection. During these episodes anakinra and other immunosuppressive drugs were continued. 14 months after the transplantation this patient has been admitted for 34 days, and again 7 months later for 11 days, including several days in the intensive care unit, because of fever, encephalopathy and renal failure. These episodes were caused by exacerbations of the underlying AOSD. Two consecutive kidney biopsies showed endo- and extracapillary glomerulonephritis without signs of rejection or TMA. Treatment with high-dose steroids led to recovery of kidney function. Because of these severe exacerbations and apparent anakinra failure, anakinra was switched to the anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab. The transplantation is now 2.5 years ago",
