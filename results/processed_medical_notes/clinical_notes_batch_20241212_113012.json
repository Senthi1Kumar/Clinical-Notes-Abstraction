Since then, she had taken antituberculous therapy with isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. In January 2009, her regimen was changed to isoniazid, ethambutol, and levofloxacin due to development of drug-induced hepatotoxicity, after which she had no discomfort and her laboratory findings normalized. However, from May 2009, her dyspnea and chest discomfort showed a gradual increase. Upon physical examination, her blood pressure was 130/85 mm Hg, heart rate was 63 bpm, and respiratory rate was 18 bpm. No neck vein engorgement, pitting edema, or organomegaly were observed. In addition, her heart and lung sounds were normal, as were the results of her laboratory examinations.\nA chest radiography revealed a new rounded bulging of the superior cardiac border and an adjacent lung nodule ().

In her past medical history, she had hypothyroidism and diabetes insipidus (DI) being treated with levothyroxine tablet 0.1 mg daily and desmopressin spray, one puff every 6 hours, respectively. She was also receiving propranolol tablet 20 mg daily and atorvastatin tablet 20 mg every night. The MRI of pituitary gland reported partially empty sella with a flattened pituitary gland. Her previous medical history was otherwise unremarkable; specifically, there had been no earlier laryngeal disease or signs of upper airway obstruction. She had no history of aspiration or previous intubation. There was no significant finding in her family or habitual history. She was not a smoker and had no history of voice abuse.\nPhysical examination showed a 5\u22175 cm supraglottic mass with extension to the pharynx.

Two years after the initial resection, she developed a local recurrence in the left scapula and subsequently underwent extensive resection surgery for both the tumor and clavicle. No residual tumor was detected following surgery. In the following year, multiple bilateral lung nodule shadows appeared on CT.

The liver biopsy showed septal fibrosis and infiltrating lymphocyte in his liver tissue associated with degeneration of limiting plate, and histologic activity index\u2014METAVIR score (Thio et al. ) was A2-F3. He had been living in Japan all his life and had no family histories of viral hepatitis. He denied intravenous drug use and dissolute sexual behavior in Japan, but admitted occasional sexual intercourse with men in Thailand since he was 20 years old. The screening for HIV antigen/antibody test was positive and HIV infection was confirmed by the positive Western-blot HIV antibody test. The Serological HBV genotyping test by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in the clinical laboratory testing industry (SRL Inc. Japan) showed genotype D. However, his social history was not compatible with the risk of chronically HBV gonotype D (HBV/D) infection because HBV/D is rare throughout Japan except for some areas and not prevalent among men who have sex with men (MSM). Then, HBV-DNA genotyping was performed using obtained isolates from this patient. We cloned full-length HBV isolates and determined the complete genome sequences of 2 obtained clones as previously reported (Sugauchi et al. ). Briefly, the full length of HBV genome was amplified as two overlapping fragments by using the primer set to yield a 3200 bp amplicon for fragment A and another primer set to yield a 462 bp amplicon for fragment B.

The patient was addressed to our institution for a long-lasting history of idiopathic chronic pancreatitis and was submitted to CPD with the intention to treat a severe recurrent abdominal pain syndrome associated to stenosis of the main pancreatic duct. During the recovery period, pulmonary embolism was diagnosed and the patient received full dose anticoagulant therapy. On day 14, she presented acute epigastric pain and abdominal CT imaging demonstrated a well-defined 1.7 cm pseudoaneurysm of the first jejunal branch close to the origin of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) (). After multidisciplinary meeting, transcatheter coil embolization was considered as the optimal treatment option. This procedure was performed in the interventional radiology suite through a 5-French sheath percutaneously placed in the right common femoral artery. After SMA catheterization, direct access into the pseudoaneurysm sac was obtained using a 2.7-F microcatheter (Progreat; Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) and one electrolytically detachable coil (GDC 14 mm\u201330 cm, Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, MA, USA) was used to occlude the pseudoaneurysm. During coil release, the direct access into the pseudoaneurysm was lost, even after many attempts. Subsequent images showed that only incomplete filling was obtained and further embolization was necessary (). Analysis of the previous angiographic images showed that the efferent artery branch of the aneurysm was in communication with a collateral vascular arch between first and second jejunal arteries, which could permit an access through the opposite side. A microcatheter was successfully and rapidly placed into the pseudoaneurysm using this route ().

    "original_text": "A 36-year old woman presented with an acute biliary pancreatitis at a peripheral hospital, after which a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. One year later, she developed several episodes of acute onsets of abdominal pain, which were caused by biliary pancreatitis. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed a high suspicion on presence of small bile stones in the remnant cystic duct. Although, Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreaticography (MRCP) did not show either an evident remnant biliary duct or presence of bile stones in either the remnant cystic duct or CBD, which could be explained by the limited image quality due to artefacts. Moreover, it has been shown that MRCP has a 93% sensitivity for detection of bile stones []. The a priori probability on presence of CBD stones was assessed as low, as no biochemical evidence of post hepatic obstruction (elevated bilirubin) was present. Based on this, patient was referred to an university hospital to investigate the possibility to remove the bile stones in the remnant cystic duct either endoscopically or surgically., Given the clinical symptoms, the findings at EUS (length of remnant cystic duct and suspicion on small bile stones in remnant cystic duct) and MRCP, the patient opted for a definitive therapeutic approach (surgical resection of remnant cystic duct) instead of another diagnostic modality (endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography), although this could have had therapeutic implications. Consequently, the case was discussed at the hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) multidisciplinary team meeting and a robot-assisted surgical resection of the remnant cystic duct under NIR fluorescence guidance using ICG was proposed.

    "cleaned_text": "a 36-year old woman presented with an acute biliary pancreatitis at a peripheral hospital, after which a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. one year later, she developed several episodes of acute onsets of abdominal pain, which were caused by biliary pancreatitis. endoscopic ultrasound (eus) revealed a high suspicion on presence of small bile stones in the remnant cystic duct. although, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreaticography (mrcp) did not show either an evident remnant biliary duct or presence of bile stones in either the remnant cystic duct or cbd, which could be explained by the limited image quality due to artefacts. moreover, it has been shown that mrcp has a 93% sensitivity for detection of bile stones []. the a priori probability on presence of cbd stones was assessed as low, as no biochemical evidence of post hepatic obstruction (elevated bilirubin) was present. based on this, patient was referred to an university hospital to investigate the possibility to remove the bile stones in the remnant cystic duct either endoscopically or surgically., given the clinical symptoms, the findings at eus (length of remnant cystic duct and suspicion on small bile stones in remnant cystic duct) and mrcp, the patient opted for a definitive therapeutic approach (surgical resection of remnant cystic duct) instead of another diagnostic modality (endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography), although this could have had therapeutic implications. consequently, the case was discussed at the hepatopancreaticobiliary (hpb) multidisciplinary team meeting and a robot-assisted surgical resection of the remnant cystic duct under nir fluorescence guidance using icg was proposed. after screening for contraindications for the use of icg (impaired kidney function, hypo/hyperthyroidism, pregnancy, and allergy for iodine), the patients provided informed consent for the use of icg nir fluorescence imaging.\nafter induction of general anaesthesia, 5 mg (2.5 mg/ml) of icg was injected iv in order to visualize the biliary ducts. the patient was positioned in reverse trendelenburg, and a small",

    "original_text": "A 51-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for a behaviour and mood disorder that had arisen almost one year before our evaluation together with the complaint of mild memory deficit.\nHistory taking disclosed a sudden onset of left-sided limb weakness at the age of 49 that lasted 4 days, for which patient did not consult a specialist. Subsequent routine medical investigation revealed severe hypertension (of unknown onset) for which she was started on antihypertensives. Six months after the acute episode, she began to present a mood disorder with a change in behaviour. She had at least two episodes of insomnia, distractibility, increased energy, and expansive and elevated mood, circumstantially accompanied by eccentric behaviour (such as bathing while dressed), lasting nearly one week each. These episodes of elevated mood alternated with periods of apathy, loss of interest or decreasing physical energy, and depressive mood.

A complete resection of the urethra and a radical dissection of the left inguinal lymph nodes was performed concomitantly in our surgical department. Only 1 month after the intervention intravaginal mucosal metastases were diagnosed and histologically confirmed (). Computed tomography (CT) scans showed nodal metastases in proximity of the left iliac vessels with no option to obtain a complete resection of the tumor masses. Molecular analyses of the tumor showed wild types in the BRAF- and NRAS gene and a p.K558dup mutation of c-KIT on exon 11. In view of the locally advanced, inoperable melanoma a systemic therapy with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab was induced and temporary obtained stable disease. After administration of 10 cycles of pembrolizumab the patient started to suffer from recurrent vaginal bleeding, which significantly restricted the patient's quality of life. Clinical examinations revealed ulcerated pigmented intravaginal metastases. Imaging confirmed loco-regional progress without distant metastases (). Hence, 4 weeks after the last dose anti-PD1 antibody and in agreement with our patient, we initiated treatment with the oncolytic virus T-VEC (first administration 106 PFU/ml, followed by 108 PFU/ml at week 3 and followed Q2W, 1\u20133 mL). In cooperation with our department of gynecology T-VEC was injected directly into the intravaginal mucosal metastases. The injections provoked moderate local bleeding of the mucosa, and the patient suffered from flu-like symptoms a few hours after injections. The patient did not show any signs of a herpes infection at any time. Our patient reported that the T-VEC applications were tolerable and that the side effects did not restrict her daily life. Laboratory investigations did not reveal any significant pathologic findings. After the first injections, metastases slightly seemed to increase in size, but vaginal bleeding remarkably",

One year previously, a pimple approximately the size of a grain of rice had appeared in the patient\u2019s left nasal cavity without evident inducement. The pimple caused no itching or pain, and the corresponding external skin on the nose exhibited no noticeable change, so the patient paid no attention to the pimple. Subsequently, the nodule gradually grew. Six months prior to the current presentation, the patient noticed that the nodule was locally red, swollen and erosive, and the patient felt mild nasal congestion and had difficulty breathing. The patient was diagnosed with chronic nasosinusitis at the Ear, Nose and Throat Department of a local hospital. Subsequent to receiving cephalosporin antibiotics as an anti-inflammatory treatment, the redness and swelling subsided, but the nodule remained. Afterwards, the nodule continued to enlarge progressively and grew internally and externally, accompanied by hyperemia and swelling of the corresponding skin outside the nose. Three months prior to the current presentation, upon agitation by the patient, the nodule ulcerated and oozed blood, with locally damaged skin, deteriorated nasal obstruction and a large amount of purulent nasal discharge.

Noninvasive mechanical ventilation (MV) was used for initial treatment but hypoxemia was worsened; hence, she was intubated and invasive MV was used. On her physical examination, we auscultated mild crackles bilateral on lower lung zones. Her chest X-ray showed bilateral nonhomogenous infiltration at middle and lower zones (). While initial fraction of inhaled oxygenation (FiO2) was 80% on MV, her PaO2 was 65 mmHg and lung protective MV strategies were applied. An appropriate fluid replacement, antibiotics, and other medical treatments were applied. Undergoing MV, FiO2 level was decreased gradually and she was weaned from MV on her fifth day of ICU stay and MV. After weaning, we observed that her oral secretions increased and her left nasolabial sulcus wiped out. On her neurological examination, abnormal findings were not found except left facial paralysis. We did not study out any pathological imagination neither on her cranial computed tomography (CT) nor on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Peripheral facial paralysis (PFP) was diagnosed and intravenous steroid treatment 1 milligram per kilogram (methylprednisolone) was added to her therapy by neurologist.

There was no history of limb numbness, weakness, or walking difficulty. The bowel opening and micturition were normal. On examination, visual acuity in the right eye was counting fingers and left eye was hand movement. Both pupils were sluggish and a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) was not apparent. Both anterior segments were unremarkable. Funduscopy showed a diffuse hyperemic swollen disc with dilated vessels in both eyes. The left eye was found to be more profound than the right eye (Figure ). The macula was normal in both eyes. There was no sign of retinitis or choroiditis. She was admitted to the ward for further investigation. Urgent computed tomography (CT) of the brain, orbit, and paranasal area was performed. Both optic nerves had homogenous enlargement which was suggestive of optic neuritis. The left optic nerve was slightly prominent compared to the right side (Figures -). The brain and paranasal views were normal. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) showed 6 mm/hour and the white cell count was within normal limit. Blood screening for infective and autoimmune processes was unremarkable. Mantoux test was negative. A diagnosis of bilateral optic neuritis post-HPV vaccination was made.

Chest computed tomography revealed a soft tissue density at the left lower lobe bronchus (LLLB) with stenosis of the left main bronchus and emphysema of the left lower lobe ().\nAirway exploration by fiberoptic bronchoscopy under sedation and local anesthesia through the nasal route was performed to locate the suspected bronchial lesion.

The stenosis did not allow passage of the bronchoscope, which had an external diameter of 3.6 mm. A smaller bronchoscope with an external diameter of 2.8 mm was able to pass through either lumen divided by the bridging scar tissue. Advancement of the bronchoscope revealed that the bridging scar tissue ended 5 mm above the left second carina, and a pink tubular-shaped FB was lodged in the LLLB. However, the nature of the FB in the left main bronchus was unclear. Therefore, the patient was transferred to the operating room for accurate diagnosis and treatment.\nIn the operating room, the patient admitted that she had aspirated a plastic whistle 6 months previously. A laryngeal mask was used during general anesthesia, allowing the patient to breathe spontaneously.

As headache and nausea were still present on the following day, he visited the general outpatient clinic by walking. During the physical examination, the patient was clearly conscious without any neurologic deficit symptoms or meningeal irritation symptoms. On head CT, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was observed []. On the subsequent DSA of the left vertebral artery, a slightly abnormal shadow from the meningeal branch was detected, however, it was not concluded as the source of bleeding. The patient received conservative treatment, and on day 15 of illness, DSA was repeated. On angiography of the left vertebral artery, the patient was diagnosed with dAVF, with which blood flew in from the radicular artery of the left vertebral artery and flew out to the anterior spinal vein at the level superior to the C1/Foramen magnum []. CBCT was performed using an Allura Xper FD20/10\u00ae angiography device (Philips Electronics Japan). The images were obtained at a tube voltage at 80 kv, 30 fr/s using nondiluted contrast medium at 1.0 ml/s for 25 s.

    "original_text": "The case report involved a 75-year-old woman with no special medical history. The patient's height and weight were 147 cm and 49 kg, respectively. She visited a nearby clinic and presented with a tumor on the right clavicle and a sense of discomfort. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a large right-upper mediastinal tumor and micropulmonary metastases (Figures and ). The large tumor extended to the neck, subclavicle, and right-upper mediastinum. Partial resection of the lung metastasis was performed under thoracoscopy to diagnose the primary tumor. We did not biopsy the superior mediastinal tumor because it was an extrapulmonary lesion with no continuity with the lung lesion, which was covered by pleura. The pathological diagnosis was lung metastasis of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Although a small mass was also found in the thyroid gland, there was no malignant finding, and treatment was prioritized without further examination. Because the tumor obstructed the right brachiocephalic vein and approached the superior vena cava (SVC) junction, there was a risk of SVC occlusion and pulmonary embolism (). We decided to start treatment as soon as possible to avoid sudden death from pulmonary embolism. Lenvatinib treatment was started with approval from the Cancer Board of Kanagawa Cancer Center (IRB approval number 28\u201341). The tumor shrank upon treatment, and the major axis was reduced from 68 to 48 mm in diameter.

On physical examination, she was well built with normal vital signs. A 7 x 6 cm firm irregular subcutaneous mass was felt in the right lower para-umbilical area of the anterior abdominal wall. On palpation, the abdomen was soft and lax with no intra-abdominal masses. There were no palpable lymph nodes. Her cardiac and respiratory examinations were unremarkable. Computerized Tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a mass within the abdominal wall. Her laboratory investigations were within normal limits. A plain chest X-ray was unremarkable.\nWide local excision with safety margins of the tumor was done. The postoperative period was uneventful, and she was discharged on the second postoperative day in a satisfactory condition.\nGross examination of the specimen showed an ellipse of skin that measured 13 x 10 cm with subcutaneous fatty tissue measuring 11 cm in thickness. On cut section, a well-defined nonencapsulated grayish yellow mass measuring 7 x 6 cm with foci of necrosis was seen. No skin infiltration or abdominal skeletal muscle involvement was noted.\nMicroscopic examination revealed well-defined but nonencapsulated subcutaneous mesenchymal neoplasm composed of irregular islands of large cells with mostly round to oval pleomorphic vesicular nuclei, with markedly granular cytoplasm, and several large eosinophilic globules (). The nuclear cytoplasmic ratio was variable, with several cells having large nuclei. The tumor nests were surrounded by bands of fibrous connective tissue ().\nMany foci of tumor necrosis and scattered mitotic figures, 4 per 10 HPF at a magnification of 200, were identified (Figures and ).

The patient's chief complaint was an asymptomatic slowly progressive growth in the right mandible. The exact date, when swelling was first observed, was not clear. She also felt pain in this area. She had no noteworthy family history and her medical history was negative for trauma, pain, paresis, paresthesia, or lymphadenopathy. No symptoms, signs, or laboratory findings suggestive of parathyroid disturbances were detected.\nClinical examination revealed a swelling about 3 \u00d7 2 cm in size, causing slight facial asymmetry in the region of submandibular area, including parasymphysis region of the mandible. Assessment with palpation showed a hard, non-tender mass with smooth surface adhered to the mandible.

Drugs were not prescribed. The Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) index was calculated to be 40, with a marked impact on daily activity and social relationships. After a year, given the persistence of the symptoms, possible PANDAS was suggested.

Due to the severe clinical course, treatment with prednisone was introduce with the permanent relief of the symptoms.\nThe following year in August the same symptoms occurred in his 31-year-old sister (DO), who lived with her twin-sister (KO), separately from MO. Clinical characteristics and laboratory results were similar as in her brother (), and after prednisone therapy the permanent cure was achieved.\nIn the meantime, in June, the neck pain and fever occurred in KO (the twin sister of DO). KO was diagnosed with SAT in our department and the same treatment was introduced due to very severe neck pain and fever. However, her clinical course and laboratory results were different from MO and DO (). She was the only one who had preceding upper respiratory tract infection and was unnecessarily treated with azitromicin when the fever and neck pain occurred three weeks later. She had normal thyroid hormone levels while her TRAb level was significantly increased. Prednisone treatment (40 mg daily) was administered but every attempt to decrease the dose below 15 mg daily resulted in the recurrence of clinical symptoms and worsening of ultrasound (US) image and laboratory SAT markers. She had three episodes of recurrence and her SAT was diagnosed as glucocorticoid-dependent.

The patient was taking medications for hypertension and had a 60 pack-year smoking history, but reported that he had no history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia or cardiac disease. He described that he had an electrifying feeling in the dorsal spine at dinner and then 5 minutes later, he experienced weakness in both lower limbs. According to his medical record presented to the hospital, he had no abnormalities of consciousness and cognition, and no manifestations such as fever suggesting systemic infection or inflammation. The muscle strength using the Medical Research Council Scale was grade 5/5 in both upper limbs and 0/0 in both lower limbs, and numbness was observed below the T7 dermatome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (sagittal image of whole spine and axial image of cervical spine) and cervical computed tomography (CT) which were performed 3 hours after the onset of symptoms showed that the C6-C7 intervertebral disc was compressing the cervical spinal cord on the right central side (). Discectomy of the C6-C7 intervertebral disc and anterior interbody fusion of the C6-C7 vertebrae were performed as emergency care. The patient was transferred to the Department of Rehabilitation in our hospital for active rehabilitation treatment 1 month after the onset of the symptoms, with no clear postoperative functional improvement in the lower limbs. At the time of transfer to our hospital, muscle strength grade was 1/1 for hip flexion, 1/1 for knee extension, 1/2 for ankle dorsiflexion, 2/2 for ankle plantar flexion, and 1/1 for extensor hallucis longus muscle without spasticity. Sensory tests showed that pain and temperature senses were decreased, although touch, vibration, and position senses were normal in the T8-T12 dermatomes, and all senses were normal in the other dermatomes including the anal region.

There was no history of thoracic and abdominal trauma. A chest X-ray film revealed a double line on the right diaphragm (Fig. ). Chest CT demonstrated a well-circumscribed mass in the right thoracic cavity measuring 28 cm \u00d7 9 cm \u00d7 10 cm that was compressing the right lower lobe (Fig. a). The mass comprised mostly fatty tissue, and any other organs such as intestinal tract were not included in the mass (Fig. b). The results of blood chemistry studies, including tumor markers, were within normal ranges. Thus, the following differential diagnosis were considered: lipoma, liposarcoma, and diaphragmatic hernia. Surgery was performed for diagnosis and treatment via a small lateral thoracotomy via the seventh intercostal space with thoracoscopic assistance. A retroperitoneal fat pad of 28 cm in size was slid into the thoracic cavity from the right lumbocostal triangle, as the hernia orifice (Fig. a, b). The size of orifice was about 8 \u00d7 5 cm. We transected the neck of the fat pad above the orifice, because the hernia content in the thoracic cavity was larger than the orifice and difficult to reduce. Several feeding arteries contained in the stem were dissected by a vessel-sealing device. The orifice was closed by suturing the surrounding diaphragmatic muscle and the chest wall. The collapsed lung could be re-expanded by positive pressure ventilation without developing acute lung edema. The operation time was 112 min and the total blood loss 220 g. The fat pad measured 28 \u00d7 9.7 \u00d7 9.5 cm (Fig. a). Histological examination revealed maturated fat tissue (Fig. b). The chest drain was removed on the first postoperative day.
