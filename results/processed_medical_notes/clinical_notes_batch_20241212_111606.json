On clinical examination, the right upper central incisor presented with a complicated crown fracture and was tender on percussion with no abnormal mobility. A draining sinus tract was observed in the buccal mucosa in relation to the upper right central incisor (). The tooth did not respond to cold test or electric pulp test (EPT). Radiographic examination revealed the tooth to have an incomplete root with an open apex with no signs of any periapical changes (). The patient's history revealed that he had fractured the tooth following a fall at home 14 months back and had not sought treatment for the same until now.\nTaking into consideration the incomplete root development and nonvital status of the pulp it was decided to attempt pulp revascularization. Before proceeding with the treatment the risks and possible outcomes of the treatment were comprehensively discussed with the parent and consent was obtained.\nWe followed the technique as described by Banchs and Trope. Following administration of local anesthesia (2% lignocaine with adrenalin, 1:200000) and isolation with rubber dam, access was obtained to the pulp space. The canal was not instrumented, but was disinfected by copious irrigation with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite, dried with sterile paper points and flled with a creamy paste of metronidazole, ciprofoxacin and minocycline mixed in a ratio of 1:1:1 in propylene glycol. The access cavity was then sealed with resin modified GIC. When the patient returned after 4 weeks, the sinus tract had healed.

He has been working as a transport manager but had retired 1 month prior to presentation due to his current health problems. He was living alone in the countryside. The patient denied a past history of psychiatric or somatic disorders and was not taking any medication at the time of presentation. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Routine blood work that included clinical blood count and blood chemistry was evident for dyslipidemia.\nThe patient was referred for neurology and psychiatry consultations. On psychiatric interview, the patient was alert, oriented, and was noted to have symptoms of psychomotor retardation, tearfulness, depressed mood, feelings of worthlessness, and pessimistic thoughts about the future. The patient denied suicidal thoughts. Neuropsychological testing demonstrated mild cognitive impairment due to concentration difficulties, and moderately severe depressive symptoms as well as mild anxiety symptoms. The patient's symptoms were mostly consistent with major depressive episode, and antidepressant treatment with mirtazapine 15 mg once daily was initiated. Neurological examination did not reveal any cranial nerve deficits. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head was ordered to rule out organic brain lesions. Rather unexpectedly, non-contrast head CT demonstrated hypointense oval-shaped lesion of 0.9 cm in diameter within the projection of the anterior communicating artery that was mostly consistent with a saccular aneurysm []. On head CT scan, there were also multiple lacunar ischemic lesions and signs of chronic ischemic encephalopathy. There were no signs of subarachnoid bleeding.

He was otherwise healthy and denied any history of trauma or injury, did not smoke, and had no prior surgery or significant family history. He developed pain along the sciatic distribution 3 years before evaluation with progressive numbness, tingling, and weakness. His prior work-up included radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his L-spine which demonstrated Grade I anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 with associated degenerative disc disease (). Mild inferior foraminal narrowing was also noted. The patient had been treated by their primary care physician who referred them to pain management when physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medications did not improve his symptoms. His treatment course included epidural steroid injections and treatment with gabapentin and oxycodone. Two years before evaluation, he developed a palpable mass in his right upper calf that slowly increased in size. Nine months prior to evaluation, the patient had increasing pain and progressive weakness and numbness.\nOn evaluation, the patient\u2019s right calf measured 42 cm at the level of the tibial tubercle compared to 38 cm on the left. A firm, non-mobile mass was palpated with a positive Tinel\u2019s in the peroneal nerve distribution. The patient had numbness in the peroneal distribution with normal posterior tibial sensation.

He was diagnosed with CFRD based on fasting glucose and HbA1c levels along with symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia. He was started on insulin therapy the year following diagnosis () with 1 unit of rapid acting insulin analogue, insulin aspart, per 20 g of carbohydrates, and no basal insulin. Eight years after being diagnosed with CFRD, he was approved to start a new therapy, ivacaftor 150 mg orally twice daily for treatment of his CF based on his G551D mutation. Pre-ivacaftor, his insulin regimen was unchanged as he generally averaged between 4 and 6 units of insulin aspart per meal consistent with a carbohydrate content of 100 to 120 g per meal. This dose was consistent with what he received as an inpatient during admissions with stable postprandial levels not requiring additional correction. Within 6 months of starting ivacaftor, he reported recurrent hypoglycemic episodes and stopped insulin therapy. Between starting ivacaftor and the 3 subsequent years, the patient had been hospitalized for CF exacerbations 8 times at our institution. On these admissions, he rarely required insulin with only low-dose sliding scale insulin aspart as needed for elevated blood sugars. Fasting blood sugars during these exacerbations on ivacaftor were variable but similar to those pre-ivacaftor, with fasting blood sugars ranging between 70 mg/dL and 140 mg/dL. His HbA1c levels were monitored at each of these admissions (). During 2 of these exacerbations, he did receive single-dose intravenous methylprednisolone in the emergency room prior to admission: June 2012 and May 2015. On all other exacerbations, he was admitted directly from clinic for intravenous antibiotics without steroid administration.

He underwent an attempt to posterior repair three months post-trauma using a perineal approach with bulbomembranous anastomosis. Inadvertently, the anastomosis was performed onto the posterior surface of the prostate. The prostatic apex was dislodged anteriorly (). As a result, the patient went into immediate retention after postoperative catheter removal. An anatomical midline dissection using a combined perineal and suprapubic approach was chosen six months after the previous attempt. Vessel and nerve sparing dissection was used preserving the rhabdosphincter. The bulbous urethra was completely mobilized via a midline perineal approach, excising all excess scar tissues. The retrograde blood supply of the urethral bulb via the dorsal penile vessels was still satisfactory. There was no visible connection to the proximal urethral end. The distal end of the membranous urethra can almost always be identified directly underneath the symphysis, just proximal to the divergence of the corpora cavernosa. Care should be taken not to damage the dorsal neurovascular bundle of the penis that runs behind a thin fascial sheet closer toward the symphysis. After identifying the rhabdosphincter intrasphincteric dissection is used. There is a fascial plane on the inner side of the rhabdosphincter allowing for lengthwise sliding of the urethral wall. This plane allows for careful dissection (). The mobilized bulbous urethra was now pulled through the rhabdosphincter. It was not possible to find the proximal urethral end within severe scar tissue. Through a lower midline laparotomy the bladder outlet and prostate was explored.

    "cleaned_text": "a 20-year-old man suffered a severe crush injury of the pelvis with concomitant membranous urethral distraction injury. he underwent an attempt to posterior repair three months post-trauma using a perineal approach with bulbomembranous anastomosis. inadvertently, the anastomosis was performed onto the posterior surface of the prostate. the prostatic apex was dislodged anteriorly (). as a result, the patient went into immediate retention after postoperative catheter removal. an anatomical midline dissection using a combined perineal and suprapubic approach was chosen six months after the previous attempt. vessel and nerve sparing dissection was used preserving the rhabdosphincter. the bulbous urethra was completely mobilized via a midline perineal approach, excising all excess scar tissues. the retrograde blood supply of the urethral bulb via the dorsal penile vessels was still satisfactory. there was no visible connection to the proximal urethral end. the distal end of the membranous urethra can almost always be identified directly underneath the symphysis, just proximal to the divergence of the corpora cavernosa. care should be taken not to damage the dorsal neurovascular bundle of the penis that runs behind a thin fascial sheet closer toward the symphysis. after identifying the rhabdosphincter intrasphincteric dissection is used. there is a fascial plane on the inner side of the rhabdosphincter allowing for lengthwise sliding of the urethral wall. this plane allows for careful dissection (). the mobilized bulbous urethra was now pulled through the rhabdosphincter. it was not possible to find the proximal urethral end within severe scar tissue. through a lower midline laparotomy the bladder outlet and prostate was explored. endoscopy through the site of the suprapubic catheter revealed that the prostatic apex was dislodged anteriorly right behind the symphysis pubis. here the prostatic urethra was opened. no mobilization of the bladder or the remains of the prostate was possible above the pelvic floor. through the perineal incision the proximal corpora cavernosa were dissected in the midline, again",

He was born at term by elective cesarean section for prenatally diagnosed ventriculomegaly. At birth, he weighed 3.66 kg and was given APGAR scores of 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. He did require oxygen and bag mask ventilation. He was then maintained on nasal CPAP of 7 mm H2O and a FiO2 of 30%. A prenatal MRI showed he had vermian hypoplasia with associated cisterna magna and severe symmetrical ventriculomegaly with enlarged third ventricle. There were no other abnormalities related to the cardiorespiratory system or craniofacial structure.\nHe presented to the operating room with respiratory distress consisting of tachypnea and retractions despite the above mentioned ventilatory support. On physical exam he had severe microstomia and retrognathia (). He also had a cleft of the second palate. His lungs were clear to auscultation but as mentioned previously he was tachypneic. After placement of standard monitors, he underwent mask induction with oxygen and sevoflurane. Mask ventilation was a challenge, even performed by an experienced anesthesiology attending, due to the retrognathia without any translocation of his mandible to aid in lifting soft tissue. The patient was mask ventilated with an endoscopy mask, which allows for continued positive pressure mask ventilation while providing a site for flexible fiberoptic intubation. The mask has a flexible membrane that a fiberoptic scope can pass through while still maintaining a seal on the patient's face. After instillation of oxymetazoline HCl into the nares, flexible nasolaryngoscopy was performed to evaluate the anatomy, which showed significant tongue base prolapse causing retroflexion of the epiglottis.

The swelling got relieved on taking antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines but reoccurred again. There was no relevant past medical history. No history of trauma was prevailed. On clinical examination, we could only acknowledge the mobility of second primary molar which was about to exfoliate as mouth opening was reduced. There was no sign of caries on the first permanent molar. Nothing was acquired from oral examination, so orthopantomogram (OPG) was advised.\nOPG revealed no signs of carious exposure, impacted teeth, or cyst/tumor in that area (); therefore, ruling out to be hard/bony tissue pathology, soft tissue pathology was presumed. Then, the patient was advised for MRI. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a strange foreign body which was cylindrical in appearance situated near the retromolar area ().\nDue to lack of compliance and reduced mouth opening, it was planned to remove the foreign object under general anesthesia set-up. In the procedure, a vestibular incision is given from the region of first permanent molar to the anterior border of ramus. Mucoperiosteal flap is raised and blinded, but careful dissection is done in the region of pterygomandibular space so as to avoid any unintentional injuries ( to ).\nWe startled as we felt a hard structure, which was carefully separated from the adjacent vital structures such as inferior alveolar nerve and vessels, lingual nerve, and vessels. After elevation with the help of Ellis tissue-holding forceps, a strange foreign body was taken out which was found to be a cap of a plastic ball pen ( to ).

He had full functional capacity in all acts of daily living including driving, lived independently and was working until the day of his presentation. An initial physical examination revealed the presence of fasciculations in all muscles of the lower limbs, warranting further investigation and admission. The patient had stable non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\nAn initial neurological assessment revealed normal cognition, speech and swallowing. An examination of his central and peripheral nervous systems revealed no diagnostic abnormalities, other than the fasciculations in the lower limbs with mild asymmetrical leg weakness (Table , Day 1). His mini mental state examination result of 25 and clock drawing test measurement of four out of five were considered within normal limits for a French/Algerian man of age 70 where English was not his first language. Furthermore, his Addenbrooke\u2019s cognitive assessment and total functional capacity were normal. There were no upper motor neuron signs and the patient could walk without assistance. An initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan did not show diagnostic abnormalities in the brain or cervical spine. Nerve conduction studies were normal and an electromyography (EMG) test on day 9 showed widespread active and chronic partial denervation in all skeletal muscle sampled: fibrillation and fasciculation potentials were present in all examined muscles and in all four limbs.\nA week following presentation, our patient experienced increased difficulty walking with worsening leg weakness (Table , Day 7). The fasciculations had ascended and were now clinically evident in the lumbar and thoracic paraspinal muscles and upper limbs.\nElectroencephalography (EEG) revealed nonspecific slow wave changes without epileptiform activity.

During childhood, she had undergone several procedures to the hip including a Salter osteotomy. Radiographic evaluation demonstrated a lateral center edge angle (CEA) of 18\u00b0 and an anterior CEA of 5\u00b0 (). Arthro-CT showed an intact cartilage layer and an MRI of the knee was normal. She was initially treated with intra-articular corticoid injections with short-term benefit. However, after 2 years of conservative treatment, it was decided to perform a Ganz PAO to improve acetabular coverage. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia and patient controlled epidural analgesia was prescribed for postoperative pain control. The patient received a transfusion with 2 units of packed red cells because of postoperative anemia. Immediately after surgery, she suffered from hypoesthesia in the groin and mild adductor weakness due to neurapraxia of the obturator nerve. Clinical control at 3 months showed improvement of the obturator nerve neurapraxia and a normal function of the femoral and sciatic nerve. Radiographs demonstrated healing of the osteotomy sites and a normal CEA (). Electromyography revealed signs of ongoing reinnervation in the obturator nerve distribution and a reduced contraction pattern in the femoral and sciatic nerve musculature. Full weight bearing was allowed and physiotherapy was continued. However, at 6 months postoperatively, she complained of increasing pain and weakness in the left leg and the inability to walk without support. Clinical examination demonstrated weakness of ankle and knee flexion and extension, significant atrophy of the quadriceps muscle, and a colder and blue discolored left leg.

Limited angiographic images obtained demonstrated an 80% left main stenosis, with angiographically normal vessels in the remainder of the coronary tree. The patient was kept in hospital and sent for double vessel CABG, receiving a left internal thoracic artery (LITA) graft to LAD and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal. Since 1998, the patient had been relatively asymptomatic up until five months prior to current presentation.\nHer current symptoms were similar, though not identical to her initial presentation in 1998, but they were still provoked by activity and relieved with nitroglycerin spray and rest. She also reported a significant decrease in energy and her usual activities were limited due to exertional dyspnea. Review of systems was otherwise noncontributory. Notably, she was an active user of tobacco, smoking half a pack a day for the past ten years, was a social drinker, and had a mother who died from a heart attack in her early 60s. Her medical history was significant for gastroesophageal reflux, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. Her medications included atenolol, ezetimibe, rosuvastatin, paroxetine, and l-thyroxine. She had also recently been placed on topical nitrate patch. Her new-onset symptoms prompted a referral for repeat coronary and graft angiography, and possible percutaneous intervention if appropriate. Based on her cardiovascular history and current suggestive symptoms, stress testing was decided against, due to her high pretest probability of having ischemic disease.\nP",

She had no known comorbidities and her gynecological history included normal menstrual cycles that started at age 11. The patient also had no history of previous sexual activity. During a gynecological consultation in January 2013, a bulky tumor was visualized at the vaginal opening and a biopsy of the lesion was performed. No adnexal masses were detected. Histopathological examination was consistent with adenocarcinoma of the cervix. Since the material was not available for confirmation of this finding, the patient was referred to a gynecological oncologist who performed a second biopsy of the tumor. The patient developed a sudden episode of intense vaginal bleeding, fatigue, and dyspnea, resulting in hospital admittance. Her initial hemoglobin value was 5.4 g/dL (normal range, 12-16 g/dL) and blood transfusion was required. Concomitantly, the results of the second biopsy indicated necrotic tissue with inflammatory findings and an absence of neoplastic cells.\nBased on the clinical findings, epidemiological profile, physical examination, and previous histopathological results, the patient was treated with a total dose of 40 mg/m\u00b2 cisplatin and four fractions of 180 cGy radiotherapy. Staging exams were performed and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging revealed a uterine inversion due to a bulky lesion (110\u00d794\u00d782 mm3) present in the endometrium. This lesion also presented an exophytic component that extended through the vaginal canal (). No metastatic disease was detected. With evidence that the tumor originated in the endometrium, chemo-radiotherapy was suspended and a surgical approach was scheduled.\nTwo days after chemo-radiotherapy was discontinued, and while waiting for elective surgery, the patient experienced significant vaginal bleeding and hemodynamic instability. Emergency surgical intervention was required and a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and bilateral pelvic resection of suspicious lymph nodes was performed. Macroscopic analysis revealed uterine cavity inversion and a polypoid tumor mass with a lobulated surface located at the uterine fundus",

The patient is a known diabetic since 5 years and is under oral anti diabetic medication. Concurrent with the history of swelling, the patient gives a history of weight loss in past 2 months. No history of cold, cough or fever.\nExamination revealed a swelling of 9 \u00d7 4 cm in size which extended anteriorly 1 cm in close proximity to chin on left side and posteriorly in line with the ear lobe []. Skin over the lesion was pinchable, normal in color and texture. Margins were well-defined and the swelling was firm, fixed to underlying tissues and non tender on palpation. There were no signs of paresthesia. No local rise of temperature was seen in the concerned area. Left submandibular lymph node was 0.5 cm in size and mildly tender on palpation. A provisional diagnosis of benign tumour of left submandibular salivary gland was given. Few differential diagnoses such as Sarcoidosis, Sjogren's syndrome, Lymphomas and Mikulicz disease were considered. Sarcoidosis was ruled out because only one of the submandibular glands was involved. Generally, all the salivary glands are involved. Sjogren's syndrome was ruled out as there was no history of dryness. In both Sarcoidosis and Sjogren's syndrome, the patient did not give any relevant history. Mikulicz disease is an autoimmune disease and thus was ruled out.\nThe following investigations were done:\nFNAC gave an impression of chronic non specific lymphadenitis.

Shortly after onset, she visited an emergency center and was diagnosed with right hydroureteronephrosis on the basis of computed tomography (CT) at another hospital (Fig. ). She underwent balloon dilation of the right distal ureter. Her right hydronephrosis was relieved, and the final diagnosis was idiopathic right distal ureteral stricture (Fig. ). She subsequently had mild cyclic right flank pain and visited numerous physicians, including gynecologists, but the cause of her symptoms was not diagnosed. Two weeks before visiting our hospital, her right flank pain was acutely aggravated during menstruation. She visited another hospital and was diagnosed on the basis of ultrasonography (US) and CT with right hydronephrosis due to right distal ureter stricture; however, her hydronephrosis resolved after 1 week (Fig. ).\nThe patient denied any menstrual cycle irregularities or history of endometriosis; chronic disease; allergies; hospitalizations; or past surgical history, including abdominal and gynecological surgeries. The result of a comprehensive review of systems was negative. Routine laboratory test results, including urinalysis, were all within normal limits. Transabdominal US revealed improved right hydronephrosis (Fig. ) compared with the previous CT findings. On transvaginal US, the uterus was deviated to the right with a nodular lesion at the right uterosacral ligament; the right ovary was attached to the uterus, with no apparent cystic lesion (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 2.8-cm heterogeneous mass in the right uterine wall with a tiny implant in the serosa of the posterior uterine wall.

He described it as dull, non-radiating, and with no associated motor or sensory weakness. The patient denied shortness of breath, chest pain, productive cough, weight loss, night sweats, or loss of appetite. Physical examination was unremarkable. The patient reported a 10-year pack smoking history. One year prior to the current presentation, he was admitted to our hospital with severe stabbing abdominal pain radiating to the back. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography was done which showed an abdominal aortic dissection extending from thoracic aorta to left common iliac artery that was managed conservatively with tight blood pressure control. The patient admitted to not having any follow-up imaging since discharge from the hospital.\nA CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was ordered to evaluate the abdominal aortic dissection as the cause of his back pain. The results showed a stable long segment type B dissection of the descending thoracic aorta extending into the left common iliac artery. An incidental finding of a large lobulated pleural-based mass was also seen in the lower lobe of the left lung. A CT scan of the chest with contrast was ordered for better visualization of the mass, which again identified a large lobulated pleural-based mass in the posterior mediastinum measuring 21.5 x 9 x 10.2 cm (Figure ).\nA US-guided biopsy of the lung mass was done which showed a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm with a predominantly spindle cell pattern and epithelioid features, consistent with spindle cell carcinoma.

Before the visit, the patient had visited a local hospital where the patient was diagnosed with gingival bleeding and pharyngitis and treated using antibiotics. However, the treatment was not effective. At our hospital, laryngoscopy identified a red, peanut-sized neoplasm with a smooth surface, soft texture, and hemorrhagic tendency on the free margin of the caudal nasal septum. Nasopharyngeal mucosa on both sides was smooth (Fig. ). Considering the possibility of hemangioma, we admitted the patient for surgery. Physical examination performed after admission revealed no enlarged lymph nodes in the head and neck regions. However, axial computed tomography (CT) revealed a round and soft tissue shadow on the caudal nasal septum (Fig. ). Preoperative tests were comprehensively conducted, and no obvious contraindication of surgery was found. Accordingly, endoscopic resection of the nasopharyngeal mass was performed under general anesthesia. During resection, the bilateral nasal mucosa was contracted, and no obstruction of the bilateral nasal cavity was detected. Meanwhile, a red neoplasm with a smooth surface and hemorrhagic tendency was detected in the caudal nasal septum. The pedicle flap of the neoplasm was located in the upper third portion of the right side of the caudal nasal septum, and the mucosa around the pedicle flap appeared normal. Mucosal resection was performed approximately 0.5 cm around the root of the pedicle flap. Subsequently, the neoplasm was completely resected.

    "original_text": "We present the unique case of a 28-year-old male patient displaying a complex clinical picture with mental retardation and various behavioural problems since birth. Symptoms of the autism spectrum comprising difficulties in social interaction and communication are reported since childhood. Additionally, he suffers from auto-aggressive tics in terms of beating himself with objects against his head and lower jaw, head movement tics and simple vocal tics. Striking dysmorphic features are not evident.\nExcept a one-time bleeding in week 20 of gestation, pregnancy had been without any complications. No infections, medication, smoking, or intake of alcohol or drugs during pregnancy was reported. The patient was delivered in week 40 of gestation with the help of a ventouse due to irregular cardiac activity. During delivery there were minor signs of birth asphyxia. Birth weight was 2.900 g (25th percentile), birth length 51 cm (50th percentile) and head circumference 33 cm (<3rd percentile). During infancy a prominent frontal fissure was conspicuous. A premature ossification of the sagittal fissure could not be detected.\nThe patient showed psychomotor retardation: he walked alone only by 26 months and was not able to sit alone falling over to one side without shoring up even at the age of 2. Furthermore, tics in terms of eye blinking as well as a muscular hypotonia were described. The patient\u2019s parents reported early autistic features such as difficulties in social communication and interaction with avoiding eye contact and poor interest in social interaction. Development of speech was delayed (first words with 18 months).

On examination, a firm swelling approximately five centimeter in size was noted on the posterior mid thigh. The swelling was diffuse, tender, and deep to the muscles. The overlying skin was normal. The child was febrile and total counts were elevated. Sonography reported the possibility of abscess deep to the thigh muscle. He symptomatically responded to antibiotics, analgesics, and rest. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer tomography (CT) angiography reported the possibility of an infected hematoma or hemorrhage in non-involuting hemangioma with close proximity to the sciatic nerve [Figure and ]. The child was advised surgical excision for diagnostic confirmation with an explained risk of nerve damage. However, the parents did not give consent, so it was deferred.\nOn follow-up, the child developed weakness in the limb. The swelling was now more localized, firm, and non-tender. Fine needle aspiration was done, which revealed small round cells with mitotic figures. He was advised surgical excision. Operative findings revealed a variegated consistency mass in the substance of sciatic nerve []. The mass originated from the sciatic nerve with no gross involvement of the surrounding tissue []. The parents were counseled and informed consent was taken for nerve excision. The tumor was excised completely with one centimeter of the intact nerve at the upper and lower pole. In view of an established peroneal neuropathy for distal limb, a size-matching, peroneal nerve was harvested as a donor nerve for autologous nerve grafting.

Seven years after surgery, computed tomography (CT) revealed lymph node recurrence at the splenic hilum, which was treated with four courses of cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil. Treatment reduced the size of the lymph node, although 1 year later, lymph node metastasis was detected again at the pancreatic tail and splenic hilum (Fig. ). Chemoradiotherapy (50 Gy in 28 fractions) resulted in a complete response at the lymph nodes. However, 11 years after surgery, a cystic solid tumour was detected at the pancreatic tail using CT (Fig. a\u2013b) and endoscopic ultrasonography (Fig. a). A change in the main pancreatic duct was also detected using endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (Fig. b). No other metastases were seen on evaluation with positron emission tomography/CT (Fig. ), which strongly suggested primary pancreatic tail cancer with lymph node metastasis. Intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma was one of the differential diagnoses that were considered. Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with lymphadenectomy were performed to treat the tumour, which had a diameter of 30 mm and appeared to invade the artery of the gastric tube that had been reconstructed during the oesophagectomy. Thus, the artery was also resected to achieve curative resection. Operative time was 190 min and blood loss was 30 mL. The resected specimen from the pancreatic tail measured 29 \u00d7 22 \u00d7 30 mm (Fig. ). Pathological examination revealed that the tumour was a squamous cell carcinoma, which was compatible with the detection of the previous OSCC. The final diagnosis was pancreatic metastasis from OSCC (Fig. ). The resected metastatic lymph nodes at the splenic hilum also exhibited squamous cell carcinoma cells. The patient was discharged after an uneventful recovery. She is continuing clinical follow-up without adjuvant",
