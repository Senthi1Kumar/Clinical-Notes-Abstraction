The lesion showed relatively low density in arterial phase and faded signal in portal phase and delayed phase. HCC was highly suspected, and hepatic steatosis and cirrhosis were also noted.\nThe patient was admitted for further examination and treatment. No abnormality was found by blood tests.

    "original_text": "An adult captive male bateleur eagle (Terathopius ecaudatus) estimated to be 32 years old and weighing 2.4 kg was presented for evaluation of left hindlimb lameness. The animal had been transferred from another institution 4 weeks prior to presentation with a history of osteoarthritis at the left intertarsal joint and an asymptomatic systolic heart murmur. Laxity and varus deviation of the distal left hindlimb at the intertarsal joint were first observed 2 years prior to presentation at the animal's previous institution. It had also been treated for several previous episodes of bilateral pododermatitis.\nSeveral days after transfer into a new enclosure, the animal began to exhibit intermittent non-weight-bearing left hindlimb lameness and was prescribed tramadol (5.5 mg/kg bodyweight (BW) orally twice daily) for pain management. The animal failed to sufficiently respond to this treatment over the course of 1 month and began spending increased time in a sternal position or on the ground of the enclosure. Under general anesthesia with isoflurane gas and oxygen, a physical examination with radiographs, complete blood count, and plasma biochemistry was performed to evaluate the lameness. Physical examination revealed firm periarticular enlargement, reduced range of motion, subluxation, and dynamic varus deviation at the left intertarsal joint (). No evidence of pododermatitis was observed at either foot.

Since her diagnosis, she was started on short acting \u03b2-agonists followed by inhaled steroids.\nNot long after, long acting \u03b2-agonists and Montelukast were added to the treatment because of persistent asthma consisting of a persistent cough, shortness of breath and wheezes that were not responding to the treatment previously prescribed. She also was prescribed steroids as needed for relapses which happened frequently.\nShe sought help by multiple pulmonologists and internists, because it was interfering with her life activities, who prescribed her the same treatment and would put her on oral steroids which would improve the patient's condition partially but not completely.\nFrequent exacerbations were noticed but since she was already taking the maximal optimal dose for asthma medications, nothing else could be done.\nIn our hospital, the patient was reevaluated with a detailed history focusing on the place of residence, degree of ventilation of her house (which was well ventilated) and exposure to allergens and animals at home. There was nothing of significant value with no allergen exposure, no history of NSAIDs or \u03b2-blockers use and no heart burn. She did however mention a brownish colored sputum with a plug like consistency and multiple courses of antibiotics.\nShe also mentioned that her husband is an avid smoker but not in front of her and her past medical and surgical history was unremarkable despite the asthma.

According to the clinical signs of conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, pseudomembrane formation as well as preauricular lymphadenopathy, she was diagnosed with adenoviral conjunctivitis and given topical antibiotics. Three weeks later, she developed a decrease in vision and was referred to our clinic. On examination, her visual acuity was 20/125 bilaterally. Slit lamp showed normal conjunctiva, bilateral widespread subepithelial corneal infiltrates, in addition to central corneal edema with white distinct border resembling immune stromal ring, as well as Descemet's folds and keratic precipitates in the central area []. Anterior chamber was normal without any flare. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography showed corneal edema with keratic precipitates []. Central corneal thickness (CCT) was 969 and 956 \u03bcm in the right and left eyes, respectively.\nHer systemic evaluation revealed no immunosuppression; she had neither any systemic disease nor any history of varicella vaccination. Conjunctival scrapings, staining, and cultures of both eyes for viral and bacterial etiologies were performed.

It was hard in consistency, gradually increasing in size to attain the current size of 4 cm. He was diagnosed to have multiple myeloma stage IIIa in 2004, for which he underwent chemotherapy for a year. He again developed back pain and left hip pain for which he took radiotherapy. He underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery for sinusitis at another institution. He had a fall in 2008, and underwent left bipolar hemiarthroplasty and left lateral rhinotomy for the nasal mass. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the maxillofacial region revealed a rounded heterogeneous mass over the left side of the nasal dorsum and frontal process of the left maxilla. The lesion contained areas of amorphous calcifications and ossifications []. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were consistent with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma (36% plasma cells). Protein electrophoresis and immunofixation confirmed the myeloma band. The tumor was enucleated under general anesthesia. Intra-operatively, a mass was found to be over the left side of the dorsum of the nose and the frontal process of the maxilla was eroded. Specimens were sent for pathological examination.\nHistopathological examination revealed a well-circumscribed neoplasm, predominantly made up of acellular eosinophilic material, arranged as nodules, with extensive calcification and ossification [, ].

Patient was a Hindu priest by profession, was a resident of Jharkhand, and had a positive family history of rhinosporidiosis in a paternal cousin and maternal uncle. Patient had been operated on 11 times earlier; first surgery was done when he was 16 years of age. The last procedure was done about 1 year back with KTP laser when he had to undergo a tracheostomy because of the extensive nature of the disease. On examination, a fleshy mass was seen filling both nasal cavities with yellowish pinhead sized spots on surface. Note was also made of the presence of septal perforation in the cartilaginous part of the septum. The mass was extending in the oropharynx behind the soft palate. On laryngoscopy, growth was seen involving bilateral vallecula, bilateral glossoepiglottic fold, and lingual surface of epiglottis pushing the epiglottis over the laryngeal inlet. Vocal cords could not be visualized. A contrast enhanced computed tomographic scan was done, which revealed a homogenous mass filling bilateral nasal cavity without any bony invasion, although thinning of bilateral lamina papyracea was noted. Also mass was filling nasopharynx and oropharynx involving the lingual surface of epiglottis, obscuring laryngeal inlet (). Taking into account his history and the severity of his symptoms, a decision was made to operate on the patient.\nAn elective tracheostomy was done taking into view the difficult airway. Patient was put under general anesthesia. The nasal extension of the mass was first addressed under endoscopic vision.

There was no evidence of mediastinal lymph node enlargement on the chest CT. The patient was admitted to our hospital to investigate the pulmonary lesion. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) revealed significant uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) by the cavitary mass (SUVmax = 8.3), which indicated a probability of lung cancer. There was no significant difference in FDG uptake between the cavity and the area of consolidation within the lesion (Fig. ).\nThe patient underwent a right lower lobectomy. As shown in the CT image, the lesion revealed areas of cavity and consolidation. Pathologic results showed that adenocarcinoma (moderately differentiated) and pulmonary tuberculosis coexisted within the lesion (Fig. ). The consolidation was confirmed as due to adenocarcinoma, and the cavity was confirmed as due to pulmonary tuberculosis. In addition, there was evidence of adenocarcinoma at the borderline between the consolidation and cavity. After AFB staining, the pulmonary tuberculosis was confirmed as active tuberculosis.\nThe size of the lung adenocarcinoma was 2 cm and lymph node metastasis was absent. Thus, a diagnosis of stage Ib lung cancer was made. A recent study showed that adjuvant chemotherapy is not recommended for routine use in patients with stage Ib lung cancer after complete resection,[ and therefore, we did not perform adjuvant chemotherapy.

Recently, she felt shortness of breath even during short distance walking. She also complained of intermittent coughing for the previous 6 months. She was diagnosed with essential hypertension 2 years ago, and has been taking single antihypertensive medication. She did not recall any other medical conditions which can explain her symptoms.\nOn her hospital visit, her blood pressure was 122/68 mm Hg, heart rate 95 beats per minute and respiration rate of 22 per minute. Physical examination was not remarkable except for loud to-and-fro murmurs which were audible along the left sternal border. Breathing sound was clear in both lung fields. The chest radiograph showed slight increases in cardiothoracic ratio without signs of pulmonary congestions. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with QRS configuration of right bundle branch block.\nInitial laboratory studies revealed elevated levels of brain natriuretic peptide to 699 pg/mL, but the levels of cardiac markers including cardiac troponin and creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme were within normal limits. Routine blood cell counts and chemistry tests were also normal.\nOn transthoracic echocardiographic exam (TTE), basal part of interventricular septum was dissected by intrusion of a cystic cavity which communicated with coronary sinus of Valsalva. The cystic structure appeared in various sizes according to the cardiac cycle, increasing during diastole with protrusion into LVOT () and decreasing during systole (). Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) also showed dynamic changes of the cystic structure with inflows () and outflows () between the aortic root and the cavity. However, no shunt flow was observed between left and right heart.

    "original_text": "A 21-year-old male patient with Class II subdivision presented with the chief complaint of missing teeth in his lower back tooth region. On clinical examination, impaction of 47 was noted with the distal cusps exposed among the alveolar mucosa in relation to 47. Patient presents a past dental history significant to the cause. He had a root canal treated 46 due to chronic pulpitis at the age of 10 years followed by a crown at the age of 16 years, which might be a significant cause to chief complaint of the patient.\nOn clinical examination, 47 was missing and impacted with distal cusps exposed in the oral cavity without any signs of pericoronitis in the alveolar mucosa of 47 region. On radiographic examination, orthopantomogram revealed vertical impaction of 47 without any resorption or pathology associated with the teeth and periodontium. It was clearly noted that the potential for eruption was disrupted by the porcelain fused metalic (PFM) crown luted on endodontically treated 46.\nPrecisely the distogingival margin of the PFM crown, which was over contoured in the distal aspect acted as an undercut preventing the eruption of 47 [].\nThe treatment protocol has been planned and executed by Department of Orthodontics and Department of Periodontics. The first step involved in the management of impacted permanent second molar is periodontal surgery over the gingival mucosa in relation to the impacted teeth, which was required to gain access to the buccal surface of 47. The periodontal surgery was performed under local anesthesia with a carbon dioxide LASER. The LASER surgery was preferred since it had minimal bleeding thereby reducing bond failure on bonding. Picasso soft tissue diode laser (with 7 W, 810 nm) was used in the surgery. A bondable attachment (0.22 slot MBT premolar Bracket, Oramco) was placed in the exposed visible surface of impacted 47.

She complained of right upper quadrant fullness, and physical examination revealed a remote right subcostal incision. At the age of 12 years, she had first developed decreased appetite, weight loss, fatigue, pruritus, and subsequently became jaundiced. Medical records from that episode revealed that an endoscopic biliary stent was placed with surgical exploration through a right subcostal incision and partial resection/enucleation of a pancreatic mass. In the intervening 12 years, the mass had persisted and enlarged, although the patient was asymptomatic, having neither anorexia, pruritus, nor jaundice.\nRoutine hematology and basic chemistry panels were normal. The tumor marker cancer antigen 19-9 was mildly elevated at 89 U/mL (<35 U/mL). An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast revealed an 8.2 \u00d7 7.6 cm heterogeneous-enhancing lesion, prominently involving the uncinate process of the pancreas (). The pancreatic head and neck were displaced and splayed around the anterior aspect of the tumor. The mass abutted the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) as well as the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). There was no evidence of main pancreatic ductal dilatation and the pancreatic neck, body, and tail were normal. Imaging showed no evidence of metastatic disease to the liver or regional lymph nodes. The mass was believed to be an SPT, based on the previous partial resection and the accompanying pathology report.\nThe patient underwent an open cholecystectomy and a difficult classic pancreaticoduodenectomy. The operative time was 12 h and the estimated intraoperative blood loss was 1500 mL. There was no evidence of metastasis, but the tumor had adhered extensively to the SMV and portal vein and surrounded the SMA.

On initial neurological examination, the patient was lethargic but oriented to person, place and time. She had impaired concentration and required occasional tactile or auditory stimulus to maintain attention. There were no cranial nerve deficits. Strength was 4/5 in the bilateral upper extremities and 3/5 in the bilateral lower extremities. There were no pathologic reflexes and sensation to light touch was intact in all extremities. The patient then had a rapid deterioration requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Serum laboratory results and serology testing throughout the hospital course are presented in \u2013. Ceftriaxone, acyclovir, vancomycin, and ampicillin were started due to suspicion of meningitis based on the initial clinical presentation and serum testing. Computed Tomography (CT) angiogram of the head was unremarkable. Initial MRI Brain without contrast (hospital day 1) showed abnormally increased T2 FLAIR signal in the deep gray nuclei bilaterally, most prominent in the striatum (). Blood cultures were negative throughout her hospitalization. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was suggestive of meningitis and is presented in . Her CSF arboviral antibody panel is shown in and was initially unremarkable except for California encephalitis IgG 1:256.\nElectroencephalogram (EEG) showed diffuse background slowing and rare left temporal sharp waves.

She had a history of subtotal abdominal hysterectomy for uterine leiomyoma performed 3 years before and a history of right ovarian cystectomy. She denied any symptoms or presentations of endometriosis and had no history of hormone replacement therapy. Digital rectal examination revealed a fixed and firm mass with blood. Her serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels were in normal limits. The laboratory tests showed no remarkable abnormality except for a moderate anemia. Abdominal and pelvic computed tomographic (CT) scan demonstrated thickening of rectal wall with inhomogeneous enhancement and a 4 cm soft tissue mass that involved the rectum and left ovary (). The CT scan also revealed right hydronephrosis and hydroureter. On colonoscopic examination, a protruding lesion in the rectum and segmental stenoses of the rectosigmoid lumen were found. Endoscopic biopsy reported tubular adenoma and proliferation of spindle cells at the edge of tissue. Laparotomy was performed under the clinical consideration of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) or carcinoma developed on the rectum. On operation, nodular masses (1\u20133 cm in diameter) were found generally scattered in the intestinal walls and mesentery. Frozen section examination of nodules reported the exhibition of endometrial glands and whirling proliferation of plump spindle cells, considering extrauterine ESS as a clinicopathologic diagnosis.

This headache has been occurring in a frequency of once in 6 months beginning 7 years ago; however, 5 years ago, an intense occipital neuralgia occurred after the patient struggled while carrying a heavy object with his head. The condition of occipital neuralgia then was the sense of being squashed constantly. The areas of pain stayed in the fronto-occipital and back neck regions, and the pain was most severe in both sides of the lower margin of the inferior obliquus capitis muscle. When the head was tilted back, he felt the pain lessened slightly and when the head was bent, the pain increased. When the patient moved around, the headache worsened and when the patient laid on the back, the pain was reduced. The pain lasted for 3 days or once in a week then, yet, a year ago, before the patient's initial visit to the hospital, pain occurred almost consistently. When the headache worsened, it lasted from 24 hours to 48 hours and the visual analogue scale (VAS) was then approximately 10/10.

There was no obvious calcification of the aortic arch; angiography of the arch using 25 ml iopamidol was performed only once. Ten minutes after the aortic arch angiography, the patient experienced mild headache. The pain was bearable, and the patient could cooperate during the remainder of the procedure. The DSA was completed 20 min later. No haemorrhage or vasospasm was detected during the procedure. The headache was continuous, and the patient suffered nausea and vomiting. The immediate physical examination showed no obvious abnormal sign. The patient was treated with 8 mg ramosetron and 10 mg dexamethasone. After 20 min of observation, the symptoms were relieved. Her cerebral CT scan at the time was normal (Fig. a, b, c). Two hours later, the patient manifested dizziness with nausea and vomiting and was treated with 8 mg ondansetron and 20 mg diphenhydramine.

The headache occurred 2 to 3 times in a month and the duration of pain was 48 to 72 hours. The patient felt neck stiffness, fatigue, and depression 2 days before the onset of headache. She was managed with a combination of drugs, including acetaminophen 325 mg, dichloralphenazone 100 mg, and isometheptene 65 mg 3 times a day, as well as dexibuprofen 300 mg 3 times a day and metoclopramide 10 mg 3 times a day prescribed by a neurologist. Despite these medications, pain intensity was 7 using VAS, while the MIDAS score was 32 (Table ). After informed consent was obtained, ultrasonography-guided SGB was performed by injecting 5 mL of 1.5% lidocaine at the anterior aspect of the right 6th cervical spine transverse process. Thirty minutes after the right SGB, the left SGB was performed. During the intervention, the patient was monitored with noninvasive blood pressure, heart rate, and pulse oxygenation, and no complications associated with SGB were observed. The patient received bilateral SGB every 2 weeks for a month. After the second bilateral SGB, the incidence and severity of migraine significantly decreased. Pain severity was 4 on the VAS score, which lasted 24 hours. In addition, premonitory symptoms such as fatigue and mood change disappeared and the pain occurred 1 day before menstruation cycle. Therefore, bilateral SGB was performed once a month. Four months after bilateral SGB, the MIDAS score was 6 and pain was 3 on VAS, respectively (Table ). The pain was treated with oral acetaminophen 600 mg 3 times a day. However, migraine with pain intensity 3 on VAS continues to occur 1 day before menstruation cycle. Therefore, patient is still receiving bilateral SGB and oral acetaminophen 1200 mg once a month",

She had been well 8 weeks before admission when she experienced the sudden onset of sharp left anterior chest pain. The pain was worse in the area adjacent to the sternum and also worsens when she takes a deep breath. In 1999, she underwent radical left side mastectomy followed by CEF (cyclophosphamide, epirubin and fluorouracil) chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The clinical and histological characteristics of the primary breast cancer revealed a Stage IIIa adenocarcinoma with positive axillary lymph node metastasis. Her estrogen receptor assay, as well as the amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER 2/neu) was negative. Expression of her progesterone receptors was defined as low (Reiner score for staining of tumour-cell nuclei). On admission our patient's vital signs were normal. She had neither jugular venous distension nor cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Her chest was clear on auscultation. There was no tenderness on palpation of her ribs or sternum. The remainder of her examination results was normal.\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of our patient's chest revealed a 74.2 \u00d7 37.7 \u00d7 133.6-mm mass in her anterior mediastinum adjacent to the main pulmonary artery, the right ventricle, and ascendens aorta contiguous to the pericardium (Figures and ). There was no specific direct evidence of vascular invasion but we raised the question of pericardial invasion. Our patient was vigorously scrutinized for metastatic disease, which included routine blood chemistries and the determination of lipid associated sialic acid, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 15-3 serum markers. CT scan of her neck and abdomen for restaging revealed no other foci of metastatic disease. A bone scan showed uptake only in her sternum.\nOur patient was anaesthetized and ventilated with a double-lumen",
