On examination, a 3 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm ovoid swelling was palpated lingual to the edentulous alveolar ridge, extending from midline (lingual frenum) to the right premolars []. It was a firm, non-tender, non-compressible, non-reducible, did not move with deglutition and showed no change in size with meals. No pulsations were felt over the mass and no vascular channels seen. The swelling was not fixed to underlying tissues and salivary secretions were normal. Some cervical lymph nodes were palpable but not tender. There was no neural involvement or sudden increase in size. Complete hemogram, serum electrolyte levels, kidney function test and liver function test had all values within the normal range, but for a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (50 mm/h). Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the lesion suggested PA. Node Ib was palpable, but non-reactive on FNAC. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 20 mm \u00d7 18 mm \u00d7 15 mm well defined well-marginated lesion in right sublingual space in the region of anterior aspect of sublingual gland []. It indented the inferior surface of tongue and right genioglossus muscle and did not cross midline. Multiple mildly enlarged bilateral level Ib, II and III lymph nodes were noted. A provisional diagnosis of PA of sublingual gland was made and local excision of the lesion along with the gland was planned under L.A. Incision was placed from midline extending posteriorly near the alveolar ridge in order to protect the Wharton's duct. With careful dissection, lingual nerve was identified and protected. On surgical exploration, it was found that the mass involved the deep part of submandibular gland and duct with the sublingual gland being compressed by the mass. It was difficult to delineate",

She received an offer from a brain dead, 9-month-old female donor with a terminal creatinine of 0.2 mg% and donor weight of 10 kilograms. The recipient-to-donor weight ratio was roughly six-to-one. After performing the standard multi-organ procurement, it was noted that the donor left renal vein was essentially dismembered from the inferior vena cava (IVC). This prohibited performing the standard en-bloc technique to transplant the kidneys. Normally, the suprarenal IVC is sutured closed, and the infrarenal IVC is spatulated at the iliac bifurcation for anastomosis to the recipient iliac vein. The pediatric kidneys were divided on the back table similar to an adult kidney procedure. The left renal vein was separated completely. The aorta was split down the middle and Carrel patches were made around the renal arteries. The right renal vein was elongated using the donor IVC in the standard fashion, and a venotomy was made on the side of the IVC for the anastomosis. The transplant then proceeded normally by exposing the right iliac vessels. Adequate exposure was achieved. The internal iliac veins were ligated and divided to elevate the external iliac vein and allow for a tension-free anastomosis. The external iliac artery was dissected to its full length, from the takeoff of the internal iliac artery to the inguinal ligament. The two kidneys were transplanted by stacking them on the same side. The left kidney was placed higher to allow the longer vein to cross over the iliac artery. The arterial anastomosis was performed using Carrel patch to the external iliac artery. The iliac veins were reconstructed in the usual fashion to the external iliac veins. Schematic diagram of the techniques is demonstrated in Figure . We used 7.0 non-absorbable monofilament stitches in a running fashion for all anastomoses. Both kidneys were reperfused simultaneously (Figure",

We established that his symptom was caused by DPN in his leg, characterised by an elephant-like pigmented cutaneous tumour.\nWe planned serial excision with the resection area being from the buttock to the posterior thigh. Before the procedure, interventional radiologists performed TAE with Serescue\u2122 to the feeding vessels originated from the superior and inferior gluteal arteries and the deep femoral artery of the affected side. An occlusion balloon was placed within the right internal iliac artery (IIA) to prevent uncontrollable critical haemorrhage.\nUnder general anaesthesia, we resected the tumour in the posterior thigh towards the head (A). In the buttock area, torrential bleeding from the wound occurred. The occlusion balloon in the IIA was inflated, and the bleeding was reduced temporarily. The total intraoperative blood loss was 4970 mL. We transfused 1960 mL of concentrated red cells and 1680 mL of fresh frozen plasma. The resected tumour weighed 5 kg with confirmed porous particles occluded in the arteries (C).\nTo prevent further bleeding from the wound edge, additional TAE was performed to the superior and inferior gluteal arteries immediately after surgery. The wound edge became gradually necrotic and dehiscent (B). Finally, we performed debridement and wound closure operation 4 weeks after the first surgery.\nThe second debulking surgery in the lower leg was conducted 4 months after the first debulking surgery.

The patient had an elevated creatinine level of 3.5 mg dl\u20131 and presented with back pain and fever raising a suspicion of pyelonephritis. Ultrasound imaging showed bilateral hydroureteronephrosis. Laboratory investigation revealed increased white blood cell count.\nMRI was requested to elucidate the cause of the bilateral hydronephrosis. Evaluation by MRI additionally showed filling defects in the calyces of both kidneys (). Further, the right kidney showed a thin rim of parenchymal diffusion restriction with diffusion restriction of the calyces and the tip of the medullary pyramids in both kidneys (). This suggested a possibility of early right-sided pyelonephritis with a diagnosis of bilateral papillary necrosis. Other features of papillary necrosis such as filling defects, clefts and phantom calyces were seen. Urine culture demonstrated the growth of Escherichia coli ().\nThe patient underwent bilateral ureteric stenting, followed by a course of antibiotics. This resulted in improvement of patient symptoms with return of routine urine examination and urine culture to normal.\nThus diffusion restriction at the calyx and tip of the renal pyramid with filling defects within the pelvicalyceal system was seen in all five cases of papillary necrosis. A cleft in the region of the tip of the renal pyramid was seen in two of the five patients. This led us to conclude that diffusion restriction at the calyx and tip of the renal pyramid with filling defects within the pelvicalyceal system is an important finding in papillary necrosis.\nAlso to be noted in this series is that all patients had elevated creatinine levels, which prevented the use of intravenous urography (conventional) or contrast-enhanced CT or MR urography. MRI can provide valuable information by imaging the urine-filled ureter. Thus, at our institution, in this subset of patients, imaging with MRI",

Previous to this, she had undergone total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophorectomy for uterine cervical cancer in February 1993 and had undergone a modified radical left mastectomy for left-sided breast cancer in September 2008. Thus, the Klatskin tumor was her third cancer.\nAfter confirmation of the Klatskin tumor, a radical operation was performed on April 20, 2012. The operation consisted of resection of the left lobe of the liver and radical extrahepatic bile duct resection with Roux-en-Y heapticojejunostomy, combined with portal vein partial resection and re-anastomosis. The tumor was pathologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma consistent with a Klatskin tumor that had directly invaded the liver. In addition, the tumor was present in the portal vein, lymphatic area, cystic duct, and perineural area. The distal bile duct resection margin was focally involved, and the liver parenchymal resection margin was very close. Because of these high risk pathological findings, postoperative three dimensional conformal radiotherapy was performed from May 22, 2012, to July 3, 2012, with a total radiation dose of 54 Gy over 30 fractions. The radiation treatment volume included the tumor bed and regional lymph node area. The antrum of the stomach was also included in the radiation treatment volume ().

He was born at term with uneventful pregnancy, and he is the first child of nonconsanguineous parents. There was no history of autoimmune or primary immunodeficiency disorders in the family. Intradermal BCG vaccination was inoculated at the left buttock without any reaction within 3 months of life, and intramuscular vitamin K was routinely given after birth. He was exclusively breastfed. At 3 months of age, he developed frequent vomiting and irritability. Physical examination revealed enlarged and tense anterior fontanelle. CT brain showed hyperdensity lesion size of 1.5 \u00d7 1.8 cm at left temporal lobe with perilesional edema () which was confirmed to be intracerebral hemorrhage. All hematologic, coagulation studies and biochemical laboratory tests () were consistent with deficiency of vitamin K dependent clotting factors. The cause of vitamin K deficiency in this patient was presumed to be caused by malabsorption mechanism. Therefore, intravenous vitamin K was given for 3 days at initial presentation, and the coagulogram data was corrected within 24 hours. One week later, the patient developed steatorrhea. Fat malabsorption was suspected as the levels of fat-soluble vitamins were evaluated (). Cystic fibrosis was excluded by the negative sweat chloride test. At 4 months of age, perianal abscess was detected and treated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for 7 days without surgical drainage. However, subsequent pus culture was not performed. At the age of 6 months, lymphadenopathy of 3 cm in size at the left groin was detected.

The level of suspicion for malignancy was low, and this was therefore assigned BI-RADS 4A.\nThis persisted on additional views. High-resolution sonography revealed no suspicious focal mass. There were only some minimal fibrocystic changes which could potentially correlate with indeterminate mammographic findings. However, the sonographic examination was noncontributory.\nThe imaging was reviewed and decisions regarding core biopsy with titanium clip placement were made.\nPatient informed the team that had some mild adverse skin reactions to base metals previously; namely common materials such as copper, lead, nickel or aluminum used in costumes or jewellery. There was no history of previous medical interventions, autoimmune diseases, and atopic dermatitis, and she was not aware of any allergy or prior contact with titanium.\nSince the asymmetry in keeping with an area of interest was well seen on mammography, an open coil\u2013shaped hydro-mark titanium clip was chosen to enable the potential follow-up and exact correlation with sonography. The hydro-mark clips are stainless, based on hydrogel technology, and consist of both hydrogel and titanium. These markers hydrate the site of interest after deployment and subsequently enable long-term visualization with both ultrasound and T2-weighted MRI sequence. Moreover, the left-sided mammographic abnormality regarding our patient was nonpalpable.

The clinical history did not reveal any systemic pathology associated with it. Intraoral examination revealed the presence of retained right maxillary deciduous central incisor (51), the absence of the corresponding tooth, i.e. right maxillary permanent central incisor (11), with the contralateral tooth already erupted. An intraoral periapical radiograph was obtained, which revealed the presence of a radio-opaque tooth-like structure in the apical region of 51 and an impacted permanent right maxillary central incisor whose path of eruption was impeded by the radio-opaque structure [Figure -].\nA complete blood investigation was carried out before performing the surgical procedure. Surgical excision of the odontoma was done under local anesthesia. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap from the right maxillary permanent canine to the left maxillary permanent canine was reflected []. The layer of bone overlying the calcified mass was removed and the calcified tooth-like structure was excised [Figure and ] without disturbing the underlying impacted right maxillary permanent central incisor and was sent for histopathologic examinations. In order to ensure that no denticles remained, a thorough curettage was performed in the area and radiographs were taken before the closure of the flap []. After hemostasis was achieved, the area was irrigated with normal saline and the lingual button was bonded onto the labial surface of the impacted right maxillary permanent central incisor and ligature wire was tightly secured to it; the mucoperiosteal flap was then sutured back in the position. After flap closure, the ligature wire was tightly secured to the arch wire in order to apply traction forces [Figure and ].

Physical examination and laboratory tests were unremarkable.\nOn admission, the water bottle sign of the cardiac silhouette was found on the chest roentgenogram (Fig. ). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a large (10.2 \u00d7 7.5 \u00d7 3.8 cm) well-defined homogenous hypoechoic mass located in the pericardial cavity, encompassing the anterior walls of aorta and pulmonary artery. Further assessment by enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a large lobulated low-density mass in the pericardial cavity (Fig. ). The tumor presented with septal enhancement and absence of parenchymal enhancement. Meanwhile, computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the heart confirmed normal coronary arteries and no compression signs by the tumor. After extensive workup, a preoperative diagnosis of cardiac liposarcoma was made based on the extensive growth and the enhancement of the tumor septa, which made us believe complete tumor resection was of high difficulty. Debulking surgery was scheduled to release patient\u2019s symptoms.\nIntraoperatively, a giant lipoid tumor originating from RA was noted after pericardiotomy (Fig. ). The tumor was based predominantly on the entire free wall of the RA, stretching down from the RA appendage all the way to the orifice of the inferior vena cava (Fig. ). The RA was extremely deformed owing to the significant local mass effect. Due to well capsulation and no signs of local invasion, the tumor was considered a lipoma and therefore resectable. Complete tumor resection was achieved during beating heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass assistance. Excision required removal of most of the RA free wall.

During this time her swelling remained non-tender, however towards the beginning of January 2016 she presented with pain in her elbow joint. Repeat imaging showed worsening of the left elbow joint mass and an enlarging right sternoclavicular mass. She was referred to a specialist centre for biopsy of the right sternoclavicular joint mass for suspected lymphoma. In April 2016, multiple biopsies of her right sternoclaicular joint showed necrotic material and inflammatory cells along with granulation tissue suggestive of osteomyelitis.

Her past medical history was insignificant except for a minor trauma to her upper abdomen three years back when she was evaluated for an incidentally detected retroperitoneal solid cystic mass lesion. Her abdominal examination showed an ill-defined mass in the epigastric region which was firm and non-tender. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed a solid mass lesion with heterogeneous echo texture in the lesser sac arising from the pancreas. Further imaging evaluation with the contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) abdomen showed an exophytic, well defined and encapsulated solid heterogeneously enhancing mass lesion arising from the body of pancreas pushing the stomach (Figure ).\nThere was also compression of the splenic vein along with partial compression of portal vein (PV) at the confluence and few perisplenic collaterals were noted. A clinical diagnosis of solid pseudo papillary neoplasm was made and we proceeded for laparotomy with the intent of curative resection.\nThe abdomen was opened by a midline laparotomy instead of the rooftop incision for cosmetic benefit. Intraoperatively, we found a highly vascular 10 \u00d7 10 cm lobular mass of variegated consistency arising from the proximal body of pancreas in the lesser sac with dense adhesions to the greater omentum and posteriorly to the Toldt\u2019s fascia. The mass was densely adherent to the splenic vein near the confluence. Figure showed an intra-operative photograph of the tumor being mobilized from the confluence showing the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and the portal vein which were free.\nThe splenic artery was found to be coursing through the mass.

    "original_text": "A 50-year-old male in excellent general health condition needed to undergo fixed implant-supported dental rehabilitation. Despite the strong motivation to be rehabilitated and the awareness of the related surgeries, at the first visit the patient was stressed about the dental therapies, exhibiting distress and anguish.\nFrom an oral point of view, the patient was afflicted by severe periodontal disease. He had lost all the teeth of the left side of the maxilla, except the central incisor; bone resorption of the area was massive with the tongue interposing between the arches laterally. The periodontal disease was progressively well controlled by proper therapies and a bone grafting of the left side of the maxilla was planned. According to the literature, autogenous bone is considered the gold standard for bone grafting procedures\n; therefore, calvaria was selected as donor site, to harvest bone blocks to perform vertical and horizontal bone augmentation in the large area for proper dental implants insertion and stabilization. Sinus lifting was planned concomitantly with bone augmentation. In this case, the unique appropriate sedation technique was general anaesthesia (Propofol; Starting dose: 144 mg; then 640 mg per hour of continuous venous infusion up to 15 minutes before the end of the surgical procedure; then 320 mg per hour of continuous venous infusion up to 5 minutes before the end of the surgical procedure; then the infusion was stopped). Local analgesia injection was also administered in the mouth and in the parietal bone area of the patient, to obtain vasoconstriction (Ecocain, 6 \u00d7 20 mg/ml, 1.8 ml, 1:50:000 adrenaline).

    "cleaned_text": "a 50-year-old male in excellent general health condition needed to undergo fixed implant-supported dental rehabilitation. despite the strong motivation to be rehabilitated and the awareness of the related surgeries, at the first visit the patient was stressed about the dental therapies, exhibiting distress and anguish.\nfrom an oral point of view, the patient was afflicted by severe periodontal disease. he had lost all the teeth of the left side of the maxilla, except the central incisor; bone resorption of the area was massive with the tongue interposing between the arches laterally. the periodontal disease was progressively well controlled by proper therapies and a bone grafting of the left side of the maxilla was planned. according to the literature, autogenous bone is considered the gold standard for bone grafting procedures\n; therefore, calvaria was selected as donor site, to harvest bone blocks to perform vertical and horizontal bone augmentation in the large area for proper dental implants insertion and stabilization. sinus lifting was planned concomitantly with bone augmentation. in this case, the unique appropriate sedation technique was general anaesthesia (propofol; starting dose: 144 mg; then 640 mg per hour of continuous venous infusion up to 15 minutes before the end of the surgical procedure; then 320 mg per hour of continuous venous infusion up to 5 minutes before the end of the surgical procedure; then the infusion was stopped). local analgesia injection was also administered in the mouth and in the parietal bone area of the patient, to obtain vasoconstriction (ecocain, 6 \u00d7 20 mg/ml, 1.8 ml, 1:50:000 adrenaline). after 5 months, five endo-osseous dental implants were placed. during the previous appointments for dental care procedures, the dental team gradually gained patient's confidence, so that the surgical stage of implant placement and the other prosthetic phases were performed with local analgesia (topical analgesia: lidocaine 15% spray; injected local analgesia: mepicain 2%, 1.8 mm, 1:100.000",

    "original_text": "A 76-year-old female with end stage renal disease on peritoneal disease presented with presyncope and was found to have high-grade AV block and intermittent CHB.\nA Micra AV implant was performed. The patient was discharged uneventfully but presented again a few days later with dizziness. Her presenting ECG showed CHB with a junctional escape rhythm (JER) at 42 bpm (Figure ). Chest radiograph showed stable Micra position. Device interrogation showed sinus rhythm at 80 bpm with CHB and JER. The device was initially programmed VDD with AV Conduction Mode Switch enabled (so called \u201cVVI+\u201d). The Micra AV Conduction Mode Switch algorithm is designed to promote intrinsic conduction when possible. If the ventricular rate is greater than 40 bpm, it switches to VVI 40 regardless of the presence of AV block. This issue presented in this case is also commonly seen in patients with 2:1 AV block when the sinus rate is \u226580 bpm. In these situations, it is often best to turn AV Conduction Mode Switch off to avoid the default switch to back-up pacing at VVI 40 in the setting of AV block.\nIn the Micra AV, AV conduction is considered present if the intrinsic ventricular rate exceeds 40 bpm. This algorithm is strictly looking at the intrinsic ventricular rate to assess whether to switch back to VDD. Thus, if you have AV dissociation and a junctional rate of greater than 40 bpm, you will remain in VVI 40 despite AV dissociation.

She developed diarrhoea, abdominal pain and nausea following which her steroids were withheld and a native kidney biopsy was done. On light microscopy, there were 20 glomeruli of which 6 were globally sclerosed, 2 showed segmental sclerosis with corresponding adhesion to Bowman\u02bcs capsule. Twelve glomeruli showed mild focal increase in mesangial matrix. There was mild tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Immunofluorescence microscopy was negative. Electron microscopy showed diffuse effacement of podocyte foot processes. Capillary loop BM was uniform and of normal thickness. There was segmental capillary loop obliteration with accumulation of lipid, hyaline and foam cells associated with capsular adhesion. Overlying epithelial cell hyperplasia was present. There was no capillary loop immune complex-like dense deposits present.\nThe mesangial matrix was minimally expanded without hypercellularity or electron dense deposits. The biopsy was reported as focal and segmental glomerulosclesosis (FSGS). She was again started on steroids at 1 mg/kg/day and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 500 mg twice a day was added. However, there was no response and in December 2014 all immunosuppressive drugs were stopped. Over the next 3 years there was progressive rise in creatinine and when she presented to us in November 2017 the eGFR was 10 mL/min and kidneys were small and echogenic on ultrasound. She was advised to undergo pre-emptive transplant.\nHer brother came forward as potential donor. Initial evaluation revealed that he too had proteinuria. In view of this, genetic analysis for steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome was carried out. This revealed a mutation in exon 2 of the LMX1B",

A left axillary arterial thrombus was identified on Doppler ultrasound. Subsequently, our patient underwent left axillary artery stent placement with complete symptom resolution. To identify the source of the thrombus an echocardiogram was performed, which revealed a large mobile mass adherent to the anterior apical region of her left ventricle. The left ventricle ejection fraction was normal at 60%. The intracardiac mass was thought to be a thrombus and anticoagulation was initiated to prevent further embolic events. Possible cancer-induced thrombosis was suspected and a computed tomography (CT) scan of her chest, abdomen and pelvis was obtained. This showed a 7 \u00d7 8 cm complex mass between the upper pole of her left kidney and her spleen as well as a 3 cm nodule in the right lower lobe of her lung. A total body positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed increased uptake in the abdominal mass as well as the lung nodule, which raised the question of metastatic disease. Initially, renal cell carcinoma was considered the most likely diagnosis and surgery was scheduled to take place following dissolution of the intracardiac thrombus. However, while still hospitalized for anticoagulation therapy, our patient had multiple hypertensive episodes with a blood pressure as high as 223/139 mmHg. This prompted a 24-hour urine collection for catecholamine and metanephrine tests. Her 24-hour urine metanephrine and normetanephrine levels were significantly elevated at 18160 \u03bcg (normal range: 19-140 \u03bcg), and 7742 \u03bcg (normal range: 52-310 \u03bcg) respectively.

A metal plate was visible below the lower right teeth, with generally good dentition. The right calf was tender to palpation. A healing bite wound on her index finger was clean, without swelling or tenderness. Laboratory evaluation revealed iron deficiency anemia, normal renal function, normal hepatic enzymes, and a normal leukocyte count and differential.\nAn ultrasound indicated a right popliteal artery thrombus. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a 2 cm \u00d7 0.7 cm vegetation on the atrial side of the posterior mitral valve leaflet.

When first diagnosed, he experienced bouts of joint pain, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, resulting in the loss of 14 kg in 6 months. Further complications included buttock abscesses and anal fissures, requiring several surgeries. In May of 2016, he began treatment with infliximab (5 mg/kg) and received subsequent infusions at weeks 2 and 6 (Fig. ).\nWithin days of initiating treatment, the patient had significant improvement in his gastrointestinal symptoms. However, within a week of the first infusion, he developed persistent insomnia, periods of increasing irritability, depressed mood, and guilt. During the 2 months following his second infusion, he experienced further worsening of depressed mood, hopelessness, and the onset of passive suicidal thoughts.

    "original_text": "Case 5: Reported here is a 64-year-old male patient, a known case of diabetes since 18 years, who presented with fever and burning micturition. The patient had an elevated creatinine level of 3.5 mg dl\u20131 and presented with back pain and fever raising a suspicion of pyelonephritis. Ultrasound imaging showed bilateral hydroureteronephrosis. Laboratory investigation revealed increased white blood cell count.\nMRI was requested to elucidate the cause of the bilateral hydronephrosis. Evaluation by MRI additionally showed filling defects in the calyces of both kidneys (). Further, the right kidney showed a thin rim of parenchymal diffusion restriction with diffusion restriction of the calyces and the tip of the medullary pyramids in both kidneys (). This suggested a possibility of early right-sided pyelonephritis with a diagnosis of bilateral papillary necrosis. Other features of papillary necrosis such as filling defects, clefts and phantom calyces were seen. Urine culture demonstrated the growth of Escherichia coli ().\nThe patient underwent bilateral ureteric stenting, followed by a course of antibiotics. This resulted in improvement of patient symptoms with return of routine urine examination and urine culture to normal.\nThus diffusion restriction at the calyx and tip of the renal pyramid with filling defects within the pelvicalyceal system was seen in all five cases of papillary necrosis. A cleft in the region of the tip of the renal pyramid was seen in two of the five patients.

At the time of diagnosis, she was pregnant and was experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms of abdominal bloating, dyspepsia, heartburn, and nausea. These symptoms persisted postpartum, and the patient underwent an upper endoscopy with biopsy, which was consistent with the presence of amyloid material; however, the type could not be determined. Thereafter, the patient continued to live a fairly normal life and did not seek any further medical attention until her daughter who when turned 16 started experiencing similar symptoms and underwent an upper endoscopy with biopsy results consistent with the presence of amyloid. At that time, the family sought medical attention at our institute. The proband reported that, in spite of an overall normal life, she had continued to experience dyspeptic symptoms that worsened with stress. She also reported around 12\u201315 episodes of hematemesis since her initial diagnosis. Additional symptoms on close questioning included easy bruisability, periorbital purpura, and ecchymosis associated with activities such as retching and vomiting. An upper endoscopy was performed at the Mayo Clinic. No morphological abnormality was seen on the endoscopy; however, Congo red stain demonstrated the presence of amyloid material in the gastroesophageal junction, stomach, and duodenum. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis were normal. Proteomic assessment with laser capture mass spectrometry (LCMS) evaluation of the congophilic material detected an amino acid sequence abnormality in the lysozyme protein (I56T). Peripheral blood genotyping confirmed I56T mutation (DNA change c.221T > C) in exon 2 of the lysozyme gene, which replacing isoleucine with threonine at position 56.

    "original_text": "A 78-year-old woman was referred for anemia investigation. She had a medical history of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and required LP shunt insertion. The patient underwent LP shunt insertion in 2016; however, the type of LP shunt tube used was unknown. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor in the ascending colon. Colonoscopy revealed cancer of the ascending colon with constriction. Regional lymph node metastasis was suspected, but there were no findings of distant metastasis. CT revealed that the LP shunt was routed from the subarachnoid space at the level of fourth and fifth lumber spine through the subcutaneous tissue of the left back and left flank and into the abdominal cavity (). Although there was a certain risk of causing LP shunt-related complications during the perioperative period, her colorectal cancer was progressing, due to which we recommended a surgery.\nDuring the perioperative period, no procedures, such as externalizing and clamping the shunt tube, were performed. Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the supine position. The first trocar was inserted through the umbilicus. After peritoneal insufflation using carbon dioxide, trocars were inserted, avoiding the left abdomen (). Pneumoperitoneum was maintained at a pressure of 10 mmHg. The position of the shunt tube was confirmed in the abdominal cavity, and surgery was performed without any interference (). Laparoscopically, lymph node dissection and mobilization were performed. Furthermore, minilaparotomy was performed to connect the incision of the upper abdomen to the umbilicus, and right hemicolectomy was performed with extracorporeal, ileocolonic anastomosis using a linear stapler. After the anastomosis, the abdominal cavity was cleaned with 2 L saline, and the wound was closed.

On physical examination the interphalangeal joint and pulp of the thumb were exposed with complete loss of the distal phalanx. Through the wound, we were able to see the volar surface of the nailbed was intact. The wound was primarily at the volar aspect of the distal phalanx with ragged edges and questionable blood supply of the skin flaps.\nInitial debridement of the thumb was performed, and a cement spacer replicating the distal phalanx was placed to build an induction membrane, applying the principals of the Masquelet technique for the management of long segmental defects. The spacer also supported the nailbed which avoids a progressive hook nail deformity. Stabilization of the bone cement spacer was done. The severely mangled skin was monitored with evidence of partial epidermal skin necrosis, but at 10 weeks, the pulp of the thumb was completely healed with no soft tissue defects.\nReconstruction of the distal phalanx was accomplished with a rectangular 3 \u00d7 1 cm MFCF.\nExposure of the thumb was performed through a Brunner incision and fixation was performed using a 90/90 technique with #0 malleable wires to fuse this to the interphalangeal joint of the thumb. Examination of the digital arteries of the thumb revealed both arteries were severed at the interphalangeal joint level. The digital arteries were identified at the level of the palm and after tourniquet was deflated the blood flow of both digital arteries was poor. The pedicle of the graft was anastomosed to the radial artery at the snuffbox with a vein graft harvested from the volar forearm.

However, due to the economic crisis, he started facing financial difficulties and had problems in carrying out his business, paying salaries to his long-lasting employees, and supporting his family. After trying many options to get support from banks, he realized that his company was in danger. Because of this situation, he started experiencing sadness, insomnia, loss of appetite, hopelessness, and irritability. He described how he saw no way out, and he described himself as in a tunnel with no real solution to his economic problems. Things got worse as the crisis eroded the money he had saved for emergencies.\nHe also experienced unimaginable physical suffering with unpleasant sensations at the hypochondrium (the upper part of the abdomen) related to anxiety, and he sometimes had dyspnea. Despite these symptoms, he tried his very best to continue and attend to his work activities. After almost 3 months of feeling depressed, he started thinking about suicide. He reported that suicidal ideation gradually became the companion that could provide help and relief from the pain he was experiencing. Having realized that he could rely on suicide as a way out from his problems, he experienced both the pressure of the precarious economic state and a state of relief when lousy news regarding his debts continued to arrive.

    "original_text": "A 47-year-old male was admitted to the Respiratory Medicine department of Xiangya Hospital on March 29th, 2010 complaining of repeated cough and expectoration for 5 years, aggravated with intermittent fever for 4 months. From 2005, the patient had begun to have cough and expectoration after a common cold, and this symptom became more serious in December 2009 when intermittent fever occurred. His body temperature became more than 39\u00b0C and he got dyspnea when the temperature was abnormal. The outpatient chest X-ray showed infection of the lower left lung and a small quantity of pleural effusion. Relief of symptoms of fever and cough was obtained after treatment with cephalosporin, but the symptoms would recur 1 or 2 weeks later. In order to get better treatment he came to our department. He had no hypertension or diabetes, and had a long history of smoking. Physical examination on admission showed no abnormal findings on the skin, and the lymph nodes were impalpable. The left lung was dull at percussion. Breath sound of the left lung was coarse and moist rales could be heard. Examination of the heart and abdomen were normal. The laboratory test, complete blood count (CBC), white blood cells (WBC) 29.8 x 109/L, neutrophils 87%, sputum culture, HIV-antibody and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were all normal. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a nodule in the left bronchus, obstructive pneumonia in the lower left lung and lymphadenectasis in the mediastinum (Figure A). The primary diagnosis was tumor in the left bronchus with obstructive pneumonia in the left lower lung. He was given antibiotics treatment. Bronchoscopy showed a spherical tumor with amicula in the bronchus cavity, which was located in the lateral wall 5 mm far from the eminence. The tumor was smooth and rich in blood vessels. The cavity was almost obstructed. Excision biopsy and histology of the nodule showed encapsulated tumor tissue composed of inter",

Computed tomography revealed a tumor (5.1 \u00d7 5.0 cm) within the right parotid gland that was enhanced by contrast (). The tumor had an irregular shape with calcifications, a low-density area and the boundary between the tumor and surrounding tissues was indistinct.
