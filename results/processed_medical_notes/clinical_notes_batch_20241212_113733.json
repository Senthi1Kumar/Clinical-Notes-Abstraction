She was asymptomatic at rest and denied chest pain, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, leg swelling, presyncope, or syncope. She was incidentally found to have a systolic murmur during her pregnancy 20 years prior to this presentation. Notably, she had been offered aortic valve replacement in the past but declined.\nVital signs were normal with blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg, pulse rate of 79/min, temperature of 97.2\u00b0F, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min with normal oxygen saturation of 100% on ambient air. Physical examination was significant for irregularly irregular heart rhythm, and ejection systolic murmur was loudest in the aortic area with radiation to the carotids. Her lungs were clear to auscultation, and no pedal edema was noted. Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. Her most recent transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a thickened calcified aortic valve with decreased excursion with 4.6 m/s velocity suggesting a peak of 86 mmHg and mean of 36 mmHg suggestive of severe aortic stenosis. No other significant valvular abnormalities noted. Cardiac catheterization revealed widely patent coronary arteries.\nBased on the presence of worsening symptoms and the risk of sudden cardiac death, the decision was made to proceed with surgical aortic valve replacement. Given her history of chronic atrial fibrillation, she was also planned for left atrial appendage exclusion and Cox Maze IV procedure simultaneously with the aortic valve replacement. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram revealed quadricuspid aortic valves confirmed during surgical exploration (). The native stenotic quadricuspid aortic valve leaflets were excised, and a 21 mm Saint Jude Medical Trifecta valve was implanted.

He had also been found to have a vascular abnormality (DAA) as an adult and was observed in an asymptomatic state.\nPhysical examinations showed no unusual findings, and the laboratory examination data, including tumor markers, such as squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen and carcinoembryonic antigen, were all within normal ranges. Chest X-ray demonstrated a widening in the upper mediastinal silhouette, reflecting the superior right aortic arch. An endoscopic examination revealed superficial esophageal cancer located in the left side of the wall in the upper thoracic esophagus and the invasion of the submucosa (Fig. ). A histological examination of biopsy specimens confirmed the presence of squamous cell carcinoma. Enhanced computed tomography showed a swollen lymph node in the right upper mediastinum, which was diagnosed as metastatic (Fig. ). No distant metastasis was detected. Computed tomography also confirmed the DAA. The right aortic arch was dominant, and the descending aorta was located at the right side of the post-mediastinum, as is common in cases of DAA (Fig. ). The patient was therefore diagnosed with upper thoracic esophageal cancer of cT1bN1M0 Stage IIB (UICC-TNM 7th) and a DAA.\nHe underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to sub-total esophagectomy with three-field lymphadenectomy.

We first planned to perform cervical procedure in a supine position before the thoracic procedure in order to identify the bilateral inferior laryngeal nerves and avoid causing them injury or inducing palsy.

At age 47, the patient was first diagnosed with right parietal parasagittal meningioma involving the falx cerebri, which was treated with surgery. Twenty years later, due to progression of residual left-sided hemiparesis, the patient was diagnosed with a recurrence for which he underwent a second surgery at age 68. This second surgical resection was incomplete, leaving a thin layer of tumour tissue in the posterior third of the sagittal sinus. Histopathology was compatible with meningothelial meningioma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the posterior brain showed multiple early recurrences (2 parasaggital, 1 parietal, and 1 frontoparietal). Due to progression of these lesions, a third surgery was performed 3 years later, at age 71. This surgery resulted in multiple postoperative complications, the most important of which were a cerebrospinal fluid fistula requiring a ventriculopleural shunt, repeated failed graft reconstructions due to infections, and an intestinal perforation (due to a laparotomy performed to obtain a microvascular omental graft) leading to peritonitis and, subsequently, right hemicolectomy.\nSixteen months after the third surgery, a follow-up MRI showed clear signs of disease progression, with multiple extra-axial lesions involving the falx cerebri.

    "original_text": "In August 2013, our 45-year-old female patient underwent a gross total resection of a 2.5 cm non-functioning pituitary adenoma with degenerative changes and recent hemorrhage, at an outside institute. Pathologic examination revealed small sheets of pleomorphic cells with positive staining for synaptophysin, chromogranin, CAM5.2, and AE1/AE3. She was subsequently followed regularly until March 2014, when repeat imaging showed her tumor had recurred in the sella turcica with asymptomatic invasion into the left cavernous sinus. The patient underwent a debulking resection of the sellar component of the tumor. Upon pathologic review, the recurrence specimen was found to now stain positively for ACTH as well as contain some atypical features including nuclear pleomorphism, large nucleoli, mitotic figures, and Ki-67 staining of 8\u201312%. Although lacking p53 nuclear expression, the tumor's increased mitosis, Ki-67, and invasive phenotype led to the classification of atypical pituitary adenoma []. She remained without Cushinoid symptoms at that time. She tolerated the surgical resection well and subsequently underwent postoperative CyberKnife radiation to a dose of 25 Gy given in 5 fractions to the residual mass completed in June 2014. On radiographic follow-up, a small amount of residual disease was observed in the left cavernous sinus. Over the next year and a half, the adenoma demonstrated slow, but persistent progression, and the patient began complaining of issues in her left eye concerning for CN III, IV, and VI palsies including lid ptosis and difficulty with left eye abduction and adduction.

MRI showed intra-axial expansive and infiltrative lesions that were cortical and subcortical, and which affected the anterior half of the right temporal lobe and extending from the pole to the Sylvian fissure superiorly and to the right parahippocampal gyrus, posteriorly, and medially. Partial surgical resection was performed in August 2010 and the first pathologic diagnosis was astrocytoma grade II. He underwent chemotherapy with TMZ at a dose of 2,000 mg with cycles every 28 days for 5 days in the years 2011\u20132013, with no tumor regrowth until the beginning of 2015. At this time, he underwent MRI, which was used to compare the discrete extension of the signal alteration areas, especially the subinsular regions. In March 2015, he resumed chemotherapy with TMZ at a dose of 100 mg/day and the patient then lost 12 kg of body weight, which was associated with anorexia, insomnia, and depression. In May 2015, he suffered a seizure requiring hospitalization. In June 2015, the patient resumed the old chemotherapy regimen with TMZ (2,000 mg every 28 days for 5 days), and a follow-up with MRI; however, the tumor size continued to increase. In January 2016, the neuro-oncology team decided to discontinue treatment with TMZ considering the risk/benefit and planned a surgical re-approach.

Conventional radiography of the knee demonstrated an osteochondral flake near the medial patellar margin, whereas the femoral fracture remained unnoticed (Figure ). After reposition of the patellar dislocation, the joint was stabilized with an orthosis, and the patient was sent home.\nTwo days later, because of increasing pain and swelling of the left knee, his family doctor arranged further radiographic examinations with MRI and CT scans, revealing the Hoffa fracture.

Surgical treatment consisted of diagnostic arthroscopy, open reduction of the fracture, and internal fixation with three 40-mm headless compression screws (Figure ). The screws were placed in posterior to anterior and caudal to cranial directions. The anterior horn of the lateral meniscus was fixed to the joint capsule using FiberWire 2-0, and the ruptured retinaculum was fixed to the medial patellar margin with two Mitek anchors. A 3 \u00d7 3 cm tumor close to the articular capsule turned out to be a lipoma and not, as initially suspected, a neurofibroma.\nAfter surgery, the knee was stabilized with a knee orthosis, and partial weight-bearing was prescribed for 10 weeks. Fracture healing was regular. In <4 months after the accident, the patient returned to work without any orthopaedic therapeutic appliances. In this case, the occurrence of a femoral fracture after a low-velocity trauma was probably influenced by reduced bone quality because of an underlying NF1, but NF1 did not influence fracture healing.

The consultation team included vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists, hematologists, oncologists, plastic surgeons, and pathologists.\nThe patient had an unremarkable medical history.\nAt clinical examination, the girl showed functional impairment of the right knee (limited flexion of 30%), muscle contracture, and localized pain (). In the days before her hospitalization, the reported daily mean visual analog scale (VAS) score for chronic pain was 7 \u00b1 1. Neurologic examination revealed normal patellar tendon reflex, full strength of the surrounding musculature, and normal superficial and deep sensitivities. Dermatological examination revealed normal skin characteristics.\nIt was reported that no therapeutic procedure had been carried out previously, and the pain symptoms had been controlled with pain relievers, when necessary.\nLaboratory blood tests for coagulation were performed, according to the high rate of variations in coagulation states that are found in patients with vascular anomalies. No abnormalities were observed in our young patient.\nIn addition to clinical signs, diagnosis of FAVA was based on both ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. Both imaging modalities showed a complex mass of 11 cm \u00d7 8 cm \u00d7 8 cm in the right thigh, a finding compatible with FAVA malformation, located in the vastus medialis muscle and marginally in the rectus femoral muscle.

Screening of the spine was done to locate the possible source of the bleeding leading to superficial siderosis.\nCervical spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an intradural extramedullary mass occupying the anterior intradural space which displayed hypointense signal on T2WI and hyperintense signal on T1WI (Figures , , , and ). Contrast enhancement of the mass was not evidently revealed by visual assessment on postcontrast fat saturated T1 weighted images () due to strong T1 hyperintensity of the mass on unenhanced images.

After the fever abated, she became aware of hearing loss. Because she lived in a mountain village, she rarely visited medical facilities. Since then, she had never worn a hearing aid, had gone to a school for the deaf from elementary school to high school, and communicated with people in sign language. Her husband also used sign language, so she had not used oral communication from elementary school to the present. In 2011, family stress triggered the onset of tinnitus. Because around the same time, she began suffering from sleep onset disorder (it took about one hour until sleep onset), nocturnal awakening, and palpitations, she went to a nearby psychosomatic medicine clinic. She received medication at the clinic but her tinnitus did not improve, so she was referred to our department in 2014.\nVarious questionnaires were given at her consultation. The result of THI (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory) [], which is used to evaluate the severity of tinnitus, was a high of 94, which indicates the most severe form of tinnitus.

He scored four points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. His cardiac examination findings, including echocardiography (EKG) and transthoracic echocardiography, were unremarkable. MRI of the brain was performed and multiple high signal intensity lesions were seen in the left frontal and parietal lobes on T2-weighted MRI and on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with an associated low signal on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (). We subsequently performed contrast-enhanced brain MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). There was no evidence of enhancement of the lesions on post-gadolinium images and there was no evidence of hemorrhage on T2 *-weighted images. The lesions were all felt to be in the left middle cerebral artery territory (although there was some question as to whether the most inferior lesion was in the posterior cerebral artery territory). However, contrast-enhanced brain MRA showed no steno-occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. An initial diagnosis of acute cerebral infarction was made on the basis of these findings and the patient was treated with antiplatelet therapy. Because of the patient\u2019s fever, an infectious work-up was performed and blood cultures were drawn. The complete blood count was unremarkable but chest X-ray suggested bronchitis.

Chest X-ray demonstrated a widening in the upper mediastinal silhouette, reflecting the superior right aortic arch. An endoscopic examination revealed superficial esophageal cancer located in the left side of the wall in the upper thoracic esophagus and the invasion of the submucosa (Fig. ). A histological examination of biopsy specimens confirmed the presence of squamous cell carcinoma. Enhanced computed tomography showed a swollen lymph node in the right upper mediastinum, which was diagnosed as metastatic (Fig. ). No distant metastasis was detected. Computed tomography also confirmed the DAA. The right aortic arch was dominant, and the descending aorta was located at the right side of the post-mediastinum, as is common in cases of DAA (Fig. ).

The blood chemistry included serum creatinine of 10.7 mg/dL and serum potassium of 5.1 mM/L. Renal ultrasound (US) showed moderate hydronephrosis in both kidneys and dilatation of both upper ureters. It was thought that the bilateral obstructive uropathy was due to direct extension or external compression of both ureters by advanced gastric cancer metastases. Therefore, percutaneous nephrostomy catheters were placed bilaterally on an emergency basis and antegrade pyleograms were obtained. The third day after the urinary diversion, the serum creatinine had decreased to 1.3 mg/dL. The antegrade pyleograms revealed moderate dilatation in both renal pelvises and upper ureters, and the mid to lower ureter could not be visualized, even after 1 hr, implying complete ureter obstruction (). Bilateral retrograde ureterograms (RU) were attempted after a normal cystoscopic examination, which revealed a narrowed ureter caliber bilaterally, suggesting long segmental strictures from the upper to middle ureter bilaterally (). Since the percutaneous nephrostomy tubes would reduce the patient's quality of life and cause a number of problems, such as discomfort and tube displacement, we inserted double-J ureteral stents in both ureters and then we clamped both nephrostomy catheters to ensure proper urine drainage through the ureteral stent.

His description alluded to a pain that was sharp and intermittent with localization in the right upper quadrant. He could not attribute the intermittent nature of his predicament to any aggravating or relieving influences.

On initial presentation, the patient reported visual acuity of hand movement in the injured eye.

Under the diagnosis of unstable angina, anticoagulant and dual antiplatelet therapy was initiated with intravenous heparin (25000/IU), aspirin (75 mg/day), and clopidogrel (75 mg/day). Laboratory tests showed a partial thrombin time of 58.3 seconds and a prothrombin time of 11.6 seconds with an international normalized ratio of 13.24. One day after commencing anticoagulant therapy, she developed sudden severe back pain and paraplegia (Grade I/V).\nAlthough she also had hypoesthesia below the T2 dermatome, her consciousness was completely normal. Thoracic T2-weighted MRI showed intradural extramedullary low signal intensity at the T2-3, which was consistent with spinal subarachnoid hematomas. High signal intensity was also observed from C5 toT4 in the spinal cord (). Surgical exploration was then undertaken to decompress the spinal cord. Prior to the operation, heparinization was reversed and antiplatelet administration was discontinued. With total laminectomy at T1-4, we could not find any hematoma in the subdural space. However, thick hematoma compressing the spinal cord was found beneath the arachnoid membrane (). The hematoma extended into the anterior, upper and lower subarachnoid space around the spinal cord.

There was no evidence of extra thoracic metastasis on brain MRI and bone ECT scans. Lung needle aspiration revealed adenocarcinoma and the patient was diagnosed with NSCLC stage IV. She started 4 cycles of systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine in Jul 2007. CT scan showed a stable disease of the carcinoma and marked clinical improvement was noted as dyspnoea disappeared and the patient reported a general feeling of wellness. The patient then received two cycles of docetaxel for maintenance therapy. In the following six months, the patient was well without any evidence of local or systemic recurrence. In June 2008 a routine follow-up bone ECT and brain MRI revealed bone and brain metastatic lesions, and the patient commenced erlotinib (150 mg daily ), which she tolerated well and only experienced grade 1 skin rash without requiring dose adjustment. After 4 weeks of erlotinib, the patient showed complete response in her intracranial disease and a partial response in her lung disease. After 12 months of erlotinib therapy, tumor at the right lower lobe progressed, and two cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel were administered. CT imaging confirmed stable disease in the right lower lobe tumor. However, the patient refused further cytotoxic chemotherapy because of severe treatment-related diarrhea. She was re-challenged with erlotinib (150 mg daily ) in October 2009, and experienced grade 3 skin rash without dose modification.

Computed tomography (CT) disclosed a 7 \u00d7 11 cm retroperitoneal mass compressing the vena cava and additional mediastinal lymphadenopathy of 2.1 cm in size. Further clinical evaluation revealed a right-sided testicular mass and a thrombosis of the vena cava with extension of the intravascular clotting into both iliac veins (). The serum level of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (bHCG) was increased to 36.6 U/L (upper limit of norm, 2.5 U/L); alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were within normal limits. The management consisted of antithrombotic treatment and inguinal orchiectomy. Histologic evaluation revealed pure testicular seminoma (). Subsequently, the patient received chemotherapy with 3 courses of cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Upon restaging, the bHCG serum level had normalized and the mediastinal mass had disappeared, while the retroperitoneal mass had shrunk to 3 \u00d7 3 cm. One year thereafter, the residual mass had completely disappeared. With respect to the thrombotic occlusion of the vena cava, multiple collateral veins had evolved in the retroperitoneum. Later, during follow-up, the patient developed hypogonadism with the need for testosterone replacement therapy. Nine years after initial treatment, the patient presented with abdominal pain. Abdominal CT revealed an oval mass sized 5 \u00d7 6 cm located in the retroperitoneum caudal to the left renal vein and between vena cava and abdominal aorta (). No other neoplastic deposits were observed. The serum levels of bHCG, AFP, and LDH were within normal limits. The findings were considered to represent a late relapse of seminoma mainly because the newly evolved mass was located right at the site of the initial metastasis 9 years priorly. Accordingly, the patient received a chemotherapy regimen consisting of three cycles of cisplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide. Upon restaging with CT, no significant change",

One hour after the execution of her first-time (later revealing as negative) nasopharyngeal swab, while driving home, she likely experienced amnesia: the bystanders reported that the woman pulled over the car, lowered the window and called for rescue, telling she was unable to find the right direction; when she was asked where she was going, she answered she did not remember and began to behave anxiously. The bystanders reported that she could tell her name and other personal information, and that she could herself remember the unlock code of her phone and call her husband. The husband noticed she was disoriented, repeatedly asking the same questions about where she was and what she was doing. This episode lasted for about two hours then reverted; the day after, she was conducted to our attention for evaluation. A memory gap for the episode persisted: she could remember having had the swab tested, then having paid for the test, having left the hospital, and reached the car after the procedure, but she could not remember the following events, including those witnessed by the by-standers and including the call to her husband and its arrival on the place where she had left her car.\nNeurological examination was normal.

The ThinPrep cytology test revealed moderate inflammation. Several transvaginal ultrasonography scans revealed an edematous cervix and multiple cysts with a honeycomb appearance (). The inner cervical wall was not smooth and the tumor marker levels were within the normal range. Following cervical conization for the cervical cysts, the biopsies revealed chronic cervical inflammation with the presence of retention cysts and squamous metaplasia in the fundic portion of the cervix. Subsequently, the patient underwent laparoscopic cystectomy and biopsy, hysteroscopy, fractional curettage and cervical biopsy. The histopathological examination revealed chronic inflammation of the cervical mucosa. However, the vaginal discharge did not subside. The patient then underwent a pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination, which revealed multiple cervical cysts and hydrops in the pelvic cavity. Medically the patient was in good condition and her history only revealed an appendectomy performed in 1983. Following admission to our department, the gynecologic examination showed large amounts of vaginal discharge and cervical hypertrophy, with no other abnormal findings. The patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and the fast-frozen cervical biopsy revealed the presence of adenocarcinoma; thus, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy was also performed.\nGrossly, the cervix was thickened and hard with multiple retention cysts, with no other abnormal macroscopic findings (). The microscopic examination revealed cervical mucilaginous glands that were irregular in size and shape with increased apophysis, part of the glands were surrounded by a loose edematous or desmoplastic stromal response, the glands typically exhibited deep invasion of the cervical wall and were adjacent to the cervical adventitia. The glandular epithelial cells exhibited foci of heteromorphism. The parametrium and the pelvic lymph nodes showed no evidence of malignancy. The tumor was staged as Ib2 MDA according to the FIGO classification. Subsequently, cervical and pelvic radiotherapy was performed.",

    "original_text": "This case corresponds to a 16-year-old Caucasian male, who was diagnosed with PGC at the age of 5 and was brother of case 2. He was on medical treatment (one drug) for elevated IOP from age 5. At presentation in HCSC, an enlarged corneal diameter was the only sign detected. At the age of 16 a goniotomy in the OS was performed because of poor IOP control despite being on three topical glaucoma medications. Five months later, a trabeculectomy was required in the OS, achieving IOP control since then without medication. The IOP in the OD has been controlled up to the present with three topical glaucoma medications, and no previous surgical procedures were required.\nThe trabeculectomy from the OS of this patient contained two pieces of tissue, one corresponding to a part of the sclera and another containing the rest of the sclera, the SC and the TM. In semithin sections, we observed a SC with an open lumen, a quite compact CTM, and an UTM with well-developed intertrabecular spaces \u201c\u201d. In either pieces of sclera, we found no collector channels. The TEM revealed that most of the SC endothelial cells had disappeared with only debris of necrotic cells being observed \u201c\u201d. The JCT was composed of alternating layers of abundant ground substance, elastic-like fibers, fibrillary collagen and necrotic stellate cells \u201c\u201d. The CTM was difficult to recognize because the tissue was quite disorganized \u201c\u201d. In some areas the trabecular beams were separate and the zones that would correspond with the inter-trabecular spaces were occupied by the remains of necrotic cells and by collagen that had been detached from the trabeculae \u201c\u201d. In other areas the trabecular beams were fused, the boundary between them being recognized by the presence of necrotic cells debris \u201c\u201d. The trabecular beam had basal membranes, many elastic-like fibers, fibrillary collagen and abundant ground substance \ufffd",
