The pain was described as vague and had a progressive onset. The patient has a history of smoking one pack per day for the last 30 years, and he works as a general contractor. At the time of presentation, the patient was able to move his toes and foot without much difficulty. The right foot examination revealed diminished dorsalis pedis pulse, mild sensory loss, and no muscle weakness. The right foot was cold and displayed pallor with no distinct demarcation. The patient had a CTA done, which revealed an acute occlusion involving the proximal anterior tibial artery and the tibioperoneal trunk with reconstitution distally. Given the poor reconstitution, no evidence of atherosclerotic disease in either extremity and no evidence of vasculitis the occlusions were likely acute and embolic in etiology. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), a tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) was infused directly into the affected peripheral vessel, and a heparin drip was started.\nThe patient did not have any history of cardiac arrhythmias or myocardial infarction. An echocardiogram revealed a patent foramen ovale which was only evident by a bubble study. Due to the foramen ovale not being large enough to explain the current arterial occlusion, a transesophageal echocardiogram and a closure device were not recommended. Interventional radiology was consulted, and the patient underwent four attempts of thrombolysis, resulting in improved clot burden by the end of each procedure. However, the patient continued to have repeated episodes of thrombosis. Angioplasty of the anterior tibial and posterior tibial arteries was also performed. Unfortunately, recanalization of these vessels was unsuccessful. Despite four days of TPA thrombolysis therapy and multiple attempts at angioplasty and thrombectomy of all three tibial vessels, they remained occluded. The patient's right lower extremity angiogram demonstrated persistent occlusion",

The patient had undergone total thyroidectomy 20 years earlier, and she has been managed for hypothyroidism since then. Seven years prior to admission, she was diagnosed with and managed for angina pectoris, but was not evaluated properly. A month before presentation, she had experienced worsening chest pain with dyspnea on exertion despite medication. She was diagnosed with severe mitral regurgitation by echocardiography at our cardiovascular clinic. When she was hospitalized, she complained that her chest pain and dyspnea had been aggravated with time. Two weeks of medicinal management did not control the symptoms. After dobutamine stress echocardiography, it was determined that the patient should undergo open heart surgery. Mitral valve replacement was performed under extracorporeal circulation. Immediately after surgery, the patient's general condition and laboratory data were found to be stable except for mild thrombocytopenia. Platelet concentrates were transfused to increase the platelet number and prevent unexpected bleeding. A postoperative echocardiogram showed good mitral valve function without para-valvular regurgitation. Since postoperative day 4, she had a fever over 38\u2103 and the laboratory data showed signs of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Acinetobacter baumannii was cultured in the blood. She was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for sepsis as well as plasma and platelet transfusion for pulmonary hemorrhage, which occurred on postoperative day 6. Since the thrombocytopenia did not respond to transfusion, intravenous immunoglobulin G was infused and methylprednisolone was administrated intravenously at a dose of 15 mg three times a day. In spite of vigorous treatment, the platelet count did not increase, and even worse, it decreased to a lower count. The lowest platelet count occurred at postoperative day 9. To identify the reason for the refractory response to platelet transfusion, a study for antibody to platelet and additional immune workup were performed on postoperative days 9 and 10. The findings included hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia (hemoglobin=7.6 g/dL, platelet=15,000/\u00b5L, schistocytosis(+) in a peripheral blood smear), negative",

He had no history or clinical stigmata of neurofibromatosis.\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine with and without gadolinium demonstrated a homogenously enhancing, well demarcated intradural extramedullary neoplasm (). An initial MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine with and without gadolinium was negative for additional lesions. While a diagnosis of benign nerve sheath tumor was suspected given typical radiological appearance, a metastatic lesion was also considered in the differential because of prior history of cancer. A metastatic work up performed to look for any additional lesions was negative.\nA partial L2 and complete L3 laminectomy was performed and a midline durotomy was made. A greyish mass was found in the intradural space arising from the left L3 nerve root with obvious enlargement and involvement of the nerve root. A frozen specimen was sent early for pathological evaluation that was diagnosed as MPNST. The nerve root of interest was clearly identified both proximally and distally, which on stimulation resulted in robust electrophysiological response suggestive of origin from a motor nerve root. No obvious plane was found between the tumor and the nerve root. Given the risk of motor deficit, the nerve root was preserved with partial resection of the tumor. Final pathology confirmed the diagnosis of MPNST ().\nGiven the initial pathologic diagnosis on frozen section, subsequent management including reoperation with extensive resection was discussed. Given his preoperative status, the patient, and family elected to observe in the short term with consideration of further treatment options following final pathology.

The left little finger landed first, then the left wrist flexed and landed and the dorsal skin of the left forearm was punctured by ulna and radius fractures causing pain, swelling and bleeding of the left upper limb. The skin of the left hand felt normal after the trauma, and finger activity was normal.

The injury occurred only in the left upper limb, and no other organs or tissues were injured.\nThe patient was hospitalized for further surgical treatment. External fixation and Kirschner wire were used to stabilize the left distal ulna, radius and little finger (Figure ). The patient walked every day after the operation. The swelling of the left forearm was reduced 12 d after the first surgery. Open reduction and internal fixation were performed under general anesthesia to stabilize the left distal ulna and radius. Because some of the bone in the distal radius was lost due to compression, we took about 10 g of bone from the left ilium to fill (Figure ). The operation continued for 4 h. Broad-spectrum antibiotic was used to prevent infection, and drugs were used to promote blood flow and microcirculation. After the anesthesia recovery period, the patient told us that he suffered severe pain and could hear the noise from the electric drill during the operation, but he was unable to communicate this during the operation. This led to psychological trauma. The patient became very sensitive to pain and remained in bed until the third postoperative day.",

The pain was mainly located lateral in the iliac area, with minimal pain in the groin, and was radiating to the thigh. The pain was worse at night and waked the patient up from sleep every night. Physical examination of the affected hip revealed normal extension, and limited flexion at 100\u00b0, abduction at 30\u00b0, adduction at 10\u00b0, external rotation at 30\u00b0 and internal rotation at 15\u00b0.

Plain radiographs suggested osteopenia and joint space thinning and loss of sphericity of the femoral head, but failed to show any tumor (Fig. ). The CT scan, MRI and bone scan demonstrated findings suggestive of OO of the left acetabular fossa (Fig. ).\nThe patient has tried several NSAIDs before his presentation to our clinic. Nevertheless, all medication trials (including the use of naproxen) failed to relieve his symptoms. Radiofrequency ablation therapy, consisting of three cycles for two minutes at 90 \u00b0C with an interval of one minute rest time between each cycle, was performed under CT guidance to treat the lesion. Following the procedure, the patient started to complain of severe pain that was limiting his ability to walk and stand normally even with continuation of NSAIDs. The OO appeared to be unchanged on a CT scan of the left hip that was done 4 months following the RFA. With the possible higher rate of complications of open surgery that requires hip dislocation, the patient agreed for an attempt of arthroscopic excision of the tumor. Based on the CT scans, the tumor was located posterior and superior within the acetabular fossa; therefore, hip arthroscopy was performed using the anterior, anterolateral and posterior portals. The region of the tumor was identified with irregularities of the cartilage at the posterior/superior edge of the fovea. Under fluoroscopic and direct guidance, a burr was placed in the identified region of the tumor.",

This was complicated by a P. aeruginosa mediastinal and aortic graft infection (confirmed by blood and deep wound culture) for which the patient returned to the operating room on multiple occasions for debridement and washout of the infected chest wall (A). The chest wall was eventually closed with omental and bilateral pectoralis major flaps. The patient was admitted again in early 2013 for recurrent P. aeruginosa infection (confirmed by blood and deep wound culture) and a new mediastinal fistula which drained purulent material. The patient was deemed too high risk for surgical replacement of his infected aortic graft after extensive discussions with his treating cardiac surgeon and multiple other consulting surgeons from other institutions. Therefore, the patient was conservatively treated with IV ceftazidime and superficial chest wall debridement. The patient was successfully discharged from the hospital, completed his multi-week course of intravenous ceftazidime (2 g IV q8h), and was switched to oral ciprofloxacin (750 mg q12h) as the isolated P. aeruginosa was susceptible to ciprofloxacin at this time. Over the course of the next year into 2014 the patient was admitted three more times for P. aeruginosa bacteremia (confirmed by cultures) which always began with subjective fevers and increased purulent drainage from his mediastinal fistula. CT imaging during the patient\u2019s admission in October of 2013 showed increased perigraft fluid near the aortic root with surrounding phlegmonous changes in continuation with the mediastinal fistula tract (B). This poorly organized phlegmonous collection was thought to be the source of the mediastinal fistula discharge. However, the collection never became organized enough on subsequent CT scans to attempt drainage. During these admissions, his P. aeruginosa sample showed intermediate resistance to ciprofloxacin; therefore, the patient was treated with several week courses of intravenous ceftazidime that successfully suppressed the infection. Between each admission, attempts were made to restart oral ciprofloxacin after discussions with the infectious disease physician",

After a long hospitalization in the intensive care unit, he developed a stage IV sacral pressure ulcer (length 10 cm, width 10 cm, depth 5 cm) which was steadily worsened due to fecal incontinences despite the intensive dressings three times a day. Plastic surgeons, therefore, recommended a colostomy to provide a clean environment for healing the pressure ulcer. He also suffered from intermittent abdominal pain 1 month after the injury. The pain was mainly localized in the periumbilical area and did not appear in a radiating pattern. The initial pain scale was 60 mm on visual analog scale (VAS). Physical examination demonstrated no tenderness or distension to palpation of the abdomen. Peripheral blood tests showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates with 69 mm/hr and C-reactive protein was elevated to 3.77 mg/dL. His past medical history included antibiotics therapy for acute cholecystitis a month ago. Computerized tomography (CT) on abdomen showed mild nonspecific gallbladder wall thickening (). Chronic cholecystitis was diagnosed and the patient was referred to the general surgery department for a colostomy and cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and sigmoid colon loop colostomy were performed on November 2011, but the abdominal pain around umbilicus persisted and became even more severe. The pain intensity scored 80 mm on VAS. The pain was not associated with food intakes or defecations. No other possible causes of visceral pain such as constipation, paralytic ileus or abdominal distension were identified. Laboratory findings on the peripheral blood tests were nonspecific and follow-up CT images of abdomen showed no abnormalities.

The patient had been diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma involving the left lateral border of the tongue 2 years back.\nThe patient had type II diabetes since last 20 years and was under medication. General examination indicated there was collapse of lip and cheek on the left side of the face, due to lack of support of the musculature.\nIntraorally, completely edentulous well-formed maxillary and severely resorbed mandibular residual alveolar ridges were intact [].

He was initially treated for his traumatic injuries at the regional trauma center and was noted to have rhabdomyolysis associated with traumatic muscle injury. The patient was fluid resuscitated, ruled out for any additional traumatic injuries and subsequently transferred to a burn center for care of his thermal injuries.\nWorthy of note is that on examination the patient was unable to extend his left hand and fingers. In addition, he was found to have necrosis and cellulitis involving the burned areas of his left upper extremity, which appeared to be rapidly progressing. He was therefore taken to the operating room for debridement of the wound (). At that time, both upper extremity wounds as well as the wound to his right lower extremity were excised of devitalized tissue. The necrotic area was excised down to the fascia, and necrotic muscle tissue was removed wherever possible.\nPostoperatively the patient's myoglobin and creatinine kinase normalized with intravenous hydration. He was started on empiric antibiotic therapy, and his intraoperative wound cultures eventually grew several pansensitive organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus vulgaris, all of which were amenable to treatment with oral gatifloxacin, for which he was eventually switched too.\nThe patient returned to the operating room three days after admission for possible further debridement of the wounds as well as exploration of his left radial nerve, at which time additional necrotic areas were noted in the left forearm wound extending proximally.

A Doppler ultrasound at 35 weeks showed complete covering of the cervical os which was attached to the scar with incessant hemorrhagic lesions in the inner anterior myometrium, indicative signs of PA (Figure ). She had diagnosed placentation in the lower uterine segment and had given a history of irregular, painless bleeding of the vagina during the fifth and seventh months of gestation.

On the day of surgery, an expert urologic surgeon had been involved along with the interventional cardiology team. During the cesarean, the uterus was opened along the midline in upper segment of uterus, and a baby of the 3 kg was delivered with a good Apgar score.

This mass had been slowly increasing in size for 2 years. Two years ago, the patient had undergone an operation to remove an abdominal soft tissue fibrosarcoma. The local general surgeon had used a mesh to repair the peritoneal defect and to close the abdominal wall directly. Unfortunately, the incision did not heal due to infection, and the mesh was soon taken out by operation. The incision resulted in a draining wound, and bacterial cultures eventually showed that the wound had a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. The patient repeatedly came to the clinic to have his bandage replaced, but the masses in his abdomen gradually increased in size. The patient was referred to the Hand Department, and while laboratory tests were normal, further examination by computed tomography imaging revealed that the tumor had recurred, and that the patient also had a hernia in the upper abdomen along with the infected wound. Considering the patient's condition, the main purpose of the operation was to resect the tumor and treat the hernia. The surgical procedure was designed to resect the recurrent tumor using a left upper abdomen approach under general anesthesia, but a very large (15 \u00d7 8 cm) abdominal wall defect was found on peritoneum, which could not be directly sutured (Fig. ).

On further examination, the femoral head was palpable in the ipsilateral inguinal region. There was no external bleeding wound and no associated distal neurovascular deficit.\nThe routine imaging investigations and examination ruled out any head, cervical, thoracic or abdominal injury.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of right hip was also ordered to look for any associated acetabular fracture, intra-articular fragment, occult femur neck or intertrochanteric fracture; it ruled out any associated injury and confirmed anterior hip dislocation with ipsilateral greater trochanter fracture (Figure ).\nWe performed a closed reduction of the dislocation under sedation within two hours of the accident in the emergency department. The patient was positioned supine and the reduction involved the collective effort of four persons; the pelvis was stabilized by one resident, another person pushed the femoral head into the acetabulum by direct palm pressure while the other two gave continuous axial traction in the extended position followed by flexion and internal rotation.

At 18 weeks of gestation, there were no signs of a low-lying placenta or placenta previa. At 24 weeks of gestation, she complained of vaginal bleeding and came to the clinic for a consultation. On examination, the patient was found to have slight intermittent bleeding. Transvaginal ultrasonography showed signs of vasa previa, and she was referred to our perinatal center. On ultrasonography, the placenta was seen to be on the anterior wall and there were no signs of placental malposition. The presence of vasa previa as well as velamentous umbilical cord insertion was confirmed by transvaginal ultrasonography, which demonstrated the cord vessels running on the anterior lower uterine segment and covering the internal cervical os (Figure ). The vaginal bleeding ceased on examination, and it was found to be unrelated to the vasa previa. There was no fetal distress detected on fetal heart monitoring. She was hospitalized from 32 weeks and 5 days of gestation. At 33 weeks of gestation, the normal placental position as well as the absence of abnormal placental morphology was confirmed by an MRI scan (Figure ). In addition, MRI confirmed the precise course of the cord vessels running on the anterior lower segment of the uterus (Figure ). We performed a cesarean section at 35 weeks and 1 day of gestation. Because the cord vessels were running on the anterior lower uterine segment, the horizontal incision was made on the uterine fundus to avoid the rupture of the cord vessels.

    "original_text": "A 36-year-old female (gravida 2 and para 1) was referred to our hospital from a private clinic for placenta previa at 28 weeks of gestation. The patient had a history of a cesarean delivery, and in her current pregnancy, the placenta covered the entire anterior uterine wall and totally embedded within the lower uterine segment. We performed ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, and diagnosed her with placenta previa and placenta accreta without bladder invasion (). The patient was considered at risk for severe obstetrical complications due to placenta accreta; therefore, a cesarean section was planned at 36 weeks of gestation to avoid emergency surgery. At 35 weeks, she experienced a sudden onset of vaginal bleeding from the placenta and was admitted to our hospital. Total blood loss was estimated to be over 500 mL, and we performed an emergency cesarean section under general anesthesia.

She had no history of head and neck radiation treatment or a personal or family history of salivary neoplasms, but she was in the second trimester of her first pregnancy. Initially, the patient did not seek medical attention, but because of the progressive increase of the size of her parotid mass lesion, she obtained a referral to a head and neck surgeon. Her medical assessment, which included cytologic studies, indicated that the mass lesion was due to an acinic cell carcinoma.\nThe patient was managed surgically in the form of a right superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the ipsilateral facial nerve.\nThe patient remained well and had no recurrence of her malignant disease until four years later, when she became pregnant again. During the third trimester of her pregnancy, she developed a new mass lesion at the same site as her previous parotidectomy, which proved to be a recurrent acinic cell carcinoma. She also had a right submandibular malignant lymphadenopathy. The size of the recurrent acinic cell carcinoma and the ipsilateral malignant cervical lymphadenopathy progressively increased until the end of her pregnancy. The function of both facial nerves was intact. All investigations were essentially unremarkable, and no evidence of distant metastases or contraindications for surgical treatment were present. Her CT scan confirmed the presence of the recurrent mass lesion of the right parotid gland (Figure ).\nThe multidisciplinary management of this patient consisted of a right total parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve (Figure ) and an ipsilateral radical neck dissection followed by postoperative external-beam radiotherapy.

On his admission, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan was taken, which revealed an 8.9 cm\u00d77.1 cm\u00d78.0 cm heterogeneous mass in the anterior mediastinum.

She denied a history of fever on admission, but was treated with cyclophosphamide 1 month prior for an episode of cerebral lupus. She had noticed a papule over the left deltoid region which progressed to an ulcer over 1 week. Fever was noted following several days of hospital admission and the ulcer site became painful. She had worked in paddy fields several months prior to the admission when she was in good health. However, she could not recall any precipitating injury at the affected site during working. She is a mother of two and both pregnancies were uncomplicated. She denied history of alcohol abuse or smoking.\nOn examination she was emaciated and had a GCS score of 15/15 following recovery of status epilepticus. There was no obvious lymphadenopathy. At presentation, the size of the ulcer was about a 3 cm lesion and it gradually developed in to an ulcer with a necrotic center with surrounding erythema. A tentative diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum was made with the appearance of the ulcer (Figure ). It gradually advanced into the underlying muscle over 3 weeks of onset despite the antibiotic treatment. Examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory systems, and the abdomen was normal.\nHer full blood count, blood picture, and other supportive investigations showed evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia, which was suggestive of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura which resolved following plasmapheresis. Her ESR was persistently normal. Renal functions were stable during hospital stay, so were the liver profile. Chest radiography revealed evidence of bilateral mild pleural effusions and echocardiography revealed a thin rim of pericardial effusion and good cardiac function. MRI, MRA brain showed evidence of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome.

    "original_text": "A 31-year-old Caucasian woman was booked into our hospital for her first pregnancy. An ultrasound scan at 19 weeks confirmed a normal fetal anatomy and a large simple septate cyst arising from the pelvis measuring 11 cm. Neither of the ovaries was seen, so it was difficult to determine the origin of the cyst. The cyst was not complex and was reported to be a simple cyst with a single thin septum. Although both ovaries were not visualized, which is not unusual at 19 weeks, because of the relationship of the cyst with the uterus and the cyst being in the pouch of Douglas, it was suggested to be of probable ovarian origin. The overall morphological features of the mass did not indicate malignancy. In view of the large size and septation of the cyst, the surgical option to remove the cyst by the laparoscopic technique was discussed with the patient, which she agreed to.\nShe was admitted at 20 weeks' gestation. She was asymptomatic and the height of the fundus at 20 weeks corresponded to 26 weeks' gestation. After induction of general endotracheal anaesthesia, a nasogastric tube was passed to remove any gaseous distension of the stomach. The uterine fundus was palpated and a Verres needle was inserted through the Palmer's point. After insufflation with CO2 to a pressure of 20 mmHg, a 5 mm cannula was placed through the same site. A 10 mm infra-umbilical port was inserted. Two secondary ports, 5 mm each, were inserted under direct vision, the right and left lateral ports at the level of the umbilicus.

    "cleaned_text": "a 31-year-old caucasian woman was booked into our hospital for her first pregnancy. an ultrasound scan at 19 weeks confirmed a normal fetal anatomy and a large simple septate cyst arising from the pelvis measuring 11 cm. neither of the ovaries was seen, so it was difficult to determine the origin of the cyst. the cyst was not complex and was reported to be a simple cyst with a single thin septum. although both ovaries were not visualized, which is not unusual at 19 weeks, because of the relationship of the cyst with the uterus and the cyst being in the pouch of douglas, it was suggested to be of probable ovarian origin. the overall morphological features of the mass did not indicate malignancy. in view of the large size and septation of the cyst, the surgical option to remove the cyst by the laparoscopic technique was discussed with the patient, which she agreed to.\nshe was admitted at 20 weeks' gestation. she was asymptomatic and the height of the fundus at 20 weeks corresponded to 26 weeks' gestation. after induction of general endotracheal anaesthesia, a nasogastric tube was passed to remove any gaseous distension of the stomach. the uterine fundus was palpated and a verres needle was inserted through the palmer's point. after insufflation with co2 to a pressure of 20 mmhg, a 5 mm cannula was placed through the same site. a 10 mm infra-umbilical port was inserted. two secondary ports, 5 mm each, were inserted under direct vision, the right and left lateral ports at the level of the umbilicus. normally, right and left ports are inserted but it was impossible to reach the left side from the right port, therefore a further left port was inserted between the left lateral port and the palmer's point port. the two left port placements facilitated exposure of the ovarian cyst, adhesiolysis of the bowel from the left adnexa, avoided potential injury to the gravid uterus and minimized uterine manipulation.\nat laparoscopy,",

Therefore, it was not only the disease entity that we needed to consider but also the financial and psychosocial impact on the patient. She had no associated hair loss over any other body site. There was no history suggestive of any associated complaints. Her nails were normal on examination. There was no history of similar complains in the family. After taking a prior informed consent, phenolisation was done over the bald patches with 88% phenol until a uniform ivory white frost appeared. Phenol was applied all over the bald patches, covering more than 50% of scalp surface; 1 ml of phenol was taken in a container and applied to the scalp by dipping a bud in phenol. We assume that out of 1 ml, some amount of phenol was left in the bud. Thus, the total application of phenol was below the safe limit. No neutralization was done. The patient did complain of burning sensation and was given 5 mg diazepam orally. She underwent 5 such sittings at an interval of 15 days each. She was also given dexamethasone pulse therapy for 4 months. Dexamethasone was given in the dose of 60 mg intravenously in 5% dextrose. She was given dexamethasone and phenolisation at an interval of 15 days.

After five sessions done with 88% phenolisation and 4 pulses of dexamethasone intravenous therapy, she showed marked improvement with well-marked hair growth over the patches.

A contrast-enhanced chest CT showed dilatation of the main PA, filled with a hypodense area with calcification adjacent to the right and left PA. The lumens of the main PA and the hilar areas of the right and left PA appeared almost obliterated by the mass; however, the mass was not attached to the pulmonary valve and did not extend into the peripheral parts of the right and left PA (Fig. ). The differential diagnosis included primary PA tumor and pulmonary thromboembolism, but we suspected it to be a PA tumor based on the radiological findings: a relatively poor contrast effect on the lesion with calcification. Lung perfusion scintigraphy revealed decreased blood flow in the whole bilateral lungs, except for the left lung upper lobe. Due to critical symptomatic obliteration of the pulmonary circulation, an emergency surgery was performed on the second day of hospitalization. Preoperative FDP D-dimer was 1.9 \u03bcg/mL, slightly higher than the normal limit (within 1 \u03bcg/mL).\nFollowing a median sternotomy and institution of cardiopulmonary bypass, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was induced for the removal of the tumor.

A sentinel lymph node biopsy was positive for 1 of 1 lymph node with a 0.35 mm deposit of melanoma.

On examination, he was found to have unilateral swelling of his left lower extremity and a palpable intra-muscular mass. Fine-needle aspiration of the left upper extremity nodule was performed and pathology was consistent with melanoma. PET CT imaging performed in October of 2013 demonstrated a subcentimeter FDG avid lesion in the left upper extremity correlating with the subcutaneous nodule, as well as an intramuscular lesion in the left gastrocnemius with marked FDG uptake and a focal area of FDG uptake in the small intestine without a CT correlate.\nThe patient was referred to our melanoma clinic for further care in December of 2013. Repeat imaging with PET CT performed at that time confirmed prior FDG avid lesions involving the upper and lower extremities along with the small bowel lesion (Fig. ). Brain MRI was negative.

She had been suffering from abdominal pain for about 1 year, and the pain has become more intense in the last 6 months. The pain was postprandial and localized to the right upper abdomen. She has become icteric with generalized spread plus itching since past 2 months. The patient had no history of alcohol consumption or smoking. The patient was referred to us with a highly probable diagnosis of pancreatic head and neck carcinoma to be consulted for surgery. Also, a plastic stent was implanted for her in the previous health center due to intra- and extrahepatic duct dilation for the relief of patient symptoms and signs. After admission to our hospital, she was evaluated by abdominal computed tomography (CT), endosonographic imaging, and diagnostic ampullary biopsy. The abdominal CT scan with contrast exhibited an 18 mm \u00d7 20 mm hypodense mass at the head and neck of the pancreas (). Also, endosonographic imaging was performed to rule out periampullary lesions (). A 20 mm \u00d7 19 mm lesion was seen in the pancreatic head and neck region, and the main pancreatic duct was slightly dilated in the body of the pancreas. Moreover, the common bile duct (CBD) was distally thickened and contained sludge. Subsequently, diagnostic biopsy for pathological assessment was done. The biopsy revealed an irregular gray-creamy soft tissue which had undifferentiated malignant tumor features at microscopic evaluations. During the Whipple procedure, after cutting the neck of the pancreas in the left side of the portal vein, the frozen section revealed more involvement of pancreatic tissue. Although additional 2 cm was resected, the pancreas residue still had tumor involvement, macroscopically.

The patient had the swelling for more than four years that had gradually increased in size. She did not have it evaluated as it very occasionally caused symptoms like on and off tearing, itching, and irritation. She decided to seek medical care when she noticed some tenderness over the lesion. On initial evaluation, she was noted to have a 0.6 mm, elevated, cystic-appearing subcutaneous nodule in the central medial left upper lid margin and lash row. It was noninflamed and tender to palpation. The lesion was in close proximity to the cornea. All other eyelid and orbital functions were normal.\nThe lesion was initially thought to be a benign cyst. As it was symptomatic, it was excised and reconstruction was done. Histopathological analysis revealed positivity for carcinoma cells and suggested that it was a mucinous colloid carcinoma. As the margins were positive, a repeat excision with wider margins and reconstruction via advancement of her lateral full thickness upper lip into the central upper lid was done following a superior cantholysis of the lateral canthal tendon. The surgeons felt that there was no evidence of regional extension beyond what was excised. This was further confirmed by CT imaging of the orbits that revealed no locoregional extension or residual tumor (Figure ). Histopathological exam showed that the tumor was present within the dermis abutting the orbicularis muscle and was composed of lobules of epithelial cells floating in pools of mucin.

Subsequently these wires would be removed every week or two at a clinic in a nearby town, but they would soon recur. The copper wires extracted from the patient surgically would be entrusted to the family members, who would dispose them off near home. The patient and the family members sought treatment at many places in nearby towns but there would be recurrence in a few days. The family members had also taken her to many faith healers for cessation of extrusion of these wires, who told them that she was afflicted by a powerful jinn causing the presence of the wires. Faith healers had suggested rituals which the patient did not follow meticulously. She had also received brief media attention for her symptoms, which she liked and the family members would often talk about it with pride during the interview. The patient presented to our center after she was refused surgery for extraction of wires by local surgeons, who referred her to a tertiary care center.

The patient was admitted for the elective cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation. She was referred from the rural primary care hospital where routine ultrasonography revealed low-lying placentation. A Doppler ultrasound at 35 weeks showed complete covering of the cervical os which was attached to the scar with incessant hemorrhagic lesions in the inner anterior myometrium, indicative signs of PA (Figure ). She had diagnosed placentation in the lower uterine segment and had given a history of irregular, painless bleeding of the vagina during the fifth and seventh months of gestation. Further, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, images still revealed that the placenta was completely covering the cervical os and suspected implantation of placental villi penetrating the full thickness of the myometrium, which further extending posteriorly up to the bladder wall and anteriorly displayed vascular engorgement (Figure ). On the day of surgery, an expert urologic surgeon had been involved along with the interventional cardiology team. During the cesarean, the uterus was opened along the midline in upper segment of uterus, and a baby of the 3 kg was delivered with a good Apgar score. Due to invasive placentation and bleeding, cesarean hysterectomy was proceeded immediately after the birth of the baby. The lower uterine segment was noted to be relatively thin but was covered by a plexus of deep vessels which spread over the bladder near the broad ligament which was covered by peritoneum. The bladder was opened and repaired due to continuous bleeding as the placenta extended to the bladder. Left-sided salpingo-oophorectomy was also performed due to constant bleeding from the left tubo-ovarian ligament. The estimated blood loss was approximately 3500 mL during the procedure. Afterward, three units of whole blood were transfused, and two hemaccel infusions were given. The patient was kept on inotropic support in postoperative ICU for 24",

In 2016, she underwent partial removal of the filler after a pus discharge from the right gluteal induration burst. The fluid culture was positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa which was treated with intravenous (IV) piperacillin/tazobactam for ten days. Also, she had a history of DVT 3 times in the right proximal leg. The first was 5 years back when she was pregnant at the second trimester, and the second was 2 days after delivery. The third thrombotic event occurred after a few months of filler removal. She presented to the emergency department with marked right leg swelling and pain associated with skin thickness and erythema extended to the lower part of the abdomen. Ultrasound Doppler of the right leg confirmed right iliofemoral DVT. Abdominal CT showed retroperitoneal soft tissue density with multiple calcifications that compress the aorta and inferior vena cava. They also compress the right ureter contributing to hydronephrosis and right proximal hydroureter (). No fluid collection had been noticed.

The pain in his leg had been present for many months and was progressively becoming more swollen to the point that he had difficulty ambulating. This was on the background of a past history of bilateral popliteal artery aneurysms that were ligated and bypassed surgically. Examination of his knee revealed a large knee joint effusion with considerable restriction in motion due to pain.\nRadiographs of the right knee demonstrated multiple permeative lytic lesions surrounding the distal femoral condyle and metaphyseal region, resembling a \"soap-bubble\" appearance. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee revealed numerous rounded areas that were hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging in the subcortical bone of the distal femur (Figure ). Some of the lesions exhibited a sclerotic margin and two lesions appeared to breach the cortex and extend into the soft tissues adjacent to the bone. Diffuse abnormal bone marrow signal was seen in the distal femoral diaphysis and metaphysis but not the proximal part of the femur. A large aneurysm arising from the femoral artery was evident, that extended to the popliteal artery, with MR evidence of thrombosis. Around the knee joint there was diffuse oedema and synovitis. A triple-phase bone scan of the knee was performed that showed abnormal tracer uptake in the distal right femur which was greatest in the lateral femoral condyle. The bone scan appearance was not typical for metastatic disease and there was no evidence of osteoblastic metastatic disease elsewhere. Thallium scan showed an active metabolic process occurring within the lateral femoral condyle with permeative bone lesions.\nComputer tomography (CT) guided closed biopsy of the lesion was performed.

The patient's medical history was significant for smoking, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. He also reported sustaining a deep laceration of the ulnar aspect of the left wrist with a piece of glass at age 10 years. Arteriography of his upper left extremity demonstrated occlusion of the ulnar and radial arteries at the level of the wrist, with poor distal perfusion to the middle, ring, and small fingers (Fig ). Distal collateralization beyond the level of occlusion at the wrist suggested chronic ulnar artery occlusion. There was no filling of the superficial palmar arch. The patient had a normal electrocardiogram. Both the aortogram and echocardiogram showed no evidence of an embolic source.

Two weeks after admission, the patient still had back pain and CTA indicated that the pseudocavity was large and the true cavity was small, with poor organ perfusion. Therefore, a thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was performed, and the left subclavian artery opening was not closed. On the third day following surgery, the patient complained of pain in the anterior cardiac region with recurrent dizziness. A re-examination of CTA revealed a retrograde tear of the ascending aorta to form a type A dissection. The brachiocephalic trunk was torn by the dissection while the right CCA was normal. The left CCA was torn to the bifurcation and the true cavity was narrow as a result of a massive thrombosis in the distal pseudocavity (). An ascending aorta and total arch replacement was then performed under extracorporeal circulation. Due to the large number of thrombi in the pseudocavity of the left CCA, cerebral perfusion was performed with a unilateral brachiocephalic cannula when circulation was stopped. The aortic arch was cut open intraoperatively and a large number of fresh thrombi were found in the left carotid artery pseudolumen, with little blood return. The thrombus was sucked as far as possible into the suction device until there was no visible thrombus and a good blood return.

The irritation originates from a lesion along the midline on the dorsum of his penile glans. He was referred to a urologist for further evaluation.\nThe patient reported noticing a small dimple along the midline on the dorsum of his glans for as long as he could remember. The lesion had not previously caused him any discomfort, nor did he report a history of discharge, including urine, semen, blood or pus from the orifice. In recent months, the patient has become more sexually active and he has become aware that during and after intercourse the site is painful and inflamed for a short period of time. The patient wants to make sure there is not something wrong with his anatomy and seeks a solution.\nThe patient had no significant past medical history. There is no family medical history of relevance, specifically no one has reported any genital malformation. Physical examination by a urologist demonstrated a well-developed adult male. A small midline opening was present on the dorsum of the penile glans. There was no focal erythema or discharge present at the time of examination. Manipulation of the opening demonstrated a thin lumen that appeared to continue proximally along the dorsum of the penile shaft. The most likely aetiology was determined to be urethral duplication. Imaging was necessary for confirmation and to delineate the particular anatomic presentation in order to plan treatment. Demonstration of communication with the urethra or bladder would require more extensive surgical intervention to eliminate the sequelae of discharge accumulation in the lumen causing infection, cyst formation or recanalisation of the accessory orifice.

He also described a shooting, electric sensation that began in his lower back and radiated laterally to his hips and down his legs whenever he flexed his trunk, such as when transferring from a seated to standing position. A skiing accident occurred approximately 2 months prior to presentation during which the patient sustained a fracture dislocation of his right shoulder. Imaging at that time included X-rays of the right shoulder, in addition to imaging of the thoracic and lumbar spine. These images were unremarkable other than degenerative changes consistent with the patient's previous diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis. Several weeks after the accident he began to experience an intermittent, sharp pain in his lower back that radiated anteriorly around his abdomen at the T10 level. He had been to both his primary care and physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians after the accident, and they had followed him up for further medical management and physical therapy.\nApproximately 2 weeks prior to admission, the patient began to experience the intermittent shock-like sensation and worsening bilateral lower extremity weakness. He described his weakness as not only a perceived loss of muscular strength but also an excessive fatigue resulting in the inability to complete physical activities that had previously been routine for him. Two days before presenting to the hospital, the patient was unable to lift himself off an exercise mat after the completion of a physical therapy appointment and required the assistance of his wife and son to help him return to his vehicle.

He had had a right arm melanoma excised 5 months previously but otherwise had no significant medical history. Clinical examination revealed a left pleural effusion confirmed by chest radiograph which subsequently drained blood-stained fluid positive for reactive mesothelial cells and lymphocytes. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Computed tomography (CT) of his thorax and abdomen undertaken just prior to discharge from hospital revealed a left renal mass consistent with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and multiple bilateral subpleural nodules. Renal function was normal at this stage.\nThe patient was electively re-admitted a week later for planned thoracoscopy and pleural biopsy. Biopsy confirmed the subpleural nodules to be metastatic RCC deposits. Following repeat chest drain insertion the patient collapsed some hours later and became acutely dyspnoeic with oxygen saturations of 82% on room air and a systolic blood pressure of 96 mmHg. There was no clinical evidence of lower limb deep vein thrombosis. Arterial gases confirmed type I respiratory failure and an electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with new right bundle branch block. Subsequent CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) demonstrated a large saddle embolus with thrombus extending into the lobar branches of both main pulmonary arteries (Fig. ). Massive PE was diagnosed and in view of its acute setting and the patient being in extremis the origin of the PE was not sought at this stage. Moreover a team of chest physicians; oncologists and urologists concluded that with the combination of neoplastic disease; a recent biopsy and a chest drain in-situ thrombolysis would be deleterious to the patient. Intravenous heparin was commenced whilst a cardiology opinion was sought to explore the possibility of percutaneous intervention.

    "cleaned_text": "a 70 year-old male presented with a 4-month history of dry cough and general malaise. he had had a right arm melanoma excised 5 months previously but otherwise had no significant medical history. clinical examination revealed a left pleural effusion confirmed by chest radiograph which subsequently drained blood-stained fluid positive for reactive mesothelial cells and lymphocytes. cytology was negative for malignant cells. computed tomography (ct) of his thorax and abdomen undertaken just prior to discharge from hospital revealed a left renal mass consistent with renal cell carcinoma (rcc) and multiple bilateral subpleural nodules. renal function was normal at this stage.\nthe patient was electively re-admitted a week later for planned thoracoscopy and pleural biopsy. biopsy confirmed the subpleural nodules to be metastatic rcc deposits. following repeat chest drain insertion the patient collapsed some hours later and became acutely dyspnoeic with oxygen saturations of 82% on room air and a systolic blood pressure of 96 mmhg. there was no clinical evidence of lower limb deep vein thrombosis. arterial gases confirmed type i respiratory failure and an electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with new right bundle branch block. subsequent ct pulmonary angiogram (ctpa) demonstrated a large saddle embolus with thrombus extending into the lobar branches of both main pulmonary arteries (fig. ). massive pe was diagnosed and in view of its acute setting and the patient being in extremis the origin of the pe was not sought at this stage. moreover a team of chest physicians; oncologists and urologists concluded that with the combination of neoplastic disease; a recent biopsy and a chest drain in-situ thrombolysis would be deleterious to the patient. intravenous heparin was commenced whilst a cardiology opinion was sought to explore the possibility of percutaneous intervention. we as a faculty had no previous experience of using percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (pmt) for dealing with massive pe at the time. the lead cardiologist was asked to review the patient with a view to endovascular intervention by a chest physician who wanted to exhaust",
