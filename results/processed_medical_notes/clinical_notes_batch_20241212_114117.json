A CT scan showed multiple lung nodules. In addition, a PET-CT scan showed 4 PET-positive lesions in the right lower lobe, as well as 2 nodules in the right middle lobe and an enlarged PET-positive lymph node in station 7, which were suspicious for metastatic breast cancer lesions. Mammography of the right breast showed no local recurrence of the tumor. EUS-FNA of station 7 was performed using a 19G needle. Directly after the procedure, the patient experienced pain and was admitted for observation. A chest X-ray showed subcutaneous emphysema on the left side of the neck. A non-contrast CT scan showed pneumatosis in the mediastinum, and pleural effusion and atelectasis on both sides (). The laboratory results demonstrated a CRP of 600 mg/L and a WBC count of 22\u00d7109/L. The patient was placed on a fasting regimen and intravenous antibiotics were started. The patient experienced clinical deterioration and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 2 days after the EUS-FNA.

CT scans showed that this patient had developed multiple metastases, including mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, and also to the right intrapulmonary lymph nodes. He received 6 cycles of Pem-Cis chemotherapy, followed by thoracic radiation. Review of the CT scan at completion of sequential chemoradiotherapy treatment resulted in a significant shrinkage in the primary tumor in his left lung, while simultaneously resulting in a slight increase in metastatic lymph nodes (Fig. ). In February 6, 2017, CT scans showed that the tumor progressed rapidly. He was then scheduled to receive gemcitabine plus nedaplatin (Gem-Ndp) chemotherapy. However, the patient had to discontinue the planned 2nd cycle of this regimen as he developed moderate pneumonia. After systemic antibiotic treatment, the patient improved symptomatically and became increasingly energetic. However, CT scans on March 29 revealed that his tumors had progressed further. Owing to his poor physical condition after Gem-Ndp treatment, the chemotherapy regimen was changed to Pem-Cis. However, CT scans on May 11 failed to detect any shrinkage in his tumor. In addition, lymph node metastases increased post-treatment. The patient subsequently started standard of care pembrolizumab treatment at 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.

    "original_text": "A 68-year-old woman consulted because of a left vulvar lesion. As a pathological antecedent of interest, she had presented multifocal motor neuropathy in the left upper limb that was treated with rituximab.\nDuring the gynaecological examination, a 2.5-cm irregular pigmented lesion was observed in the upper third of the left lower lip (Fig. ) with a raised and rough acetowhite lesion inside of it (Fig. ). There were no palpable inguinal nodes.\nA vulvar biopsy was performed using a punch under local anaesthesia. The biopsy demonstrated a superficial spreading malignant melanoma. The Breslow index was 0.72 mm and Clark's level IV. The PET-CT examination did not show any metastatic lesion. Surgery consisted of vulvectomy with selective sentinel node biopsy technique. Surgery was carried out 5 days later under general anaesthesia with previous technetium 99m (Tc99m) injection. The resection limits were defined, as shown in Figure . Intraoperatively, permanent bladder catheterization was performed, and methylene blue was injected at the level of the lesion.

His past medical history included left nephrectomy due to nephrolithiasis at the age of 48, CKD of unknown etiology, and right hemicolectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy due to colonic adenocarcinoma 5 years prior to the current hospitalization. The physical examination at the admission to our hospital revealed no signs of peritonitis. Goldflam sign was absent. The abdominal ultrasound revealed no pathology. A noncontrast abdominal CT scan was performed, and a suspicion of either inflammatory infiltration or surgical scarring in the right middle abdomen was indicated by the radiologists. Laboratory results showed signs of AKI, with plasma creatinine 390.6 \u03bcmol/L on day 1 rising quickly to 647.6 \u03bcmol/L on the second day of hospitalization, metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia (sodium 133.7 mmol/L on day 2), and hyperkalemia (potassium 5.49 mmol/L on day 1 and 5.77 mmol/L on day 2). CRP started to increase on day 2, reaching 52.4 mg/L on the following day. The empirical antibiotic therapy consisting of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole was administered after both blood and urine samples were taken for bacteria culture test.\nShortly after being admitted to our ward, the patient developed anuria, despite intravenous infusions of fluids and loop diuretics initiated at the hospital emergency department and continued at our ward. The kidney function impairment reflected by the raising plasma creatinine levels in subsequent days was worsening rapidly.

    "original_text": "A 29-year-old man was referred from another urologic clinic for severe perineal pain with a weak urine stream and dysuria. When he visited Kyungpook National University Medical Center, he reported a history of acute urinary retention and had a Foley catheter in place for about 1 month. A digital rectal examination (DRE) showed a relatively enlarged prostate with tenderness on pressure. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an 8\u00d77\u00d74.5-cm-sized moderately enlarged prostate. The estimated volume of the prostate by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level were 80 mL and 8.0 ng/mL, respectively. Considering the relatively young age of the patient, acute bacterial prostatitis was suspected, but the patient's clinical symptoms did not exactly line up with acute bacterial prostatitis. To relieve the patient's symptoms and drain the urine, we performed a suprapubic cystostomy and started the patient on intravenous antibiotics, but his symptoms were not relieved. Repeated TRUS and DRE suggested a prostate cold abscess, but prostate malignancy could not be ruled out. Thus, we performed prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nThe prostate MRI showed a huge prostatic mass that obstructed the bladder neck (). According to the results of the MRI, we performed transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) to relieve the bladder outlet obstruction and to confirm the pathologic nature of the mass. The pathology report from TURP indicated high-grade sarcoma with extensive necrosis. We performed chest CT and a whole-body bone scan to evaluate the extensiveness of the disease to determine the feasibility of surgery. No metastatic lesions were found on the chest CT or whole-body bone scan.

The first surgery occurred 26 years previously when he was 12 years old and underwent thoracotomy for two hydatid cysts in the left lung. Subsequently, in April 1999, the patient was diagnosed with a hydatid cyst in his left lung and underwent surgery again. Nine years later, after confirmation of a hydatid cyst in his left lung, he underwent thoracotomy. In May 2011, computerized tomography (CT) revealed multiple cysts located behind the left lung and the fourth rib (R4), leading to the diagnosis of paraspinal hydatidosis and a second thoracotomy. In May 2014, his imaging results demonstrated the presence of four hydatid cysts in the left hemithorax. Total cystectomy was performed for one cyst under the latissimus dorsi, and two cysts behind the third rib (R3) and one cyst behind his left clavicle were drained. In the same year, one hydatid cyst was detected in his liver, and hepatic resection was performed. In March 2018, imaging results demonstrated the presence of multiple cystic lesions under R3, R3 and the fifth rib (R5). Thoracotomy was once again performed, and the cystic lesions and the necks of R3, R4, and R5 were removed. After surgery, albendazole therapy (400 mg/kg) was initiated and continued.\nIn December 2019 the patient was referred to our surgery unit with progressive weakness.

She had no pertinent past medical or surgical history. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a live twin DCDA spontaneous intrauterine gestation and a significantly low amniotic fluid volume involving fetus A but an acceptable amount of amniotic fluid in Fetus B, with heart rates of 163 beats per minute (bpm) and 168 bpm, respectively (Figure ). The patient was advised to be on pelvic rest and told to go to the emergency department (ED) if there was a worsening or recurrence of her vaginal bleeding. The following week, the patient presented to the ED with similar watery, blood-tinged vaginal fluid and abdominal discomfort. Abdominal ultrasound findings were unchanged from the previous study, and her care team diagnosed her with PV-PPROM. The patient was extensively counseled and chose to manage expectantly with weekly outpatient follow-up visits pending signs of infection or maternal compromise.

She had undergone a left TKA 6 years earlier using a PCL-sparing prosthesis (Zimmer Natural-Knee gender specific high flexion knee system, Zimmer Inc., Warsaw, IN, USA). Following this procedure, she had recurrent sharp lateral joint pain during activity, requiring arthroscopic lysis of adhesions after 1 year.

At this setting, she underwent debridement of scar tissue with synovectomy and revision of femoral and tibial components.

Further, EUS showed a thick, low echoic lesion in the second layer of the gastric wall, and the nodular part of the lesion had infiltrated into the submucosa (Fig. ).

    "original_text": "A 20-year-old male was referred to the Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics because of swelling in his left mandibular region. His medical status was noncontributory. According to the patient's clinical records, he reported a history of pain in the lower left side 1 month back. He consulted a general dentist, where caries excavation in the left mandibular first molar (tooth 36) was done followed by temporary restoration.\nOn extraoral examination, there was a bone expansion on the left area of the mandible. On intraoral examination, there was a hard swelling of the buccal vestibule cortex in the concerning region covered with normal mucosa. Tooth 36 had occlusal caries, which was slightly tender to percussion with probing and exhibited normal mobility. The electronic pulp test was negative for tooth 36. A panoramic radiograph showed a well-circumscribed radiolucent lesion located around the apex of the distal root of tooth 36 [] just above the mandibular canal. The lesion was approximately 10 mm in maximum diameter. After evaluating all the data, a root canal treatment of the left first molar was planned.

Previously, she had visited a local dental clinic due to intermittent pain in the past 6 months. The vitality test of upper-right teeth had been performed. Even though the teeth had been vital, she had received endodontic treatment on the upper-right second premolar due to worsening pain. Then, she was referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology at our hospital when she complained of new sharpening pain on the right side of her face after two or three days.\nThere were no clinically abnormal findings in physical and oral examinations. The patient only had a history of orthognathic surgery on both the maxilla and the mandible performed about 21 years prior to this visit. Panoramic and Waters' radiographs revealed increased haziness and dome-shaped homogeneous radiopacities in the lower regions of both maxillary sinuses (). Endodontic retreatment was performed on the upper-right second premolar because it was thought that radiologically, the origins of the pain were not in the maxillary sinuses but in the teeth, resulting in only a temporary reduction of pain that later intensified.\nComputed tomography (CT) was performed for finding other origins of the pain, and low-attenuation lesions were detected in both maxillary sinuses. The lesions measured approximately 36mm\u00d727mm\u00d720 mm in the right maxillary sinus, and 30mm\u00d721mm\u00d725 mm in the left maxillary sinus. The margins were undulated, while corticated discontinuously. The lesions extended slightly below the floor of both nasal sinuses. No internal calcifications were present.

She complained of swelling on the helix of right ear since 1\u00bd years. There was history of first ear piercing of lobe of the ears at the age of 10 years without any swelling following piercing. Additional ear piercing was done at the age of 24 years at the helix of both ears. A small swelling appeared on the superior aspect of helix of ears bilaterally after 3-4 months of piercing, which gradually increased in size and continued to grow until it reached the present size on the right ear in 1\u00bd year duration. Swelling appeared first on the left ear and was larger in size. That was excised surgically after 1\u00bd years. Surgical excision of keloid on the left ear was done 1 week back.\nOn examination, a small, oval, sessile, non-tender, smooth-surfaced swelling was present on the upper part of helix of the right ear, measuring 8 mm superoinferiorly and 6 mm anteroposteriorly. On the left ear, there was a healed scar on the superior aspect of the helix. There was no pain, pruritus, or other adverse accompanying symptoms except that it caused emotional stress due to impaired esthetics. A clinical diagnosis of keloid was given. It was planned to use pressure therapy to reduce the size of the growth on right ear and to prevent recurrence on the left ear.

The growth was asymptomatic except for the uneasiness which the patient mentioned. The patient's medical history was non-contributory and she did not give any history of intake of any medications.\nClinical examination revealed a solitary, exophytic, pedunculated, spherical-shaped, reddish pink swelling with distinct borders and irregular surface []. Adjacent palatal mucosa was normal. Swelling was located in the anterior part of the hard palate just posterior to the central incisors measuring 1.5 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm in size. On palpation, the swelling was non-tender, soft to firm in consistency, and blanched on pressure.\nOcclusal and intra oral periapical radiograph showed no loss of bone in relation to the lesion [Figures and ]. Based on the clinical signs and symptoms, a provisional diagnosis of pyogenic granuloma was established and capillary hemangioma was kept as differential diagnosis. The treatment was planned under local anesthesia with all necessary emergency equipment's at hand under the guidance of a trained anesthetist, keeping in mind the differential diagnosis of capillary hemangioma.\nThe lesion was excised in toto using electrosurgery. Periodontal dressing was placed on the operated area, and the patient was given post-operative instructions. After 1 week, the dressing was removed.

She has been treated with many kinds of anxiolytics for a sufficient amount of time but with little effect. Recently, her symptoms were exacerbated with the occurrence of two daily episodes of attacks; she also began to experience the feeling of impending death, and sometimes even fainted, eyes closed. After the attack, she was able to recall the whole process and complained of fatigue and poor sleep with the fear of recurrence which restricted her social functioning markedly. As a result, she came to our hospital. There were no abnormalities on the physical examination and laboratory tests including the tilt-table testing. Her symptoms were reckoned to be common PD according to the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10. Therefore, she began treatment with paroxetine 20 mg/day until the dose increased to 40 mg/day and clonazepam 3 mg/day. However, her symptoms did not improve except for the sleep quality. During her hospitalization, we happened to find her heart rate was 55 beats per minute during a panic attack. After that, it recovered to 70 beats per minute. Based on the variation of her heart rate, we prescribed atropine to control her bradycardia occurring during these episodes. She was treated with atropine 0.6 mg/day, increased to 1.8 mg/day after 1 week. Because of her signs of worry and hopelessness between the intervals of attacks, we did not cease the treatment with paroxetine. Through the treatment for 5 weeks, the patient had remission of PD and her basic heart rate also increased to 76 beats per minute but no obvious somatic discomfort was observed. As a result, she was discharged from hospital. One month later, she visited our outpatient department for follow-up.",

    "original_text": "A twenty-five year-old-male patient came to the dental clinics for routine dental care. His chief complaint was to remove and/or minimize the noticeable brown/yellow staining of his teeth. He wanted the least invasive and most cost-effective treatment to change his smile. A review of his medical history and past dental history revealed no contraindications to dental treatment. In consideration of his age, the patient was not interested in treatment options that involved significant removal of tooth structure, such as porcelain or composite resin veneers. From the appearance of his teeth, a diagnosis of mild fluorosis staining determined by using Dean's Fluorosis Index () was sent on the anterior teeth in the aesthetic zone, with the most significant staining occurring on the maxillary anterior teeth, with light brown streaks in the middle third of the facial surfaces ().\nA treatment plan was presented to the patient that would fulfill his request for minimally invasive treatment which proposed microabrasion of the superficial enamel.

He did not have saddle anesthesia or urinary or fecal incontinence. He was initially seen in a primary care clinic and was diagnosed with sciatica. As symptoms continued to worsen, he underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the lumbar scan as an outpatient that was concerning osseous spinal metastasis. He was started on prednisone 10 mg daily and was referred to the oncology clinic at our center. Prednisone gave him minimal symptomatic relief. While waiting to be seen in the oncology clinic, the patient had an episode of leg weakness with near-fall prompting him to present to the emergency department of our hospital and was admitted for further evaluation. His vital signs were stable. He had no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymph nodes. Neurological exam was normal with intact strength and sensation in both lower extremities.\nHis complete blood count and serum electrolytes were normal including a normal serum calcium level at 8.1 mg/dL. He tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2 antibodies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine showed several enhancing lesions in T11, T12, L3, L4 vertebral bodies, right sacrum, and ilium that were concerning metastatic disease. There was effacement of the right lateral recess and right neural foramen at the L3-L4 and effacement of the left lateral recess and left neural foramen at the L4-L5 due to tumor retropulsion (Figures \u2013).

Stone-guided bull's eye puncture with fluoroscopy unit in 0 degree and 30 degree was performed with an 18 gauge needle. A single sub-costal puncture was performed via lower pole posterior calyx. After the C arm showed the needle near the desired calyx in 0 degree, it was rotated to 30 degree toward the surgeon and access to the calyx was sought by aligning the needle with it. This step required minor adjustments and resulted in multiple passes (about six) of the puncture needle. The tract was dilated with amplatz sequential dilators to 28 Fr. The stone was removed in toto without use of lithotripsy and a 26 Fr nephrostomy tube (PCN) was applied.

    "original_text": "A 43-year-old male patient with cerebral palsy (athetoid type) was diagnosed with cervical disc herniation in addition to a symptom of 1-year history of pain radiating to the upper limb. The patient underwent a laminectomy (C3-5), an anterior interbody fusion (C3-5), a posterior interbody fusion (C3-5), and an artificial bone graft operation 1 year ago. However, he complained of persistent pain mediated by the branch of the left C5 after the operations. He was then referred to the Pain Clinic of our hospital for inpatient collaborative consultation for treatment. At that time, his visual analogue scale (VAS) score was an 8 out of 10. After due consideration that it was difficult to perform interlaminar epidural block because of the inability to put the patient in the appropriate position and that the stellate ganglion block had no effect, a left C5 selective cervical nerve root block was performed.\nMonitoring devices were set to measure the patient's electrocardiogram (EKG), blood pressure (BP), and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2).

Laboratory findings showed an increased C-reactive protein level (203 mg/l), leukocytosis (13,000/mm3) and microcytic anemia (hemoglobin level: 9.2 g/dl). The tumor markers were normal except the CA-125 which reached 209 mIU/l.

Conventional angiography showed that the aneurysm was 20\u00d711 mm in size with a broad neck and an elongated and lobulated configuration. Because the aneurysm was large in size, involved the M1, and perforated the originating sites, direct clipping or endovascular embolization was not feasible.

An MRI was performed in January 2014 showing a calcaneal spur, signs of inflammation at the calcaneal tubercle, and structural changes of the plantar fascia, surrounded by a large edema (see Fig. ). In February 2014 he underwent an open plantar fasciotomy. Four weeks later he was allowed to perform the first units of regenerative running. Pain returned after approximately 1 week of training. An X-ray revealed no pathology and he was recommended to continue with soft training sessions. He received a peppering injection that reduced pain for 12 hours, and NSAIDs were re-prescribed.

He woke up around 3:00 am with sudden onset severe crushing chest pain that was constant. It was associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. His medical history was significant for gastroesophageal reflux, hypertension, major depression, and chronic left shoulder pain diagnosed as impingement syndrome. Family history was noncontributory. He had an extensive past surgical history, which included a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication at age 25 due to severe gastroesophageal reflux disease and associated esophagitis. Several months after this procedure, he required two open revisions of the Nissen procedure. The first was due to a hiatal hernia, and the second was due to a diaphragmatic rupture requiring diaphragm repair with prosthetic material. The patient developed a subdiaphragmatic abscess at age 30 that required antibiotics and diaphragmatic surgery where the prosthetic material was removed. In addition, at age 35 years, he had a spinal cord stimulator inserted, as treatment for chronic left shoulder and epigastric pain associated with persistent nausea and dry heaves. Three months prior to his current visit he had a diagnostic arthroscopy due to persistent left shoulder pain.\nOn physical exam, he was pale and in distress. Vital sings included an oral temperature of 97.6\u00b0F, blood pressure of 116/66 mmHg, heart rate of 45 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. No rub or murmur was auscultated on initial cardiac examination. Lungs were clear to auscultation. The electrocardiogram (EKG) was significant for ST segment elevations in leads II, III, and aVF ().

It progressed to a generalized swelling of the right shoulder and right side of the neck, restricting his arm movements. He also voiced the concern of worsening shortness of breath which started with the swelling. He did not report any personal or family history of thrombophilia. There was no previous history of any excessive upper extremity exertion or catheterization in the neck. Vital signs on presentation were a blood pressure of 127/61 mmHg, pulse rate of 79/minute, good volume, regular rhythm with no radio-radial or radio-femoral delay, respiratory rate of 19/min with a saturation of 93% on 3-liters nasal cannula, and temperature of 97.5oF. Physical examination revealed right upper extremity swelling without any sensory or motor deficits, right-sided neck swelling, and right-sided facial plethora. Examination of the contralateral arm, as well as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, was normal. Biochemical investigations were within normal limits. The patient underwent a right upper extremity duplex ultrasonography which revealed an acute non-occlusive thrombus in the proximal right internal jugular vein (Figure ) and right subclavian vein (Figure ) at the cephalic vein confluence. At this point, Factor V Leiden, anti-thrombin III, protein C, and protein S levels were ordered which were normal. The patient was admitted to the medical ward and an intravenous heparin infusion was initiated. Chest radiography did not reveal any cervical rib, and computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism. The swelling improved over the course of two days, and the patient was switched to oral apixaban for anticoagulation. He was discharged on apixaban for six months, and a complete resolution of his signs and symptoms was noted at his three-month",
