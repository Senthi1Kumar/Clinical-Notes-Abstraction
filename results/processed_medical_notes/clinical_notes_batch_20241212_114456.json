    "original_text": "A 52-year-old woman presented to her head and neck surgeon (ENT) in 2008 with a well-circumscribed, pigmented lesion of her left lingual gingiva/anterior hard palate. The clinical impression was focal melanosis due to local irritation and observation was recommended. Four years later, the pigmented lesion evolved into multifocal lesion involving both the right (tooth #2 region) and left (teeth #9, #11 and #12 region) anterior hard palate. Biopsy revealed melanoma in situ. Subsequently, the patient underwent resection of the anterior hard palate with neck dissection in 2012, which revealed malignant melanoma with positive (melanoma in situ) margins. The cervical lymph nodes were negative for melanoma. Mutation analysis revealed wild-type BRAF, KIT and NRAS. A positron emission tomography/CT showed no evidence of distant metastasis. Due to positive surgical margins, radiotherapy was considered.

The intraoral clinical examination revealed poor oral hygiene, hypersialorrhea, and extensive mucosal damage affecting the entire oral cavity and causing discomfort, pain, and dysphagia. The lesions were located in the internal surfaces of the lips and cheeks, the dorsal and ventral surface of the tongue, and the soft palate mucosa (). There were epithelial erosions and postbullous ulcerations with a positive Nikolsky sign indicating acantholysis with dislocation of the epithelial layers (). Bulloerosive umbilical involvement was associated with the oral impairment without noting any other cutaneous lesions for four months ().\nIn front of these signs, we conducted an oral biopsy and prescribed topical prednisolone (20 mg; 3 times per day) and chlorhexidine-based (0.12%; 3 times per day) mouthwashes in order to reduce the oral pain awaiting the biopsy result. In a while, her condition worsened (). We referred her to the department of dermatology where she was hospitalized and an umbilical biopsy was performed.\nOn histopathological examinations, the oral biopsy concerned a squamous mucosa lined with a partially visualized coating, with disappearance of the superficial layers and the presence of cells of the basal layer which remain attached to the underlying chorion, drawing a \u201ctapestry nail\u201d appearance, surmounted by a few acantholytic cells. In the chorion, we noted the presence of a polymorphic inflammatory infiltrate rich in eosinophilic polynuclear cells. Direct immunofluorescent examination was negative (). As for the umbilical biopsy, the sample received was carried to the deep dermis.

A chest CT showed multiple nodules in the upper lobe of the left lung, a mass in the left hilar lung and a mass in the middle lobe of the right lung with mediastinal and left hilar lymph node enlargement ( and ). Fiber bronchoscopy revealed that the trachea, main bronchus and bronchi segmentales were unobstructed, and no necrotic material or tumor was observed. TBNA of the right paratracheal lymph node and subcarinal lymph node was conducted. The pathology of those lymph nodes revealed purulent exudate and hemorrhage. He was given cefoperazone tazobartan at 2.25 g every 8 hours and vancomycin at 500 mg every 12 hours a week, but the patient had a recurrent high fever. A chest CT on January 31 showed that the pulmonary lesions had increased in size ( and ). T. marneffei was isolated from TBNA tissues on February 4 ( and ). Thus, voriconazole at 200 mg orally every 12 hours and amphotericin B at 30 mg/day intravenously were prescribed.

He had a history of hypertension, cerebral infarction and benign prostatic hyperplasia under medical treatment. Physical examination revealed direct and rebound tenderness of the lower quadrants of the abdomen. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed multiple air bubbles and wall thickening of the sigmoid colon with fecal materials in the pericolic space. Laboratory results were within the normal ranges except for an elevated carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (88.39 U/mL). Under the impression of panperitonitis caused by perforation of sigmoid colon cancer an emergency operation was performed. During the operation, sigmoid colon showed a perforating tumor, which was severely adhered to the jejunum. Hartmann's operation and segmental resection of the small intestine were carried out.\nGrossly, the specimen consisted of two separate segments of sigmoid colon and jejunum. Serosal surface of sigmoid colon showed a fibrotic torn area, which was considered to be a result of surgical detachment from jejunum. Inside was an irregular cauliflower-like mucosal lesion projected into the lumen. On section, a 3.0 cm-sized tumor with irregular infiltrating border was noted. The separately submitted jejunal segment demonstrated irregular serosal surface and intact mucosa. Sectioning of the jejunum revealed a 3 cm-sized gray-tan and rubbery tumor mainly located in the muscular layer, extending to the perijejunal soft tissue. Dilated duct-like spaces were seen in the involved muscular layer.\nHistologically, the jejunal wall displayed irregularly dilated cystic areas, invasive carcinoma and focal heterotopic pancreatic tissue (). The foci of invasive carcinoma were composed of well-formed glands as well as individual cells and clusters, featuring well to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.

In his medical history, he was diagnosed with the attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 5 years ago by a child and adolescent psychiatrist and received methylphenidate 54 mg/day alone, with significant benefit for 5 years. But, within the last year, he started to fight, tell lies, smoke and also to be a school truant. Finally, it was learned that he took his father\u2019s car without permission and had an accident with it. His family told that he did not have attention deficit problems during methylphenidate treatment and his academic achievement was satisfactory.

And after ten minutes in silence, he shut the door hard and went out.\nAccording to psychiatric assessment, he was diagnosed with ADHD and conduct disorder (CD) according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM 5) and was prescribed aripiprazole 2.5 mg/day adding to extended-release methylphenidate at a dose of 54 mg/day.

His headache was most severe in the frontal region and was not relieved by his home-administered analgesics. There was no history of neck stiffness, weakness, or a decreased level of consciousness. There was no history of fever, chills, rigors, or contact with sick people. The patient was admitted to the medical ward as a case of SCD with vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) and was started on King Fahd Hospital of the University sickle cell protocol; initial workup included complete blood count, retics, renal function test, liver function test, peripheral blood picture, urinalysis, chest X-ray, and electrocardiography. The patient was given half normal saline at a rate of 150 cc/h, and for the pain, he received 5 mg morphine sulfate every 4 h and 8 mg Xefo (lornoxicam) every 12 h. He was also kept on daily pantoprazole 20 mg and folic acid 5 mg. An intradermal skin test was made for ceftriaxone and was negative. One gram of ceftriaxone was administered every 12 h plus vancomycin 1 g every 12 h. The patient was evaluated by neurology to rule out meningitis.\nThis patient was referred to the on-call ophthalmologist as a case of bilateral periorbital swelling; the left eye was affected first, followed by the right eye.

He underwent sigmoidectomy due to intestinal obstruction, and liver lesions were planned for a two-stage surgery. Histological examination of the primary tumor revealed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with subserosal invasion and vascular infiltration, but no lymphatic or lymph node metastasis. Thereafter, he had undergone partial hepatectomy of Segment 7 lesion and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of Segment 8 lesion for colorectal liver metastases 2 months after sigmoidectomy. After 2 years from the initial operation, he had undergone partial hepatectomy for the local recurrence of post-RFA lesion. He was followed without any adjuvant chemotherapy since the resection of primary colon cancer. After that, he was referred to our hospital because of the stenosis in a hilar bile duct. Enhanced CT revealed an enhanced wall thickness in the hilar bile duct (Fig. a). Magnetic resonance cholangiography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and intraductal ultrasound showed that the tumor had grown into the bile duct lumen (Fig. b, c). A brush cytology appearance indicated a class IV. According to the radiological findings, we diagnosed a hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Bismuth type II). Then, he underwent a right portal vein embolization and followed by the extended right hemihepatectomy with extrahepatic bile duct resection. The macroscopic finding displayed 3 cm tumor located in the hilar bile duct wall. Histological examination revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma existing in the common hepatic duct. There is no tumor invasion into the right hepatic artery. Perineural infiltration was observed, but portal or vascular infiltration or lymph node metastases were not identified. There is no invasion of intraepithelial neoplasia at the margin of the tumor (Fig. ).

The left-sided headache included her upper jaw. She also reported a history of cellulitis and urinary tract infections, in addition to surgical removal of an impacted wisdom tooth in 2016. Family history was positive for diabetes mellitus (DM) type II in both her father and her grandfather and colon cancer and coronary artery disease in her other grandfather. She admitted to drinking alcohol one to two times per week but denied use of tobacco and drugs. At the time, she was taking Viorele birth control to regulate her menses. Review of systems was otherwise negative.\nClinical findings\nPhysical examination revealed a well-developed, well-nourished female in no acute distress. She was awake, alert and oriented to person, place and time with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 15. A soft left frontal lesion associated with tenderness to palpation, without erythema or drainage, was palpated slightly off midline. Her cranial nerves II-XII were intact.

The patient was admitted under Internal Medicine service as a case of suspected COVID-19 pneumonia, which was later confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and was put on Enoxaparin 40 mg daily, IV fluids and acetaminophen upon admission according to hospital protocol. On day three of admission, patient started to have increased respiratory effort and was requiring oxygen support via high flow nasal cannula. He was then admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and his enoxaparin was increased to a therapeutic dose and was started on steroids, broad-spectrum antibiotics and intravenous fluid. A 16 Fr Foley\u2019s catheter was inserted for monitoring urine output and was a routine measure in all ICU patients. After 3 days in the ICU the patient became stable and was transferred to general ward. He noticed that he has a constant painless erection that he thought it is caused by the Foley\u2019s catheter and did not report it to hospital staff. Because of the high volume of COVID-19 patients and as a safety precaution, physicians did most of their rounds via Telemedicine video calls. Therefore, genital exams were only done when there is a complaint made by the patient. After spending 21 days in the hospital the patient was ready for discharge, and while removing the patient\u2019s Foley\u2019s catheter in preparation for discharge, the primary physician noticed the erection and the Urology team were consulted for suspected priapism.

At the of age 46 years, while the patient was being evaluated with MRI scans for intermittent headaches, it was discovered that the patient had developed two intracranial tumors radiologically consistent with meningiomas. The tumors were a right cavernous sinus tumor of 13 x 10 millimeters and a larger multilobulated left tentorial tumor of 13 x 11 x 12 mm with direct compression on the left pons.

The thyroid mass limited her neck ROM and obstructed her airway by causing a tracheal deviation as seen on the computed tomography exam. This indicated that she would have a \u201cdifficult airway\u201d even though the rest of her airway indices were normal. Specifically, her airway exam showed she had a Mallampati class II airway with an oral aperture of 3 fingerbreadths and a thyromental distance of 3 fingerbreadths.

    "original_text": "A 65-year-old woman was referred to a gynaecologist for a urethral mass that on gross examination appeared to be a caruncle. Upon examination, a 3-cm wide, pedunculated, black pigmented, friable, haemorrhagic polyp was found at the posterior wall of the urethral meatus. The tumour was removed by local excision. A histopathologic analysis partially revealed a polypoid tumour with superficial ulceration that comprised squamous and transitional epithelia (). The tumour was composed of loosely cohesive nests of atypical epithelioid and spindle-shaped melanocytes that showed diffuse and nested growth patterns. The neoplastic cells had an abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, large hyperchromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli, and brisk mitotic activity. Most of the tumour cells contained coarsely granular melanocytic pigment (). The depth of tumour invasion, as measured by a digital microscopic camera (Olympus DP10), was 3.57 mm. No vascular/lymphatic invasion was observed histologically. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells showed strong cytoplasmic reactivity for HMB-45 and S100 (). Three months after the initial surgery, a resection of the distal third of the urethra showed no evidence of disseminated disease. The initial staging, which included computerised tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, revealed no evidence of disseminated disease. A repeat CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis two years after the initial diagnosis revealed two enlarged right parailiac lymph nodes, which remained unchanged at two subsequent CT assessments that were performed four and six years after the primary diagnosis.

His viral load in February 2018 was 1168 copies/ml on this regimen. In March 2013, he was diagnosed with an unprovoked DVT with HIV being his only notable risk factor and started on warfarin with the aim of achieving an INR of 2-3.

She reported occasional easy bruising in the last two months with no other bleeding issues, lymphadenopathy, or splenomegaly. The patient had one previous uncomplicated pregnancy delivered thirteen months previously with normal platelet counts throughout and had been in good health prior to this pregnancy. She had a personal history of equivocal hypothyroidism, had a family history of hypothyroidism and systemic lupus erythematosus, was on no regular medications, and had not commenced any new medications in pregnancy. Thyroid function tests, immunoglobulins, and folate and vitamin B12 levels were within normal range with a negative antinuclear antibody test. As a low serum ferritin level was noted, she commenced on iron supplementation. The patient was given a presumptive diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia in pregnancy. During pregnancy, fatigue was her only symptom and she had no bleeding complications with her platelet count remaining static. There were no clinical findings to suggest preeclampsia or HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome. Blood film examination was performed routinely throughout pregnancy with no morphological abnormalities observed.

The patient was sent to the Godoy Clinic and reported having undergone several treatments throughout her life as well as several episodes of erysipelas. She did not marry due to the lymphedema and complained of the frequent occurrence of strangers staring at her leg, which upset her. The physical examination confirmed elephantiasis. The circumference of the left lower limb was 106 cm. Her body weight was 106 kilograms, height was 160 cm, and the body mass index (BMI) was 41.6 kg/m2 ().\nThe patient was submitted to intensive treatment for three weeks, which led to a 21 kg reduction in weight and 66 cm reduction in leg circumference ().\nIntensive treatment with the Godoy Method consisted of eight hours per day of mechanical lymphatic drainage, 15 minutes of simultaneous cervical lymphatic therapy, and hand-crafted compression stockings made from grosgrain fabric. Mechanical lymphatic therapy consisted of an electromechanical device that performs plantar flexion and extension. After three weeks of intensive therapy, the patient continued treatment at home using the compression stockings. At the follow-up evaluation, the patient was submitted to electrical bioimpedance analysis as well as circumference measurements and volumetry. The bioimpedance analysis revealed a pattern of normality, with the reduction in lymphedema. Ten years after treatment, the patient has maintained the results with the compression stockings. In occupational therapy throughout this period, the patient has been encouraged to perform activities that she has always wanted to do to improve her wellbeing.

    "original_text": "Patient is a 73 year-old right hand dominant female who initially presented to the office complaining of atraumatic right shoulder pain with activity and limited range of motion of longstanding duration. On physical exam, she was found to have significantly limited active range of motion of the right shoulder and clinical signs of impingement. Radiographs at that time demonstrated superior escape of the humeral head with impingement of the greater tuberosity on the acromion and early acetabularization of the acromion (Fig. ). MRI findings were consistent with her x-ray and also demonstrated a lack of contiguous supraspinatus or infraspinatus tendon. At this juncture, the patient was diagnosed with rotator cuff arthropathy and elected to proceed with reverse total shoulder arthroplasty.\nThe patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the beach chair position. An incision was made from just lateral to the coracoid to the medial border of the proximal humeral shaft in line with the axillary fold. Subcutaneous tissue was dissected and the cephalic vein was identified. As the cephalic vein was mobilized and the clavipectoral fascia was incised, a discrete, branching, fascicular nerve was identified lateral and deep to the cephalic vein within the deltopectoral groove (Fig. ). The nerve was further dissected and traced both proximally and distally. Distally, the nerve and all branches were found to be diving into the anterior deltoid muscle. Proximally, it was found to run deep to the conjoined tendon, towards the brachial plexus. The nerve was freed from the deltoid muscle belly, allowing enough excursion to access the glenohumeral joint via a small deltoid window.

Since the onset of the disease, there had been no incidences of low fever or night sweat and no significant changes in weight. Nevertheless, he complained about a decline in physical strength since the onset of the disease. He had a history of hypertension and diabetes for more than 20 years and had a cerebral infarction 8 years ago. On physical examination, a grade 3 enlarged prostate was found by digital rectal examination, with a hard texture, rough surface, and poor mobility. On laboratory examination, all other routine blood indexes were within the normal limits. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value was 0.09 ng/mL, which was in the normal range (<4.0 ng/mL), and other tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigen and glucosaminidase, were also within the normal limits. Urinalysis showed that all indicators were in the normal range. Based on the details above, we performed transabdominal contrast-enhanced ultrasonography and transrectal prostate biopsy.\nTransrectal ultrasound showed that the appearance of the prostate was enlarged, the size was 91 mm \u00d7 63 mm \u00d7 90 mm, the outline was irregular, the internal echo was not uniform, and a necrotic liquefying area in the center was seen, with a range of approximately 78 mm \u00d7 48 mm; furthermore, color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) revealed rich blood supply signals from the surrounding soft tissue (Fig. A), RI: 0.89. CEUS of the abdomen showed that the peritumoral parenchyma began to enhance rapidly in 12 seconds (Fig. B), the large blood vessels in the necrotic liquefying area of the tumor center enhanced synchronously with the surrounding tissues, and the enhancement was most significant at 21 seconds (Fig. C). The necrotic area shown by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography was much larger than that by two-dimensional ultrasonography. According to the enhanced area as shown by CEUS",

After the patient was treated with 300 mg of aspirin, 600 mg of clopidogrel, as well as a weight-adjusted (70 IU/kg) bolus of unfractionated heparin, coronary angiography was performed showing an ostial left main coronary artery (LMCA) thrombus with 90% obstruction (, ), a total occlusion of the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD) () and a mid right coronary artery (RCA) thrombus with 80% obstruction (, ). From this point on we had three possible strategies. The first one was the interventional strategy (stenting/aspiration with high risk of cerebral and peripheral embolism, which would have exposed the patient to short and long-term risks). The second one was the coronary artery bypass graft surgery (the coronary artery bypass grafting may represent a high risk of early occlusion because of normal native coronary flow after dissolving the coronary thrombus with medical therapy) and the third one was pharmacological strategy (thrombolytic therapy), eventually followed by the pharmacological strategy. Thus, based on the STEMI guideline of European Society of Cardiology; alteplase (rt-PA) 15 mg was injected intravenosus as a bolus dose and subsequently 50 mg alteplase was infused for 30 minutes (0.75 mg/min) and 35 mg was infused for 60 minutes.

The standard first line therapy and in consequence eradication of the bacteria was impeded by a hyperresponsiveness of the bronchial airway to nebulized tobramycin and colomycin, regardless of pre-medication with bronchodilator and corticosteroids. The patient was treated regularly with oral antibiotic courses (ciprofloxacin) and the attempts for aerosol administration of anti-pseudomonas antibiotics were repeated. The initial clinical course was stable, with no acute exacerbation. However, the lung function was deteriorating continuously with time. At the age of 12 years the girl was experiencing deterioration of clinical condition with increased need for oral antimicrobials and acute exacerbation resulting in hospital admissions for I.V. treatment. During one of the hospitalizations, intravenous antibiotic therapy with tobramycin and ceftazidime was initiated. Due to new microbiological findings revealing resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to tobramycin, the antibiotic therapy was switched to ceftazidime, flucloxacillin and colomycin, all given intravenously. Minutes after the initiation of the colomycin infusion the girl reacted with generalized urticaria, dyspnea, tachycardia and hypotension. The infusion was stopped and steroids and antihistamines were applied. The patient recovered and the antibiotic therapy was changed and well-tolerated. The colomycin hypersensitivity was confirmed with positive prick-test (7 mm) and clinical significant FEV1 deterioration (>20 %) after inhalation with colomycin. Since then, colomycin was avoided. Further clinical course showed progressive lung deterioration. The microbiological findings revealed repeated detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa up to 108 cells/ml. The patient was treated regularly with oral antibiotics. Attempts for nebulized tobramycin therapy were tried again, but was not tolerated by the patient. Repeated IV therapies were resulting only in temporary clinical improvement. At the age of 15 years, due to clinical signs of pulmonary exacerbation, the girl was again hospitalized.",

Bystanders attending to the accident found him in cardiac arrest and started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) immediately. Sufficient CPR efforts were continued until the emergency services had arrived. The first recorded heart rhythm was ventricular fibrillation (VF). On inspection, no signs of injury were immediately visible and no skid marks were found. CPR was continued by physician-staffed emergency medical services (EMS) according to the current advanced life support (ALS) guidelines [].

    "original_text": "The second patient was a 70-year-old man with complex left leg swelling and pain. He had a Charcot left foot deformity, foot ulcers, and peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes mellitus. He wore a leg brace and an orthotic boot on his left leg. A right diabetic foot infection led to a right below-knee amputation. He had multiple reasons for lower-extremity edema, including a significant cardiac history, renal failure, chronic venous insufficiency, and liver cirrhosis. The patient presented with a 1-month history of left lower leg edema below the knee. Consequently, he was no longer able to fit into his left leg brace and orthotic boot, and he developed significant pain that limited his ability to ambulate and elevate his leg for prolonged periods. The swelling in his left lower leg was maximal in the ankle and foot (). Because of failure of traditional management, we proceeded with a trial of the geko device to treat his leg swelling.\nInitial placement of the geko device over its intended site did not stimulate the calf muscles. We suspected that this was a consequence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy of his common peroneal nerve. Instead, the geko device stimulated the short head of the biceps femoris muscle. Following 4 weeks of daily geko use, there was almost complete resolution of the left lower leg swelling, with the majority of improvement occurring during the fourth week of therapy (). During this time, the device produced minimal discomfort for the patient. The initial left calf circumference decreased from 29 to 23 cm (21% reduction).
