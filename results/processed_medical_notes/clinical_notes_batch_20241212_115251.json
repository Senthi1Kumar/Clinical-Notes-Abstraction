The routine preprocedure preparation was uneventful and an indwelling bladder catheter was placed without difficulty. Upon peritoneal entry, the bladder was noted to be significantly distended despite the fact that urine was confirmed in the urinary drainage bag.

To investigate this hypothesis, 400 mL of methylene blue was injected through the urinary catheter. The bladder volume did not change and no methylene blue was noted intraabdominally. After this negative test, most of the 400 mL of methylene blue flowed back into the urinary bag and the remaining blue-colored urine came in intermittent streams. A rectal digital examination did not reveal any injuries.\nCystoscopy confirmed a distended bladder and two patent ureteral meatus. No trace of methylene blue was identified within the bladder. At the end of the cystoscopy procedure, a fold was noted on the posterior wall of the bladder neck (see ). This fold was initially thought to be iatrogenic. Insertion of the cystoscope inside this fold revealed a dilated peristaltic tubular structure containing methylene blue. This finding confirmed that the urinary catheter entered this ectopic ureter, and not the bladder. In order to avoid this fold and empty the bladder, a urinary catheter was placed under direct visualization.

The hepatic tumour discovered during follow-up for a previous bladder cancer submitted to endoscopic surgery three years before measured 22 mm in diameter and was located in the VIII Couinaud's segment [] of the liver in association with three smaller hypodense liver lesions with a focal dilatation of peripheral biliary tree ().\nThe case is discussed with radiologists, oncologists, and pathologists of our hospital. Even if the lesion had been the single site of disease; due to the proximity/doubtful infiltration of the lesion to the biliary tree, we decided to submit the patient to an explorative staging laparotomy and possible palliative surgery.\nOur internal protocol states that during the preadmission every patient who is a candidate for a liver resection is subjected to a routine liver function test with ICG to determinate the most appropriate surgical procedures []: 0,5 mg/Kg ICG are routinely injected intravenously up to seven days before surgery to evaluate the ICG retention rate at 15 min (R15). In our case 45 mg of ICG was intravenously administrated to test hepatic function, ten days before the surgery (patient R15 = 8.9).\nThanks to the ICG property of being fluorescent with the light emitted from the photodynamic eye of the laparoscopic system in our possession, it is possible to visualize the lesion during the surgical procedure. To this target, timing of administration and dose of ICG are key points.\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that the effective dose of ICG depends on the timing of injection; in particular, if the function liver test had been performed more than 7 days before surgery it would have been necessary to administer an adjunctive dose (0,1 mg/Kg) the day before [].

The emergency room doctor performed computed tomography (CT), which showed no abnormalities of the internal organs or brain. That same day, he was referred to our department for the treatment of contusions of the lips and oral cavity. No abnormal findings in his medical history or family history were noted. When he arrived at the hospital, he was in pain and bleeding from the contusions, but there were no signs of nerve paralysis or infection. The contusions of the lips and oral mucosa were debrided and sutured.\nThe CT performed in the emergency department showed no fractures anywhere. However, it showed a cavity in the lingual side of the mandible from the right anterior to the premolar region. CT in hard tissue mode showed a high-density line, suggesting cortical bone on the margin of the cavity in the lingual side of the mandible (). The lingual cortical bone was recessed from the lingual side to the buccal side and, at the most recessed point, was contiguous with the buccal cortical bone (). There was no continuity between the apex of the adjacent #27 and the cavity in the lingual side of the mandible, and a high-density line suggested the presence of bony tissue between the apex of #27 and the cavity in the lingual side of the mandible. There was no continuity between the cavity in the lingual side of the mandible and the mandibular canal.

As part of the clinical work-up, the patient underwent an abdominal computed tomography, which demonstrated colonic distension and small bowel ileus with focal narrowing and obstruction of the transverse colon (). Mechanical obstructive ileus was suspected, and a colonoscopy revealed luminal erosion and stricture of the transverse colon. Microscopic examination of multiple blind biopsies showed erosion and vascular congestion with no evidence of malignancy.

Pain onset was followed by bloody stools, both of which resolved the following day aside with only some residual nausea. Abdominal cramping recurred early on in the morning of admission. The patient denied any ingestion of potentially contaminated water or unusual food. The patient history was also negative for recent surgeries, travel, or sick contacts. The patient reported no family or personal history of inflammatory bowel disease and had no other concerns aside from the left lower abdominal pain and bloody stools.\nUpon examination, her vital signs revealed an elevated heart rate of 118 and a slight elevation in blood pressure at 134/88. Her abdominal exam showed normal bowel sounds and a soft abdomen but with mild diffuse tenderness. No rebound or guarding was noted.\nLaboratory testing was largely unremarkable. CT abdomen pelvis with intravenous contrast revealed findings consistent with an ileocolic intussusception (). A tubular structure was seen within the lumen of the intussusception which was determined to be a distended appendix potentially serving as the lead point. No indication of obstruction or bowel perforation was seen, but there was a small amount of intraperitoneal fluid. All organs were unremarkable aside from a non-obstructing stone seen in the right kidney.\nThe patient was admitted to general surgery for further evaluation and management. It was discovered that right colon and distal ileum had intussuscepted into the transverse colon, but it was unable to be reduced laparoscopically and therefore the procedure was converted to open laparotomy.

Another PM replacement (Medtronic) was performed at the age of 27 years, again, due to battery depletion.

The ICD lead was implanted passing the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. Six years later, severe TV stenosis developed, caused by an ICD lead, that stuck to the posterior leaflet of the biological valve and ventricular myocardium, and the TV had to be replaced a third time. To avoid future TV dysfunction due to lead related complications, we discussed several options with the patient. These included first TV replacement in combination with epicardial pacemaker leads and a subcutaneous ICD (S- ICD, EMBLEM\u2122 Boston Scientific) or alternatively placing a pacing lead in the coronary sinus in combination with an S- ICD. As the patient disagreed on both options, despite a higher risk of TV dysfunction by placing another transvenous ICD lead through the TV, we discussed another option and opted for a lead sparing replacement of the TV.

The patient had presented with 3 days history of painful left eye associated with loss of vision. Prior to this acute symptom a month earlier he was treated by a local doctor for suspected viral conjunctivitis in both the eyes that settled after 10 days. Subsequently, the patient noted gradual reduction of vision in both the eyes with painful knee joints. As the left eye became painful and red in the last 3 days the patient reported to the nearby ophthalmologist.\nOn examination he had best spectacle corrected vision of 20/80 OD and FC 1 m OS. Slit-lamp examination revealed disciform keratitis with normal corneal epithelium in the right eye []. There were no cells in the anterior chamber nor were any keratic precipitates. The left eye revealed very swollen corneal stroma in the form of a large disc almost involving the entire cornea associated with a small ragged epithelial defect in the para-central part of cornea [, arrow]. The edge of the epithelial defect had a faint whitish infiltrate. The anterior chamber showed a small hypopyon with numerous cells in the anterior chamber.\nBased on the finding, a diagnosis of bilateral disciform keratitis was made with suspected bacterial keratitis in the left eye. As the patient was already using moxifloxacin eye drops 0.5% in the left eye and was feeling better, corneal scraping was not attempted. The patient was admitted and treated with prednisolone 1% eye drops 6 times a day in the right eye. The left was treated with moxifloxacin (0.5%) eye drops every hour and atropine (1%) eye drops 3 times a day. He was also put on oral acyclovir (400 mg) twice daily.

She was affected by CRF as a result of hypertension and had undergone HD three times a week and hemofiltration twice a month for the past nine years. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a mass in the upper lobe of the right lung near the mediastinum and multiple small nodules in the bilateral lung (Fig ). Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT revealed that the mean standard uptake value of the mass was 4.5, the uptake of the multiple nodules elevated, and the abdominal uptake value was normal. Tumor relapse was confirmed based on these results. Because of her advanced age, poor PS, CRF requiring HD, and the toxicity of chemotherapy, chemotherapy was inappropriate for this patient. An EGFR DNA sequencing analysis was performed on her tumor tissue, which was obtained 18 years ago, revealing an L858R mutation in exon 21. The patient gave written informed consent and started oral gefitinib treatment at a dose of 250 mg daily.

The patient reported a painful pop in her knee with extension. Pain was reported up to 10 out 10 with walking and running but relieved with rest. Past medical history, surgical history and review of systems were noncontributory. On physical exam, the patient walked with an antalgic gait. There was a visible pop on the anterolateral aspect of her patellar tendon with acute knee extension, focal tenderness to manual palpation of the anterolateral aspect of the fat pad and minimal knee joint effusion. A firm nodule could be manipulated, which was tender to palpation while the knee was in full extension. Exam was otherwise negative. An magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained and showed a well-defined intermediate to low signal intensity soft tissue nodule in the deep proximal lateral border of the infrapatellar fat pad measuring 1.3 cm by 0.9 cm. This nodule was adjacent to the inferior lateral margin of the patella, in close proximity to the anterior margin of the lateral femoral trochlea ().\nThe patient was brought to the operating room for arthroscopic biopsy and excision. An anteromedial portal was used as the viewing portal given the location of the nodule. The medial compartment was first evaluated and showed an intact meniscus and normal articular surface. The lateral compartment showed a well-circumscribed encapsulated nodule visible at the proximal lateral aspect of the patella fat pad (). A distal lateral portal was created with the assistance of an 18-gauge spine needle to avoid penetrating the nodule.

The patient complained of facial asymmetry and poor looks due to loss of the right eye. A history of retinoblastoma, followed by exenteration of the orbit was recorded. The surgical intervention had been carried out when the patient was 5 months old; thereby the growth was retarded. The facial asymmetry was apparent as the anophthalmic defect included the right orbit and extended laterally along the outer canthus of the eye, toward the temporal region as well along the malar eminence toward the zygomatic arch. The patient underwent a computed tomography scan on basis of which a stereolithographic model was fabricated. A mock surgery on the stereolithography model [] revealed optimal bone thickness along the inferolateral orbital rim composed of zygomatic bone while the lateral aspect of superolateral rim composed of frontal bone showed moderately optimal bone in terms of thickness and density.\nA surgical stent was fabricated as per the mock preparation. After obtaining patient's written consent, implant surgical procedure was done under short general anesthesia. Two intraoral dental implants were placed depending on the availability of the bone at the defect site. A 3.75 mm \u00d7 10 mm implant was placed in inferolateral region and 3.75 mm \u00d7 8 mm implant was placed in superolateral region [].

During the admission she developed sudden onset left-sided weakness and altered levels of consciousness, as well as rigidity and one isolated temperature spike. The concern was raised that she may be or might have been suffering from neuroleptic malignant syndrome and her neuroleptics were stopped as a precaution (Table ). She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the MMUH in Dublin with a suspicion of neuroleptic malignant syndrome or encephalopathy. Computed tomography (CT) brain imaging was normal at the time. As neuroleptic malignant syndrome was suspected, olanzapine was stopped. However, her creatinine kinase levels were normal as was her body temperature. Hence, neuroleptic malignant syndrome was deemed to be unlikely. An electroencephalogram during admission showed changes suspicious of encephalopathy and MRI imaging showed no acute abnormality.

At the time of her admission, she was not in distress, she was not febrile, and her vital signs were within normal values. On clinical examination, there was swelling with a red area measuring 12 cm \u00d7 4 cm and tenderness of the right flank around her appendectomy scar. Crepitus could be felt diffusely on her right and left flanks and the periumbilical and epigastric regions upon palpation. Blood test showed the presence of mild inflammation, with a CRP value of 7 mg/l (within normal values) and an elevated white blood cell count of 18 G/l. The rest of the laboratory results were normal. Emergency ultrasonography was unhelpful because of air interference. An abdominal CT scan () showed diffuse subcutaneous abdominal emphysema extending to the pelvis on the left side that was more pronounced on the right inguinal fossa with a bowel loop in contact with the abdominal wall. An emergency laparotomy centered on the McBurney incision showed feces and pus within the subcutaneous compartment. Furthermore, at the level of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, an inflammatory diverticulum could be seen fistulizing between the lumen of the sigmoid colon loop and the necrotic subcutaneous tissue. We subsequently diagnosed intraoperatively a subcutaneous abscess and emphysema with an enteroparietal fistula caused by a ruptured sigmoid diverticulum in an incisional hernia. The necrotic tissues were excised, and the punctiform sigmoid colon fistula was closed.

FNA was done to rule out breast cancer, and the specimen showed few foamy macrophages and rare clusters of ductal cells, with focal secretory lactational changes. Based on that, it was determined that the specimen was negative for malignancy. The tumor continued to grow, and in June 2004, FNA of the right breast was repeated and showed large staghorn-shaped sheets of uniform ductal cells with no cytologic atypia along with myoepithelial cells. There were fragments of fibrotic stroma and bare nuclei scattered in a bloody background, and so, a diagnosis of fibroadenoma was made. Two months later, the patient underwent excision of the tumor in another healthcare facility. Examination of the slides showed an overgrowth of epithelial and stromal components in pericanalicular and intracanalicular patterns with irregular large cystic spaces showing protruding leaf-like structures (). The stromal cells showed plump elongated slightly dysmorphic nuclei with occasional prominent nucleoli. Other areas showed significant cellular growth of the stromal spindle cells which appeared to be arranged in long intersecting fascicles and growing in herringbone pattern ().

During the surgical procedure, a central venous catheter was placed in the internal jugular vein by ultrasound-guided puncture of the vessel, but an inadvertent puncture and cannulation of the right subclavian artery occurred before catheter placement. Because of the ultrasound-guided procedure, the anesthesiologist thought to have cannulated the carotid artery and applied local pressure for a few minutes. Two hours later, when the patient was in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) around midnight, a chest X-ray to check the correct position of the central venous catheter revealed a massive hemothorax (), while the patient was hypotensive and responder to crystalloids and blood infusions. A chest drain was inserted without any substantial output but a small amount of clotted blood.

He had chronic pain and progressive deformity of lateral elbow, and lost extension after one episode of elbow dislocation about 20 years ago. He was transferred to our office for further assessment with above symptoms. Tracing back his trauma history revealed that he noted a daily sensation of painful slip in and out on the lateral elbow joint after a dislocation underwent a closed reduction by a bonesetter. His elbow symptom didn't improve or got a diagnosis after visiting three orthopedic surgeons for the first 6 months. Although his elbow symptom was persisting but he was tolerable at eating, dressing, carrying or pulling of daily activity or working ability except lifting or push-up and he didn't visiting any physician for further help since then until this new symptom of hand numbness occurred.\nPhysical examination revealed the elbow with flexion arc from 20\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 and full forearm rotation compared with contra lateral side, and grip strength 105 lb (125 lb on the right side).

She expressed a desire to become pregnant to her primary physician and subsequently stopped receiving prednisone. A year prior, at 39 years old, the patient was diagnosed with multiple myoma by transvaginal ultrasound. Her primary physician referred the patient to our hospital for infertility treatment, which included a myomectomy followed by timed intercourse after monitoring her ovarian cycle via vaginal ultrasound. Laparoscopic-assisted myomectomy was performed in our department, and infertility treatment was started 3 months postoperatively. Serum LH and FSH hormone levels were found to be within the normal range (Table ). The patient indicated in her interview that she had regular menstrual cycles, but upon further investigation, this was found not to be the case. The results from the ultrasound monitoring showed an irregular cycle and that the patient met some of the criteria for PCOS, most notably a high AMH level.\nFollowing standard treatment guidelines in Japan, the patient underwent timed intercourse with cyclofenil administered at a dose of 600 mg/d for 5 days, starting on cycle day 5 until cycle day 9. However, no follicular development was observed, even on the 25th day of the menstrual cycle. At this time, a mass was not observed in the right ovary on the ultrasonogram and a follicle width diameter of 8.6 mm was confirmed (Figure A).

He was subsequently operated on in Thailand, where he underwent an open reduction and internal fixation. Upon return to the UK his surgical site wound began to discharge, over the course of a 7 month period prior to presentation to our institution.

He had no significant past medical history, nil reported allergies and was fully mobile prior to this incident.\nThe patient was admitted to hospital (Day 1) for further management of his infected surgical site wound. Initial laboratory analyses including a full blood count, liver function tests and serum urea and electrolyte tests were conducted upon admission. All results were unremarkable. An X-ray of the left tibia and fibula performed on admission indicated periprosthetic lucencies. There was no evidence of healing at the site of the proximal fracture aligning with the initial clinical presentation of osteomyelitis.\nThe patient was subsequently taken to theatre on Day 4 for removal of all metalwork (including 12 screws), debridement and deep tissue and bone sampling for bacterial culture. During this operation vancomycin was incorporated in bone cement and intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone (2 g/q24h) was initiated pre-operatively.

The patient reported a history of left hip trauma at the age of 10, at which time he did not accept proper treatment. The resultant left hip deformities had since caused the patient to walk with a limp. Prior to his fall, the patient was able to bear weight and work with moderate left hip pain. Physical examination revealed the left leg to be 4 cm shorter than the right leg, with local tenderness being detected in the left hip.

As passive activity caused serious pain, we were unable to measure the degrees of left hip motion. The patient had been diagnosed with hypertension for six years, and regularly took blood pressure control medications. Computed tomography scans revealed the high posterior dislocation of the left femoral head up to the level of the greater sciatic foramen(Fig. b).

These symptoms were abrupt in onset, with the child suddenly refusing to play with his sister and other children in his neighborhood. He began asking his parents to be around him and cried if they did not listen. He insisted that his parents and siblings did not move away from him even for a minute to the point of not allowing them to go to another room. Within 2 days, the behavior increased to such an extent, that he would cry at the thought of separation from his parents and siblings. At one point, when the parents resisted his behavior, he got very angry and scratched himself on his face leading to abrasions. However, such symptoms were very discrete and were present only for some time during a day (usually from 1 to 5 pm everyday) with no exacerbating or relieving factors. For the rest of the day, though he appeared slightly anxious, he did not have as much separation anxiety.\nHis parents noticed that the child had difficulty completing any work at home like helping his mother in her chores, which he would do with ease otherwise.

A biopsy 6 years earlier had revealed an intraosseous haemangioma, but the patient had refused amputation and did not seek further consultation.\nThe physical examination showed a large, tender, bony mass over the anteromedial portion of the proximal right leg. The patient retained full motion of the ipsilateral ankle and knee joints. There were no other masses (). The radiographs showed an extensive lesion of the right tibial shaft extending from the proximal epiphyseal line to the distal third of the tibia with an associated huge anterior soft tissue mass. There was a lattice-like pattern with horizontally and vertically oriented striations within the entire lesion (). Magnetic resonance T2-weighted images showed multiple high signal intensity lobules with multiple septations containing several round areas of low signal intensity ( to ).\nA repeat open biopsy confirmed the histopathology to be that of a haemangioma of the bone.

The pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan showed some nodules at the posterior margin of the bladder that were considered to be endometriosis, and some pelvic effusion that was significant on the right side.

The CT images revealed a region occupying the middle right ureter that was considered to be a retroperitoneal aggressive fibroma, which led to severe hydronephrosis on the right kidney and upper ureter, and a right pelvic effusion (Fig. ). After more detailed examinations were conducted, there were no obvious abnormalities detected in the brain, heart, liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas or blood.

Initial staging by abdominal and pulmonary CT revealed a lesion in the right-sided colon penetrating the visceral peritoneum with infiltration of the abdominal wall (cT4b) and a single metastatic lesion in the liver, in segment VII, with a diameter of 1.5 cm (M1a) according to a stage IVA disease.\nAfter right-sided hemicolectomy together with a simultaneous atypical resection of the single liver metastasis adjuvant chemotherapy (CTX) with capecitabine and oxaliplatin was started. After 5 cycles of adjuvant CTX the patient complained about a considerable increase of his abdominal girth. An abdominal CT in March 2011 yielded peritoneal nodules and ascites (Figure ).\nAfter confirmation of a mutated K-RAS gene a palliative first line CTX with capecitabine and irinotecan in combination with bevacizumab was started. However, treatment was interrupted right after the first cycle because of an episode with neutropenic fever and resumption of CTX was refused by the patient until June 2011.\nCT imaging in June 2011 showed a disease progression with a new solitary pulmonary lesion with a diameter of 3.3 \u00d7 2.8 cm (Figure a) and ascites in all 4 quadrants of the abdomen (Figure b). As the patient refused biopsy of the pulmonary lesion and the radiology report stated that the lung lesion was radiological consistent with a pulmonary metastasis a biopsy was not performed. Tumor markers CEA and CA 19.9 were within normal range at the time of diagnosis and during the whole course of disease. Clinically, the amount of ascites was increasing and required abdominal punctures on a weekly basis. Therefore the first line CTX with capecitabine, irinotecan and bevacizumab was reinitiated.

During her stay, the patient complained of an unpleasant sensation in her whole body that had been present at night since admission. When the patient was at rest, discomfort and irritation occurred in both calves. All symptoms were resolved by moving the legs. The symptoms mainly occurred in the evening, around dinner time (about 6 pm) and reached a peak during sleep. As a result, the patient could not easily fall asleep, and often woke up during the night. In addition, the patient had to move her legs 7 to 8 times a night because of the discomfort in both calves during sleep. A detailed interview revealed that unpleasant sensations when resting or sleeping had occurred since the patient was an adolescent. However, the patient reported that both her mother and sister had the same symptoms and she had concluded it was a familial characteristic. Therefore, the discomfort in the lower extremities had never been assessed, and had she had never received any treatments or medications to manage it. The patient stated that she had to move throughout the night, and that when someone else was nearby, she refrained from moving, making the discomfort worse. Therefore, she slept alone, even after she was married.\nWe diagnosed the patient with chronic persistent RLS based on the 2012 Revised International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Diagnostic Criteria.[ Blood tests revealed no iron deficiency or renal function abnormality. HbA1c was also confirmed to be within the normal range, and diabetes mellitus was excluded.

She was unable to move her elbow actively due to pain. A physical examination revealed mild swelling and tenderness over the lateral aspect of the distal part of her humerus. The child had a restricted range of motion of her elbow, especially with flexion. Joint stability was considered normal and no neurovascular signs were observed. The diagnosis was made on a lateral and an oblique radiograph (Figures and ), which revealed a displaced fracture of the capitellum of her right elbow, a typical Hahn-Steinthal or Type I fracture. An anteroposterior radiograph of the distal part of her right humerus did not reveal a definite fracture. No other injuries were detected.\nOur patient was treated by open reduction and internal fixation. Under general anesthesia, an attempt was made at closed reduction but complete reduction could not be achieved that way.

Both tumours were round and about 2 cm in diameter and rather well-circumscribed. A previous biopsy had suggested possible squamous cell carcinoma, but the morphology and IHC profile with >90% of the cells positive for p40, S100 and smooth muscle-specific actin (CK5 was positive in about 40% of the cells) was consistent with epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma. See Fig. . Based on the tumours\u2019 macroscopic appearance and peripheral location in the lung it was concluded the tumours were metastases. There was no evidence of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma in the salivary glands or in accessory salivary glands in the bronchi.\nThe patient had a previous history of a breast tumour originally suggested to be at first hand consistent with ductal carcinoma in situ, approximately 2 cm in size, surgically treated almost 5 years earlier. The tumours from the lung and breast were reviewed by several pathologists in Sweden and one international expert without consensus regarding the breast tumour. The morphology of the peripheral cells in the breast tumour and the cells of the lung tumours was similar although the growth pattern when comparing with the breast tumour as a whole was not perfectly identical and there were different opinions among pathologists whether the breast tumour was invasive or not. However, additional IHC staining of the breast tumour showed positive CK5, p40, p63, S100 and smooth muscle actin in the basal and peripheral cells, while the luminal cells were partly positive for CK5 (about 15% of the luminal cells) and estrogen receptor (about 20%).

    "cleaned_text": "case 2 was a 70 years old woman with two histologically identical lung tumours in the right upper and lower lobes, respectively, both surgically removed with wedge resections. both tumours were round and about 2 cm in diameter and rather well-circumscribed. a previous biopsy had suggested possible squamous cell carcinoma, but the morphology and ihc profile with >90% of the cells positive for p40, s100 and smooth muscle-specific actin (ck5 was positive in about 40% of the cells) was consistent with epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma. see fig. . based on the tumours' macroscopic appearance and peripheral location in the lung it was concluded the tumours were metastases. there was no evidence of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma in the salivary glands or in accessory salivary glands in the bronchi.\nthe patient had a previous history of a breast tumour originally suggested to be at first hand consistent with ductal carcinoma in situ, approximately 2 cm in size, surgically treated almost 5 years earlier. the tumours from the lung and breast were reviewed by several pathologists in sweden and one international expert without consensus regarding the breast tumour. the morphology of the peripheral cells in the breast tumour and the cells of the lung tumours was similar although the growth pattern when comparing with the breast tumour as a whole was not perfectly identical and there were different opinions among pathologists whether the breast tumour was invasive or not. however, additional ihc staining of the breast tumour showed positive ck5, p40, p63, s100 and smooth muscle actin in the basal and peripheral cells, while the luminal cells were partly positive for ck5 (about 15% of the luminal cells) and estrogen receptor (about 20%). see fig. . progesterone receptor and her2 were negative. the lung tumours were negative for estrogen and progesterone receptor and her2.\nafter targeted ngs analysis revealed the same pik3ca mutation in both the breast and lung tumours there was a total agreement among the pathologists that the breast tumour was a malignant",

Intraorally there was an area of exposed bone roughly 1 cm in size on the buccal aspect of the mandible in the area of tooth #20; there was a separate area of exposed bone on the lingual aspect. There was minimal amount of thin purulent drainage intraorally and on the neck bandage. A diagnosis of MRONJ was made based on her clinical presentation, and she was scheduled for follow-up with imaging to discuss her treatment options.

Furthermore, there was progressive development of pain in the TMJ region while opening the mouth. There was no history of trauma, vascular collagen diseases, infections, or surgery on the face or jaws. Her medical history and family history were noncontributory.\nThe extraoral examination confirmed facial asymmetry due to the downward displacement of the entire right mandible and an increase in the vertical height of the middle and lower facial thirds on the right side. The chin had deviated to the right side, and the lip line had slightly shifted downward, tilting toward the right side. Furthermore, mild tenderness was noted in her TMJs bilaterally, a clicking sound was heard during movement of the left TMJ, and tenderness was noted in the right side of the neck. The intraoral examination revealed a slight shift of the mandibular midline to the right side along with a mandibular cant. In addition, she had a posterior open bite, that is, posterior teeth of both the jaws were slightly tilted lingually to maintain the occlusion.\nThe panoramic radiographic image revealed significant uniform asymmetrical enlargement of the right mandibular condyle and elongation of the neck of the right mandibular bone, along with improper dental occlusion of the right side. The right gonial angle was characteristically rounded off and the mandibular canal was displaced to the lower border of the right mandible (Figure ).
