    "original_text": "We present a 57 year old gentleman with CKD 5 who had an autogenous brachiocephalic fistula 4 months prior to presentation to us. During their last surgical clinical visit, the fistula was noted to be poorly maturing and then referred to interventional radiology for fistulogram and possible endovascular intervention to assist with fistula maturation.\nThe patient had a fistulogram which demonstrated a high grade juxta-anastomotic stenosis which was successfully balloon dilated. After a 6 week follow up clinic visit the fistula was still immature and a duplex scan, a second fistulogram with possible intervention were requested.\nFistulogram was performed via an antegrade approach from an access just proximal to the swing point. There was an \u201capparent\u201d stenosis (Fig. ) which was angioplastied then followed by severe spasm (Fig. ). which was perceived by the operator to be recalcitrant stenosis. In the light of this perceived recalcitrant stenosis, a decision to stent the area was taken. After measuring the vessel diameter based on the immediate post-plasty images a 6 mm diameter \u00d7 5 cm length Viabahn stent (Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ) was selected and deployed in the standard fashion.\nFollowing stent deployment, the stent migrated and stopped at the confluence of the cephalic vein and the subclavian vein (Fig. ). At the time the operator thought the stent was stable and unlikely to cause harm to the patient in this position.

Neither esophagogastroduodenal endoscopy (EGD) nor colonoscopy was conclusive.\nThe patient was severely anemic with an initial hemoglobin concentration of 3.9 g/dL. A complete physical examination revealed no pertinent findings. After blood transfusing with 4 U red blood cell and 500 mL serum, the patient underwent urgent EGD, which demonstrated curious dark blood in the second portion of the duodenum. We thus assumed that the bleeding lesion might locate at the duodenum or at the proximal loops of the jejunum. Colonoscopy was herein used and showed a 2.0 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm submucosal mass at the proximal loops of the jejunum. There was an ulcerative pit on the top of the mass, within which was an adherent clot (Fig. ). Fresh blood was extruded at the center of the pit when the patient felt nausea. The patient was then suspected as stromal tumor with active bleeding.\nConsidering that the patient still had massive bleeding and the blood pressure kept going down, urgent endoscopical sclerotherapy was performed. A 5 mL test dose of polidocanol was administered by injecting into the mass body with a 23 G injection needle, followed by 2 mL aliquots were injected circumferentially surrounding the center of the pit. The total volume of polidocanol was 15 mL. The sclerotherapy was done till the surface of the mass bulged and the active bleeding terminated (Supplementary Video).

The baseline 12-lead ECG revealed a sustained monomorphic VT with RBBB morphology and left axis deviation (Fig. ). Since tachycardia was poorly tolerated with systolic blood pressure of 80 mmHg an electrical cardioversion was applied and the rhythm was restored to sinus (Fig. ). The \u0395CG, physical examination and laboratory tests after the cardioversion were unremarkable.\nThe chest X-ray revealed an increased cardiothoracic index. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed dilated left ventricle with a lateral wall aneurysm, left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% and mild mitral regurgitation (Fig. ). The coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries, whereas the left ventriculography further confirmed the lateral wall aneurysm (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging further confirmed the presence of the LVA (Fig. ).\nThe patient was started on amiodarone per os and after two weeks an electrophysiology study was performed. The programmed ventricular stimulation in the right ventricular apex with 500/230-240 msec basic drive cycle and two extrastimuli reproducibly induced sustained monomorphic VT of 160 bpm associated with hemodynamic instability. That tachycardia, however, had different characteristics from the one at the emergency department as it was associated with left branch bundle block (LBBB) morphology and normal cardiac axis and was terminated by overdrive pacing (Fig. ).

She opted for medical management. Accordingly, a low-dose misoprostol of 100 \u00b5g was inserted vaginally in the posterior fornix, and 6 hours later, a repeat dose was given.

The main complaint of the patient was an ulcer with a 3 weeks reported duration, which caused moderate constant pain. She had done a full blood count and biochemical panel which showed no abnormal findings. She initially visited for this reason a general dentist who prescribed fluconazole and as the lesion did not resolve, she consulted an oral surgeon who suggested evaluation by an oral medicine specialist. The clinical examination revealed an ulcer with irregular margins covered with necrotic slough, located on the gingiva of the upper left quadrant [#25,#26], where the patient had an old bridge, (Fig. ) and extended from the buccal to palatal surface. She had no palpable neck lymph nodes. According to the medical history and clinical findings the differential diagnosis, was : osteonecrosis, ulceration due to methotrexate, lymphoproliferative disorder of the oral soft tissue due to immune suppression. An immediate soft tissue biopsy [from the palatal surface] and orthopantomography were performed. The radiographic findings showed normal bone underneath the ulcer. The histological examination revealed lymphocytic infiltrate in hematoxylin eosin stain (Fig. ), and a panel of immunohistochemistry markers for lymphoma revealed positivity for the CD30 [cluster of differentiation (Fig. ) and Epstein\u2013Barr virus encoded early RNA [EBER].

He sustained a bicondylar left tibial plateau fracture with an ipsilateral left diaphyseal tibia fracture. His BMI was 30.5, he had a 25-year history of smoking, and he took omeprazole for gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Exam demonstrated extensive soft tissue swelling to his left lower extremity. A temporary external fixator spanning both fractures was applied to allow soft tissue rest. The patient remained on the orthopaedic ward in stable condition and was brought back to the operating room for definitive ORIF ten days after initial treatment. Definitive management consisted of stabilizing the fractures with a 13-hole lateral locking plate (Synthes, West Chester, PA, Figure ). DVT prophylaxis was performed by administration of subcutaneous heparin, 5000 units twice daily.\nFour days after ORIF, the patient developed extensive swelling and erythema to the left lower extremity as well as frank scrotal edema. He was tachycardic and febrile. Compression gray scale ultrasound as well as Doppler imaging revealed an extensive occlusive DVT from the common femoral to the popliteal vein.\nSystemic anticoagulation with heparin and warfarin was immediately started and a CT venogram was obtained, demonstrating an extension of the DVT into the common iliac vein. A stump of the left common iliac vein at the crossover from the right common iliac artery, diagnostic with MTS, was found. With still increasing soft tissue swelling and fear of a possible pulmonary embolism, a decision for an immediate endovascular intervention was made.\nBoth right internal jugular and right iliac vein were cannulated and a seven French inferior vena cave (IVC) sheath was positioned in the common iliac vein using a guide wire.

One year after the first surgery, three metastatic lung nodules appeared at the upper lobe of her right lung, the lower lobe of her right lung, and the lower lobe of her left lung. Wedge resection for upper and lower lobe of her right lung was initially performed via three-port thoracoscopic surgery. Then, wedge resection for the lower lobe of her left lung was performed via eighth intercostal single incisional thoracoscopic surgery.

The girl was delivered on term via spontaneous vaginal labor at 36 weeks of pregnancy due to a premature rupture of membranes. Her birth weight was 2340 g and she received 9 points on the Apgar scale. There were no abnormalities in the healing of the umbilicus. The girl was rehabilitated from the beginning of the third month of life on account of increased muscle tone (hypertonia). Furthermore, she had an episode of acute diarrhea at three months of age, apart from which she did not suffer from any other illness. She was fully vaccinated by 6 months of age.\nThe patient presented with episodic diarrhea, intermittent \u201csun-setting eye phenomenon\u201d and mild facial dysmorphism to a rural hospital where ultrasonography revealed hepatomegaly with numerous diffuse areas and decreased echogenicity, as well as failure to visualize the spleen twice. An echocardiogram disclosed atrial septal defect (ASD) type 2 and treatment with spironolactone was introduced. The structures of the brain were correctly visualized in a transcranial ultrasound.

During the examination, he was found to be gesturing and muttering, as if he was in conversation with an imaginary person. He was referred immediately to the psychiatry department where he was admitted for further evaluation.\nHis history revealed that he was apparently normal until 13 years back whereupon he had been admitted to the critical care unit for symptoms of sudden onset weakness, vomiting, dehydration, and melena following a Russell's viper snake bite. He was treated with supportive management. On discharge, our patient was diagnosed to have hypoadrenalism and was managed with oral prednisolone 2.5 mg twice in a day. Two months later, he was admitted again for hypoglycemic shock after complaining of the generalized weakness of the body.

The pain had started suddenly about 2 hours before and worsened rapidly to its peak such that he had never experienced before.\nHis past medical history included hyperthyroidism, bilateral subdural hematoma, and coronary heart disease. He got a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 11 months before his admission. Since then, he took aspirin and warfarin daily.\nOn admission, his blood pressure and pulse rate were 102/65 mmHg and 86 bpm, and he was symptomless except for mildly distended abdomen with severe tenderness over his left flank to back. Laboratory findings showed a low serum hemoglobin concentration 10.0 g/dL. In addition, PT-INR was slightly prolonged to 3.50.

His family history was significant: he was born as the third child in the family; his sister is alive; his brother, who had a congenital heart malformation and Down\u2019s syndrome, died as an infant. His two cousins had Say-Meyer syndrome. His mother had contact with chemical disinfectants during the first two months of her pregnancy. The boy was born in the 38th week of pregnancy with Apgar scale 9 congenital malformation of all four limbs. When he was 1 year old, his family recognized that he had hearing problems but they did not seek any professional help. In 2006, his chromosome analysis confirmed incorrect karyotype 46, XY, t(7:12)(q21.2;q21.3). The boy had reciprocal translocation between chromosome pairs 7 and 12.***\nThe first episode of invasive streptococcal disease was diagnosed in 2008 when the patient was 6 years old. It was a complication of an inflammation of his right ear. After that, the boy developed two further episodes of meningitis: in 2011, without confirmed aetiology, and in 2012, again streptococcal. In 2011, due to his recurrent infections of the central nervous system, the boy had a consultation with a neurosurgeon and underwent an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and lumbar column, but the radiologist did not find any abnormalities of these structures.\nIn April 2015, the boy started to complain of pain in his left ear. After three hours the laryngologist confirmed the presence of an inflammation in his left ear and prescribed an oral antibiotic. The pain was so severe that the mother took the child to the hospital two hours later. At the time of admission the general status of the child was good: he presented neither a fever nor pathological neurological symptoms. His leucocyte count was 18.7 G/uL; C-reactive protein\u2013 0.39",

His medical history was generally unremarkable, though his mandible had been accidentally smashed against his young son\u2019s head at the age of 40. No fracture was detected at the time, and no treatment was received.\nClinical examination revealed slight swelling in the left lower molar region and swelling of the left mandible. There was no disturbance of sensitivity in the left lower lip or chin, and he could move his lips normally. Radiographic examination showed large, irregular, multilocular radiolucency of the left area of mandible extending to the premolar and molar area, with no evidence of any impacted tooth (Fig. ). A computed tomography (CT) image revealed a 45 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 30 mm multilocular cystic mass in the mandible (Fig. ). An axial CT image showed thinning or partly resorption site of the buccal cortical plate. The coronal section images of the CT scan showed the mass lesion displacing the mandibular canal downward, near the inferior border. The roots of the adjacent teeth were resorbed, changing their shapes (Fig. ). The location of the teeth was not changed.\nThe initial clinical impression was an ameloblastoma, myxoma, keratocystic odontogenic tumor or another tumor type lesion.\nThe lesion was removed surgically with the buccal cortical bone and buccal mucosa in contact with the mass of the tumor.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 58-year-old man, on treatment for hypertension, who was admitted to a vascular surgery service because of an incidental finding of two aneurysms of the SMA, identified during preoperative imaging exams preparatory to repair of an incisional hernia. The patient had no abdominal symptoms and on physical examination his abdomen was flaccid and painless and with a pulsating mobile mass in the epigastrium. Abdominal ultrasonography indicated a partially thrombosed saccular aneurysm in the retroperitoneal space, with no communication with the aorta. Multislice angiotomography revealed two aneurysms of the SMA, a proximal one measuring 5.9 \u00d7 5.2 \u00d7 5.0 cm and a distal one measuring 5.3 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 3.2 cm ( \n ). Since multiple collateral branches emerged from both aneurysm bodies, which meant the endovascular treatment would have involved a risk of damaging the intestinal blood supply, the decision was taken to perform open surgical repair. During the operation, by explorative laparotomy, access to the retroperitoneal space was achieved after performing the Cattell-Braasch maneuver, with medial displacement of the ascending colon and part of the transverse colon, exposing the infrarenal aorta and its branches. This revealed two true aneurysms of the SMA, the larger of which was around 3 cm from the arterial ostium and the smaller approximately 2 cm from the end of the first ( ). It was also possible to observe collateral branches (right colic, ileocolic, jejunal artery, and ileal arteries) projecting from the bodies of these aneurysms. A mesenteric-mesenteric, end-to-end bypass was therefore constructed, using a dacron prosthetic graft, excluding both aneurysms but preserving branches distal of the proximal aneurysm.

    "original_text": "A 20-year old man was admitted because of nausea, vomiting and severe abdominal pain, accompanied by weight loss. Besides recidivating relapses of herpes infections in the mouth and throat, he suffered no other diseases. The symptoms started at the age of 13 years, when he had a sudden debut of abdominal pain and a collapse. Since then, he suffered occasional periods of abdominal pain and hard stools, alternating with periods of diarrhoea. The results of tests on blood samples taken repeatedly were all within the normal range. The diagnosis IBS was set according to the Rome-II criteria []. Both his mother and aunt suffered from functional dyspepsia since several years; else there is no history of hereditary factors.\nAt the age of 18 years, the symptoms grew worse. The most pronounced symptoms were nausea and abdominal pain, accompanied by weight loss. The symptoms were more and more accelerating, and the patient had difficulties to manage his work and daily life. Vomiting was present some time a week. Blood samples taken repeatedly were all within normal ranges, inclusive cobalamines and folate. Glutenintolerance was ruled out by negative antibodies against endomysium and transglutaminase. Feces haemoglobin was negative, suggesting intact mucosa. Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) showed normal findings in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Treatment with histamine receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors did not have any impact on the nausea.\nAs the routine examinations turned out normally, the patient was referred to a psychiatric clinic for treatment. He visited the psychologist regularly for support. However, this treatment did not affect his nausea.

He also complained of abdominal distension but presented no other signs and symptoms like fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or intestinal obstruction. His medical history included an untreated left inguinal hernia in the last year. A physical examination revealed pain in his left abdomen associated with a palpable mass on his left flank, without rebound tenderness or guarding.\nTwo bilateral reducible inguinal hernias were found. Laboratory results revealed a C-reactive protein of 124mg/L. Given this unspecific clinical presentation, an abdominal and pelvic CT scan were performed, revealing an intra-abdominal abnormality, suggestive of pathologic infiltration of his omentum and the presence of the whirl sign suggesting torsion of his greater omentum (Figure A and B). The distal end of his omentum seemed to be alongside the spermatic cord into a bilateral inguinal hernia sac. Since there was no evidence of acute abdomen or incarcerated hernia and he was stable, we decided on conservative treatment because it has been reported that spontaneous derotation of the omentum can occur []. After he had spent 2 days as an in-patient of our hospital, his pain persisted and his left inguinal hernia became incarcerated. A preoperative diagnosis of secondary torsion of his greater omentum associated with an inguinal bilateral hernia (particularly left inguinal hernia) was established and he submitted to surgery.\nLaparoscopy was performed to evaluate the extent of the damage to his omentum. A wide twist of omentum with large necrotic vascular changes that extended to the inguinal hernia content was found (Figure A). After reducing the hernia content, omentectomy was performed. His abdominal cavity was reached using a 10mm trocar under his umbilicus. Two accessory trocars were placed in his right flank (5mm). A median minilaparotomy (6cm) through the umbilicus port was created for exteriorization",
