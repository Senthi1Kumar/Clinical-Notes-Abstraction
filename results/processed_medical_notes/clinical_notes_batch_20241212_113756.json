Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images. The patient had two previous C-sections. Her menstrual cycles were ovulatory. Spermogram was unremarkable and hormonal assay did not show any abnormality. HSG was performed and revealed a migrated copper IUD with its long tail out of the uterine cavity (Fig. ). Plain abdominopelvic radiography also indicated a rotated T-shaped IUD in the pelvis (Fig. ). A transvaginal ultrasound was also performed by a skilled radiologist who reported a copper IUD in the bladder lumen with a small portion of it within the bladder musculature. The patient had taken multiple courses of antibiotics for urinary tract infection (UTI), but her symptoms never disappeared. The patient also underwent cystoscopy for recurrent infection last year, but no pathological finding was detected. Eventually, the patient said that her symptoms were related to the possible adhesions following two previous operations. The patient had a history of IUD insertion following her last C-section about eight years ago. After three years, however, the patient decided to remove it due to recurrent vaginal secretions. Three years later, her IUD was expelled, and another copper IUD was inserted. The patient removed the other copper IUD for becoming pregnant about two years ago. The patient was very confident of its removal, but her recent HSG, interestingly, demonstrated a rotated copper IUD in the pelvic cavity. Physical examination was essentially normal. A baseline complete blood count, urea, and creatinine levels were normal. The patient was candidate for a hysteroscopic cystoscopy. Hysteroscopy was normal except for a small fibrotic defect at the lower segment of the uterus. During cystoscopy, the long tail of the copper IUD was found",

On transvaginal ultrasound, we describe a solid ovarian mass with a maximal lesion diameter of 59 mm, a maximal diameter of the largest solid component of 59 mm as well, and without acoustic shadowing. There is presence of fluid outside the pouch of Douglas (ascites). If we introduce these parameters in the ADNEX model (in this case, application for smartphone), we obtain the results and column charts as illustrated in . First we add the risk predictions for the four malignant subgroups to obtain the total risk of malignancy, which is 95.3% for this patient. Thus the tumor is likely to be malignant. Then, we look at the differentiation between four malignant subgroups and observe a predicted risk for secondary metastatic cancer of 21.2% (compared to a baseline risk of 4.0%) and a risk for stage II-IV ovarian cancer of 67.9% (compared to a baseline risk of 14.1%). The predicted risks for the other subgroups are lower (4.6% for stage I cancer and 1.6% for borderline) and are also smaller than the baseline risks.\nThe corresponding relative risks (i.e. ratio of predicted risk and baseline risk) for secondary metastatic cancer and stage II-IV ovarian cancer are 5.3 and 4.8, respectively. The relative risks for borderline or stage I ovarian cancer are below 1. With the knowledge of the increased risk for advanced stage ovarian cancer and more importantly secondary metastatic cancer, clinicians may adjust their preoperative diagnostics by excluding a tumor of other primary origin, such as gastric cancer or breast cancer.

She was admitted to that hospital and was treated with antibiotics of ceftriaxone and clarithromycin, intravenously. On the sixth day of her illness, her fever subsided. However, she abruptly developed left hemiparesis and left facial palsy, and was referred to Inha University Hospital. Past medical history of the patient and family were unremarkable.\nOn admission, she was fully conscious and oriented.

He immediately appeared non-compliant with healthcare workers. The first clinical evaluation revealed important and generalised pain of the right leg as well as functional impotence, tibial fracture with medial exposure of degree IIIB of about 10 cm of extension at the level of the distal middle third of the right tibia, contamination of the same outbreak with material that probably originated from the road surface, and various lacerated contusion wounds spread around the exposure ().\nThe patient showed no apparent deep vascular-nervous deficits and reported being a habitual smoker. After appropriate evaluation by the general emergency room surgeon in order to rule out abdominal and/or cranial lesions, the patient was sent to radiology to perform anteroposterior and lateral radiographs, which showed a complex multi-segmented displaced tibia fracture (type 42-C3) with an attached disrupted fracture of peroneal malleolus, type 44-B2 ().\nThe patient was surgically treated with a reduction and stabilization with external fixation. The patient was placed in the supine position, and the exposure was debrided to remove the contaminating residues. Various bruised wounds and bruises were thoroughly cleaned. The fracture was reduced by mounting an external fixation implant in a hybrid configuration with a tibial socket of three proximal Schanz screws and three distal 2 mm transverse wires anchored to a semicircular frame ().\nOne month later, the patient underwent a clinical and radiographic follow-up evaluation, which showed an implant with good grip and a reduction of the fracture abutments.

Multiple unsuccessful electrical and chemical cardioversions (using sotalol and amiodarone) had been attempted in the past. Therefore, ablation of the AV node was performed and a permanent dual chamber pacemaker was implanted. Nonetheless, at the time of admission to hospital the patient was complaining of fatigue, palpitations and dyspnea that were rapidly linked to uncontrolled atrial fibrillation at a heart rate of 120/minute. Previously, for a long time he was on metoprolol 100 mg BID concomitantly with diltiazem 300 mg OD for heart rhythm control. To further control the heart rate, he received in sequence atenolol 100 mg OD and, more than 24 hours after diltiazem cessation, verapamil SR 240 mg OD to replace his previous regimen. Two hours after receiving his first dose of verapamil, the patient began to complain of weakness and dyspnea. He presented with signs of shock with blood pressure at 70/50 mm Hg and heart rate at 101/minute. Lung and cardiac auscultation appeared normal with no new murmur of acute valvular failure, pulmonary congestion or signs of pulmonary embolism. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed paced rhythm (Figure ). A quick bedside echocardiogram showed diffuse hypokinesis of both ventricles with an ejection fraction reduced to 20%. Eighteen months before, an echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular function and ejection fraction of 66%. At that time, the ventricular rate was 110 beats/min while the patient was on long-acting diltiazem 240 mg OD and cilazapril 5 mg OD. Cardiac catheterization was performed within minutes; coronary arteries appeared without significant stenosis, but there was a diffuse hypokinesis. At this point, cardiogenic shock secondary to calcium channel blocker intoxication was suspected.

Visual acuity progressively declined within 1 month to seeing only contours. Upon ophthalmological work-up, LHON was suspected. Visual acuity slightly improved over the following years. The diagnosis was genetically confirmed by detection of the primary LHON mutation m.3460G>A at the age of 49 years. At the age of 60 years, he underwent right hip replacement therapy. At the age of 61 years, he experienced a speech disturbance for 4 days, which was attributed to an ischaemic stroke in the right frontoparietal and occipitoparietal regions with complete remission. Carotid ultrasound at that time revealed occlusion of the right carotid artery. A mild stenosis was diagnosed on the left carotid artery. Cardiovascular risk factors included arterial hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. Since the age of 65 years, he has experienced recurrent nonsystematic vertigo. He had a previous history of smoking 5 pack/years until the age of 61 years. His history was further positive for recurrent, sometimes traumatic falls. The family history was positive for LHON in his brother, the oldest sister of his mother, the second sister of his mother, and one female cousin. The mutation of the index case was also found in his brother and one aunt. The brother with LHON had LVHT, a complex-I defect on biochemical investigations of the muscle homogenate, was an alcoholic, had died suddenly, and had been previously described.

After receiving 450 mL of plasma at another hospital, she was referred to our facility since her test results suggested that her fibrinogen was only 0.10 g/L. She developed spontaneous epistaxis bleeding 7 days after she was born. At 2 years of age, CFD was diagnosed. She had a history of spontaneous auditory canal bleeding at 7 years of age. Her menarche took place at the age of 13, every menstrual period she needed to use more than 40 sanitary pads, accompanied by fatigue, rapid heartbeat, and unable to attend physical education classes or daily physical exercise, showing that she may have hypermenorrhea. She even had two hospitalizations due to hemorrhagic anemia caused by menorrhagia 9 and 3 months prior. But no medical treatment was performed afterwards. Upon presentation at our hospital, she was in the middle of her menstrual cycle. Her abdominal pain was accompanied by nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and palpitation. Besides, she denied the history of smoking.\nAfter admission to the Department of Gynecology, we had a detailed physical examination. She was 155 cm and weighed 50 kg. Her vital signs exhibited blood pressure of 107/74 mmHg, a heart rate of 105 beats/min, a respiration rate of 23 breaths/min, and the body temperature of 36.5\u00b0C. General examination revealed marked pallor, but the mind was clear and no bleeding spots on skin.

A day later (2 days prior to presentation), he noticed blisters on his lips which later extended to involve his oral mucosa. This was associated with pains on chewing and soreness of his entire oral mucosa which impaired feeding. Rashes developed on his face simultaneously. The rashes were itchy, scaly and extending towards the hairline. A day prior to consultation, his eyes became reddish and discharged clear fluid. The eyes were itchy and painful. The patient did not have fever and there were no other associated symptoms. Inability to feed well and his disfigured face prompted consultation in our health facility.\nOn reviewing his past medical history, he denied taking other medications including paracetamol prior to the onset of the symptoms. He however admitted taking a similar dose of ivermectin 1 year earlier during a similar campaign with no reactions. His wife was HIV positive and on highly active antiretroviral therapy. He reported that he was last tested for HIV 6 months prior to presentation and the test was negative. He did not provide any record of the test results. He had no known chronic illness and denied having any known drug or food allergies.\nOn examination he was ill looking and in painful distress. There was a scarf around his face covering the oral lesions. The conjunctivae and sclerae were reddish and there was no cervical lymphadenopathy.

    "original_text": "A 19-year-old male presented with a swollen left mandible and a palpable mass at the level of element 37. He had mild pain since a few weeks. The symptoms had been attributed to a dental problem by a local dentist, and root canal treatment had been performed, without any effect on the pain or swelling.\nAt the initial consultation, a mass was clearly palpable. A panoramic image showed a sclerotic, sharply delineated lesion with a low-attenuation halo, fused with the root of the adjacent molar (). A panoramic radiograph obtained 3 years earlier, for post- orthodontic treatment evaluation, did not shown any tumour sign ().\nCBCT showed a heterogeneous mandibular mass associated with the element 37 causing compression and infero-lingual displacement of the inferior alveolar and mental nerve. The mandibular cortex was thinned at the vestibular side and absent at the lingual side (). Despite the relatively rapid growth, the diagnosis of benign cementoblastoma was proposed based on the classic appearance as a periapical, sclerotic, sharply delineated lesion with a low-attenuation halo, directly fused to the root of the tooth.\n3D renderings showing the affected anatomic area were obtained (). Considering lesion size and location, a possible pathological fracture of the mandible pre- or post-operatively was considered.\nIn order to prepare for such risk or complication, 3D planning and printing were made available.

The patient did not receive any preoperative regional techniques as per our typical institutional practices for lung transplantation at the time. The patient developed atrial fibrillation during surgery that was not responsive to repeated attempts at electrical cardioversion and was started on an amiodarone infusion at 1 mg/min immediately postoperatively. Atrial fibrillation persisted, and 8 hours postoperatively, a heparin infusion was initiated at 15 units/kg/hr in anticipation of repeated cardioversion with a goal of activated partial thromboplastin time of 2 times greater than baseline. Three hours after surgery, the patient was extubated and transitioned to heated Hi-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) at fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 65% at 50 liters (L) to maintain her oxygen saturation >88% on continuous pulse oximetry. For the first 24 hours postextubation, the patient maintained adequate oxygen saturation on HFNC with a range of 40\u201370 L and FiO2 of 45\u201365% without attempting to ambulate. Shortly following extubation, the patient reported uncontrolled pain, despite repeated administration of intravenous opioids (pain scores 5/10 at rest and 10/10 with exertion), with resultant difficulty participating in adequate pulmonary hygiene ().

    "original_text": "A 65-year-old white male presented to our clinic for a second opinion. Seven years earlier, he noticed a skin rash over the anterior part of his neck. He was initially evaluated by a dermatologist, who prescribed topical steroids leading to temporary improvement of the lesion. Unfortunately, the rash returned and was associated with the tightening of the skin over his neck.\nThree years later, despite the occasional use of topical steroids, the skin tightness started to spread down his body, affecting his chest, upper and lower extremities. The patient underwent multiple skin biopsies, and the histopathological report was consistent with lymphocytic infiltration, possibly EF.

The first renal biopsy revealed mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with fibro-cellular crescents in one out of 18 glomeruli, excluding one global sclerotic glomerulus (Fig. ), and deposition of IgA and C3 in mesangial areas by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. ). Weak but significant IgG deposition was also observed in glomeruli in the distribution somewhat different from IgA or C3 (Fig. ).

Patient gives history of generalized weakness, lethargy and weight loss noticed since past few months. Her family history and past medical history was non-significant.\nOn extra-oral examination a diffuse swelling was noticed on left side of the face, measuring approximately 6 cm \u00d7 7 cm, extending superiorly from the infraorbital margin to inferiorly 3 cm below the lower border of mandible, medially 2 cm away from the ala of nose to tragus of the ear laterally (). The skin over the swelling was shiny and stretched. There was no ulceration or erythema noticed over the swelling. On palpation, swelling was firm to hard and tender.\nOn intraoral examination, an ulceroproliferative growth in the vestibule on the left side, extending from the mesial aspect of lower left canine to the retromolar region posteriorly. Obliteration of buccal and lingual vestibule was observed. The growth was covered with pseudomembranous slough, and the indentations of upper molars were seen over the swelling. The swelling has displaced lower first premolar buccally and lower second premolar lingually, lower first molar anteriorly and lower second and third molars posteriorly ().\nOn palpation swelling was soft to firm in consistency and non-tender. No associated discharge or bleeding noticed. Left submandibular lymph nodes were palpable which was tender and firm in consistency.

Both of these procedures were performed uneventfully. At prenatal checkups conducted at 28 weeks gestation, the fetus also had short limbs and cranial defects, suggesting both the patient and the fetus were suspected of having skeletal dysplasia. Preanesthetic examination demonstrated a hypoplastic right clavicle, patent fontanelles, dental malalignment, and a high palate. Because thoracoabdominal radiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no abnormalities in the spinal cord or vertebra, spinal and continuous epidural anesthesia was planned for cesarean section and postoperative analgesia.\nAfter inserting an epidural catheter from the L1/2 intervertebral space, 1.5 mL of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine was injected via the L3/4 intervertebral space for spinal anesthesia. Because the highest level of sensory blockade was the L1, 6 mL of 2% mepivacaine was administered from the epidural catheter, which extended analgesia to the T4 level bilaterally. Cesarean section was completed uneventfully, and a newborn weighing 2394 g with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 min, respectively, was delivered. The total amount of intraoperative blood loss, including amniotic fluid, was 2186 g. The operation and anesthesia lasted 59 and 83 min, respectively.

He presented to his local emergency department where the extent of the injury was not recognised; he was provided with neighbour strapping and given follow up in his local orthopaedic clinic for 1 week after the injury. On examination at orthopaedic follow up, he was unable to flex the distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ) and had very weak flexion at the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ). Passive movement was maintained at the DIPJ but he had a restricted passive range of motion at the PIPJ. An initial diagnosis of a closed rupture of the FDP tendon was made and the patient referred to a hand specialist who counselled the patient for exploration and tendon repair or reconstruction.\nSurgical exploration was performed on day 14 after his injury and under anaesthesia tenodesis revealed no flexion at the PIPJ or DIPJ. Initially, a Brunner\u2019s incision was performed opening the A5 pulley where a rupture of the FDP tendon was identified. It was not possible to milk the retracted FDP tendon so the initial incision had to be extended proximally to the A1 pulley and the FDP was identified and delivered. However, a continued restricted movement at the PIPJ led to opening of the A3 pulley where a complete rupture of the FDS tendon was revealed (). The FDS tendon was not repaired as it was found to be swollen and the vinculae damaged; instead, the FDS was trimmed to facilitate repair of the FDP. The FDP tendon was threaded back through the residual pulleys and finally secured to the distal phalanx using a dorsal pull through technique.",

The duration of this rhythmic movement ranged from 10 seconds to five minutes. Sometimes he repetitively punched the brow hard enough to render skin reddish discoloration. This behavior recurred almost every day. Upon admission, video-EEG monitoring demonstrated that the patient struck his brow with the right fist for one minute during the light sleep. The frequency of tapping during the monitoring was 2 Hz. There was no EEG change. Previously, under the impression of frontal lobe complex partial seizure, various ant-epileptic drugs including oxcarbazepine, zonisamide, levetiracetam and clobazam had been administered to control this symptom without any significant improvement. With the diagnosis of the rhythmic movement during sleep, clonazepam was prescribed before night time sleep. The dose of clonazepam was increased up to three mg per day. Clonazepam could not alter the symptom and induced only daytime drowsiness as an adverse event. Levodopa 250 mg plus carbidopa 25 mg were administered as a therapeutic challenge. Surprisingly this rhythmic movement increased dramatically in intensity and duration. The patient more or less violently punched his brow for four or five hours every night. With the hint of aggravating symptom by dopamine-agonist, haloperidol was chosen. One mg of haloperidol could markedly suppress the symptom to one-tenth degree in the intensity and duration compared with the symptom of the initial presentation. To avoid long-term adverse events, haloperidol was switched to pimozide two mg just before the night time sleep.

In 1990, she was treated for a basal cell carcinoma on her left shoulder but has no other comorbidities except for past tobacco use.

He also developed LUTS in the form of straining at urine, poor stream, intermittency, incomplete emptying, and increased daytime frequency for the past 2 months. He also complained of increasing constipation for the past 2 months. There was no history suggestive of neurofibromatosis type 1 or type 2. His general physical examination was unremarkable. Abdominal examination revealed a palpable firm swelling in the suprapubic area of size 10 \u00d7 5 cm. Examination of the perineum showed a firm immobile nontender 12 \u00d7 10 cm lump behind the scrotum with extension towards right gluteal area (). Posteriorly the perineal lump was going up to 2 cm beyond the anal verge. On digital rectal examination (DRE), the lump had occluded majority of the rectal lumen. However, the rectal mucosa was free over the lump. Superior limit of the lump could not be felt on DRE. Prostate was not felt separately from the lump. His investigations revealed normal blood workup, with blood urea 27 mg%, serum creatinine of 0.7 mg%, and serum PSA of 0.940 ng/mL. USG pelvis and abdomen showed 12 \u00d7 10.9 cm heterogenous mass inferior to bladder with internal vascularity with anechoic areas suggestive of necrosis.

He had a 50-year history of smoking and a 10-year history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was diagnosed with pulmonary TB based on positive T-spot and Xpert tests and computed tomography (CT)-scans at a local hospital 1 month ago. He was administered anti-TB treatment for 1month, comprising the empirical therapy using pyrazinamide, isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol. Recent signs were weight loss and severe asthenia.\nTo investigate the patient's pain, a chest CT scan was performed, which revealed significant osteolytic destruction at the bodies of the 5th and 6th thoracic vertebrae and thoracic pedicles, with swelling of the soft tissue (Fig. ). It was suspected that the destruction and the swelling of soft tissue were due to TB with cold abscess, resulting in paraplegia. The chest scan showed tiny, wide spread, and discrete pulmonary opacities with bilateral pleural effusion, and a lump in the lower lobe of the left lung which was suspected to be an inflammatory granuloma. There was 1 thoracic aortic aneurysm (116 mm \u00d7 40 mm) at the aortic arch, 1 saccular pseudoaneurysm (67 mm \u00d7 32 mm) in the descending thoracic aorta, another saccular pseudoaneurysm (69 mm \u00d7 34 mm) in the descending thoracic aorta above celiac trunk, 1 abdominal aortic aneurysm (112 mm \u00d7 33 mm) and 1 right iliac aneurysm (58 mm \u00d7 16 mm) (Fig. ). A diagnosis of multiple tuberculous mycotic aneurysms of the aorta was made. Considering the patient's condition, surgery was not attempted.

His description alluded to a pain that was sharp and intermittent with localization in the right upper quadrant. He could not attribute the intermittent nature of his predicament to any aggravating or relieving influences. The pain was associated with fluctuating low-grade fevers (99\u00b0F-100\u00b0F), anorexia, and an associated 13-pound weight loss, which culminated in a visit to our clinical setup.\nFurther interrogation disclosed that the patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 2003.

The emergency thoracotomy was performed in the standard fashion, with an incision made along the left fifth intercostal space extending across the sternum. After cardiac repair and hemostasis, the incision was closed primarily. At ten days post-operatively, the patient developed a thoracotomy wound infection that cultured positive for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus. Despite appropriate antibiotics, the infection necessitated radical debridement of involved bone (lower part of the sternum and rib), cartilage and soft tissue. Vacuum-assisted closure device (KCI, USA, San Antonio, TX) was placed after each debridement. The wound after two debridements measured approximately 20 \u00d7 8 cm, and extended deep to the pericardium (Figure ). Location of the EDT wound however precluded use of pectoralis major or latissimus dorsi muscle flaps due to the inadequate reach of these flaps. A CT angiography of the internal mammary vasculature was performed to explore the potential use of a superiorly based rectus abdominis muscle flap for the wound reconstruction. However, it revealed interruption of the contrast medium in the internal mammary vasculature at the level of the right seventh rib (Figure ) and left fifth-seventh rib (Figure ). Therefore, a free tissue transfer by using the right-sided rectus abdominis muscle flap was carried out for wound reconstruction.

    "original_text": "A 45-year-old otherwise healthy woman with a diagnosis of spinal cord injury due to falling down the stairs about 13 h ago was admitted to our hospital. She wasn\u2019t on any medication. Based on CT-scan findings her injuries included C5-6 dislocation causing severe cord contusion and compression with the manifestation of motor and sensory loss. The patient underwent neurosurgical intervention in order to fix the cervical dislocation and prevent vertebral compression. After the operation she was admitted to our ICU with BP = 99/45 mmHg and o2 saturation = 100%. On physical exam she has no active bleeding, clear respiratory sounds without distress and her force of left upper limb was 3/5. Her lab data and hemodynamic parameters were presented in . On day 1 of injury the patient developed hypotension (BP = 99/45 mm-Hg) and bradycardia (HR = 50 bpm). We maintained euvolemia based on frequent bedside echocardiography. According to our hospital protocol continuous infusion of methylprednisolone 100 mg/24 h was administered on day 1. Despite adequate hydration she still had bradycardia and hypotension, so dopamine was initiated to optimize blood pressure and heart rate. On day 2, because of continuing bradycardia, aminophylline infusion (10 mg/h) was administered.\nOn day-3after the injury, the patient was successfully weaned off dopamine, and midodrine was started (2.5 mg BD) and the dose was titrated to 5 mg three times a day. And 5 days later, aminophylline drip was discontinued because the patient\u2019s HR was stable on 76 bpm without aminophylline. The patient did not have any further episodes of bradycardia or hypotension, so there was no need to start theophylline instead of aminophylline. Her BP was about 130/70 on midodrine, so we did not discontinue midodrine. No serious adverse effects including arrhythmia or central nervous system side effects were observed during therapy. She also received citalopram for improving her depression, melatonin for insomnia",
