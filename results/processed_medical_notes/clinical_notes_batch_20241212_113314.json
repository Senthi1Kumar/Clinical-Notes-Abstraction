Testing confirmed rupture of membranes; therefore, the patient was started on antibiotics to increase latency and was given betamethasone to hasten fetal lung maturity. An ultrasound at the community hospital showed polyhydramnios and a fetal double bubble sign consistent with duodenal atresia. The mother was transferred to Penn State Milton S Hershey Medical Center for anticipation of preterm delivery in a fetus that would require postnatal surgery.\nAfter transfer, fetal monitoring showed normal fetal heart rate variability with accelerations and occasional decelerations related to contractions. An ultrasound confirmed the double bubble sign and polyhydramnios. Blood was observed in real-time swirling into the amniotic fluid from the umbilical cord (). The patient was taken to the operating room and an emergent cesarean section was performed. The amniotic fluid was grossly bloody. A viable male infant weighing 2295 grams was delivered with Apgar scores of 7 and 8 at one and five minutes, respectively.\nThe umbilical cord overall length was 29.5 cm and there were 13, 0.5- 1 cm exposed segments of the umbilical arteries spiraling along the length of the cord (). A discrete area from which the hemorrhage emanated was not identified. The placental disk was of normal weight and appeared grossly normal. Histopathologic examination of the cord showed absence of Wharton's jelly covering the umbilical artery, extreme attenuation of the media in the portion of the vessel exposed to the amniotic fluid, and degeneration of the overlying amnion (Figures and ).\nThe infant had no stigmata of Down syndrome.

The mother of the patient denied any previous trauma or constitutional symptoms but did endorse foreign travel; they were living in Japan at the time of presentation to our department. The patient was current on all vaccinations.\nThe initial orthopaedic evaluation revealed a well-appearing, healthy child in no acute distress. The gait exam revealed that she refused to weight bear on the left lower extremity. The patient had very mild generalized tenderness in the left midfoot region; otherwise, no other area of tenderness was appreciated upon further examination of the lower extremities. She had full, painless range of motion of her hip, knee, and ankle joints. There was no erythema or swelling of the left foot; however, there was a mild effusion of the ankle. She was neurovascularly intact with normal reflexes.\nShe was afebrile, and vital signs were within normal parameters. Radiographs of the left lower extremity revealed no osseous abnormality (). Laboratory findings revealed a slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 34 mm/hr; otherwise, the white blood cell count (10,200 cells/\u03bcL), differential (45% segmented neutrophils, no bands), and C-reactive protein (<0.05 mg/dL) were normal []. An MRI of her left ankle showed an ankle joint effusion, a 16 mm fluid collection with a high T2 signal with surrounding bone marrow edema, and a low signal on T1 (Figures and ). The findings were consistent with a Brodie abscess with surrounding osteomyelitis and a possible septic ankle.

His systemic therapy was switched to ipilimumab at that time and he received four doses from early March to May of 2013. Due to the fact that the patient remained quite well from a clinical standpoint (Karnofsky = 100) and was completely asymptomatic from his brain metastases, we recommended that the patient undergo stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with the Gamma Knife.

He could not recall any ocular trauma. Empirical topical antibacterial treatment with ceftazidim (3 %) and vancomycin (3 %) was instituted (one eye drop every hour). The reaction to therapy was poor with increasing infiltration and ulcer extension. Corneal scraping grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (susceptible to amikacin, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin) and treatment was changed to amikacin (3 %) and ceftriaxone (3 %) eye drops every 30 min. The first few days the patient experienced a slight improvement but after a week clinical manifestations worsened, so he was referred to the Ophthalmological Institute 'Ram\u00f3n Pando Ferrer' in Havana. At arrival the patient had slight oedema of the upper and lower lids of his left eye, scanty yellow secretions, intense cilium-conjunctival injection and a dense corneal yellowish infiltrate leaving only 1 mm of the peripheral limbo clear. Slit lamp examination showed central extensive epithelial defects with irregular and thick borders involving all corneal layers. There were no satellite lesions or evidence. No defects were observed in the anterior segment and his right eye was normal. Ocular ultrasound examination on 10 March 2010 showed a vitreous cavity without opacities and normal retina. Ten days later a filamentous fungus from corneal scrapings was reported and the patient started treatment with miconazole (1 %) one eye drop every hour, ketoconazole (1 %) one eye drop three times per day, and oral ketoconazole (200 mg daily for 7 days). On 22 March, he underwent penetrating keratoplasty and miconazole was replaced by natamycin (5 %) eye drops every 30 min. Eight days later topical ketoconazole was stopped and empirical oral moxifloxacin (400 mg daily for 7 days) was added. Natamycine was continued",

Bilateral lung metastases were found eight years after nephrectomy, and both lesions were surgically removed, followed by postoperative interferon treatment. However, by 2010 she underwent five lung resections and also one radiofrequency ablation, and the patient achieved long-term response with adjuvant sunitinib. In May 2013, a right ovarian metastasis was detected, which was surgically excised. In July 2013, metastases to the bones (pelvic and lumber vertebrae) and hilar lymph nodes were detected, and she underwent treatment with axitinib followed by sunitinib. In 2016, her mediastinal lymph nodes were treated with EBRT of 60 Gy in 30 fractions at an external institution. In May 2018, liver metastasis was detected, and this lesion was treated with radiofrequency ablation. In September 2018, metastasis in the right ovary led to its surgical excision, followed by nivolumab at the standard dosage (infusions of 240 mg every alternate week) as third-line therapy. Four months after the initiation of nivolumab, computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed the progression of lung, liver and bone metastases and nivolumab monotherapy was further continued for two months. In January and February 2019, she underwent radiofrequency ablation for newly discovered liver metastases. In March 2019, CT imaging demonstrated gradual growth of the left iliac bone metastasis. The Tumor Board at our hospital decided that there was no surgical indication for this lesion.\nThe CT scan acquired prior to her visit to our hospital revealed an iliac crest tumor measuring 9.4 \u00d7 8.8 \u00d7 6.0 cm () and tumor volume measuring 347.5 cm3.

The patient's management was delayed due to the confinement of the COVID-19 pandemic. A physical examination showed a painful mass in the external anal sphincter and extended to the gluteal muscle. The performance status was at 2\u20133.\nPelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an ulcerated anoperineal tumor process in hypo signal on T1-weighted sequences, a hyper signal on T2-weighted sequences, and intensely enhanced after injection of gadolinium. This process is locally extended in gluteal soft tissue with mesorectal nodules, cutaneous nodules of the sacral region, and bone lesions of the left greater trochanter.

Vision at that time was hand motion, and intraocular pressure (IOP) was 44 mmHg through rebound tonometry. After initial treatment with topical steroids, his visual acuity improved from hand motion to 20/60 over the course of 2 months.

No cyclodialysis cleft was initially seen, although he was persistently dilated on cycloplegia for the iritis during initial gonioscopy. In addition, his IOP was noted to be consistently lower than the left eye, with at least a 5 mmHg difference each visit, and ranged between 6 and 11 mmHg. A month after his initial injury, choroidal folds were noted on examination and on optical coherence tomography. Although his IOP at this time was 9 mmHg, the IOP in his left eye was 20 mmHg.\nThree months after his initial injury, he was referred to the retina service for the evaluation. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/60 in the right eye, IOP was 11 mmHg in the right eye, and 20 mmHg in the left eye. Examination of the anterior segment revealed a shallow anterior chamber, and undilated gonioscopy revealed a 5-clock-hours cyclodialysis cleft located temporally.

The patient was referred to our tertiary eye centre for evaluation (Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, UK). Fundoscopic examination revealed healthy optic discs.

The diagnosis of arteriovenous malformation was made, with no evidence of progression or visual consequence reported over seven years of annual evaluation (B). Visual acuity of the patient was 6/24 and 6/6 for the right and left eye respectively, having high hyperopia in the right eye and no refractive error in the left. Right eye vision had not improved significantly after attempted patching in early childhood. Visual acuity remained stable over time. The eyes were normally aligned, and extra-ocular movements were full. Visual fields to confrontation were normal. Intraocular pressure in both the right eye and left eye was 12 mmHg.

She developed gradual symptoms over a 6 month period before her presentation with no antecedent history of trauma and constitutional symptoms. Other siblings and parents were normal.\nPhysical examination revealed a nontender palpable mass at superior border near medial angle of scapula. A grating sensation, both palpable and audible, was produced during active shoulder range of motion. Vertebral border of right scapula was more prominent than left (). The winging of scapula was noticed even at rest which did not increase as the patient did push against the wall. There were no signs of infection or inflammation. A bony mass was felt over the superomedial angle of the right scapula, which was minimally tender and corresponded to the area from where the crepitus arose. The upper extremity and shoulder girdle muscles were neurologically intact. Laboratory investigations were within normal limits.\nRadiographs showed a large bony tumor arising from superior border close to angulus superior scapulae and directed toward the thorax (). Computed tomography scan images revealed a pedunculated bony mass measuring 5.3\u00d73.0\u00d71.5 cm attached to ventral surface of superior border of scapula by a small stalk (-).

He reported an event of some minor chest pressure 2 to 3 weeks prior to admission. On the morning of admission, he developed severe chest pain accompanied by diaphoresis and dyspnea. The patient was taken urgently to the catheterization laboratory. During transport to the laboratory he developed ventricular fibrillation, from which he was successfully resuscitated with a single defibrillation. He then had an angiogram, which demonstrated a 100% thrombotic occlusion of the proximal LAD, without any other significant lesions. A mechanical thrombectomy was performed, followed by balloon angioplasty and a drug-eluting stent implantation, with excellent angiographic results. An intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) performed during the procedure identified a MB 23 mm distal to the point of maximal plaque burden. The MB was greater than 12-mm long, had a systolic compression of 14.3%, and an MB thickness (halo) of 0.41 mm (-). Clinical outcome was good; the patient remained stable during the hospitalization and is asymptomatic since then.\nA 41-year-old man, a visitor from Europe and an athlete, with borderline hyperlipidemia and no other past medical history, had completed the San Francisco Marathon on the morning of the index event. He had vomited twice shortly after the race, and then returned to his hotel. Two hours later, he developed substernal chest pain, lasting approximately 30 minutes, accompanied by shortness of breath. Learning about the possible cause of the symptoms from the World Wide Web, he decided to contact emergency medical services.

The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) was abnormal as shown in Figure . Initial laboratory workups, including electrolytes and cardiac enzymes, were within normal limits. The ECG in Figure demonstrates a narrow QRS complex tachycardia with normal axis. Borderline low voltage QRS complexes along with elevated ST-segments in leads II, III, and aVF are also apparent. The patient's ECG and presentation was concerning for an inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, careful inspection of the ECG will reveal that the rhythm is in fact atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction to the ventricles at a rate of 106 beats per minute, and the flutter waves (tachycardia cycle length 289 ms) are falling on the ST segment of the ECG.

The patient was dispatched to our intensive care unit on the fourth day of admission due to reduced consciousness.\nPatient is the first child of a family and is resident of the village. He had a history of pneumonia at 6 months of age. There was a history of seizure of fever in his family. From the outset, he was treated with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, phenytoin, and acyclovir. The growth and development were normal.\nThe patient had tachypnea and tachycardia, and fever was 39\u00b0C. Percent oxygen saturation without getting oxygen was 98%. It was toxic and had GCS = 8. The patient had a mild tenderness on the right side of the abdomen with a predominance in the RLQ (right lower quadrant). The rectal examination was normal. The amount of urine output was normal. Patients were treated with liquid therapy, and intravenous antibiotics were changed to moropenem and vancomycin. Patient tests: serum electrolytes (sodium and potassium), blood gas analysis, coagulation tests, liver and kidney function tests, vidal test and Albumin were normal.\nSome of the patient's laboratory results were as follows:\nIn addition, he had hypocalcemia and Hypomagnesemia and were treated with sepsis as a common symptom.

She had no significant medical issues and was not taking any medication. Blood tests before the operation were in the normal range, and no abnormalities except for idiopathic scoliosis were found on the simple chest X-ray. X-rays on the vertebrae revealed severe scoliosis from the fifth thoracic vertebra to the first lumbar vertebra. Prior to anesthesia, atropine 0.3 mg was administrated. Before anesthesia, the pulse oximetry was 100% and the blood pressure was 120/79. The induction of anesthesia included administration of propofol 50 mg and succinylcholine 40 mg, followed by a catheterization. The anesthesia was maintained with N2O 2 L/min, O2 2 L/min, desflurane 5%, atracurium 15 mg. To check collateral circulation in the left hand before the induction of anesthesia, Allen's test was performed, and by inserting a 22 G catheter into the left radial artery, arterial pressure was measured. When a monitoring catheter was inserted into the right internal jugular vein, the central venous pressure was 10 mmHg.\nFor the surgery, the patient was turned from a supine position to a prone position, and then her shoulder joints were abducted at 120\u00b0 and the elbow joints were flexed at 70\u00b0 while the neck was maintained in neutral position.\nAfter the transition in position, the blood pressure indicated 100/60 mmHg and the central venous pressure was 10 mmHg, showing no change.

He was planned for right-sided PCNL. Preoperative anesthetic evaluation did not reveal abnormal findings except for high total leucocyte count during routine urine examination which was normalized after 5-day course of inj. amikacin. There was no significant medical, surgical, family, and psychosocial history.\nIn the operation theater, anesthesia was induced with propofol and trachea was intubated with size 7.5 mm ID flexometallic endotracheal cuffed tube using vecuronium 7 mg as muscle relaxant. Maintenance was done by isoflurane, oxygen, and intermittent vecuronium top-ups. The initial intrathoracic pressure was 19 cm of H2O. Patient was kept on volume control mode with initial tidal volume of 8 ml/kg. Over the period of surgery of 2 h, a gradual increase in intrathoracic pressure from 19 cm of H2O to 30 cm of H2O was noted. It was ascertained intraoperatively that there was no pneumothorax by auscultation of chest and confirming the presence of breath sounds antero-posteriorly.

Intraoral examination revealed a bony hard swelling extending from the left mandibular second premolar till retromolar area. Obliteration of buccal and lingual vestibule was noted. The mucosa overlying the lesion appeared normal. The patient had undergone extraction of mandibular first molar of the same side earlier.\nThe radiographic examination revealed a multilocular radiolucency involving left mandibular region [Figure and ]. The lesion extended from the second premolar and posteriorly it involved the coronoid and the condylar processes. The expansion of buccal and lingual plate of the mandible was evident on occlusal radiographic images. Differential diagnoses of ameloblastoma and keratocystic odontogenic tumor were considered. Incisional biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of follicular ameloblastoma. Based on the histopathological diagnosis, segmental block resection was carried out with the surgical margin 1 cm away from the radiographic boundary of the lesion. The excised specimen was sent for histopathological diagnosis. No evidence of recurrence was noted after 1 year of resection.\nThe gross specimen showed expansion of buccal and lingual plates of mandible and bone erosion in the retromolar area. On grossing, a large cystic lesion was noted involving body and ramus of mandible. Microscopic examination of the excised tissue specimen revealed follicles of ameloblastoma of varying sizes []. The stroma was mature, collagenous and it demonstrated foreign body granulomas with numerous multinucleated giant cells [Figure and ].

She was diagnosed with OCD and treated with various SSRIs, including escitalopram, fluoxetine, and clomipramine in adequate doses for adequate duration. However, she showed limited improvement with these drugs. In year 2008, she was started on paroxetine and dose increased to 75 mg over 2 months and showed significant improvement in her symptom. But over these 2 months, she started experiencing discomfort and engorgement in her breasts. This continued for 2-3 weeks and then she noticed whitish milky discharge from both nipples. Patient was extensively evaluated for the galactorrhea, and her serum prolactin levels were found to be raised (89 ng/ml) and the rest of her investigations (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] brain, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate) were found to be within normal limits. She had not been using any other drug during this period, so the possibility of increased prolactin due to other drugs was ruled out. Local breast examination by the gynecologist did not reveal any pathology. Thereafter, she was lost to follow up and she discontinued paroxetine due to galactorrhea. The discharge stopped over next 7-10 days.

Initial clinical examination of the lower extremities at 13:00 showed intact skin and significant right proximal leg deformity associated with swelling and tenderness with a VAS of 3-4/10. Vascular evaluation of distal pulses revealed that the posterior tibial artery pulse was not palpable. The capillary perfusion was less than 2 seconds. The foot was sensate. Initial assessment also revealed swollen but soft compartments; however, the passive stretch test was negative and did not indicate an ACS. Radiographs showed a severely comminuted tibial plateau fracture (Figure ). Realignment of the tibial plateau fracture was performed under procedural sedation and an above-knee backslab was applied, followed by reassessment of distal pulses, which showed Doppler-able but weak pulses of the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries (Figure ). Due to the severity of the injury, its natural association with vascular injuries, and the inability to palpate the posterior tibial artery pulses on initial assessment, computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed, which revealed attenuation of the popliteal artery with patent superficial femoral and anterior and posterior tibial arteries (Figure ). The findings were communicated and thoroughly discussed with the on-call vascular surgeon. He concluded that attenuation was not an injury but a compression caused by the posterior tibial plateau and required only serial distal neurovascular assessment.

It was associated with shortness of breath on exertion and cough that was productive with yellowish sputum. During that admission, he underwent a CT scan of the chest that showed a 8 cm lobulated mass in right lower lobe with right hilar nodes. He underwent bronchoscopy with mediastinoscopy due to the concern for malignancy. There were no endobronchial lesions seen per the report and pathology showed squamous metaplasia with ulceration. He left against medical advice (LMA) prior to completion of further workup.\nThe patient was seen in our emergency room in May 2015 with a cough with blood-tinged sputum that has gotten worse since his previous admission. He also endorsed 10-pound weight loss and poor appetite. He denied any fever, chills, foul smelling sputum, or recent travel outside the country. He was currently unemployed and smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for last five years. There was no significant family history.\nInformed patient consent was obtained for his treatment. The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and underwent a CT scan of the chest that showed an irregular mass-like consolidation measuring 9.5 x 5.0 cm in the right lower lobe with adenopathy and right lower lobe bronchiectasis (Figures -).

On examination, she did have chronic dyspnea and was on home oxygen. She did not have any cyanosis, palpitations, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea.\nShe was initially evaluated with a nuclear stress test that did not show any reversible ischemia but dilation of the right ventricle (RV); ejection fraction was identified to be 54%. The patient was further evaluated by a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) in order to evaluate the RV dilatation. TTE identified a complete absence of IAS and a CA (). The findings were confirmed with a positive bubble study (). Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed that confirmed the absence of IAS, demonstrated free mixing of color flow, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, normal mitral valve structure, normal left ventricular ejection fraction, and enlarged right atrium (RA) and RV.\nThe patient was evaluated with cardiac computed tomography angiogram (CCTA) that demonstrated the right coronary artery to be the dominant artery, all coronary arteries to be ectatic/aneurysmal and measuring up to 8-10 mm, a complete absence of IAS, marked dilation of CA and both ventricles, a coronary arteriovenous fistula (CAF) between the distal left anterior descending and coronary sinus, massive dilation of pulmonary arteries, and no mitral or aortic valvular abnormalities; left ventricular ejection fraction was measured to be 59% (Figures \u2013).\nThe patient underwent an invasive angiography (IA) which demonstrated many abnormal findings.
