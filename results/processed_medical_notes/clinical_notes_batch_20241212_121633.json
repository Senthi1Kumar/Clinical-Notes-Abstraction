    "original_text": "A 56-year-old man was admitted to a local hospital for transient (10 min) left limb numbness when he rested on the sofa. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed that the right ICA was occluded from its origin to the intracranial segment. The patient reported taking aspirin, clopidogrel and atorvastatin, and was referred to the authors' center 2 weeks later. Physical examination revealed no obvious positive findings. Although a 2-month history of diabetes was recorded, there was no history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or smoking.\nThe initial CDFI was performed on day 1 of hospitalization, which revealed a patent right ICA with normal blood flow velocity (). However, CTA on day 2 indicated that the right ICA was occluded (). A repeat CDFI scan on day 4 of hospitalization revealed a hypoechoic mass [thickness 2.8 mm (suspected thrombus)] was attached to the anterior wall of the initial segment of the right ICA (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on day 6; T1-weighted imaging showed that the intracranial segment of the right ICA was invisible, indicating that the right ICA was occluded (). However, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) performed on the same day revealed that the right ICA was normal, with no significant stenosis in any segment ().\nCDFI findings were consistent with those of DSA, but nevertheless inconsistent with CTA and MRI. It was not advisable for clinicians to make a definitive diagnosis pertaining to the vascular lesions of the patient.

On several occasions, she had visited her general practitioner due to abdominal pain, but no abnormalities had been noted. The pain recurred with greater severity, and abdominal ultrasound performed by her general practitioner revealed a cystic lesion in the right lower abdominal cavity. An abdominal abscess was suspected thus she was referred to a tertiary hospital.\nOn admission, the vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 125/81 mmHg; pulse, 166 beats per minute; and temperature; 36.5 \u00b0C. On palpation, rebound tenderness was noted on the right iliac fossa. On laboratory investigation, the white blood cell count was 17,400/\u03bcL and the C-reactive protein level was 1.54 mg/dl. There was an elevation in the serum pancreatic amylase and lipase level (124 U/L, 114 U/L respectively). Contrast enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) (Fig. ) revealed a cystic lesion measuring 6 \u00d7 5 cm with an enhancing thick wall in the ileal mesentery. The cystic lesion was tubular in shape and inflammation was suspected as the density of the adjacent fat was increased. A small enhancing nodule in the cyst wall was also noted. Retrospectively, a distinct blood vessel coursing on the dorsal side into the lesion was identified (Fig. ). The pancreas appeared within normal limits. The appendix was slightly enlarged and a diagnosis of appendicitis was equivocal.\nAn abscess in the mesentery was suspected, and the patient was put on nil by mouth and treated with antibiotics. There were significant improvements in the symptoms and the laboratory data on the second week and she was discharged on the fifth week.

The patient also suffered from a headache that resolved by Day 6; however, her tinnitus had persisted. She described the tinnitus as severe and had caused great emotional distress. In addition, she reported subjective minor hearing losses in both ears, which were not fluctuating. There were no visual or balance problems \u2013 no vertigo, dizziness, ear fullness or migraines. Cranial nerve and otoscopic examinations were both normal. Audiogram revealed a normal hearing in the right ear and a low-frequency mild sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear (). Tympanograms were normal.\nShe had been involved in an early Alzheimer\u2019s randomised controlled trial for the last 3 years and had been getting a trial medication or placebo every 3 months. She was otherwise well and not on any other medications. As part of the trial, she was required to have a lumbar puncture yearly. She reported no long-lasting neurological sequela after the previous two lumbar punctures, usually only reporting mild headache that would eventually subside. However, this time, she presented with refractory bilateral tinnitus persisting for 6 days.\nIn view of her ongoing symptoms, a decision was made to perform a blood patch. The patient had not received any medical therapy prior to this. For the procedure, 20 mL of venous blood was extracted from the patient\u2019s right antecubital fossa and 18 mL of blood were injected into the epidural space with a 16G epidural needle. She reported immediate resolution of the tinnitus in her right ear, and by 24 h, the tinnitus in her left ear had also resolved.

She gave history of significant reduction of vision in both of her eyes before 7 years for which she visited an ophthalmologist. At that time, optic neuritis was considered, and she was given systemic prednisolone for about 2 months after which her vision improved, but the patient was lost from follow-up. Four months ago, she developed complete loss of vision of both eyes for which she visited SPHMMC ophthalmology department when recurrent optic neuritis was again considered and restarted on systemic prednisolone. With subsequent follow-ups, her vision and oculomotor palsy in her left eye improved after 2 months of prednisolone therapy. Seven weeks later, she experienced right lower limb weakness followed by left lower limb weakness within 1 day and became bedridden. She also experienced radicular back pain, urinary retention, and constipation. She had no upper limb paresthesia or weakness. She had history of hypertension of 18 years and dyslipidemia of 1-year duration. For these, she was taking amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, alpha-methyldopa, and atorvastatin regularly. She had no history of joint pain or skin rash. She had no history of gastrointestinal surgery or chronic diarrhea. She reported no history of recent vaccinations or diabetes mellitus. She used to work as a janitor for a wine factory until 7 years ago when she lost her job because of her vision. She has two children (one male and one female).\nShe was conscious and alert.

He had fallen from a tree 2 months earlier and had no bleeding fraction and an unremarkable shoulder X-ray. He experienced mild pain in his right shoulder and neck after the trauma, which was relieved through medication, and was sent home.\nA physical examination displayed a good physique and a normal body mass index. There was no visible or palpable stepoff in the spine, and no tenderness was observed around the area of fracture. A detailed neurological examination revealed that his upper limbs were normal, power was 5/5 according to the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, and all sensations were intact, whereas his lower limbs demonstrated decreased bulk and tone. The power in both of his lower limbs was 4/5 according to the MRC scale, and his left leg showed exaggerated deep tendon reflexes. His left leg exhibited withdrawal on eliciting plantar reflex, whereas his right leg was mute. Superficial abdominal reflexes were absent. In a sensory examination, our patient had diminished vibration sensation in both lower limbs up to his umbilicus. Below his umbilicus, increased pin prick (superficial pain) sensation and hypersensitivity to cold were detected. The results of the rest of the sensory examination were unremarkable.

The patient was of Druze descent, born to consanguineous parents (parents were double first-degree cousins). Family history was significant for two brothers who died of gastric cancer at the ages of 17 and 27 years, a sister who died of leukemia at 13 years of age, and an older brother with celiac disease.\nThe patient initially presented at the age of 15 years with recurrent diarrhea and was diagnosed with celiac disease based on a positive anti-tissue transglutaminase and histologic findings on duodenal biopsies.

His intracranial abscess was surgically drained as part of a hemicraniectomy procedure. Cultures of his intracranial abscess grew Streptococcus intermedius, and he was treated with antibiotics for 2 months. His craniectomy plate was reimplanted in June 2018.

One week postoperatively, he reported increasing pain along the incision while being treated with ceftazidime. There were fluctuance and profound tenderness to palpation along the incision site (), and a new thick purulent discharge was expressible from the wound. There were a few patchy areas of alopecia along the wound edges, which at the time were attributed to preoperative shaving, frequent wound cleaning, and removal of dressings and tape.

Due to concerns for nerve damage, it was recommended that she was walked every four hours postoperatively and the side on which she was lying was changed frequently to avoid pressure sores.\nThe patient was unable to be walked frequently on the night following surgery as she was unwilling to rise, and there was an insufficient labor force to lift her. The following morning, the patient was reluctant to walk and had mild knuckling of the left hind limb. Two days after presentation, the patient was noted to have sores on both elbows and a wound on the left hind foot. Her paresis progressed, and she was unable to walk without assistance. Proprioception was absent in both hind limbs. A neurologic examination found ambulatory to nonambulatory tetraparesis with severe knuckling of the left hind limb. Hopping was mildly delayed in the left forelimb and severely delayed to absent in the hind limbs. Withdrawal reflex was decreased in the left hind leg, but patellar reflexes, cutaneous trunci, and perineal reflexes were all within normal limits. Palpation revealed mild caudal lumbar pain. Deficits were localized to the left sciatic nerve and C1 to C5 segments of the spinal cord. The top differential was cervical spondylomyelopathy that was exacerbated due to positioning under anesthesia; however, the asymmetry of the lesions is an atypical presentation of the condition.

Sonographic examination revealed polyhydramnios with a maximum vertical pocket (MVP) of 12 cm in the recipient fetus\u2019s sac and another stuck twin fetus showing an absence of end-diastolic velocity of umbilical artery (UA) Doppler flow and thus a stage III TTTS was diagnosed. After consultation with the family about treatment options including amnioreduction and laser therapy, the patient chose to receive fetoscope-guided laser therapy. Under local anesthesia and following procedures as previously described [], ten intertwin anastomoses (six donor artery to recipient vein anastomoses and four recipient vein to donor artery anastomoses) were coagulated with 10 ~ 15 W Diode laser power with Solomen technique. The postoperative course was uncomplicated and the UA Doppler returned to normal in donor twin after the surgery.\nTen days after the laser surgery, high-level ultrasound was done at the previous hospital that referred the case. Both fetuses had their amniotic fluid returning to normal, but incidentally they found both eyeballs of the donor twin were opaque, while the recipient\u2019s were clear. (Fig. ) Therefore, discordant congenital cataract was suspected in the donor twin. At the gestational age of 23 weeks, fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was arranged to evaluate the central nervous system for both fetuses and to rule out if the donor twin had other associated anomalies; no additional information was gathered about the donor twin. At the gestational age of 27 weeks, sonography still revealed opacity over donor twin eyeballs.

(fig. ) therefore, discordant congenital cataract was suspected in the donor twin. at the gestational age of 23 weeks, fetal magnetic resonance imaging (mri) was arranged to evaluate the central nervous system for both fetuses and to rule out if the donor twin had other associated anomalies; no additional information was gathered about the donor twin. at the gestational age of 27 weeks, sonography still revealed opacity over donor twin eyeballs.

    "original_text": "Patient 3 is a 22-year-old female who was diagnosed with FXS at 9 years of age with a full mutation of >200 CGG repeats. She met all of her early milestones appropriately, but at around 3 to 4 years of age, she developed quite significant anxiety and panic attacks. There was mild benefit associated with initiation of psychological therapies, although her mother described difficulties with new settings, social anxiety, frequent negative perseverative thoughts, and ongoing panic attacks that would vary in frequency depending on her routine and social supports.\nStarting in the fourth grade, she had mild academic challenges that were supported with a 504 educational plan through the end of high school. Ongoing anxiety was present and trials of St. John's Wort and other supplements were minimally helpful. She did not receive any other medication treatment. She graduated from college with academic supports, with continued periods of significant anxiety symptoms, social withdrawal, and panic attacks. After college, she began work as an educational aide in a public school, with an exacerbation of anxiety due to this transition into adulthood and pressures of increased independence.\nAt 22 years of age, her parents provided her with a liquid formulation of hemp oil containing \u223c43 mg of CBD daily (Charlotte's Web\u2122 Everyday Advanced; CWB Holdings, Inc., Denver, CO), which she began taking. She described feeling calmer, with fewer perseverative worries, and a cessation of panic attacks. This led to more interactions and activities with peers and improved performance at work.

The saphenous vein harvest using the VASOVIEW HEMOPRO 2 Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting System (Maquet) started concurrently with sternal incision. The EVH procedure was challenging and insufflation pressure initially 12 mmHg was increased to 14 mmHg while an accumulating amount of blood could be seen in the saphenous vein tunnel.

On admission, his blood pressure was 135/85 mmHg and heart rate was 66 beats/min; and neurological examination revealed nystagmus on horizontal gaze. His pupillary reflexes and extraocular movements were intact, no limb weakness and sensory deficits were found; and bilateral finger--to-nose and heel-to-shin tests were normal.

However, Romberg sign was impossible to evaluate as the patient could not be able to cooperate with further examination.\nSimilarly, laboratory tests were within normal limits. Brain MRI performed 10 h after admission demonstrated two areas of restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the left hemisphere (Fig. b). However, no acute infarction was seen in the posterior cerebral artery territories. Considering the location of infarction area could not well explain his clinical symptoms, a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was done which revealed that the left ICA was occluded (Fig. a). Meanwhile, it showed that the left middle cerebral artery and bilateral anterior cerebral artery were supplied by the basilar artery via a PTA (Fig. b + c). Based on that we presumed that in the setting of acute left ICA occlusion, a cerebral blood flow steal phenomena occurred from posterior circulation to anterior circulation which caused the patient to have acute onset of dizziness and difficulty in walking. We also speculated that the PTA may play a protective role in preventing the patient from having severe anterior circulation ischemic stroke. Furthermore, CT perfusion showed no remarkable difference between the two hemispheres (Fig. a), which was consistent with the above conclusion. Therefore, the patient was given 100 mg",

Final pathologic diagnosis revealed a high-risk GIST according to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) criteria (). The patient was not treated with adjuvant treatment after surgery in the local hospital because he had difficulty paying for adjuvant imatinib therapy.

Disease progression occurred after the continuation of imatinib for 54 months. The patient was then treated with cytoreductive surgery combined with imatinib and showed a PFS of 7 months. New biopsy of an abdominal metastasis yielded a KIT mutation in exon 11 as well as in KIT exon 13 (V654A), confirming the clinical observation of secondary imatinib resistance (). In May 2017, this patient received second-line sunitinib. After 11 months of treatment, sunitinib was discontinued due to disease progression.

He described his pain as a constant severe burning sensation with intermittent intensive lancinating (sharp) pain in the distribution of all three branches of the trigeminal nerve. This paroxysmal pain could be provoked by a light touch of the skin surface, chewing, and toothbrushing. This burning facial pain with short lasting episode of eyelid ptosis on the right side started in 2014 and later he also started experiencing severe paroxysmal pain that did not respond to oral carbamazepine but improved with pregabalin (75 mg). Over the years, the pain worsened and the medication dose had to be increased. In 2016, a Gamma Knife radiosurgery (90 Gy) was performed in another institution, targeting the right trigeminal nerve root, but no pain improvement was observed during subsequent 15 months. By that time, the patient was taking pregabalin (600 mg) with partial control of the pain. He suffered minor side effects but other anticonvulsants failed to produce any significant pain reduction. His had no history of any head or neck injuries, sinus or dental surgery, cancer, or any facial pain in his family. Neurological examination was normal except for allodynia, dysesthesia, and hyperpathia in the area of pain combined with symmetric slight increase in deep tendon reflexes.

    "original_text": "We report a case of a 57 year old man who was surgically treated for pancreatic gastrinoma and multiple gastric ulcers at the age of 32. Several years later he developed hypercalcemia and elevated parathyroid hormone levels which yielded further endocrine work-up. Early and late images of a pre-operative sestamibi scan showed multiple areas of increased tracer accumulation which consequently resulted in the extirpation of all four parathyroid glands and right thyroid lobectomy. The following pathohistological finding showed parathyroid hyperplasia of all four glands. Aforementioned medical data posed a high clinical suspicion of MEN1 syndrome but thereupon the patient lacked interest in genetic testing since he had no children. His parents and close relatives were generally healthy without apparent health issues such as endocrinopathies or tumors. During the routine follow-up at the age of 45, the patient was diagnosed with pulmonary neoplasia. Total excision was performed and the pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor (NET) grade 2 was established without any evidence of residual disease. A year later, a positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography scan showed an increased tracer uptake in the right thoracic paravertebral area. A successful tumor resection by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was conducted leading to schwannoma diagnosis. Later follow-up did not reveal any residual disease, but the patient continued medical check-up due to painless skin lumps on the limbs, torso and face. Multiple local operations revealed skin fibromas, lipomas and basocellular carcinoma of the face. However, at the age of 50, he underwent a surgical excision which showed a low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (Fig. ). Over the next 4 years, the patient had multiple operations due to sarcoma recurrence at different sites. Furthermore, he was evaluated for mediastinal lymphadenopathy and diagnosed with NET metastasis (grade 2, Ki-67 18%).

When the battery depleted, she underwent a second procedure under general anesthetic to change the ICD generator (VVI ICD; Medtronic Evera DR pulse generator). This procedure was performed in a different hospital. During the second procedure the initial subpectoral pocket was found to have been placed rather superior and lateral, requiring the formation of an entirely new pocket.

The patient stated that he had stopped taking imatinib in September 2015 due to family issues and stressors. When he presented in December 2015, he had no specific complaints. He was noted to have mild pallor on exam, but no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Labs were significant for leukocytosis and blasts noted on peripheral smear. BCR-ABL FISH/PCR was also positive indicating relapse of CML and the transcripts at the time of diagnosis were typical. His peripheral smear showed only rare blasts (< 10 %) and the patient appeared to be in the chronic phase of CML. A bone marrow biopsy was not repeated at this time.\nThe patient was re-initiated on treatment with imatinib 400mg daily. Within 2 weeks of resuming treatment he was noted to have an improvement in WBC count. However, he was incidentally detected to have an elevated total protein level. In view of this serum protein, electrophoresis was ordered and the patient was found to have an IgG kappa monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). This diagnosis was established because the total M protein spike was <3g/dL, bone marrow biopsy showed < 10% plasma cells and the patient had no evidence of end organ damage. Skeletal survey was done which showed no lytic lesions. Imatinib was continued for CML and he was monitored closely for progression of plasma cell dyscrasia.\nWith regard to the patient\u2019s CML, he achieved molecular remission in November 2016 with 3 log reduction in the 3 tested transcripts b2a2, b3a2, e1a2 and without detectable Philadelphia chromosome.

After the cessation of clioquinol administration, her numbness gradually subsided. At 19 years of age, she was again prescribed clioquinol for 1 year, and numbness and weakness in the lower limbs as well as visual disturbances appeared. The numbness spread to the trunk, and she developed a gait disturbance. The numbness was associated with peculiar symptoms such as feeling of tingling ache, of tight ankles, and something adhering to the sole of her foot. The symptoms gradually worsened after age 40 years. She had refused to take any medications because of a fear of side effects. She visited our hospital at 69 years of age.\nNeurological examination at admission revealed that she was alert and well oriented. She was completely blind and could not count fingers, but the other cranial nerves were intact. She had pronounced dysbasia and could not stand alone. Moderate weakness was diffusely present bilaterally in the lower extremities. Muscle atrophy was not evident on inspection. Her grip strength measurements were 16 and 18 kg for the right and left sides, respectively. A sensory deficit was noted and accentuated distally in both lower extremities. Light touch and pain sensations were moderately impaired, and vibration and joint sensations were remarkably reduced in the distal portions of the lower limbs.

    "original_text": "A 66-year-old woman with esophageal cancer underwent transthoracic esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection via a muscle-sparing thoracotomy as previously reported [], with gastric conduit reconstruction and an intrathoracic anastomosis. A high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was administered postoperatively due to the patient\u2019s history of gastric ulcers; she discontinued the medication of her own volition. Three years after surgery, she was admitted to a local hospital for mediastinitis due to a perforated gastric ulcer in the conduit (Fig. ). She was treated with antibiotics and fasting. Seventeen days later, she had hematemesis and was diagnosed with a gastro-aortic fistula due to a gastric ulcer (Fig. ). She was transferred to a nearby university hospital with shock status and underwent endovascular aortic repair urgently, using two GORE\u00ae TAG\u00ae devices (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ). Two days later, total resection of the gastric tube was performed via a right posterolateral thoracotomy. There was an abscess cavity between the gastric tube and the descending aorta which consisted of necrotic tissue and old blood. A 2-cm wall defect was found on the right wall of the middle of gastric tube. The clot-filled gastric tube was resected. The perforation of the descending aorta was left. During this operation, a tracheal injury occurred while the remnant esophagus was being separated from the trachea; this injury was subsequently repaired by patching the stump of the esophagus to the injury site. Tracheostomy and a feeding jejunostomy were also performed. The operative time was 8 h and 40 min, and the blood loss was 2380 ml.

The lens was fixated by the first surgeon using intraocular forceps used in vitreous surgery in the right hand and a Sinskey hook to maintain optic capture with the left hand. The second surgeon performed iris suture fixation superiorly and inferiorly. The inferior suture led to lens tilt that was not relieved by gentle iris massage around the suture and thereafter that suture was removed. Surgery was done at night and lasted 75 minutes.

    "original_text": "A 5-year-old girl with no past medical or surgical history had complained of waxing and waning pain around the umbilicus for a few years. On several occasions, she had visited her general practitioner due to abdominal pain, but no abnormalities had been noted. The pain recurred with greater severity, and abdominal ultrasound performed by her general practitioner revealed a cystic lesion in the right lower abdominal cavity. An abdominal abscess was suspected thus she was referred to a tertiary hospital.\nOn admission, the vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 125/81 mmHg; pulse, 166 beats per minute; and temperature; 36.5 \u00b0C. On palpation, rebound tenderness was noted on the right iliac fossa. On laboratory investigation, the white blood cell count was 17,400/\u03bcL and the C-reactive protein level was 1.54 mg/dl. There was an elevation in the serum pancreatic amylase and lipase level (124 U/L, 114 U/L respectively). Contrast enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) (Fig. ) revealed a cystic lesion measuring 6 \u00d7 5 cm with an enhancing thick wall in the ileal mesentery. The cystic lesion was tubular in shape and inflammation was suspected as the density of the adjacent fat was increased. A small enhancing nodule in the cyst wall was also noted. Retrospectively, a distinct blood vessel coursing on the dorsal side into the lesion was identified (Fig. ). The pancreas appeared within normal limits.

After 6 months, the patient initially noticed clawing of his left great toe when he climbed stairs barefoot.

With the ankle held in dorsiflexion, it was not possible for the patient to actively or passively fully extend any of the toes (Figs. and ). The diagnosis of checkrein deformity of the left great toe was made and attributed to the previous fracture of the distal tibia resulting in scarring or ischemic injury to the toe flexors.

There was no prior treatment provided. Her past medical history includes surgical excision of left breast fibro-adenoma, recurrent upper urinary tract infection, stress urinary incontinence and infective colitis. She was on active follow up with the Otolaryngology department for hoarseness of voice. She was a non-smoker and non-drinker. There was no known history of any genetic disorder. The patient denied any history of trauma or infection to the jaw area. There were no other family members with a history of temporomandibular joint or jaw swelling.\nOn examination, a localized swelling was palpable over the right pre-auricular region which measured 15 mm by 20 mm. It was tender upon palpation and had a bony hard texture. The swelling appeared distinct from the TMJ capsule as it did not move when the right mandibular condyle translated anteriorly during mouth opening. On maximal mouth opening, the condylar translation at both TMJs was similar. The maximal mouth opening was normal. The overlying skin was normal in consistency and was not fixed to the swelling.\nA series of lab tests were ordered, including liver function test, renal function test and complete blood count. All results were being found to be within normal ranges. A dental panoramic tomogram (DPT) was taken (Fig. ), but no distinct lesion could be observed at the right TMJ. Unenhanced computed tomography (CT) was taken subsequently (Fig. a-b).
