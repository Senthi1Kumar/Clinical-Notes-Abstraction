The subject received chemotherapy (Zytiga and Lupron) and hormonal treatment, but represented a refractory pattern after multiple chemo failures, with PSA levels rising above 200 ng/mL. The patient had previously been diagnosed with Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) in 1996 and had undergone nephrectomy of the right kidney. With a history of recurrences, he decided to opt for active immunotherapy. PET CT scan prior to the immunotherapy revealed multiple intensely PSMA avid lesions noted in both lobes of the prostate gland with SUVmax \u221228.3 and the prostate gland measuring 3.2 \u00d7 3.2 cm displaying maximum dimensions representing primary mitotic lesions and furthermore showing few mildly avid sub-centrimetric para aortic, aortocaval, and bilateral external iliac lymph nodes. Post-administration of Dendritic Cell Immunotherapy APCEDEN (6 doses between March 2017 and June 2017), remission of the carcinoma was observed as indicated by the significant decline in the PSMA avidity by 50% reduction in SUV max dwindling to 14.0 regaining the normal size and shape of the prostate gland with no obvious focal lesions, consistent with primary disease and likewise no significant PSMA uptake in the iliac and pelvic lymph nodes (Fig. ). Six months post completion of APCEDEN, the patient was administered 6 booster shots of APCEDEN, once monthly from January 2018 until June 2018. PET CT scan in July 2018 revealed the Prostate to be normal in size and no other PSMA expressing lesions were noted elsewhere to suggest a metastatic disease.\nThe progressive remission of the carcinoma was seen in concordance with the blood PSA and Testosterone levels. The biochemical analysis was done over a period of nine months starting July 2017, indicated a stability and reduction in PSA levels with the lowest of 0.4 ng/mL",

In examination of the respiratory system, there were no breath sounds in the right middle and lower zones. Abdominal distension, umbilical hernia, and edema of the lower limbs were present. She had multinodular goitre. In her medical history, there was a lung pathology for which surgery was recommended three years ago. Laboratory findings were CRP: 243 mg/L; pulmonary function tests: restrictive pulmonary dysfunction; arterial blood gas analyses: respiratory acidosis and hypercarbia; thyroid function tests: euthyroid. Opacity was seen in the right hemithorax extending from the anterior branch of the 2th rib to the diaphragm in radiological studies. Thorax CT showed a giant mass that almost completely filled the right hemithorax, right pleural effusion, and right lung atelectasis. A 20 cm diameter mass that filled the whole right hemithorax extending from the upper mediastinum to the left of the midline was seen in thoracic magnetic resonance imaging. Right hilus and heart were pushed to the the left, and there was no evidence of mediastinal invasion.

We replaced the anticoagulant drugs to intravenous heparin 7 days before his operation followed by a thoracoscopic right upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. The operation took 385 min because of intrathoracic adhesions and infiltrating hilar lymph nodes.

The pathologic staging was pT2aN0M0 stage IB. He progressed well after surgery, and the chest tube was removed on postoperative day (POD) 5. Regarding the administration of anticoagulant, we restarted the administration of intravenous heparin on POD 1 and switched it to apixaban on POD 5 (after removal of the chest tube). The chest X-ray on POD 11 showed a small pleural space with effusion on the apex of the thoracic cavity.

She denied any ocular or abdominal symptoms during the episodes.\nThe symptoms first started when she was 5 to 6 years of age with attacks of fever and myalgia. Her symptoms occurred throughout the winter months and were often related to outdoor activities (sledding). The episodes have since occurred 3 to 4 times per year and have been increasing in frequency and severity in the last 5 years.

Labs upon initial evaluation were unremarkable, and radiologist review of CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was notable for a nonvisualized appendix without concerning signs for obstruction or internal hernia. Transvaginal ultrasound was unremarkable. It was felt that the patient's thin nature made CT diagnosis of appendicitis difficult. Due to the patient's extreme tenderness on physical exam, she was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic appendectomy with corresponding periumbilical, suprapubic, and left lateral quadrant port placements. During subsequent evaluation, the appendix was noted to be normal in nature without signs of inflammation. The appendix was taken in typical fashion, and the remainder of the bowel was evaluated for possible underlying pathology. Upon evaluation near the ligament of Treitz, 2 loops of small bowel were noted near the fourth portion of the duodenum entering what appeared to be a defect left lateral to the duodenum with one loop of bowel exiting and one entering. 40 cm of injected and dilated small bowel was manually reduced from the left-sided paraduodenal hernia defect. A fourth trocar was placed in the right supraumbilical region to provide greater retraction. However, due to poor initial port placement as a result of planned laparoscopic appendectomy, inability to progress, and lack of experience with PDH disease process, the repair of the paraduodenal hernia defect was not performed during that procedure.\nThe patient was discharged 24 hours later with plans for outpatient evaluation and repair; however, she returned approximately 72 hours later with similar complaints of abdominal bloating, nausea emesis, and persistent right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness.

    "original_text": "A 31-year-old nulliparous woman presented a bichorial biamniotic twin pregnancy, accomplished by artificial insemination due to primary sterility problems. The patient had no outstanding medical or surgical background. The fetal morphology ultrasound scan, performed at 20-week gestation, showed that both fetuses were apparently normal. Pregnancy developed normally until 23 weeks of gestation. An ultrasound scan showed supradiaphragmatic avascular cystic formation in the right hemithorax of the first fetus of 34 \u00d7 26 mm, suggesting a type I cystic adenomatoid malformation (CAM). Serial ultrasounds were performed by the maternal-fetal medicine service every two weeks, starting at 23 weeks, 3 days of gestation. As part of the diagnostic imaging protocol, fetal magnetic resonance (MR) was performed at 23 + 5 weeks of gestation. Sagital, coronal and axial fetal MR revealed a lesion with several cysts (hyperintensive at T2) occupying a space in the right inferior lobe. A more caudal cyst was noted, measuring 25 \u00d7 20 mm, with a second cranial cyst of 11 \u00d7 22 mm with a liquid level ().\nGiven the discovery of more thickened cystic walls than usually found in a CAM, and since the chest wall was apparently affected, the radiologist suggested considering a pulmonary blastoma or bronchioalveolar carcinoma, tumors described in patients with a previous CAM. However, since CAM-associated tumors have been described to appear postnatally and given the ultrasound scan findings, the first diagnostic suspicion was a type I CAM in the first twin. The amniocentesis at 25 + 1 weeks of gestation proved normal XY karyotypes for both fetuses.

    "cleaned_text": "a 31-year-old nulliparous woman presented a bichorial biamniotic twin pregnancy, accomplished by artificial insemination due to primary sterility problems. the patient had no outstanding medical or surgical background. the fetal morphology ultrasound scan, performed at 20-week gestation, showed that both fetuses were apparently normal. pregnancy developed normally until 23 weeks of gestation. an ultrasound scan showed supradiaphragmatic avascular cystic formation in the right hemithorax of the first fetus of 34 \u00d7 26 mm, suggesting a type i cystic adenomatoid malformation (cam). serial ultrasounds were performed by the maternal-fetal medicine service every two weeks, starting at 23 weeks, 3 days of gestation. as part of the diagnostic imaging protocol, fetal magnetic resonance (mr) was performed at 23 + 5 weeks of gestation. sagital, coronal and axial fetal mr revealed a lesion with several cysts (hyperintensive at t2) occupying a space in the right inferior lobe. a more caudal cyst was noted, measuring 25 \u00d7 20 mm, with a second cranial cyst of 11 \u00d7 22 mm with a liquid level ().\ngiven the discovery of more thickened cystic walls than usually found in a cam, and since the chest wall was apparently affected, the radiologist suggested considering a pulmonary blastoma or bronchioalveolar carcinoma, tumors described in patients with a previous cam. however, since cam-associated tumors have been described to appear postnatally and given the ultrasound scan findings, the first diagnostic suspicion was a type i cam in the first twin. the amniocentesis at 25 + 1 weeks of gestation proved normal xy karyotypes for both fetuses. the ultrasound scan done at the time of this invasive technique showed an image that was compatible with a cam in the first fetus' right hemithorax. a subsequent ultrasound scan at 28 weeks of gestation evidenced moderate ascites and hydrops fetalis.\nat 30 + 5 weeks of gestation, despite tocolytic treatment to prevent preterm delivery, a cesarean section had to be performed",

She noticed a soft lump and mild pain in her breast a week back. The intensity of pain increased gradually and for the last 2 days and her temperature increased. The patient had a history of 5 years of RA. The patient was not pregnant or lactating. She had three children with the last one delivered 6 years back.\nOn physical examination, the right breast was tender and swollen. A mobile, sensitive, soft, fluctuating mass of around 4 by 5 cm located in the right lower quadrant was palpable. The mass was not fixed to the upper skin. The upper skin was warm and erythematous. There was no nipple retraction or discharge from the nipple. Axillary lymph nodes were not palpable. The patient\u2019s respiratory, digestive, nervous system physical examinations were normal. Physical examination of the musculoskeletal system revealed swelling in 2nd and 3rd proximal interphalangeal joints of the right hand and swelling and limitation of motion in the right knee.\nUltrasonography (USG) of the right breast revealed a heterogeneously hypoechoic deep-seated irregular collection of approximately 40\u00d738 mm size. The patient was diagnosed with a breast abscess. The abscess was drained by USG guided drainage, and oral amoxicillin clavulanic acid 625 mg bid therapy was started empirically.\nThe drained fluid was sent to medical microbiology laboratory in a tightly capped, sterile container. On macroscopic examination, it was observed that the material had yellowish cream colour and dense consistency.

The patient did not report any feeling of abdominal mass, and she did not have any weight or appetite loss during the past months. She is post-menopausal with no complaint of vaginal bleeding, discharge, or lower abdominal pain. There were no other gastrointestinal or urologic symptoms, and her systemic review was unremarkable. Her past surgical history is significant for an open surgical intervention done due to a right ovarian tumor diagnosed in March 2012. The surgical intervention was cytoreductive surgery, including total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, ascites cytology, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, para-aortic lymph node sampling, and omental biopsy. Her final histopathology diagnosis came as an adult-type granulosa cell tumor of the right ovary stage III-A.\nThe patient received adjuvant chemotherapy starting from May up to September 2012 composed of bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin (BEP) protocol for one cycle; however, the protocol was shifted to paclitaxel and carboplatin due to severe neutropenia and gastrointestinal discomfort.

At the bronchoscopy there was no blood in the bronchial tree, but a little lesion with normal mucosa in the superior bronchus.

    "original_text": "A 56-year-old man presented with pain in the lower back, radiating from the left buttock to the anterior leg. The onset of symptoms occurred 4 weeks before presentation. Physical examination revealed numbness in the left big toe with intact motor function. The deep tendon reflexes were decreased on both lower extremities. Plain radiography of the spine showed no definite instability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) () demonstrated a very large disc herniation at the left L4-5 level (with upward migration evident on sagittal scans), spinal stenosis at the L2-3, L3-4, and L4-5 levels, and mild lateral recess stenosis at the left L5-S1 level. Microscopic discectomy was performed at the left L4-5 level. The preoperative radiating pain from the left buttock to the anterior leg was greatly improved after the initial operation (), and the patient was discharged on the sixth day after surgery. Ten days later, he visited the outpatient clinic with severe pain radiating from the left buttock to the posterior thigh. He was unable to maintain a supine position because of the pain, which was most severe during position changes. The symptoms had started 1 week before presentation at the outpatient clinic and had worsened over time. MRI showed no apparently significant interval change from the immediate postoperative MRI (). Because the patient continued to complain of left buttock pain, additional decompression for the left L3-4 and L5-S1 levels was performed ().

According to medical records and collateral history from the patient's legal guardian, the patient was diagnosed with this mood disorder over 20 years ago due to repeated manic episodes which include irritability, labile effect, increased energy, and erratic behavior. Past medical history includes cellulitis, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and repeated urinary tract infections. The patient has a history of developmental delay with a diagnosis of intellectual disability. There was an absence of psychiatric illness in her family. During evaluation by the psychiatrist in the emergency room on admission, patient was clearly distressed, with her hair not groomed, and was slightly disheveled in her appearance. The patient was loud, yelling at the psychiatry and medical staff in the hospital, and was routinely uncooperative and belligerent. Patient was also clearly agitated which appeared in behaviors such as kicking and hitting the unit staff. There were no signs of psychosis, as the patient denied hallucinations in all sensory modalities and no delusions were elicited, and there was no evidence of disorganized thinking or paranoia. Her mood overall was angry and irritable, with a labile effect. At the time of examination, she was alert and oriented to person, place, and time.

The boundary between the tumor and liver was unclear, and the wall thickening extended from the fundus to the cystic duct (Fig. A\u2013C). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed a complete filling defect in the cystic duct (Fig. D). Blood test showed inflammatory maker did not elevate. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen level was 2.1 ng/ml, and serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level was 24 U/ml. According to these findings, we diagnosed the tumor as gallbladder cancer invading the liver and cystic duct, and we decided to perform extended cholecystectomy.\nThere were no adhesions around the gallbladder, while the gallbladder wall was thickened. The hard tumor was detected at the fundus. Intraoperative ultrasonography revealed the tumor did not invade liver obviously. Inflammation changes were seen around the neck and Calot triangle. After ligation and dissection of the cystic duct at the junction, the intraoperative frozen section of the cystic duct stump and 2 sentinel lymph nodes were negative for malignancy; therefore, we performed extended cholecystectomy with liver bed resection.\nMacroscopic examination of the resected specimen showed a superficially spreading papillary tumor with thick mucus on its surface (Fig. A, ).

She had an uncomplicated pregnancy. She had no reported history of endometriosis and previous abdominal surgery. Physical examination led to a diagnosis of pelvic peritonitis. Upon admission, temperature was 37.7\u00b0C and blood pressure was 110/62 mmHg. Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 18.500/mL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 4.02 mg/dL (normal, 0.2 mg/dL). Abdominal ultrasound revealed minimal fluid around the liver, but neither air nor gross fluid was visible in the abdominal cavity. The obstetric evaluation ruled out an obstetric aetiology of patient's symptoms. The patient underwent an emergency operation for a presumptive diagnosis of acute diffuse peritonitis. Explorative laparoscopy was useful to confirm the clinical suspicion and revealed diffuse severe purulent peritonitis that originated from a double rectal and sigmoid perforation <1 cm in diameter related to an endometriotic nodule, that was confirmed in histopathological findings. A previous adherence, caused by endometriotic nodule, and the progressive traction of the enlarged uterus on the strictly adherent sigmoid colon could be a possible aetiopathogenetic mechanism. The surgical approach, for reduced intraperitoneal operative space, was continued through a median laparotomy. Purulent fluid was found in the abdominal cavity, and with further investigation a left sided sigmoid perforation was found associated with another perforation in rectosigmoid junction that was closed with linear stapler and sigmoid in site of perforation was chosen as stoma in left lateral abdominal wall. The patient tolerated the procedure well (). The fetal status remained satisfactory and the patient's postoperative course was uneventful.

Considering the possibility of meningitis, the shunt tube was externalized at its cranial end and connected to an external ventricular drainage (EVD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study was suggestive of pyogenic meningitis. The patient was started on injection ceftriaxone and vancomycin empirically as culture reports were pending.\nThe patient\u2019s past history was significant for congenital hydrocephalus for which she underwent VP shunt at the age of 6 months. Since then, she has had multiple shunt revisions at the ages of 8, 15 and 23 at different hospitals, details of which were unavailable.\nOn admission to our hospital, the patient had no neurological deficits. The shunt tube was seen exposed through an erosion in the neck. The cranial end of the shunt tube was connected to an EVD.\nThe empirical antibiotics were continued. We then performed an endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV). During ETV, the ventricular catheter of the VP shunt was visualized with the aid of a flexible endoscope. The catheter was seen surrounded by a tuft of choroid plexus and hence it was retained. The distal end of the shunt tube was stuck within the abdomen. Laparoscopic visualization of the abdomen by gastro surgeons showed that the abdominal end of the shunt tube had penetrated the jejunal wall with a well-formed track covering the tube from the anterior abdominal wall to the jejunum (). After removing the shunt tube, the bowel opening was surgically closed.\nHer CSF culture sent from the first hospital grew \n, sensitive to levofloxacin, minocycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX).

Five years prior to presenting, which was 1 year before she reached menopause, she had noticed that her abdomen was gradually distending. Her symptoms were associated with constipation, feeling of incomplete rectal emptying, early satiety, vomiting, and urinary frequency and urgency. She did not have any chronic illnesses and had a negative personal and family history of ovarian, uterine, bowel, and breast cancers. She was not receiving any medication prior to this presentation. She had delivered five children by cesarean section, and they were all alive and well. She lived in a rural area and was a subsistence farmer. She did not smoke and did not drink alcohol.\nShe had ascitic taps three times in 1 week at a district hospital before referral to a higher-level hospital because of recurrent reaccumulation of ascites. A transabdominal ultrasound scan (USS) showed generalized ascites with a thick fluid with septa, as well as bilateral mild hydroureter and hydronephrosis. Again, the ascites was drained twice. One month later, she underwent computed tomography (CT), which showed a large predominantly cystic lesion that occupied almost the entire abdominal and pelvic cavities, which were distended, causing a marked mass effect on surrounding organs and bowel. The lesion had areas of internal septation predominantly on the right flank with no features of metastatic disease. Tumor markers measured during this admission are shown in Table .\nThe patient was referred to a tertiary hospital but only went 5 years later.

He was referred to a pediatric psychologist for a history of chronic nonadherence to oral steroids and inhaled corticosteroids, parent\u2013child conflict, and maladaptive health behaviors impacting his health. Prior to the referral, the patient had one emergency visit for an asthma exacerbation, which was preceded by a prolonged hospitalization including the need for intubation and receipt of care in the intensive care unit (ICU). The pulmonary team suspected that his recent emergency room visits and prolonged hospitalization were likely related to medication nonadherence in the setting of increased parent\u2013adolescent conflict. The patient lived with his biological maternal grandmother who was his primary caregiver and legal guardian. He was the oldest of five children all of whom were living in the same household. The family had a number of psychosocial stressors including multiple family members receiving care for chronic illnesses, financial difficulties and low socioeconomic status, and ongoing housing issues, including having mold and roaches, which can be triggers for asthma symptoms.\nAs shown in a, psychological treatment included a multi-faceted approach, which included adherence and health promotion interventions, problem-solving, motivational interviewing, and family-focused interventions. This patient also received an electronic monitor to assess objective patterns of medication adherence to oral steroids. The primary focus with this patient was improving his medication adherence by identifying barriers to treatment success. This patient and his grandmother also received consistent feedback regarding his medication adherence (see b) and family-centered interventions.

The baby weighed 3.5 kg, and had two large lesions on the alveolar ridge of the maxilla and three smaller lesions on the mandible [].\nThe masses were pedunculated and covered with mucosa, which was macroscopically normal and had brisk capillary refill. On clinical examination, a round, pedunculated, 3 cm diameter, soft tissue mass, exhibiting an erythematous and smooth surface, was found in the midline and was attached to the anterior gingiva. The masses were preventing normal closure of the mouth. Three other soft tissue masses of 1.5 cm each were also found attached to the mandibles, which were smooth surfaced. Two masses were attached laterally and one at the midline of the mandible. At presentation there was no respiratory difficulty. A nasogastric tube had been placed due to feeding difficulties and the baby was breathing normally. The swellings had not increased in size in the last six days. The patient also had a depressed nasal bridge, with decreased nasal patency; however, no other structural abnormality was detected. All other mile stones were normal [].\nThe general physical examination, along with laboratory tests, was otherwise normal. The patient underwent fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), which showed a benign fibrous lesion. The midline lesion was gently pushed laterally and subsequently oral intubation could be performed with some effort.

The patient had been started on progesterone 10 mg daily one year prior to presentation for oligomenorrhea. A core biopsy taken nine years prior to presentation was reported as fibroadenoma.

One year previously, the patient had experienced pain and bilateral weakness of the muscles of the lower legs, and walking became limited. Several days later, a recurrent low to moderate fever developed and scattered red spots were visible on the extensor skin of the lower legs, with no pruritus or pain upon compression. The skin biopsy revealed erythema nodosum. The patient was administered 10 mg prednisone three times a day and the symptoms were attenuated. At 11 months prior to the present admittance, the pain and weakness of the lower limbs got worse, with involvement of the thighs and lower legs. Magnetic resonance imaging, electromyography and a biopsy of the muscle of the right thigh were performed, which diagnosed polymyositis. The condition was treated with 80 mg intravenous methylprednisolone per day and 10 mg oral methotrexate per week. Following attenuation of the symptoms, the dosage of methylprednisolone was gradually reduced.\nFour months prior to admittance, the patient experienced exacerbation of the weakness in the lower limbs. A positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET-CT) scan was performed two months later, which showed multiple regions of elevated fluorodeoxyglucose metabolism in the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, spleen and bones (). One month after the scan, the patient developed a high fever of 39.2\u00b0C, with no chill or cough. This raised temperature did not decrease subsequent to treatment with antibiotics (intravenous cefperazone-sulbactam, 3 g every 8 h) and, therefore, 10 mg methylprednisolone per day was administered to control the polymyositis and diclofenac potassium (50 mg, every 12 h) was administered to control the fever. No abnormal cells were found in bone marrow smears. Two lymph node puncture biopsies",

Pain was progressively increasing in intensity, radiating to the right lower limb and back, increased on movements and associated with tingling sensation since last 3 months.\nThe patient had become quite incapacitated due to painful restricted movements. Her past history showed that at 22 years of age, she had presented with a large abdominal mass. Her CT at that time showed a multicystic lesion measuring 18.0\u00d79.8\u00d77.6 cm in the right abdomen, which appeared to be arising from the right ovary. The liver and other organs, including the uterus, kidneys, and left ovary, were normal. Her lung x-ray at that time was normal. Thus, with a clinical diagnosis of a right ovarian tumour, she underwent surgery which showed a hydatid cyst which was confirmed on histopathology. Peroperatively her ovaries were normal with presence of paraovarian cystic masses which were densely adherent to the right ovary.\nAfter remaining asymptomatic for 3 years, in 2007, she again gradually developed pain in the right pelvic region. This time MRI showed a large solid cystic mass measuring 10\u00d76.3 cm in the right iliac fossa and right gluteal region. It was arising from the right iliac bone, involving right sacroiliac joint and adjacent marrow of the sacrum. All other pelvic organs were unremarkable. With a clinical possibility of tumour or tuberculosis, a diagnostic laparatomy was planned. Peroperatively, multiple cysts in the iliac bone with osteolysis were seen. Two cystic pieces were removed which were diagnosed as hydatid cyst. In view of the complicated nature of cysts and location it could not be completely excised.\nThe patient continued with the pelvic pain although postoperative MRI showed reduction in size of the lesion along the right iliac bone and sacro",

He gave a history of soreness of the oral mucosa with burning sensation on eating spicy food since past 9 years, but his symptoms had exacerbated in the past 5 months. He now complained of sore throat and difficulty in swallowing solids since past few months forcing him to a semisolid and liquid bland diet. He complained of multiple ulcers in the mouth and enlarged swollen bleeding gums, which had not resolved with symptomatic treatment given by his physician (topical lignocaine gel and chlorhexidine mouthwash). He informed that several of his teeth had progressively become mobile and had spontaneously exfoliated in the past 2 years. The partial denture that he had been using had become tight and was painful on insertion in the oral cavity. He found it difficult to eat or speak clearly without his denture.\nHe had been diagnosed with benign prostrate hyperplasia but was otherwise well and did not have any history of constitutional symptoms like fever, loss of appetite/weight, fatigue and arthralgia. He did not have any habits of smoking, tobacco and alcohol. There was no history of allergies or family history of similar condition. There was no history of skin, ocular or genital lesions. He did not have any systemic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis and was not taking any regular systemic medications.\nOn examination, there were erosive areas on the buccal mucosa, palate and tongue. There was no evidence of any vesicles, bullae or scarring and Nikolskys sign was negative. There was generalized inflammatory enlargement of the gingiva including the palate, extending into the pharynx. The gingiva, palatal and oropharyngeal mucosa was fiercely erythematous, edematous, with a cobble-stone like velvety shiny irregular surface which bled on palpation.
