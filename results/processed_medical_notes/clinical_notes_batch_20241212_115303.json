Despite being followed in an interdisciplinary obesity management programme, her binge eating behaviours had resulted in a 45 kg weight gain over 12 months, resulting in numerous medical complications. Comorbid psychiatric diagnoses included anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Prior to admission she resided in a group home with intensive psychological supports. Much of her therapeutic work at the group home focused on processing trauma and increasing effective coping skills using dialectical behaviour therapy and trauma informed approaches. However, due to limited resources, patients were sent home on weekends. Removed from the structure and extra support the group home provided, she reverted to ineffective strategies to gain emotional control such as binge eating and aggressively rejecting any boundaries set by her caregiver.\nThe patient was admitted to a ward designed for individuals diagnosed with restrictive eating disorders as no acute care treatment options existed for BED. The main goals of admission were symptom interruption, safety planning and care coordination. With structured meal times, interruption of bingeing was successfully achieved within 72 hours. Much of the admission (25 days) was then, however, dedicated to coordinating a discharge plan that would allow for intensive mental health support, while also ensuring safety for the patient's caregiver. Numerous barriers to finding a suitable treatment programme for an adolescent living with BED, complex obesity and mental health comorbidities surfaced. She could not return home with her grandmother due to safety concerns and, as a result, could also not return to the group home or attend an outpatient day programme. No residential programmes for youth living with BED existed.

The posteroanterior chest radiography () demonstrated a huge mediastinal shadow with well defined margins that extended to the two lung fields and there was no calcification and ossification. The pre-contrast CT scan revealed a giant cystic-solid mass that measured 16 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 8 cm and it was located in the center of the anterior mediastinum and it symmetrically grew toward the two lung fields; the mass was well-circumscribed and compressed next to the aorta and the superior vena cava.

Unfortunately, after 10 months, she started to complain of epilepsy again, with a clinical absence type behavior, pointed for temporal lobe origin type of seizures. Thus, a few months later, the left posterior temporal lesion was removed as well. The second operation gave very good medical results in terms of seizures control. The episodes dropped to one or two focal seizures per year. The third lesion, the intraventricular one, was followed up with a yearly MRI scan. At the age of 21, because the lesion had increased in size (\u223c8 mm) and because of the patient's desire, we decide to remove it using a transcranial interhemispheric approach.

He was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease at age of 18 on the basis of persistent proteinuria with hematuria. He was diagnosed with congestive heart failure and end-stage renal disease at age of 21. He started to undergo PD, but heart failure recurred one month later because of his poor self-management. Thereafter, he underwent combination therapy with HD (for 4 hours, once per week) and PD (1.5% Dianeal PD-2, 4 times per day, 6 days per week). Factor VIII (1000 U) was administered about three times a week (once a week after HD and irregular self-injection). He developed suddenly severe headache eight months after the beginning of the combination therapy. When he presented at the emergency room, his blood pressure was 200/100 mmHg. His blood tests showed prolonged APTT (110 second). In spite of immediate treatment by antihypertentsive medication (oral nifedipine), one hour later, he had a generalized convulsion due to intracerebral hemorrhage. The next day, his cerebral hemorrhage enlarged and his consciousness level worsened despite administration of factor VIII and intravenous anti-hypertensive medications. Emergency surgery was performed to remove the hematoma. He received a large amount of factor VIII to achieve an APTT level less than 40 seconds for one week. He regained consciousness after surgery and was managed with PD without HD to avoid cerebral edema. One month later, his renal replacement therapy was switched to HD (three times a week) from PD, since a ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter was placed to treat his hydrocephalus. Neither clot formation nor hemorrhage was found after hemodialysis which was performed without anticoagulant agents. He received 1000 U of factor VIII before removal of the dialysis needle at the end of every HD session to maintain the APTT level between 50 sec and 60 sec.

He reported the feeling of a foreign body sensation at his mid sternal area after drinking a cold beverage, and then suddenly lost consciousness. The duration of unconsciousness was a few seconds. There were no seizure-like movements or incontinence during the attack, and he felt no numbness or motor weakness before or after the events. The patient reported more than twelve episodes of syncope before presenting to the cardiology outpatient clinic at Samsung Medical Center. A skin laceration was noted on his forehead from the last episode of syncope.\nThe patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation seven to eight years ago, and had been taking warfarin since then. He was also diagnosed with diabetes mellitus three years ago. His diabetes was well controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents.\nThe initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 60-70. His echocardiography did not show any significant abnormality of the heart except bilateral atrial enlargement. On the second day of admission, he felt a globulous sensation at the mid esophagus after drinking a cold beverage in the sitting position, and then lost consciousness. His telemetry ECG monitoring at that time showed abrupt ventricular asystole that was sustained for 12 seconds (). Another episode of syncope occurred on the same day while drinking. His telemetry ECG monitoring showed ventricular asystole for 4 seconds ().\nWe evaluated the esophagus with a barium swallow; there were no abnormal findings in the esophagus. On the treadmill test, his heart rate and blood pressure increased to 176/min and 218/83 mmHg, respectively. The head-up tilt test three months before admission was negative; the head-up tilt test was repeated. During the repeated head-up tilt test, provocation with drinking a cold beverage showed no significant pause or hypotension.\nThe patient underwent permanent pacemaker implantation of a VVI type pacemaker to prevent ventricular asystole.",

She had experienced intermittent abdominal pain for several months. She had no other specific past medical history and no history of trauma. The patient\u2019s vital signs were stable and laboratory tests were normal. Chest X-ray showed no abnormal findings and the computed tomography of her chest showed a 4-cm-sized round mass with areas of calcification in the left hemidiaphragmatic area (Figure \n). After a review of the diagnostic imaging, we were still unable to localize the mass, but we concluded that the lesion was most likely located in the left pleural space based on its proximity to the diaphragm. We decided to remove the mass. The patient was taken to the operating room for thoracoscopic surgery. General anesthesia with double lumen endotracheal tube intubation and one lung ventilation was done. Two 5-mm ports and one 10-mm port were placed in the left chest (fifth intercostal space in the midclavicular line, sixth intercostal space in the anterior axillary line, and eighth intercostal space in the posterior axillary line) for the thoracoscopic approach. No mass was visualized in the pleural space, but a bulge was visualized in the diaphragm consistent with the location of the lesion noted on chest computed tomography. The diaphragm was opened with electrocautery around the mass lesion. Then we identified the mass in the diaphragm (Figure \n). The mass was adhered to the crucial fibers of the diaphragm but was relatively well marginated. We dissected carefully, and a small feeding vessel was noted and clipped. The dissection was relatively easy and the mass was removed. The diaphragm defect was closed with interrupted polyester sutures and one chest tube was placed. The postoperative course was uneventful. The chest tube was removed on the third postoperative day and the patient was discharged the following day. The specimen measured about 4 cm in diameter, 9.4 gram",

She visited the emergency room on day 6 and was found neutropenic. Blisters appeared over the erythematous area later that day. The patient suffered from an intensive pain despite maximal dosages of paracetamol and ibruprofen day 8, she showed up in our clinic and presented a confluent, elevated, burning erythema distributed on previously sunburned areas, the neck and the upper back, strictly excluding areas previously covered with clothes and hair. The appearance reminded of an acute sunburn. However, she had not been exposed to the sun for the last weeks. The patient was admitted to the infectious diseases ward for assessment because herpes infection was suspected. One of the blisters was punctured and PCR tests for herpes simplex virus type I (HSV I), herpes simplex virus type II (HSV II) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) were performed. The patient had fever up to 38.3 degree Celsius and the treatment with valaciclovir was initiated. However, the clinical picture was atypical since the erythema was covering several dermatomes while distinctly sparing the parts under her bra straps, rising suspicion of photo toxicity. The patient had not been sun exposed during the period of chemotherapy, but she had undertaken a trip to Vietnam for two weeks 5 months before the docetaxel treatment.

She had an indwelling urethral catheter inserted, because of the total urinary incontinence, for a period of over eight years. This catheter was last changed twelve weeks prior to her visit to the urology clinic by her district nurse. The patient had positive MSUs in the year prior to her admission demonstrating mixed growth of enteric organisms, but no prior febrile urinary tract infections were reported.\nShe received radical radiotherapy alone for a muscle-invasive bladder tumor (stage T2b) in 1991 and underwent abdominal exploration for drainage of an appendicular abscess when she was in her early twenties. The patient had a background history of cerebrovascular disease, hypertension and ischaemic heart disease. She was felt to be an unsuitable candidate for radical surgery for her invasive bladder cancer due to these comorbidities. The decision to manage her incontinence with an indwelling urethral catheter was made having discussed available treatment options with the patient. A long-term indwelling catheter was felt to be the most appropriate option for her given her other extensive comorbidities. She did not have urodynamic testing prior to urethral catheterization. The exchanges of the catheter were being carried out every three months in the community and there had been no reported difficulty with her previous catheter changes. The patient was not undergoing routine cystoscopic surveillance of her bladder.\nOn physical examination she was generally unwell with low-grade fever and pallor. Her abdomen was soft, mildly tender with no palpable masses and no signs of peritonitis.

A thorough history confirmed an episode 1-week prior, during which he developed sudden onset of dizziness associated with nausea and vomiting that resolved within hours. He denied any past medical or surgical history and was taking no medications. He has no family history of tumors. In the emergency room, his vital signs were within normal limits. His physical examination was significant for a left facial droop and right hemiparesis. Auscultation of his chest revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no appreciable murmur. No additional significant findings were noted. Stroke protocol was initiated. A chest X-ray was normal and an electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. A head computed tomography (CT) scan was negative for signs of intracranial hemorrhage. He was subsequently started on tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain demonstrated a right basal ganglia infarct and an old left cerebral infarct. A carotid ultrasound was negative. TTE demonstrated a 1 cm by 1 cm mass on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with a moderate mitral regurgitation In addition, TTE revealed a questionable mass on the left coronary cusp of the aortic valve. These findings were confirmed with TEE (Fig. ), which verified no sign of endocarditis and no atrial septal defect. A complete hypercoagulable workup was negative. Stroke protocol continued with the working diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident secondary to emboli from the mitral valve mass. Within 24 hours, he regained function of the right side of his body and had complete resolution of symptoms.

    "original_text": "A 74-year-old man presented with epigastric pain for 2 months and was diagnosed with pancreatic body cancer through diagnostic imaging studies. Computed tomography (CT), endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 3-cm-sized mass located on the body of the pancreas with suspicious perivascular infiltration around the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery with distal pancreatic duct dilatation. Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT revealed no distant metastatic lesion. Several endoscopic trials had failed to obtain tissue samples for the pathologic conformation. Finally, exploratory laparotomy was performed for tissue diagnosis. No peritoneal metastasis was confirmed after the opening of peritoneum through the midline incision. In opening the lesser sac to evaluate for a pancreatic mass and celiac or SMA invasion, a hard pancreatic mass consistent with malignancy was observed on the body of the pancreas. Dissection of soft tissue around the celiac trunk was performed and the resected tissue was sent to a pathologic laboratory for prompt frozen section biopsy. This soft tissue sample was revealed to free of carcinoma. Anterior radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy was performed without complication or event during operation.\nThe patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful and there was no remarkable postoperative complication. A routine postoperative follow-up imaging using abdomen CT scan was performed on postoperative day 7, in which there was free-fluid collection of 5.5\u00d72.2 cm in size () around the pancreatic resection margin. The pathologic examination confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with lymph node metastasis in 7 out of 19 lymph nodes. Both lymphovascular and perineural invasion were reported.

In the 50s and 60s, superficial X-ray radiotherapy was considered as a standard treatment for fungal infections of the head that were resistant to conventional medications and was used in the treatment of this common infection till the evolution in the medical treatment of fungal infections in the mid-20th century.

The patch became ulcerative with an infected appearance in the last 15 years. He mentioned that the ulcer has got larger and he has been experiencing frequent bleeding episodes from the lesion. In the last 10 years, he received routine treatments for BCC of the skin including topical 5FU, three extensive surgeries with the use of skin flap in two out of three surgeries and two cycles of radiotherapy with linear accelerating (LINAC) device. The first cycle of radiotherapy was performed using 8 Mega electron volt (MeV) with a total dose of 50 Grays in 20 fractions, and the second cycle was performed after four years from the first cycle in 20 sessions using X-ray 6 MeV with the final dose of 60 Grays. He also underwent 6 courses of Cisplatin-based chemotherapy including Cisplatin 45 mg day (1-3) and 5FU 900 mg day (1-3) in the past year. Chemotherapy resulted in a slight initial response but had no long-term response. The patient was referred to our oncology clinic for further treatment.

The patient\u2019s substance use disorder started at the age of 15, one year after the bariatric surgery. Of note, the patient's parents were separated and he lived with his mother and siblings. None of his family members or relatives had a history of substance use disorder. He initially started using fenethylline (marketed under the brand name Captagon), as it was a common substance used by his peers at school. He started with two tablets daily and increased his use gradually up to 15 tablets daily. He started smoking cannabis a year later, at the age of 16, starting with one cigarette per day and increasing his use gradually until reaching a peak of 20 cigarettes per day. The patient started drinking alcohol occasionally at the age of 16 as well, and it soon became an issue of excessive use on a daily basis. The patient drank different types of alcoholic beverages. He reported incidents of fainting in relation to alcohol use but had never experienced withdrawal. He mentioned that he started using alcohol as a way to reduce his use of other substances. Two years later, at the age of 18, the patient started using methamphetamine, which caused him to develop paranoid ideation, auditory hallucinations, severe insomnia, and aggressive behavior. The patient was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit for a few days and was started on haloperidol 3 mg orally twice daily, benztropine 2 mg orally twice daily, and quetiapine 50 mg orally as needed for insomnia.

At presentation, the patient reported a score of 10 on a pain rating scale of 10. The quality of the pain was sharp, and it was radiating to the back with mild relief on bending forward. There were no known aggravating factors. The pain was associated with nausea and non-bilious vomiting with no traces of blood. The patient denied any similar episodes in the past and has no history of alcohol consumption. She has a history of cholecystectomy done 2 years back for abdominal pain, but the gallbladder was apparently devoid of any gallstones.\nAn ultrasound and a computed tomography of the abdomen and blood workup were performed to determine the cause of pain. At admission, the serum lipase levels were elevated to > 1,600 IU/L (laboratory reference level 10 - 53 IU/L). An ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a normal common bile duct with its diameter of 5.4 mm (). The abdomen CT findings were also consistent with the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis wherein there was stranding in the retroperitoneum and the abdominal mesentery with trace fluid in the perihepatic and pelvic space. There was edema of the head and body of the pancreas with peripancreatic edema but without any pancreatic pseudocyst. The remaining findings were unremarkable with no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation, patent mesenteric blood vessels and normal spleen and adrenal glands (). Further workup was done to look for other less frequent causes of pancreatitis.

Unfortunately, the tumor recurred and the patient was sent to our clinic for salvage surgery involving a total laryngectomy. Two months after this salvage surgery, the patient developed radionecrosis of the soft tissue of the neck. This necrosis resolved after hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT); however, a large pharyngocutaneous fistula remained in the upper neck ().\nA free flap reconstruction was not suitable for this patient because of his surgical history and severe neck fibrosis. Thus, a two stage, medially based deltopectoral flap reconstruction was chosen. Because the distance requirement was relatively long, we opted for a surgical delay for the distal two-thirds of the flap. The flap was completely elevated and placed on the fistula 10 days after this delay.\nOn postoperative day 5, the flap developed necrosis at its distal tip and was completely separated from the fistula (). The flap tip was trimmed to ~2 cm; however, this postdebridement flap did not have a sufficient length to reach the fistula. After discussion with the patient, we decided to re-operate using this shortened flap rather than harvesting a new flap from the contralateral chest.\nThe revision operation was divided into three stages. In the first stage, we created a temporary recipient site just below and lateral to the fistula. After debridement, the distal part of the flap was placed on this temporary recipient site (). After this stage, the patient underwent another course of HBOT.\nBecause the temporary recipient site was located in a previously irradiated area, the second stage was delayed for 8 weeks, at which point the flap was divided from its origin.

Two years prior to initial presentation at our facility, she was diagnosed with an 11-cm right axillary, intermediate-grade pleomorphic spindle cell neoplasm. She underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy followed by a resection of the tumor. Microscopic margins were positive following the surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy was initiated. She developed a local recurrence 3 months after resection which ultimately progressed to invasion of the brachial plexus with paralysis of the right upper extremity as well as a pathologic humeral fracture. She was placed on low molecular weight heparin after developing a right subclavian vein thrombosis. Additionally, she developed distant metastatic disease in the left upper lobe of the lung. She perused several experimental modalities that were unsuccessful at reducing the tumor burden.\nShe presented to our institution 2 years after the initial diagnosis with debilitating pain of the right upper extremity. An MRI revealed a 25-cm shoulder mass involving the proximal arm muscles with encasement of the axillary artery, vein, and brachial plexus (Fig. ). After a multidisciplinary discussion, a palliative forequarter amputation was performed. Tumor thrombus was evident within the axillary artery and vein during ligation.\nTen hours after completion of the operation, she developed an acute onset of dyspnea with a resultant increase in her supplemental oxygen requirement. A chest x-ray was obtained which revealed bilateral atelectasis. Suspicion of a pulmonary embolism remained high and confirmatory testing was performed with a computed tomography (CT) chest (Fig. ). A pulmonary saddle embolism was present on the CT scan and she was started on an intravenous heparin infusion. A bilateral lower extremity venous duplex study did not reveal a deep vein thrombosis.

His CT scan showed retroperitoneal bleeding (around the pancreas and the dorsal side of the ascending colon). His general condition was stable, but he was admitted to our hospital as a conservative measure. His angiography (6 days after admission) showed an aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal artery without active bleeding.\nOur experience treating MAL syndrome in case 1 enabled us to diagnose the disease accurately in case 2. MAL syndrome was the cause of the aneurysm in this patient too (). We selected laparoscopic surgery based on the MAL syndrome and the benefits of this surgery. The patient's posture for the surgery was the lithotomy position. Intra-abdominal pressure of 12 mmHg was maintained. The points of the trocars were as follows: a 12 mm trocar at the navel for the camera, two 12 mm trocars at the right upper abdomen, and a 12 mm trocar and a 5 mm trocar at the left upper abdomen ().\nFirst, we lifted the liver umbilical ligament by surgical sutures and put in an organ retractor to the crus of the diaphragm in order to improve the field of vision. After opening the omental bursa, we lifted the stomach with a snake retractor and observed the dorsal side of the stomach. We confirmed the left gastric artery and tied it with tape. The tape was taken out from the right outside trocar, and an assistant pulled it to provide traction of the surgical field. Following the celiac artery to the root, the artery was fastened by the MAL.

No postoperative pain or swelling was mentioned in case sheet. No history of any trauma in immediate postoperative phase was noticed. Patient general status was healthy, and she was not suffering from any bone disorders. The clinician mentioned about mobility with a dental implant placed in the mandibular right central incisor region. Intraoral examination revealed no soft tissue dehiscence noted in the concerned area. Periodontal health of adjacent teeth was normal. Mucoperiosteum covering the dental implant in 41 regions was so thinned that implant outline can be easily appreciable in transmitted light (). The implant was Grade I mobile. The marginal bone loss was seen in the adjacent implant.\nThe case discussed with the patient and depicted management options of implant removal or bone reinforcement to support the implant. The mandibular grafting technique was explained to patient and complications explained. The patient was ready for the surgery under local anesthesia.\nBilateral mental nerve blocks were given. Local anaesthesia with adrenaline administered in the mandibular vestibule. Crestal incision with two vertical releasing incisions placed. Full thickness mucoperiosteal Trapezoidal flap raised. Care was taken to raise mucosa in contact with the implant. Flap raised until the lower border of the mandible.\nAfter hemostasis, the examination revealed completely denuded buccal aspect of the implant in relation to 41 (). The defect measured to be about 18 mm mesiodistally. The thickness of the graft needed was assessed to be 2-3 mm, in order to compensate for the buccolingual loss of bone.\nUsing these measurements, the graft was marked 5-6 mm away from the apical margin of the implants.

He is the first baby of first-cousin parents with no family history of metabolic disorders or early neonatal deaths (). He developed neonatal jaundice on the second day of life, and was treated with phototherapy for 5 days. He was noted to be floppy since early infancy with delayed gross and fine motor development. He achieved head control after the age of 8 months, and started to sit unsupported at 10 months of age. However, he lost some of the developmental skills that he had gained after an acute gastroenteritis at the age of 11 months. This acute illness was complicated by encephalopathy and seizures. Extensive workup was carried out including cerebrospinal fluid analysis that was negative for viral and bacterial infections. He remained with severe spasticity, not responding to extensive physiotherapy and Baclofen therapy. His initial evaluation at our hospital showed a spastic child with severe dystonic posture and failure to thrive. His investigations revealed normal serum lactate and ammonia with no evidence of metabolic acidosis. His brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed abnormal high signal intensity at basal ganglia and widened Sylvian fissure (Figures ). Based on clinical presentation along with the MRI findings, the diagnosis of GA1 was considered. He was started on intravenous dextrose 10%, oral carnitine, and low protein diet. Few days later, his urine organic acids result showed elevated 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, while serum amino acids were normal.

Although her pain initially occurred late during activity and was resolved with rest, it finally became more constant until it was present at rest (Table ). She received right cementless bipolar hip hemiarthroplasty (BHA) in her local hospital 18 years earlier due to a right femoral neck fracture and had a history of 2-year alendronate (35 mg/wk) use. Radiography showed a radiolucent space surrounding the distal portion of the stem with reactive lines, accompanying localized lateral cortical thickening and an obscure transverse lucent line just above the stem tip (Figure ). At 3 years prior to this episode, she visited our hospital for left-sided sciatic pain with magnetic resonance imaging only indicating mild spinal canal stenosis of the L5-S1. She presented no pain or other symptoms in her right leg during that time. Therefore, we accessed the conventional anteroposterior radiographs of the hip joint taken at the time of the lumbar magnetic resonance imaging scan. Reactive lines and radiolucencies were already apparent, and there were no signs of progressive component migration during these past 3 years (Figure ), even though no beaking of the lateral cortex was observed in this earlier radiograph (Figure ). One possible cause of her severe thigh pain could be aseptic loosening of the stem as plain radiography showed a periprosthetic zone of radiolucency around the bone-implant interface. Another possibility was that the incomplete stress fracture with specific features reflective of atypical femoral fractures (AFFs) was responsible for the painful hip arthroplasty. Tam et al reported that comparing the pattern of uptake with previous bone scintigraphy studies is important to determine loosening. A higher intensity around the prosthesis compared with the previous studies may raise the suspicion of aseptic loosening. Conversely, should no increased uptake on delayed bone scintigraphy exist, significant loosening is unlikely. Furthermore, acute fractures or unstable and unfused old fractures were reported to show",

He denied any prior trauma to his knee but has worked in an oil field for his entire adult life. He reported a 2-month history of acute worsening of his pain as well as catching and locking symptoms that preceded his initial orthopedic assessment. He presented to our emergency room before orthopedic assessment due to sudden onset of right knee pain; blood tests revealed a uric acid level of 7.4 (normal) and a knee aspiration by the emergency room physician showed the presence of negative birefringent crystals. Pre-operative clinical examination of his right knee examination was significant for an effusion with medial greater than lateral joint line tenderness to palpation. His active and passive range of motion was 20\u2014\u00b0, limited by pain. He had pain medially with McMurray testing and was ligamentously stable. He had no palpable gouty tophi within the knee and there was no evidence to suggest gouty tophi present anywhere else on his body. Weight-bearing knee radiographs showed mild tricompartmental degenerative changes with osteophyte formation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right knee displayed tears along the posterior horn of both menisci and mild thinning of the articular cartilage of the medial and lateral femoral condyles and mild osteophytoses. Given the patient\u2019s presentation and new onset of mechanical symptoms, a diagnosis of symptomatic meniscal tearing in the setting of chronic degenerative osteoarthritis was made. The possibility of a gout flare was also discussed but thought unlikely due to the combination of his new mechanical symptoms with a negative prior history of knee involvement.

She had RA diagnosed 10 years ago and had been undergoing conservative treatment. The pain in both knees was aggravated since 5 years ago, and a severe flexion contracture deformity developed gradually, resulting in inability to walk. The range of motion (ROM) of the right and left knees was limited to 85\u00b0\u2013135\u00b0 and 90\u00b0\u2013130\u00b0, respectively, which was accompanied by a valgus deformity. Severe flexion contracture and valgus deformity were observed on the plain radiographs and scanogram (). Both knees had severe joint destruction and deformity caused by RA, which was the indication for TKA. Operation was decided for the left knee first due to the presence of more severe pain and greater flexion contracture deformity than the right knee. Although preoperative application of serial casting and physical therapy may be more effective for severe flexion contracture in both knees, we decided to perform TKA and proceed with serial casting and physical therapy postoperatively to correct the remaining flexion contracture. Furthermore, considering the possibility that she might need additional revision knee arthroplasty in the future, as well as her young age, the goals of surgery were to perform a proper soft tissue procedure and minimal osteotomy for one-third correction of the flexion contracture deformity.\nSurgery was performed under spinal anesthesia and the 90\u00b0 flexion contracture of the left knee measured in the preoperative test was confirmed in surgery (). Using the general medial parapatellar approach, the hyperplastic synovium was removed. Femoral posterior condyle osteophyte removal was carried out and a proper posterior soft tissue release was performed. Then, additional distal femoral resection of more than 2 mm was performed to treat the flexion contracture by widening the extension gap.

As part of our ongoing study \u201cVaginal delivery after caesarean section\u201d, she underwent saline contrast sonohysterography 6 months after the caesarean section. The caesarean scar had a small indentation and the remaining myometrium over the defect was 7.5 mm (Fig. ).\nIn the current pregnancy, she had a dating scan at around 11 weeks with no remarks. She came for a transvaginal ultrasound examination at around 13 weeks as part of our study. This scan revealed a duplex pregnancy with one viable intrauterine fetus with normal anatomy and placenta located high on the anterior wall and a small gestational sac (8 mm) with a yolk sac without embryo was located in the caesarean scar (Fig. ). There was no extensive vascularity surrounding the sac. One corpus luteum was found in each of the two ovaries. She was asymptomatic.\nShe was informed that not enough evidence existed to advise a specific management of this condition. After discussion with her and her husband, expectant management was chosen with a new ultrasound examination after 5 weeks.\nShe came to our ultrasound department at 18 weeks, 22 weeks, and 30 weeks of gestation. She remained asymptomatic. The ectopic gestational sac was not visualized with transvaginal or transabdominal scans at the 18 weeks examination (Fig. ). The niche in the scar and the thickness of the thinnest part of the remaining myometrium appeared unchanged at all visits. The intrauterine pregnancy developed normally with no signs of abnormal placentation.

The patient did not have any symptoms, and he had no pain or difficulty with speech or swallowing and no history of trauma, fever, fatigue, anorexia, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, or weight changes. The swelling had been present for approximately 5 years, and the dentist observed it during the regular dental control visits, but no further action was taken. The swelling had never bothered the patient. The patient used Ritalin for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Upon physical examination, a 2 cm nonfluctuating, nontender, immobile, firm nodular swelling was observed with intact overlying mucosa on the left side of the hard palate in the bicuspid-molar region (). Clinical and radiographic examination of the dentition did not reveal any pathology. The patient had no palpable cervical lymphadenopathy. MRI showed a well-demarcated mass of the left side of the hard palate without bone invasion (Figures and ). Pathological diagnosis was established by incisional biopsy performed under local anesthesia; histological examination was consistent with a pleomorphic adenoma of the minor salivary glands of the palate. The tumor was excised under general anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation. The mucosa around the tumor was marked and incised with an adequate margin, followed by dissection, with removal of the whole encapsulated mass and the mucoperiosteum (). With a bur under copious sterile saline irrigation, the superficial part of the underlying bone was removed to ensure that no remnants of the lesions could cause recurrence.

Despite her age, she was clear-minded, and she managed to fulfill her daily activities in her own home with the help of a nursing assistant. On physical examination her abdomen was distended and tympanic with tenderness in the postoperative scar near her umbilicus. A computed tomography of her abdomen demonstrated small bowel obstruction.

Apart from the respiratory difficulty, the patient also showed persistent weakness of muscle tone and a significantly low activity level overall. Genetic and metabolic screening test results were all normal. Electromyography and nerve conduction velocity examinations yielded no definite electrophysical evidence of myopathy or neuropathy.

The infection parameters, white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation, and C-reactive protein were normal in the laboratory tests (8 \u00d7 103/mL and 5 mm/h, 2 mg/L, respectively). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displayed a lesion of 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm with low signal on both T1 and T2, and the zone around the lesion demonstrated low signal on T1 and high signal on T2, consistent with granulomatosis formation with reactive tissues around ().
