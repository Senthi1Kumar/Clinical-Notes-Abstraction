There was no history of rectal bleeding. Digital rectal examination revealed a hard invasion of the anal canal.\nIn 2012 she had been diagnosed with a left-sided invasive lobular breast carcinoma with extensive bone metastases. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2-neu). The tumor cells showed a low mitotic index (5%). She was treated with denosumab and hormonal therapy: first with tamoxifen, which was later on replaced by letrozole and eventually by exemestane due to progressive bone metastases. Because of progression of the primary tumor and the fear of future wound ulceration, the patient decided to undergo a left-sided mastectomy and prophylactic contralateral mastectomy in 2013.\nAt the initial presentation in May 2016, complete blood count, renal and liver function tests were normal, C-reactive protein was not elevated. Cancer antigen (CA) 15.3 was elevated (98 kU/l vs. 61 kU/l 8 months earlier, ref. < 30), there was a normal value of carcinoembryogenic antigen and CA 125. Left colonoscopy showed narrowing of the anal canal due to an anorectal mass and biopsies were taken. Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) revealed thickening of the anorectal wall and the soft tissues presacral and showed a few small lymph nodes in the anterior perirectal fat tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed diffuse wall thickening of the rectum and anal canal and infiltration of the presacral fat tissue and rectovaginal septum, more suggestive of inflammatory changes than of tumoral pathology (Fig. ). Except for bone metastases, no other metastatic lesions were identified on CT scan of the thorax and the abdomen. Anatomopathology revealed that the biopsies were consistent with metastatic rectal lesions of a primary lobular breast",

First for the deviated nose and flared nostrils, we performed open rhinoplasty involving implant change, columella strut formation, nasal tip plasty, onlay graft, and nostril sil reduction. This improved the nasal appearance, and the next major problem was deviated facial skin. We approached through a 5 cm intraoral incision on the upper gingiva, and much adhesion from previous surgeries was noted as expected. We meticulously undermined and elevated the facial flap of both sides, mainly involving the cheeks (). No nerves were damaged. The elevated facial flap was shifted to the left, and after finding the appropriate location, we sutured the middle portion of the flap to the periosteum of anterior nasal spine for fixation. Not too many sutures were done considering natural facial expressions in the future. One Silastic drain was inserted to the intraoral incision.\nDaily simple dressing was done postoperatively, and the drain was removed two days after the surgery.

According to prenatal documentation, her pregnancy was normal, without signs of preeclampsia.\nBecause of her previous history of the two unsuccessful pregnancies over the last three years, she had been through a full thrombophilia screening which had revealed that antithrombin III, factor V Leiden, PCGlob-FVNR, and protein C and S levels were within normal limits.

His overall nutritional status was good and had a normal height and build for his age with no history of weight loss. He had no other associated comorbidities. His family history was significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension and untreated pancreatic cancer and renal cancer. The rest of his history and test results were unremarkable. A physical examination was grossly unremarkable. Ultrasound of the abdomen was performed, with normal results. A chest X-ray was performed that showed a homogenous soft tissue density mass in the posterior mediastinum with no evidence of rib erosion. To evaluate the mass further, an MRI was performed (Figure ). The dimensions of the mass were 7.3 \u00d7 6.0 cm.\nA computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy of the mass was advised, which was carried out under general anesthesia. No complications were observed after the procedure and a post-procedural CT scan did not reveal any pneumothorax. Histopathology of the biopsy material showed multiple cones of tissue exhibiting spindle-shaped cells arranged haphazardly, having moderate cytoplasm and wavy spindle shaped nuclei. Scattered mature ganglion cells were also identified, characterized by abundant cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei; as such no immature element was identified nor was there any evidence of increased mitosis or areas of necrosis.

The pregnancy had been unremarkable. Her past medical history included endometriosis and infertility. Her past surgical history was significant for two cesarean sections and left salpingo-oophorectomy secondary to an ectopic pregnancy. Physical exam elicited severe, diffuse abdominal tenderness. Fetal heart tones were taken to be in the 140s and positive fetal movement was reported. Laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, amylase, and lipase, were within normal limits. The ER physician's leading differential diagnosis was of gastrointestinal etiology. An MRI and MRCP were performed to rule out appendicitis and gallbladder disease. The MRI was notable for a large amount of intraperitoneal fluid of unknown etiology; an intrauterine fetus was visualized.\nThe patient continued to experience intractable pain, worse with movement and breathing, despite IV pain medication. At that point she has been at the outside facility for approximately 12 hours. The patient was transferred to our facility under the joint care of the Obstetrics/Gynecology and General Surgery teams. Upon arrival, the patient's hemodynamic status had deteriorated. She presented with tachycardia, dyspnea, chest pain, and worsening abdominal pain. Her hemoglobin had fallen from 11.7 g/dL to 7.9 g/dL. Transabdominal ultrasound imaging revealed a single intrauterine pregnancy that was positioned low in the uterus, with marked thinning of the anterior myometrium at the site of the pregnancy, and significant hemoperitoneum. Fetal heart tones were steady in the 140s.

The patient had initially taken antipyretics and antibiotics but found no effect. On clinical examination, the patient was febrile, and his abdomen was soft without any guarding or rigidity. Routine investigation showed that the patient had diabetes, which was uncontrolled. The test results indicated that the patient also had a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate along with a high total leukocyte count and a high level of positive C-reactive protein. Therefore, insulin and empirical antibiotics were started immediately. An ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen revealed hepatomegaly, chronic pancreatitis, and splenomegaly with multiple splenic abscesses. An endoscopic examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract showed the presence of esophageal candidiasis with a dilated vein at the fundus. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen indicated chronic calcific pancreatitis with splenic vein thrombosis, multiple splenic abscesses with evidence of rupture and ascites, and bilateral pleural effusion with basal lung collapse. Blood culture report showed the presence of B. pseudomallei, which was sensitive to imipenem and aminoglycosides, and so the patient was put on antibiotics. A few days through the course of treatment, the patient complained of low back pain. Clinical examination revealed tenderness at the bilateral sacroiliac joints with no neurological deficit. Plain radiographic examination confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral sacroiliitis and, therefore, twice-daily sulfasalazine 500 mg was added to the treatment regimen. One week later, the patient presented again with unimproved back pain and paraesthesia and weakness in both the lower limbs.

The patient had undergone right radical mastectomy and followed chemoradiotherapy following the diagnosis. The primary tumor was multifocal (5 different focuses) and located in upper and lower outer quadrants of the breast. The size of the largest tumor focus was 2.2 cm. The immunohistochemical study showed positive Estrogen Receptor. All of the 33 dissected axillary lymph nodes were free of metastasis. Post surgical staging was stage IIB. In follow up, bone and lung metastases appeared and relevant treatment was performed. Initially, she had noticed a moderate hearing loss in her left ear, but mentioned no otalgia, otorrhea, tinnitus, or vertigo. Physical examination revealed complete obstruction of the left EAC by a soft tissue mass. No neurologic symptoms were observed. HRCT of the temporal bone showed that totally obstructed left EAC by soft tissue density mass, but no bony erosion or destruction (Fig. ). MRI showed well defined, fusiform, soft tissue mass entirely filling the left EAC. The mass was iso-intense with muscle on T1-weighted images, slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Following the administration of the gadolinium based contrast agent homogeneous enhancement was seen. Although the mass was located in both bony and cartilaginous EAC, there was no sign of bony or cartilaginous invasion (Fig. ). DWI showed slightly hyperintense signal on isotropic trace image and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map revealed slightly restricted diffusion in the mass.

(Radiographs in Figure and show the left clavicle after the initial injury sustained in July 2009 and symptomatic non-union in February 2010 respectively).\nThe patient underwent surgical intervention with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using a lateral clavicle locking plate (Periloc, Smith and Nephew) and iliac crest bone grafting of the left lateral clavicle in March 2010. The procedure was performed through a transverse incision. The nonunion site was debrided. Bone graft from the iliac crest was inserted and the fixation was performed using the locking plate; five of the eight lateral 2.7 millimeter (mm) screws allowed by the plate were inserted, though the lateral fragment of the clavicle was only large enough to allow insertion of two screws. The patient was discharged with the arm immobilized in a sling. Outpatient physiotherapy was arranged and instructions were given to perform pendular exercises within a pain free range. Flexion and abduction were restricted for the first 6 weeks.\nFollow-up radiographs 6 weeks later showed that the plate had failed and pulled out of the lateral fragment []. The plate caused significant tenting of the skin and therefore removal of metalwork was done. The nonunion was managed by stabilizing the medial fragment with a coracoclavicular sling, fixed with a 3.5 mm screw and washer.\nWhen reviewed 8 weeks postoperatively, the patient had an Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) of 28.

She denied complaints of fever, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, urinary symptoms and vaginal bleeding or discharge. However, she had a history of mild chronic constipation since childhood, with sporadic use of laxatives, which had never been investigated.\nUpon physical examination, our patient was hydrated, well-nourished, had a normal blood pressure and heart rate, and had no respiratory distress. On gynecological examination, it was impossible to insert the speculum and bimanual palpation revealed a large abdominal mass of hard consistency extending from her right iliac fossa to her right upper quadrant, apparently displacing our patient\u2019s uterus to the left. A large quantity of impacted stools was found within her rectum and anal verge.\nA pelvic ultrasound revealed a single in uterus pregnancy of twelve weeks and six days (by biometric measures) and a solid dense tumor occupying the right quadrants of her abdomen, which made it difficult to correctly assess her ovaries.\nTo classify the nature of the tumor, we performed abdominal and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because this is considered to be a safe imaging study with regards fetal exposure to radiation. The MRI demonstrated a large abdominal and pelvic mass consistent with a megarectum and megasigmoid (Figures ), with fecal impaction, which exerted a mass effect over the adjacent structures, including her uterus.

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed two homogeneous pleural nodules (diameters of 2 and 4 cm) in the left upper lung field (Fig. ). As a result, two consequent CT-assisted transthoracic core-cut biopsies were performed. From both biopsies, the histopathology examination was inconclusive (haemorrhagic and non-specific tissue).

The histopathology examination of the specimen showed normal splenic tissue (Fig. ). Only with the histopathology report in hand, a detailed medical history was taken.

She was otherwise well. Physical examination was unremarkable except her BMI was 16 kg/m2. Her upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a superficial mucosal irregularity from 25\u201335 cm with friability and contact bleeding. There was no evidence of external compression of the oesophagus on endoscopy. The biopsy of oesophageal lesion revealed a well differentiated squarmous cell carcinoma. Her preoperative contrast enhanced CT of thorax and abdomen showed a normal oesophagus without any luminal lesions or wall thickening. However, it showed an abnormal right subclavian artery (Figure ) running behind the thoracic oesophagus above the carina. There was no evidence of locoregional spread, mediastinal lympadenopathy or evidence of distant metastases. Therefore she was planned for a transthoracic oesophagectomy.\nThe thoracic cavity was approached by a mini thoracotomy [] as it provides adequate access to the oesophagus, aberrant vessel and associated with less post-operative respiratory complications when compared to conventional posterolateral thoracotomy.

During thoracic oesophageal mobilization, there was an abnormal retro-oesophageal R/subclavian artery arising from aortic arch above the carina (Figure ).

She reported no other upper or lower gastrointestinal symptoms.\nThe patient had a history of hoarseness since the first months of life. When she was one year old she presented with recurrent blisters, superinfected skin, and mucous membrane lesions that progressed to affect the whole body. Histological analysis of skin biopsies taken at the age of three showed deposition of eosinophilic hyaline PAS-positive material in the dermis and around small blood vessels, confirming the clinical diagnosis of LP. Her parents were nonconsanguineous and no other family members were affected.\nThe hoarseness progressed over the years, and she experienced recurrent superinfected blisters. The skin lesions healed after several treatments with different drugs, including etretinate and chloroquine, but visible scars developed in the areas where the lesions have been present. There was no history of seizures or neuropsychiatric abnormalities.\nPrevious laryngoscopy revealed thickening of the vocal cords and nodules on the base of the tongue and supraglottic portion. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed symmetrical calcifications on the amygdaloid nucleus and uncus.\nOn admission the patient had a hoarse voice, and multiple scars were visible on the face and body. Upper endoscopy showed multiple yellowish nodules throughout the esophagus (), body of the stomach (), and duodenum. There was no evidence of esophagitis or gastritis. Histological examination revealed deposition of eosinophilic hyaline material in the lamina propria and submucosa and around blood vessels (). The material was positive on periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining and negative on Congo red staining, confirming the diagnosis of LP.

His preoperative MRI demonstrated a right-sided facet cyst at L3-4 along with lateral recess stenosis. Transforaminal epidural steroid injections only provided temporary relief, and so surgical intervention was offered. Preoperative CT scan () showed an adequate amount of space beneath the right-sided L4 pedicle screw for placement of a 5.5 mm cortical screw; however, the left-sided residual pedicle space was much smaller. After shared decision-making, we decided on proceeding with adjacent segment fusion and decompression. The patient was taken to the operating room, and after successful completion of the lateral interbody fusion, he was positioned prone on the Jackson table. After exposure and localization of the appropriate level, the following technique was utilized for cortical screw instrumentation.\nIntraoperatively, exposure is only needed laterally to the level of the pars at both levels and no further. There is no need for wide exposure beyond the pars laterally. In fact, the previous instrumentation was not seen within the operative bed. The C-arm was then brought in, and a perfect AP X-ray of the L4 pedicle was obtained. The start site for the cortical screw in terms of medial to lateral start site is then marked and the cranial-caudal start site estimated as well. Lateral C-arm X-ray is then used to confirm the cranial-caudal start site and angle. Based on the preoperative CT scan, we aimed to be just distal to the existing pedicle screw. The pedicle is then drilled aiming parallel to the pedicle screw on the lateral view but heading out slightly laterally on the AP.

No other workup was done at the time, and no other lesions were clinically detectable. She had been very active and played tennis regularly. She was assessed with a hip ultrasound for her right groin pain and was prescribed physiotherapy. During physiotherapy, she felt a snap in her right groin and was no longer able to ambulate without a walker. Initial radiographs demonstrated a lucent intramedullary lesion within the subtrochanteric region\u2014further characterized by a focally aggressive appearance with cortical destruction and lytic expansion of the lesser trochanter (Figures and ). A ground-glass appearance, typical of fibrous dysplasia, was also noted in the mid-femoral shaft ().\nFurther workup included a Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis which showed multiple hepatic and renal cysts but no evidence of a primary carcinoma or lung metastases. Bloodwork including serum protein electrophoresis was normal. A Total Body Bone Scan (TBBS) revealed increased uptake in the right proximal femur and two areas of relatively mild uptake in the mid femur. Fat-suppressed T2 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) displayed an intermediate to high signal lesion within the medullary cavity of the proximal and mid right femoral shaft (). In line with the initial radiographs in which two benign sites of fibrous dysplasia were noted, in the third proximal lesion, there was cortical destruction with an extraosseous soft-tissue mass in the region of the lesser trochanter.

Four months after the beginning of second-line chemotherapy and 1 week before hospitalization, she was febrile with a temperature of 38.0\u00b0C and consulted the outpatient department. She presented with no accompanying symptoms other than fever and showed no abnormalities in physical examinations. Moreover, her complete blood count tests, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and blood culture revealed no significant findings; therefore, she was discharged home with oral antipyretics. However, 4 days later, she was febrile again with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C along with drowsiness and was admitted to our hospital. After admission, she almost returned to full consciousness without headache and meningeal irritation signs.

The total amount of iopamidol (Bracco Imaging Italia S.r.L.) administered during the procedure was 110 ml. The DSA showed that the patient had bilateral embryonic posterior cerebral arteries, 40% stenosis of the left middle cerebral artery and tortuous vertebral arteries bilaterally. There was no obvious calcification of the aortic arch; angiography of the arch using 25 ml iopamidol was performed only once. Ten minutes after the aortic arch angiography, the patient experienced mild headache. The pain was bearable, and the patient could cooperate during the remainder of the procedure. The DSA was completed 20 min later. No haemorrhage or vasospasm was detected during the procedure. The headache was continuous, and the patient suffered nausea and vomiting. The immediate physical examination showed no obvious abnormal sign. The patient was treated with 8 mg ramosetron and 10 mg dexamethasone. After 20 min of observation, the symptoms were relieved. Her cerebral CT scan at the time was normal (Fig. a, b, c). Two hours later, the patient manifested dizziness with nausea and vomiting and was treated with 8 mg ondansetron and 20 mg diphenhydramine. Meanwhile, compound sodium chloride injection was used to facilitate the elimination of the contrast agent. The treatment alleviated her symptoms. Four hours after the procedure, the patient re-experienced dizziness; thus 5 mg dexamethasone was administered but resulted in no alleviation until after 11 h wherein dizziness was relived but her blood pressure was 183",

Extraoral examination revealed no abnormality including TMJ, lymph nodes, facial symmetry, and lateral profile. Intraorally, the patient had multiple old discolored composite restorations in the anterior area in both arches with recurrent caries underneath. The patient had wear of the maxillary anterior teeth and had multiple missing teeth with deficient alveolar ridges. He also had a large old restoration on #22 with recurrent caries that caused recession of the gingiva apical to the tooth. Additionally, large old restorations on multiple posterior teeth were noted with periapical radiolucency on tooth #36 related to an old root canal treatment. The patient also had midline diastema and retroclined maxillary anterior teeth with a normal molar relationship. The anterior tooth malposition was expressed by the patient as a concern when he smiles. Periodontal status of anterior teeth was fair with minimal bone loss. However, localized horizontal bone loss was evident in the posterior area, especially in the maxillary right posterior area with maxillary sinus pneumatization ().\nDiagnosis included pseudo-class III malocclusion accompanied by dental wear of maxillary anterior teeth and midline diastema. He also had recurrent caries related to the old defective composite restorations in both maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth. Additionally, the patient had recurrent caries on multiple maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth with periapical radiolucency related to tooth #36. After diagnosis and treatment plan presentation, the patient agreed on extracting tooth #22 as it was deemed unrestorable.

    "original_text": "An adult captive male bateleur eagle (Terathopius ecaudatus) estimated to be 32 years old and weighing 2.4 kg was presented for evaluation of left hindlimb lameness. The animal had been transferred from another institution 4 weeks prior to presentation with a history of osteoarthritis at the left intertarsal joint and an asymptomatic systolic heart murmur. Laxity and varus deviation of the distal left hindlimb at the intertarsal joint were first observed 2 years prior to presentation at the animal's previous institution. It had also been treated for several previous episodes of bilateral pododermatitis.\nSeveral days after transfer into a new enclosure, the animal began to exhibit intermittent non-weight-bearing left hindlimb lameness and was prescribed tramadol (5.5 mg/kg bodyweight (BW) orally twice daily) for pain management. The animal failed to sufficiently respond to this treatment over the course of 1 month and began spending increased time in a sternal position or on the ground of the enclosure. Under general anesthesia with isoflurane gas and oxygen, a physical examination with radiographs, complete blood count, and plasma biochemistry was performed to evaluate the lameness. Physical examination revealed firm periarticular enlargement, reduced range of motion, subluxation, and dynamic varus deviation at the left intertarsal joint (). No evidence of pododermatitis was observed at either foot. Orthogonal view radiographs of the pelvic limbs revealed muscle atrophy of the left hindlimb, moderate soft-tissue expansion around the left intertarsal joint with an uneven joint space that was widened at its lateral and narrowed at its medial aspects on the dorsoplantar radiographic view, and evidence of degenerative joint disease at this joint (). A complete blood count and plasma biochemistry were considered unremarkable when compared to species reference values []. The chronic degenerative joint disease and instability likely associated with previous joint ligament or tendon rupture was thought to be the underlying cause of the lameness.

A primary site was not identified on CT of the head, neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis as well as quadruple endoscopy. Fine-needle aspiration of the neck mass was positive for a poorly differentiated carcinoma. The lesion was 1\u20131.5 cm in size in the right jugular digastric region just below the angle of the mandible. She received definitive radiation therapy to the head and neck region at Gershenson Radiation Oncology Center, Detroit, MI, from February 11th, 1987 to May 5th, 1987. She received treatment to the neck node and potential sites of primary via left and right lateral opposing ports to 3600 rads by means of Cobalt 60. After this dose, off-cord treatment was delivered to the left and right anterior neck to an additional 1440 rads. Finally, the site of cervical adenopathy was given an additional boost of 900 rads with 10 MV electrons. The lateral supraclavicular field and posterior neck were also treated.

He denied any loss of consciousness, confusion, seizure, numbness, weakness, or sensory loss. Vitally, the patient had a pulse of 105, blood pressure of 154/56, respiratory rate of 18, and body mass index (BMI) of 22.8.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and cervical spine showed no acute intracranial pathology, acute vertebral compression fracture, or gross subluxation. No acute vertebral compression fracture was seen on the X-ray of the pelvis. Past medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and prostate cancer with seed implants. The patient was a social drinker with no history of smoking. His family history was remarkable for diabetes mellitus type 2 in his mother.\nOn further evaluation, it was found that the patient had been treated for episodes of severe rigidity in his back and lower extremities bilaterally in a nearby hospital. The records were obtained and they revealed that he was positive for anti-GAD 65 antibody. The patient was diagnosed with SPS and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered, which as per records showed improvement in the patients' symptoms.\nThe patient was initially managed with gabapentin and clonazepam, resulting in decreased spasticity. Later, the patient was started on IVIG with minimal improvement in his symptoms. Episodes of spasms were observed, lasting up to three hours and the rigidity was relieved by IV lorazepam.
