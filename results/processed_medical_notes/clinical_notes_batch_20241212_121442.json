Physical examination revealed the forepart of the right elbow was more raised compared with the left side, a bony mass was palpable, and there was no tenderness and no feeling of bounce or reduction when pressing down. The scope of activity of the right elbow joint and forearm was significantly limited (elbow 80\u00b0 flexion, 20\u00b0 extension, and forearm 10\u00b0 pronation, 15\u00b0 supination), and no injuries of the extremity nerves or blood vessels were found. Plain X-ray of the right forearm showed a wide basal bony protuberance in the dorsal metaphysis of the right proximal radius, radial deformities, a small radial head with anterolateral dislocation, the radial shaft bending towards to the dorsal ulnar side, and bone absorption in the corresponding ulna. The ulna had no significant shortening or angular, varus, or valgus deformities. X-ray examinations of other parts showed no tumor lesions (Figure ).

Her history revealed premature rupture of membranes 04 days prior to her consultation, with continuous per vaginal flow of clear liquor. She declares that foetal movements had been present prior to membrane rupture. She eventually developed uterine contractions 4 days later with an associated cord prolapse visible at the introitus. This pushed her to consult at a health centre from where she was referred to our hospital.\nIn her past medical history, she was not diabetic nor did she bear any known chronic pathologies. There was no family history of diabetes nor malformations. Her first pregnancy two years earlier ended up in a clandestine voluntary termination of pregnancy by endo-uterine aspiration in the first trimester without any recorded complications.

He was born with tricuspid and pulmonary atresia and underwent a right BT shunt at 3 days of age. At 3 months, he had an atrial septectomy performed. Persistently elevated PA pressures precluded him from undergoing a Fontan procedure. He therefore functioned with a single LV filled by both right and left atria. His pulmonary flow remained via the BT shunt with baseline oxygen saturations around 80%. Additional medical issues included a 10-year history of recurrent atrial fibrillation requiring multiple cardioversions. He was placed on amiodarone and systemic anticoagulation. He also had pulmonary hypertension for which he was medically managed with an endothelin receptor antagonist, ambrisentan. Preoperatively, cardiology was consulted and performed a transthoracic echocardiogram. This revealed normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 62%. The single ventricle produced a high output state with a cardiac output near 17 L/min, as measured by quantitative Doppler stroke volume calculation. The echo also demonstrated mild LV hypertrophy without wall motion abnormalities. The remainder of the exam was consistent with tricuspid atresia, pulmonary atresia, an atrial septectomy, and a right BT shunt. Cardiology requested a specialist cardiothoracic anesthesiologist for this patient given his high-risk situation [].\nA laparoscopic approach was initially planned. His preoperative oxygen saturation was 78% with central and peripheral cyanosis. His baseline blood pressure was approximately 110/60 mmHg. A preoperative arterial catheter was placed for blood pressure monitoring. Anesthesia was induced with etomidate, fentanyl, and succinylcholine. Volume control ventilation was utilized with 600 ml tidal volumes resulting in peak airway pressures around 25 cm H2O. Following induction, a central venous catheter was placed without difficulty and a transesophageal echo probe inserted. He was maintained on sevoflurane at an end tidal concentration of 2.0% along with 50% oxygen. Target oxygen saturations were between 75% and 85%. Intermittent",

Her past medical history included a severe three-vessel CAD with myocardial infarction (MI), complex coronary artery bypass surgery and reconstruction of the mitral and tricuspid valve 6 month prior to admission.\nDuring the preoperative evaluation, she reported intermittent chest discomfort during exercise or stress. Thus, percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography was performed to evaluate further interventional options. The angiography showed a global hypokinesis of the left ventricle (LV) and akinesis of the posterior wall with a LV ejection fraction (EF) of 33%. Whereas the aorto-coronary vein bypass to the right coronary artery showed no pathology, the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending (LAD) bypass was compromised by a 70% stenosis of the subclavian artery proximal the bypass graft. This stenosis was technically intractable for revascularization [Figures and ].\nAs she developed symptoms of an upper intestinal obstruction due to tumor progression, the operation could not be postponed. To stabilize LV function and diastolic blood flow via the crucial LIMA to LAD bypass graft the perioperative use of an IABP was advocated.\nTo minimize perioperative cardiac stress and to obtain a sufficient postoperative analgesia a combined epidural and general anesthesia was attempted under invasive hemodynamic monitoring. General anesthesia was induced with midazolam, sufentanil, and propofol. Balanced Anesthesia was maintained with sevofluran continuous infusion of sufentanil. After placing a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe, the IABP was inserted via the right femoral artery. The first TEE examination showed a severely reduced LV function (EF 30%), an akinesis of the posterior wall and an II\u00b0 insufficiencies of the mitral and the tricuspid valve. With an augmentation rate of 1:1 and moderate catecholamine support, LV function and mean arterial blood pressure could be stabilized and kept in the range of \u00b110% of baseline values.

    "original_text": "We describe the case of a 51-year-old female who presented early in 2003 with a polyarthritis. She was initially thought to have rheumatoid arthritis and was treated with intramuscular triamcinolone and hydroxychloroquine. This was subsequently discontinued due to side effects of vomiting and diarrhoea. She presented shortly following this to a district General Hospital with renal failure, malignant hypertension, and microangiopathy. During her acute admission, she developed pulmonary oedema and seizures requiring intubation, intensive care admission, and haemofiltration. Renal biopsy was contraindicated at that time due to low platelets and bleeding risk.

Her immunological tests demonstrated a positive antinuclear antibody, titre 1 : 300, with both a speckled and nucleolar pattern. However, double-stranded DNA antibody was negative, and complement was normal. In view of her clinical and immunological findings, it was felt that her microangiopathy was related to an underlying connective tissue disorder, potentially a lupus/systemic sclerosis overlap.

Mild stenosis of the distal parent vessel and branch vessel origins was also noted.\nEmbolization through distal navigation was attempted with a Headway\u00ae DUO microcatheter over a Synchro2\u00ae Soft microwire. However, due to the distal location, navigation was ultimately unsuccessful. Surgical clipping with intraoperative DSA guidance was then performed.

A postoperative CT scan of the head demonstrated expected postoperative changes involving the parietal lobe []. Histopathological examination of the aneurysm sample confirmed triple-negative invasive ductal breast carcinoma []. After surgery, the patient remained neurologically intact. Six weeks after surgery, she underwent CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery to the region of the resected aneurysm and began treatment with chemotherapy.\nFour months later, the patient presented once again with acute severe headache.

He had no relevant past medical or family history, nor had he taken any medication. He used to smoke for more than 30 years and had been kicked the habit for more than 10 years. At the time of admission, his physical examination showed that the lung sounds in the right upper lung field were weakened. In order to assess the quality of his lung, he underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan and found that the density of the irregular soft tissue in the anterior segment of the right upper lung lobe was about 22mm\u00d719mm, and there were multiple burr shadows on the edges (). It suggested that the right upper lobe lung cancer was complicated by hilar and mediastinal lymph node metastasis. Then, the patient underwent a fine needle aspiration biopsy of the right lung mass, the pathologic diagnosis was large cell carcinoma (). Molecular analysis showed no epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene mutations, either. By direct sequencing, retrospective programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunostaining showed high PD-L1 expression with a tumor proportion score, more than 50%. Based on the examinations, a tentative diagnosis of lung cancer with T3N2M0 (stage IIIA, according to the seventh edition of TNM) was proposed. Given that the tumor was unresectable, the preferred treatment was sequential immunotherapy after simultaneous radiotherapy and chemotherapy. But the patient requested surgery strongly. After assessment by the multiple disciplinary team (MDT) in our hospital, we considered that the portal lymph nodes were swollen and had obvious adhesion with the right pulmonary artery and the right upper pulmonary vein, which could not be completely removed by surgery.

With development of renal failure, secondary hyperparathyroidism was noted. Due to her obesity, she was not eligible for a renal transplant or a SPK. At this point it was decided to offer her bariatric surgery, and, after extensive discussion, it was felt that a RYGBP was the best option for her in terms of weight loss. At the age of 32 years, she underwent uneventful robotic-assisted surgery; the stomach remnant was attached to the abdominal wall for potential future access.\nOver the next 2 years she lost 60 kg and underwent SPK during which the donor duodenal segment was diverted to a bowel loop distal to her Roux loop implant site into the common channel. Induction immunosuppression with alemtuzumab was followed by maintenance with tacrolimus (trough levels 5-7 ng/mL), mycophenolate-mofetil (2 g daily), and a steroid taper. She was CMV seronegative and received a graft from a CMV positive donor and received standard prophylaxis with oral ganciclovir (GCV) for 100 days. Within 100 days posttransplant, she was readmitted to the hospital with acute CMV disease, which was successfully treated with intravenous ganciclovir.\nShortly after this episode the patient was found to have skin lesions on her right leg, which were diagnosed as calciphylaxis.

Preoperative computed tomography (CT) and echocardiography revealed a giant cyst (12 \u00d7 10 cm in diameter) occupying a large area around the left atrium and ventricle, and it was present behind the pulmonary artery. Based on the preoperative CT findings, a pericardial or an epicardial cyst was suspected. Additionally, attachment of the cyst to the left atrium, left ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary vein was suspected (Fig. ). Compression of the left atrium and ventricle was considered to be the cause of her symptoms. Her hemodynamic condition was stable.

However, we believed that the cyst was more likely a pericardial cyst because a pericardial cyst is more common than an epicardial cyst. Therefore, resection involving video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was planned initially. However, the pericardium was intact and an epicardial cyst was diagnosed intraoperatively. As preoperative CT showed compression of the left atrium, ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary vein, adhesion was suspected. Additionally, the possibility of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was considered. Therefore, open surgery through median sternotomy was performed. The cyst was found to be attached to the visceral pericardium involving the left atrium and pulmonary artery. Contrary to our expectation, the left ventricle was not involved. Additionally, coronary vessels were not involved. The cyst was most tightly attached to the main pulmonary artery. Thus, it was thought to have originated from the pulmonary artery (Fig. ).

The lesion appeared as a flat protrusion in the lesser curvature of the lower third of the stomach (Fig. ). Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) showed a 23 \u00d7 12-mm, hypovascular, heterogeneous lesion thickening the second and third gastric layers. The findings strongly suggested scirrhous gastric cancer (Fig. ). Although the lesion biopsy revealed no evidence of malignancy, our suspicion of scirrhous gastric carcinoma persisted due to the configuration of the tumor and our EUS findings. We performed an endoscopic open biopsy to make an accurate diagnosis. However, evaluation of the specimen revealed only slight chronic inflammatory cell invasion. Computed tomography (CT) scanning showed only gastric wall thickening at the angle of the stomach (Fig. ). Positron emission tomography-CT showed no evidence of metastasis or abnormal uptake in the tumor (Fig. ). The laboratory findings were normal as were levels of tumor markers (CEA, 1.6 ng/ml; CA19-9, 12 U/ml).\nIn spite of these findings, given our high level of suspicion, we decided to perform surgery to obtain a definitive diagnosis and treat the tumor. We chose gastric wedge resection using a combined laparoscopic and endoscopic method for several reasons. Firstly, the biopsy did not show cancer, but the tumor configuration strongly suggested malignancy; therefore, we selected a non-exposed method to prevent interoperative dissemination of tumor cells. Secondly, the tumor appeared to be a submucosal tumor (SMT), and gastric wedge resection using a combined laparoscopic and endoscopic method is among the safest procedures for resection of gastric SMTs [, ]. Lastly, we chose a wedge resection because if the tumor was not malignant, a distal gastrectomy could be considered excessive.

He was deemed suitable for transplantation and was put on the waiting list once his eGFR fell below 15 mL/min. He suffered from hypertension requiring Amlodipine, Lisinopril, and Doxazosin and was also taking Omeprazole and Calcichew. LD had negative serology for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, CMV, HIV, and VDRL syphilis but positive for EBV and chickenpox. He had a 5-year pack history of smoking; however, his exercise tolerance was excellent. He started peritoneal dialysis in June 2012.\nLD underwent renal transplantation in January 2014 with a kidney from donation after brain death (DBD). The donor was a 50-year-old female who died from hypoxic brain injury due to hanging and had a creatinine (Cr) of 430 mmol/L. The tissue mismatch was 110. Pretransplant biopsy of the sister kidney at another centre showed severe acute tubular injury. The transplanted kidney was initially slow to perfuse but this improved as soon as the systolic BP was raised to 150 mmHg. At perfusion, the cold ischaemia time was 14 hours and 20 minutes and the anastomotic time was 37 minutes.\nIn the immediate postoperative period, LD had a significant bleeding of approximately 1120 mL and he was therefore taken back to theatre for exploration. At surgery, bleeding was noticed from a small branch of the renal artery where a surgical clip had come off. The bleeding artery was ligated and haemostasis was achieved. Blood clots were evacuated and the wound washed out and closed. As a result of the haemorrhage, his Hb dropped from 86 to 68 g/L and he was transfused with four units of red blood cells and two units of fresh frozen plasma. Subsequently, LD developed hyperkalaemia which was treated successfully with insulin and dextrose. There was no significant urine output.",

Fifteen years ago, she was admitted for the first time with a frontal meningioma and underwent gross tumor resection. The tumor had recurred locally and had been totally resected for the second time 1 year before her last presentation. The postoperative histopathology confirmed the presence of an atypical meningioma. However, that patient refused adjuvant irradiation after her second surgery.\nPhysical examination revealed bilateral submandibular and upper cervical lymph nodes. The largest one was measured approximately 3 cm in diameter. In addition, she has persistent right-sided hemiplegia since the first surgery. Other examinations were normal with no neuropathic deficiency. Sonography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral lymphadenopathy of upper jugular, middle jugular, and parotid groups (levels II, III, and VIII, according to Robbins modified system). Some of those showed necrosis center ().\nCareful upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and flexible endoscopy of ear, nose, and throat yielded no abnormality. An excisional neck node biopsy was performed, resecting the left level II node. Microscopically, the node was composed of spindle cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) showed a 23 \u00d7 12-mm, hypovascular, heterogeneous lesion thickening the second and third gastric layers. The findings strongly suggested scirrhous gastric cancer (Fig. ). Although the lesion biopsy revealed no evidence of malignancy, our suspicion of scirrhous gastric carcinoma persisted due to the configuration of the tumor and our EUS findings. We performed an endoscopic open biopsy to make an accurate diagnosis. However, evaluation of the specimen revealed only slight chronic inflammatory cell invasion. Computed tomography (CT) scanning showed only gastric wall thickening at the angle of the stomach (Fig. ). Positron emission tomography-CT showed no evidence of metastasis or abnormal uptake in the tumor (Fig. ). The laboratory findings were normal as were levels of tumor markers (CEA, 1.6 ng/ml; CA19-9, 12 U/ml).\nIn spite of these findings, given our high level of suspicion, we decided to perform surgery to obtain a definitive diagnosis and treat the tumor. We chose gastric wedge resection using a combined laparoscopic and endoscopic method for several reasons. Firstly, the biopsy did not show cancer, but the tumor configuration strongly suggested malignancy; therefore, we selected a non-exposed method to prevent interoperative dissemination of tumor cells.

She had been compliant with her medications, as confirmed by her and her son. However, she presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a one- to two-hour history of difficulty with speech and right-sided weakness, which she had developed while having breakfast.\nIn the ED, she had a blood pressure of 134/87 mmHg, pulse of 141 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 26, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Physical examination revealed complete paralysis of the right upper and lower extremities and aphasia with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 22. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed AF with a heart rate of 116. CT scan of the head showed no evidence of acute infarct, acute intracranial hemorrhage, or mass effect, as showed in Figure .\nStill, a CT angiogram showed complete occlusion of the M1 branch of the left middle cerebral artery, as shown in Figure .\nFibrinolytic therapy was withheld as she was on anticoagulation therapy for AF and had taken a dose less than 12 hours before her symptoms developed. She immediately underwent a successful mechanical thrombectomy and was transferred to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring.

Past medical history was significant for traumatic T10-L1 compression fractures approximately 35 years prior to the anoxic event, resulting in paraparesis which gradually resolved with laminectomy/fusion and physical therapy; we have no information about his gait prior to the anoxic episode although he had been functionally independent.

Other medications included baclofen 15 mg bid, citalopram, simvastatin and omeprazole.\nAt baseline, his gait was fast and impulsive, hypermetric with a wide base, strong heel strike and arms held in abduction; he fell frequently, mostly as a result of his poor safety awareness and visual impairment. He was unaware of his gait problems and was always curiously reticent to use a wheelchair. There had never been any problems with gait initiation nor any signs of parkinsonism.\nApproximately nine years after the anoxic insult, he began to develop problems with gait initiation, characterized by taking multiple stuttering in-place steps before starting and to a lesser extent in association with turns.

As the GIF worsened, he was noted to be unable to shift his center of gravity forward, and he bore his weight on his heels; he ultimately fell backward a few times while trying to start.

In the week preceding his presentation to an outside hospital, he had increased his intake of ondansetron 4 mg tablets up to 40 tablets/day because of intractable nausea and vomiting. He was initially hospitalized for a progressively worsening headache of 1 week duration. Initial computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral cerebral edema in the parietal and occipital lobes in the setting of elevated blood pressure (BP). However, 3 days into his admission, following initial improvement in his blood pressure with oral anti-hypertensive medication, but in the setting of continued use of the ondansetron, he developed sudden onset near complete blindness with inability to count fingers from one foot away but bare light perception. His blood pressure was measured as 190/110. Computed tomography (CT) head imaging revealed similar cerebral edema in the posterior cortex but new intra-parenchymal hemorrhage (Fig. ). The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our institution but despite supportive treatment, his condition worsened while CT imaging findings remained unchanged. No angiography was obtained, as it was felt to likely be inconclusive in the setting of massive hemorrhage. A CT venogram demonstrated no evidence of venous sinus thrombosis. Invasive intracranial monitoring with a Licox\u00ae monitor revealed variable to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) ranging from 10 to 50 mm Hg. The patient was aggressively treated with hyperosmolar therapies and other supportive measures. He stabilized and after a protracted hospitalization was eventually discharged to rehabilitation. At the 12 week follow-up, he was noted to be independent in most of his activities of daily living.

Follow-up was negative until February 2009 when a whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan revealed lung nodule with a major diameter of 2.8 cm in the inferior left lobe. Considering the long disease-free survival time (24 months) along with the presence of single metastasis, a left lung wedge resection was performed. The histology confirmed the diagnosis of metastasis from clear cell RCC. About 5 months later, a spiral CT showed a new malignant micronodule in the right superior lung lobe and nodules ranging from 2.8 to 1.8 cm in the left and right adrenal glands, respectively. Patient's Karnofsky Performance Scale score was 90% and he was classified in the favorable risk group according to both MSKCC and Heng's score criteria. In August 2009 he started a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI), sunitinib 50 mg per day (4 weeks on and 2 weeks off). After 2 cycles of treatment, a grade 3 mucositis occurred but after 3 weeks of break it declined to grade 1. Thus, he resumed therapy at the lower dosage of 37.5 mg per day (4 weeks on and 2 weeks off). The whole-body CT scan, regularly performed every 3 months, demonstrated a stable disease (SD) as best response until June 2011 when, after 15 cycles of therapy, it revealed a progressive disease (PD) at the left adrenal gland which was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Therefore, in August 2011, a second-line therapy with everolimus 10 mg per day was started.

The lesion increased in size over the next few weeks and showed no improvement with a 2-week course of antibiotic treatment (Keflex). Due to the progressive increase in the size of the lesion, the patient was referred to a general surgeon and underwent an incisional biopsy. As seen in Figures and , the biopsy showed fragments of squamous epithelium with hyperkeratosis, keratotic plugging, and filiform acanthosis. These features were interpreted as consistent with a squamous papilloma. On review at our institution, we agreed with the originating pathologist's description of the lesion. However, due to the patient's clinical history and the degree of hyperkeratosis and keratotic plugging, in our opinion, findings were more consistent with hyperkeratosis of the nipple.\nThe patient delivered a healthy infant but was unable to nurse on the right side due to sloughing of the nipple skin and pain. In addition, the lesion continued to increase in size. On physical examination at our institution, a soft, exophytic mass of the right nipple was noted. The areola was uninvolved. No other abnormalities in either breast and no axillary lymphadenopathy were detected. A mammogram was performed and revealed no masses, calcifications, or sites of architectural distortion within the breast parenchyma. The radiologist noted that, due to the heterogeneously dense breast composition, small masses could be obscured and a targeted ultrasound was performed. The ultrasound revealed an enlarged right nipple, approximately 1.7 cm in diameter with a hypervascular nipple mass. The subareolar ducts were normal in size, without evidence of an intraductal mass. Although the previous sample had been interpreted as benign, the biopsy was superficial, and, given the progressive increase in size, excision of the lesion was recommended. The patient underwent excisional biopsy of the right nipple lesion and,",

She was afebrile and in good clinical condition with otoscopic findings, characteristic of acute otitis media and concomitant oedema in the external auditory meatus of the left ear. Due to otorrhoea on the left side 4 days ago, the child started receiving antibiotic treatment per os with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid 457 mg/5 ml (90 mg/kg) every 12 h. Family history showed that the mother died 7 months ago at the age of 34 due to melanoma recurrence during pregnancy. She was diagnosed with melanoma at the age of 25, for which she was treated with chemotherapy with complete regression of the disease. During her pregnancy, she presented with a recurrence of melanoma with metastases in the liver, bones, lungs, and brain. She died 3 months after delivery. The child was initially treated as an acute mastoiditis on the left side according to our clinic's protocol, and a double intravenous antibiotic scheme of cefotaxime + clindamycin and dexamethasone was administered. Subsequently, a myringotomy was performed on both sides under general anaesthesia, and ventilation tubes were placed. A purulent fluid was drained from the left side, which was sent for culture. The child showed an immediate improvement in her clinical picture, showing reduced otorrhoea on the left and reduced oedema in the left zygomatic and retroauricular region after the following 24 hours. After the antibiogram results (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), the treatment was changed to ceftazidime and amikacin. Due to recurrence of the retroauricular oedema on the left after 7 days, a CT of the temporal bone with contrast was performed. An invasive lesion of the mastoid cavity on the left with widespread corrosion of the trabeculae of the bone was found, expanding intracranially (towards the cranial bones and the underlying meninx) (). A drilling of the mastoid on the left followed.",
