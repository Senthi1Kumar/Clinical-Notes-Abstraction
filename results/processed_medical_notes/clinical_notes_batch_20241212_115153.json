The patient denied the history of diabetes and had no bad habits, such as smoking and drinking alcohol. Physical examination at admission revealed that his body temperature was 36.2 \u00b0C and blood pressure was 196/119 mmHg. The patient was conscious and suffered from incomplete aphemia. Bilateral pupils were of the size and round, the diameter of pupils was 3 mm, and pupils were sensitive to light reflexes. Muscular strength of the limbs was about grade 4. Bilateral pathological signs were negative, and there was no significant abnormality noticed during nervous system examination. Head MRI conducted the next day after admission indicated no significant vascular malformations (Fig. b). General consultation evaluated that bleeding sites of the patient were slightly different from hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. The hematoma sites were close to the middle cerebral artery and the walking areas of its branches, mainly in the temporal lobes. Therefore, cerebral vascular hemorrhage and other causes could not be excluded, and head CTA was further suggested. Head CTA performed on 17th May 2017 showed that the patient suffered from intracerebral hematoma caused by aneurysm rupture at the M1 bifurcation of the left middle cerebral artery, without any significant subarachnoid hemorrhage (Fig. a).

Her serum amylase, lipase, aminotransferase, and bilirubin levels were within normal limits. Tumor markers including CEA, CA19-9, and AFP were not elevated. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of her abdomen showed a 5 cm tumor (Fig. ). The lesion was attached to and compressing the body of the pancreas, the left gastric artery, the body of the stomach, and the abdominal part of the esophagus superiorly. The wall of the mass was thin and not enhanced. Magnetic resonance images showed a multilocular tumor. Neither an internal nodule nor septations were noted.

Endoscopic ultrasonography showed that the cyst content had iso- and hypoechoic density with a thin wall and no mural nodules. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy was not performed. Differential diagnosis included a mucinous cystic neoplasm, a pancreatic cyst, or a retroperitoneal cystic lymphangioma. She was thus referred to the surgical department for evaluation.

He described the pain as burning in character and was constant. The pain was aggravated by food intake and was not relieved by over-the-counter medications. He rated the pain as 8 out of 10 in severity and he could not sleep because of the pain. The pain was associated with nausea and recurrent episodes of vomiting. The patient reported that he had been having abdominal pain that was similar in quality but much milder in severity than the current episode.

Postoperatively, the patient continued to suffer from constipation and severe pain during defecation. Therefore, he visited another hospital 1.5 1\u00bd months later, where physical examination revealed the presence of an anal stricture.

    "original_text": "A 35-year old female with chronic hepatitis B infection and liver cirrhosis was referred to our hospital due to severe mitral valve regurgitation and atrial fibrillation. A decision was made to first treat the hepatitis infection and initiate liver protection therapy with a combination of Entecavir, the antiviral agent, polyene phosphatidyl choline and then operate on the heart defects. Once normal liver function was regained, she returned to our center for surgery. After all presurgery examinations had been carried out, we performed a mechanical mitral valve replacement and radiofrequency ablation. On day 5 postoperation the mediastinum and pericardium drainage tubes were removed. A routine echocardiogram found moderate fluid accumulation in the pericardium and fluid in the left pleural cavity.

    "original_text": "A 32-year-old gentleman had inversion injury to his left ankle on 2007 resulting in persistent medial ankle pain. He was treated with physiotherapy without improvement. Radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his left ankle showed the presence of osteochondral lesion (OCL) of the medial talar dome (). Ankle arthroscopy and microfracture of the osteochondral lesion were performed on May 2008. His left ankle pain persisted after the operation and MRI of his left ankle was repeated and showed no interval change as compared to the previous MRI. Ankle arthroscopy was repeated on March 2009. Intraoperative findings showed that the medial talar OCL was covered with fibrocartilage and the other articular cartilage of the ankle joint was normal. However, his left ankle pain deteriorated afterwards as that he needed to walk with crutches. He complained of medial ankle pain and there was no rest pain or systemic upset. He was referred to our clinic for further management. Clinical examination showed that his left ankle was stiff with tenderness at the medial talar dome. Standing radiographs and MRI of his left ankle showed decreased ankle joint space without significant osteophytes formation, subchondral cyst, or subchondral sclerosis (). Blood tests and gallium scan did not suggest any underlying infection. Ankle arthroscopy and distraction arthroplasty with Universal Compress Hinge were performed on May 2010. Arthroscopic findings showed marked fibrosis of the capsule with minimal synovitis. Most of the articular cartilage of the ankle joint was gone with exposure of the subchondral bone. There was an osseous defect at the medial talar dome. The patient was advised on active ankle mobilization exercise and weight bearing walking as pain was tolerated. The external fixator was removed three months later and his left ankle pain persisted with weight bearing. His left ankle pain started to improve 12 months after the distraction arthroplasty. During the latest followup on May 2012, he did not experience left ankle pain on walking although the ankle motion was still limited. Radi",

She denied any history of trauma. Radiograph and magnetic resonance imaging were concerning for GCTB. She underwent curettage and cementation of the right distal femur lesion and histological examination confirmed the suspected diagnosis of GCTB. Approximately one year later, she developed local recurrence of the tumor, which was also curetted with additional use of cement. One year after the second surgery, a routine chest radiograph showed lung lesions suspicious of metastatic disease (). At the time she was feeling well, with only mild pain in her right knee. Computed tomography (CT) imaging verified the presence of several pulmonary nodules including a large right lower lobe (RLL) mass measuring 5.6 cm (). CT-guided core needle biopsy of the largest lung mass confirmed metastatic GCTB ().\nAfter discussion at a tertiary center musculoskeletal tumor board the patient was started on denosumab therapy. Treatment was initiated with a loading dose of 120 mg every week for three weeks. She was then transitioned to receive a dose of 120 mg every four weeks. She was also placed on daily calcium and vitamin D supplements.\nAt 3 months after the initiation of treatment she had repeat CT imaging of her chest. The scan showed the RLL mass had decreased considerably in size, now measuring 2.6 cm in its greatest dimension. There was also a decrease in size of the other pulmonary lesions (). No new pulmonary nodules were seen. Since then she has had CT imaging of her chest every three months and radiographs of her right knee every six months. She has been without subjective complaint at each follow-up visit.

Visual acuity (VA) in the right eye was hand movement and in the left eye 20/50. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD). Visual loss in the right eye was consistent with the degree of maturity of the cataract. Since it was impossible to view the posterior pole through the dense cataract, ultrasonography was performed and found to be normal. The left eye had a nuclear sclerotic cataract and a normal dilated fundus examination. Subsequently, the patient underwent a cataract extraction in the right eye by phacoemulsification with an implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens. Surgery was performed under topical anesthesia and was uneventful. On the first day after surgery, corneal edema was seen, attributed to the high energy required to aspirate the dense cataract; however, it resolved rapidly during the following days. Intraocular pressure on the first postoperative visit was 15 mm Hg. One month after surgery, VA was 20/50 and the ocular examination was normal.\nTwo months after surgery, the patient experienced a sudden loss of vision in the right eye. Upon examination, VA was 20/120 and a positive right RAPD was found. The optic disc was swollen with surrounding flame-shaped hemorrhages. He was diagnosed with NAION and was started on aspirin 100 mg daily.\nFour months later, the patient complained of decreased vision in his left eye.

He did not have a history of any previous injury or symptoms regarding his shoulders. Following unsuccessful attempts to reduce his shoulder under sedation in the accident and emergency department, he underwent a closed reduction under general anesthesia. The shoulder joint, on examination, was found to be unstable on internal rotation beyond 10 degrees. Two weeks following a closed reduction, he sustained a recurrence of dislocation whilst putting on his shirt. X-rays demonstrated the presence of a large reverse Hill Sachs defect (Fig. , ). While performing a closed reduction under general anaesthesia with fluoroscopic screening, this defect was seen engaging the glenoid on internal rotation beyond 10 degrees. Screening was performed in all degrees of rotation, both in the reduced and unreduced positions to assess the maximum volume of this defect. A decision was taken to surgically repair the defect over the anteromedial humeral head without the need for further CT scans as fluoroscopic screening suggested the defect to be of sufficient size to contribute to a recurrent dislocation.

The patient had a previous history of hypertension for more than 10 years, and was under medication to control and maintain the blood pressure to be around 130/80 mmHg. The patient denied the history of diabetes and had no bad habits, such as smoking and drinking alcohol. Physical examination at admission revealed that his body temperature was 36.2 \u00b0C and blood pressure was 196/119 mmHg. The patient was conscious and suffered from incomplete aphemia. Bilateral pupils were of the size and round, the diameter of pupils was 3 mm, and pupils were sensitive to light reflexes. Muscular strength of the limbs was about grade 4.

    "original_text": "In March 2018, a 60-year-old man presented to a private dental clinic with a history of painful swelling in the right angle of the mandible. The patient reported that in December 2017, he had visited another local dental clinic with a chief complaint related to pain in the right posterior mandibular region. His past medical history included controlled type 2 diabetes. The dentist requested a panoramic radiograph, and the diagnosis was a periapical infection related to the right third molar and badly decayed right second molar, and an extraction was performed based on the patient's history. After extraction, the patient reported continuous pain with an unhealed socket, and an antibiotic regime was initiated. As a result of the unresolved pain, and without a prescription from his physician, he packed the unhealed wound with diclofenac sodium daily.\nA panoramic radiograph was acquired from his first visit (), and it revealed an ill-defined radiolucent lesion posterior to the right third molar, as well as an abnormally irregular inferior border of the mandible. The clinical examination record did not mention any observation of an intraoral soft tissue mass or ulceration at that time. An extraoral examination revealed a swelling with paresthesia in the right mandibular angle (). A panoramic radiograph was requested and showed complete erosion of the right ramus, with the lesion extending to the body of the mandible (). The radiographic signs were highly suggestive of aggressive neoplastic changes, and advanced imaging was therefore recommended. Multi-slice computed tomography without contrast revealed a large soft-tissue mass lesion occupying the right side of the parapharyngeal region, extending from the inferior orbital margin to the lower neck region, resulting in a prominent right anterolateral contour bulge ().

A biopsy of the lesion was performed, with the histological result confirming periosteal osteosarcoma diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) of her thorax and emission computed tomography (ECT) scan demonstrated no metastases. Segmental resection of the proximal periosteal osteosarcoma with internal fixation grafting was performed. The histology report demonstrated the presence of periosteal osteosarcoma.

The patient had an existing diagnosis of NF One, but no other medical conditions. Denied any use of regular medication besides prenatal vitamins. The mass had been present since early childhood and had been stable in size since 11 to 12 years of age.\nPer the patient, the mass started to grow early in her first trimester and was noted to be more painful than in the past. The patient reported pain with minor trauma that lasted for days. No change in consistency of the mass was noted. No reported weakness or altered sensation in the leg, night sweats, fevers, chills, or weight loss by the patient. In her past pregnancy, the patient denied any change to the size of the mass or increase in pain like she was currently experiencing.\nThe physical exam was notable for multiple 2-3 mm hyperpigmented macules in the bilateral axilla. The upper extremities and back had large hyperpigmented tan macules and patches in various sizes consistent with Cafe au lait spots. The left thigh had a large 18 x 9 cm boggy hyperpigmented mass on the lateral side. It was pendulous and had multinodular consistency. The mass was moderately tender on palpation. The patient was noted to be able to ambulate without difficulty and had equal sensation and strength in both lower extremities.\nAfter discussion with the patient, she was prepped for punch biopsy of the mass. Multiple biopsies were taken from different areas of the mass to ensure adequate sampling.

The patient presented with transient hemiparesis, with MR imaging suggesting a previous additional, unrecognized cerebellar infarction. CT angiography of the neck and intracranial vessels was unremarkable. Ambulatory ECG monitoring did not detect any atrial fibrillation. Contrast transthoracic echocardiography suggested the presence of a patent foramen ovale with subsequent transoesophageal echocardiography confirming the presence of a PFO with an aneurysmal interatrial septum. In view of the absence of alternative mechanisms of stroke, MR imaging suggesting previous embolic events, and the desire to avoid lifelong anticoagulation, the patient was referred for percutaneous device closure.\nUnder general anaesthesia and transoesophageal echocardiography guidance, a 30 mm Amplatzer fenestrated atrial septal occluder was delivered using a 9 Fr delivery system. The device was released uneventfully () and the final appearance on fluoroscopy () and transoesophageal echocardiography was excellent; device position was confirmed with a \u201cpush-pull\u201d maneuver prior to device release. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed the following day demonstrating satisfactory device position with no evidence of pericardial effusion. The patient was then discharged on aspirin and clopidogrel. The patient remained asymptomatic. Routine repeat transthoracic echocardiography was undertaken six months following device implantation to assess for any residual shunt. The Amplatzer occlusion device was not visualized on transthoracic imaging with strongly positive right to left shunt noted. Subsequent transoesophageal imaging demonstrated absence of the occluder across the interatrial septum consistent with device embolization; the device could not be visualized in the main or branch pulmonary arteries. CT angiogram of the thoracic and abdominal aorta was performed and the device was located in the visceral abdominal aorta. There was no compromise of flow noted to either the visceral vessels or distal aorta.\nArrangements were then made for percutaneous device retrieval.

He also complained of pain in his left shoulder and arm. On examination, the air entry was found to be decreased on the left side of his chest. Radiography of his chest was done and a diagnosis of hemopneumothorax was made by the emergency physician. A chest tube was inserted in his left hemithorax and 150ml of blood was drained. There was relief in his breathing difficulty and air entry was found to be equal on both sides of his chest. There was visible deformity of the left humerus, with abrasions over the left scapular region, and no distal neurovascular deficit in the left upper limb. Local examination revealed a positive sulcus sign and anteriorly displaced humeral head along with unnatural mobility at the humeral shaft. A radiographic examination confirmed an anterior dislocation of the shoulder, with transverse fracture of the shaft humerus at the proximal one-third and distal two-third junction, along with fracture of the ipsilateral scapula and left-sided third, fourth and fifth rib fractures (Figure ). A computed tomography scan was done to outline the scapular fracture pattern, and decide its management (Figure ).

The clinical tachycardia presented with abrupt onset and offset and could be terminated by 5 mg of verapamil. She had undergone a left modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer 21 years prior. The patient had been diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes mellitus at that time. A chest radiograph revealed no evidence of cardiomegaly. Echocardiography revealed no evidence of structural heart disease with a normal left ventricular function. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at the time of admission demonstrated regular sinus rhythm with a narrow QRS complex and a normal axis (, left panel). An ECG recorded during an episode of palpitations revealed a narrow QRS complex tachycardia with a cycle length of 480 ms. The P wave polarity preceding the QRS complex was negative in leads V4-6, biphasic (initially negative and a late positive component) in leads V1 and V3, and undetermined in the limb leads (, right panel).\nAfter giving informed consent, an electrophysiological study was performed without sedation. Three catheters were introduced to the right atrium, the right ventricular apex, and at the His-bundle region via the femoral veins.

Ultrasound, CT angiography scan and subsequently catheter angiography demonstrated very high flow arterial venous fistula within the transplanted organ (Fig. ), likely to be the cause of the patients symptoms of decompensated heart failure. The main transplant artery and veins, as well as all intra renal branches were aneurysmal with extreme tortuosity, especially in the intra renal vessels. The maximum diameter of the main transplant artery was 12 mm with relative narrowing at the origin. Other salient findings were ectatic and tortuous iliac vessels (Fig. ). Given the decompensated heart failure being caused as a result of the high flow AVF, patient planned for super-selective embolisation of the arterio-venous communication under interventional radiology.\nInformed consent was obtained and patient readmitted for elective super selective renal transplant embolization, to be performed under general anaesthesia in order to control the patient\u2019s haemodynamic status. Given the knowledge of high flow through the AVM, plans were made to make both arterial and venous punctures. The contralateral left common femoral artery was punctured under ultrasound guidance and 6F sheath was inserted and positioned in the right common iliac artery. Through the sheath, the transplant artery was selected and 6mmx40mm angioplasty balloon was positioned and inflated at the origin of the transplant artery to reduce inflow and hence pressure into the AVM. The site of the AVM was approached",

Computed tomography (CT) showed that the tumor was enhanced during the arterial phase and washed out during the portal phase, and the tumor pressed the right anterior branch to the main branch of Glisson and the middle hepatic vein; hence, the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma was made (Fig. ). The indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min was 21.8%. Child-Pugh score was A. The patient tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody. He had a history of excessive consumption of alcohol, and alcoholic liver damage was considered as a possibility. Partial hepatectomy with segments IV + V and cholecystectomy with cystic duct-tube drainage were performed. Intraoperative findings indicated that the anterior branch of bile duct was exposed at the resected area, and some small bile ducts were ligated. On POD 1 following hepatectomy, bile leakage developed from the drain placed in the foramen of Winslow. CT showed fluid collection in the cavity between the liver and fistula to drain. Cholangiography via the endoscopic bile duct enhancement showed no communication between the common bile duct and abdominal cavity. Drip infusion cholangiography (DIC)-CT revealed the bile duct of the peripheral side. We maintained simple drainage to reduce the cavity. On POD 19, this patient had fever and CT revealed that the fluid collection has increased (Fig. ). Percutaneous drainage to the cavity near the liver cut surface was performed. Cholangiography via the c-tube did not show the anterior branch of the bile duct. Fistulogram from the drainage tube at the abdominal cavity showed the bile duct at segments V and VIII (Fig. ). We diagnosed the bile leakage from the isolated bile duct of segments V and VIII. Further management was needed to control the persistent biliary leak of 200\u2013250 mL/day",

Head CT performed within 3 h of onset of symptoms (Fig. a) showed hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe, and the patient was admitted in our department with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of \ufffd\ufffdhemorrhage in the left temporal lobe\u201d. The patient had a previous history of hypertension for more than 10 years, and was under medication to control and maintain the blood pressure to be around 130/80 mmHg. The patient denied the history of diabetes and had no bad habits, such as smoking and drinking alcohol. Physical examination at admission revealed that his body temperature was 36.2 \u00b0C and blood pressure was 196/119 mmHg. The patient was conscious and suffered from incomplete aphemia. Bilateral pupils were of the size and round, the diameter of pupils was 3 mm, and pupils were sensitive to light reflexes. Muscular strength of the limbs was about grade 4. Bilateral pathological signs were negative, and there was no significant abnormality noticed during nervous system examination. Head MRI conducted the next day after admission indicated no significant vascular malformations (Fig. b). General consultation evaluated that bleeding sites of the patient were slightly different from hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. The hematoma sites were close to the middle cerebral artery and the walking areas of its branches, mainly in the temporal lobes. Therefore, cerebral vascular hemorrhage and other causes could not be excluded, and head CTA was further suggested. Head CTA performed on 17th May 2017 showed that the patient suffered from intracerebral hematoma caused by aneurysm rupture at the M1 bifurcation of the left middle cerebral artery, without any significant subarachnoid hemorrhage (Fig. a).

Computed tomography (CT) showed that the tumor was enhanced during the arterial phase and washed out during the portal phase, and the tumor pressed the right anterior branch to the main branch of Glisson and the middle hepatic vein; hence, the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma was made (Fig. ). The indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min was 21.8%. Child-Pugh score was A. The patient tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody. He had a history of excessive consumption of alcohol, and alcoholic liver damage was considered as a possibility. Partial hepatectomy with segments IV + V and cholecystectomy with cystic duct-tube drainage were performed. Intraoperative findings indicated that the anterior branch of bile duct was exposed at the resected area, and some small bile ducts were ligated. On POD 1 following hepatectomy, bile leakage developed from the drain placed in the foramen of Winslow. CT showed fluid collection in the cavity between the liver and fistula to drain. Cholangiography via the endoscopic bile duct enhancement showed no communication between the common bile duct and abdominal cavity. Drip infusion cholangiography (DIC)-CT revealed the bile duct of the peripheral side. We maintained simple drainage to reduce the cavity. On POD 19, this patient had fever and CT revealed that the fluid collection has increased (Fig. ). Percutaneous drainage to the cavity near the liver cut surface was performed. Cholangiography via the c-tube did not show the anterior branch of the bile duct. Fistulogram from the drainage tube at the abdominal cavity showed the bile duct at segments V and VIII (Fig. ). We diagnosed the bile leakage from the isolated bile duct of segments V and VIII. Further management was needed to control the persistent biliary leak of 200\u2013250 mL/day",

Patient was symptomless for sometime but in due course developed periodic swelling and now since 6 months had noticed intermittent pus discharge.

Tracing of the sinus tract with gutta percha confirmed the involvement of the central incisor. The tooth was tender on percussion and palpation. The periodontal status was normal (probing depth <3 mm) with no mobility ruling out any periodontal pathology. The lateral incisor showed incompletely done root canal treatment. Radiographic examination of the central incisor revealed poorly obturated root canal with incomplete root formation. The root end had thin dentinal walls with apical flaring and periapical rarefaction of 2-3 mm []. The lateral incisor had intact periodontal ligament space and showed complete root formation. Electric and cold tooth vitality testing were performed for all the maxillary anterior teeth except the maxillary right central incisor. The right lateral incisors gave a negative response and all the other teeth gave a positive response. According to the clinical and radiographic findings, there were two treatment options available for the central incisor, either a surgical removal of the periapical lesion followed by retrograde filling or a nonsurgical endodontic retreatment with apexification.

She discovered a small mass in her right breast just after completing the breast feeding period, which increased in size gradually for 25 years. There was no nipple discharge, fever, history of breast trauma, hormone replacement therapy or family history of breast or ovarian cancer. She did have close contact with sheep and dogs.\nUpon physical examination, a large palpable mass with regular borders was identified within the right breast. The nipple, areola and skin were normal. There was no palpable lymph node in the right axilla. The left breast and axilla were normal, and systemic examination did not show any abnormality.\nHer mammograms showed two (large and small) oval and dense masses within the upper outer quadrant of the right breast (Figs and ). The largest mass was about 4 \u00d7 3 cm and multilobulated, and the small mass was about 1 \u00d7 1 cm well circumscribed in its contours.\nThere were associated calcifications at the periphery of the large lesion and diffuse linear microcalcifications at other areas of the breast. The left breast was within normal limits. The ultrasound revealed a large heterogeneous and lobulated mass that contained mixed hypo- and hyper-echoic degenerative contents with a small internal anechoic cyst at the periphery of the lesion in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. There were no associated enlarged axillary lymph nodes.\nInvestigation revealed that the complete blood count, chemistry and liver function test were within normal limits with the exception of the echinococcal hemagglutination test, which was positive. The chest x-ray and abdominopelvic ultrasound were normal.\nWe suspected a hydatid cyst because the patient came to our clinic from an epidemic area. We decided on mass excision. The risks and benefits of the procedure were clearly explained to the patient, and consent was obtained. The total mass excision was performed without any spillage,",

He has been working 8 h a day and 6 days a week. His work equipment consists of a monitor and a headset.\nHis equipments have no amplificator. The system is accessed by a password and the incoming calls are directed by team leaders to the related operators. He was mainly serving clients from mechanical maintaining and repair sector clients, thus he described frequent high pitch noise and parasite particularly at the beginning of the conversations. He said, \u201cI have to control the noise level manually since I do not have the amplificatory device\u2026.\u201d In his occupational history, he describes the time between high noise level and parasite and manual modification as 3-5 s. He also described ear pain after some of these exposures. A call is received every 3-5 min; 17% of the work time is passed in passive mode, waiting for a call. The breaks are managed by the operator himself or by the team leader. He also mentioned other employees with hearing problems during occupational history, but we did not have a chance to examine any other employees yet.\nHe reported no periodical health examinations and very limited occupational health and safety training was given to him only at the beginning of the job.

She described the pain initially as throbbing in nature that was exacerbated with activity and with ankle dorsiflexion and was relieved with rest and warm compresses. At that time, she noted a mass in her left calf that was about 2 inches in size, which did not fluctuate in size and was nontender.

He completed adjuvant chemotherapy and returned for an elective reversal of his ileostomy nine months postoperative. His preoperative workup included a colonoscopy which revealed exclusion colitis for which he was treated. He also underwent a gastrografin enema and computed tomography (CT) imaging of his abdomen and pelvis with no evidence of recurrence, obstruction, or distant metastases. On CT imaging, the proximal ileum appeared normal, but the distal ileum was not imaged. After his reversal, his postoperative course was complicated by persistent small bowel obstruction, for which he was managed conservatively for two weeks. He subsequently underwent a CT abdomen and pelvis, which was highly suspicious for anastomotic stricture.\nOn postoperative day 14, the patient underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy showing multiple adhesions around the previous reversal site with normal-appearing dilated proximal and collapsed distal small bowel. There was no localized stricture in the defunctionalized distal ileum. He underwent a resection of the prior reversal site and creation of a new side-to-side primary anastomosis. Despite creation of new anastomosis, his small bowel obstruction continued for additional two weeks. CT imaging and small bowel series were obtained, both modalities showing a narrowing of the ileum distal to the previous anastomosis (Figures and ). On hospital day 27, the patient underwent a final exploratory laparotomy with intraoperative findings of persistent collapsed bowel loops distal to the new anastomosis. The collapsed distal segment was resected, and an ileocolic anastomosis was created. On gross examination, the entire distal ileum was thickened without stricture (Figures and ).

The patient was an active smoker who suffered from morbid obesity with a body mass index of 43 kg/m2 and COPD as comorbidities relevant for this case report.\nThe patient was introduced to the surgeon during hospitalization at the gastroenterology department where a diagnostic workup due to a clinical picture of chronic small bowel obstruction was conducted. While taking the anamnesis, the patient reported frequent abdominal cramps, swelling, and pain in the area of the hernia that had intensified in the last few weeks. The physical examination revealed a large irreducible ventral hernia in the lower abdomen that was quite painful on palpation, but soft and, at that time, without signs of incarceration or strangulation. Taking into account the clinical picture with threatening hernia incarceration, the surgeon did not opt for preoperative optimization of the patient in terms of smoking cessation and starting a weight loss program but made an indication for semielective surgery.\nOn operative procedure, greater omentum, part of the transverse colon, and a cluster of small bowel loops with signs of chronic obstruction were found as hernial content.
