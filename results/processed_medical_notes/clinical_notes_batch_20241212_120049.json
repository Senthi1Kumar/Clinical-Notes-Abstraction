    "original_text": "A 15-year-old boy was referred to our unit with severe leg pain on a background of 1 week of claudication-type symptoms. On arrival, he had a dusky left lower leg with reduced sensation, reduced movements, and a capillary refill time of 7 s. Examination of the foot demonstrated an absence of the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. Medical history included meningococcal septicemia at 2 years old with no long-term sequelae. There was no family history of vascular disease. Blood tests revealed a normal prothrombin time of 14 s and a prolonged thrombin time of 194 s. A CT angiogram demonstrated complete occlusion of the left popliteal artery with additional thrombus within the profunda femoris artery (). The apparent cause for this was a mixed density lesion arising from the distal femur, compressing the femoral vessels.

An echocardiogram excluded a patent foramen ovale and subsequent imaging excluded a DVT.

She had an MRI scan in her home country, in which a complex cyst in the left ovary had been detected, suggesting an endometriotic origin. She wished to have a follow-up on the cyst. But the findings in the MRI could not be reproduced by ultrasound. Four months later, however, in the subsequent follow-up ultrasound scan, both of the ovaries as well as the rectovaginal septum showed newly developed, possible endometriotic lesions ().\nIn consequence of these findings, a hormonal treatment with norethisterone acetate was initiated.

The treatment recommendation was for primary surgery consisting of floor of mouth excision, bilateral selective neck dissections and radial forearm free flap (RFFF) reconstruction.\nHer past history was significant for a colonic perforation approximately 2 years prior to her presentation to our clinic. At that time she required a laparotomy and colostomy followed by an extended intensive care unit stay. She was right-hand dominant and denied any trauma or surgery to the left forearm or hand. She was a 50-pack year smoker and a heavy alcohol drinker. Pre-operatively she was assessed for RFFF harvest with a standard Allen\u2019s test and pulse oximetry plythesmography, which were both normal. She had a palpable radial pulse and no visible evidence of trauma at the donor harvest site.\nShe was taken to the operating room and underwent resection of the primary site. A RFFF measuring 5 \u00d7 4 centimeters was designed overlying the radial artery with the distal aspect of the skin paddle placed approximately 3 cm proximal to the left flexor wrist crease. The flap was raised in standard fashion. During the flap elevation, significant fibrosis was encountered at the distal aspect of the pedicle as well as along the flexor retinaculum underlying the pedicle.\nAfter the tourniquet was released, the skin paddle of the flap was not perfused. Assessment of the radial artery with pencil Doppler confirmed a pulse in the proximal artery but this was lost at the proximal end of the skin paddle. No pulse was obtainable within the borders of the flap. The distal artery clip was removed and there was no flow-through observed.

The pain had increased for the last 2 days in severity and was associated with episodes of emesis. The patient had a story of undetermined colitis, treated with medical therapy, actually in phase of remission.\nAt clinical examination, the abdomen appeared flat, with a generalized tenderness, painful to palpation, in particular in the left upper quadrant. Lab tests showed a white blood cell count of 15,400/mm3. Chest and abdomen X-Rays were normal and abdominal ultrasound was normal too. On the contrary, the CT scan with intravenous contrast medium revealed an aspecific thickening of a tract of small bowel with partial contrastographic enhancement near the left colon, with a modest dilatation of the lumen of small bowel upstream of the injury, as reported in .\nTherefore, in order to perform a resolute diagnosis, in presence of an inconclusive and nondiagnostic CT scan, we decided to perform an emergency exploratory diagnostic laparoscopy. In the operating theater, after the first laparoscopic entry in the abdomen according to the open Hasson technique, an exploratory laparoscopy was performed. All the abdominal cavity was explored and all the bowel was inspected: at 35 cm from the Ligament of Treitz, a jejunojejunal intussusception was found. We decided to reduce the jejunal intussusception in order to define the pathologic cause, suspecting the presence of a mass.

He was the first-born child to unrelated healthy parents, born at 38 weeks of gestation after an unremarkable pregnancy. His birth weight was 3.5 kg, and meconium was passed on the first day of life. The patient had no history of meconium ileus or diabetes mellitus and lacked family history of CF. Tracing back his medical history, the patient was formula feeding but failure to thrive with a weight of 6.8 kg at the age of 8 months and had intermittent diarrhea. For further evaluation of the condition of growth and development, the patient was taken to a local hospital at the age of 8 months, and received complete blood count and liver function tests. And the results indicated liver involvement with slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) with values of 78 and 82 U/L, respectively. The patient suffered from recurrently and slightly elevated ALT levels ranging from 70 to 92 U/L and AST levels ranging from 80 to 90 U/L. In addition, the common etiologies that easily lead to increased levels of ALT and AST were also excluded, such as cytomegalovirus and hepatitis B virus infection.

    "original_text": "This was a 40 year old, premigravida patient who initially presented to the infertility clinic at our institution for desired pregnancy. Her past medical history was significant for primary infertility. A successful intrauterine pregnancy was achieved via intrauterine insemination. Due to advanced maternal age, the patient underwent extensive prenatal testing and monitoring through the course of her pregnancy. All tests were normal, with the exception of a left ovarian mass that was incidentally detected by ultrasound during the third trimester. The patient was closely followed without prenatal surgical intervention. Her pregnancy advanced uneventfully, and labor commenced at 40-week gestation. Due to failure to progress, a caesarean section was performed resulting in the delivery of a healthy female infant. At the time of caesarean section, a left oophorectomy was performed.\nThe specimen was received fresh for intraoperative pathology consultation. On gross examination, it consisted of an intact, unilocular, thin-walled cyst measuring 15 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 5 cm and filled with clear fluid. Both the outer and the inner surfaces of the cyst were smooth. The cyst wall ranged from 0.1 cm to 0.8 cm in thickness and showed marked edema. Based on the gross findings, an intraoperative interpretation of benign ovarian cyst was made. No frozen section was performed.\nOn subsequent microscopic examination, the cyst was lined by single to multiple layers of large cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm (Figure ). Most cells showed small, round and regular nuclei, but focal cells displayed enlarged and bizarre nuclei with hyperchromasia and occasional mitosis (Figure ). The outer fibrous wall of the cyst showed edema and nests of luteinized cells that were morphologically similar to the cyst lining cells.

    "original_text": "A 49-year-old male smoker with a history of squamous cell carcinoma was found to have a 4 cm left hilar mass on CT scan. An EBUS FNA performed of the mass demonstrated abundant mucinous material with clusters of pleomorphic cells []. The nuclei were enlarged and hyperchromatic, with coarse chromatin and dense basophilic cytoplasm. The background showed abundant mucinous material with entrapped inflammatory cells and bronchial cells []. The ROSE was malignant, favoring a nonsmall cell carcinoma; however, it was uncertain if the mucin was associated with the neoplastic cells or simply a contaminant. The immunohistochemical stains performed on sections of the cell block revealed that the tumor cells were positive for p63, CK5/6, and negative for TTF1. In addition, the tumor was similar in morphology to the patient\u2019s prior lung biopsy with a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. The final diagnosis was metastatic squamous cell carcinoma with the mucin attributed to bronchial contamination.\nThis case illustrates the discrepancy or mismatch that may exist between background material and the cells of interest in EBUS FNA. For example, a mucinous background usually leads us to infer that there is a mucin-producing adenocarcinoma []; however, similar to pancreatic EUS-guided FNAs, mucin can be a contaminant from the needle path and is not necessarily produced by the tumor cells present. This is an important aspect of EBUS FNA to be aware of, particularly because cytopathologists often rely on the background material to aid in making a diagnosis and for subtyping tumors.\nWhen looking at an EBUS FNA with a mucinous background, there are two cytomorphologic clues that can help to determine if the mucin is truly indicative of a mucin-producing adenocarcinoma.

    "cleaned_text": "a 49-year-old male smoker with a history of squamous cell carcinoma was found to have a 4 cm left hilar mass on ct scan. an ebus fna performed of the mass demonstrated abundant mucinous material with clusters of pleomorphic cells []. the nuclei were enlarged and hyperchromatic, with coarse chromatin and dense basophilic cytoplasm. the background showed abundant mucinous material with entrapped inflammatory cells and bronchial cells []. the rose was malignant, favoring a nonsmall cell carcinoma; however, it was uncertain if the mucin was associated with the neoplastic cells or simply a contaminant. the immunohistochemical stains performed on sections of the cell block revealed that the tumor cells were positive for p63, ck5/6, and negative for ttf1. in addition, the tumor was similar in morphology to the patient's prior lung biopsy with a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. the final diagnosis was metastatic squamous cell carcinoma with the mucin attributed to bronchial contamination.\nthis case illustrates the discrepancy or mismatch that may exist between background material and the cells of interest in ebus fna. for example, a mucinous background usually leads us to infer that there is a mucin-producing adenocarcinoma []; however, similar to pancreatic eus-guided fnas, mucin can be a contaminant from the needle path and is not necessarily produced by the tumor cells present. this is an important aspect of ebus fna to be aware of, particularly because cytopathologists often rely on the background material to aid in making a diagnosis and for subtyping tumors.\nwhen looking at an ebus fna with a mucinous background, there are two cytomorphologic clues that can help to determine if the mucin is truly indicative of a mucin-producing adenocarcinoma. the first clue is the presence of columnar cells, or cells with voluminous mucinous cytoplasm or targetoid vacuoles with a central mucin droplet. a second clue is the presence of \"dirty\" mucin with entrapped inflammatory cells and debris, which usually signifies mucin contamination [",

Eight lymph nodes were examined with no evidence of nodal metastases. He was treated with adjuvant sunitinib on a clinical trial. The patient was unable to tolerate therapy, and sunitinib was discontinued after 1 month.\nOne year after nephrectomy, surveillance imaging demonstrated new pulmonary and hepatic lesions, as well as abnormal tissue in the left nephrectomy bed and left adrenal gland. Liver biopsy confirmed metastatic RCC. The patient was started on pazopanib as first-line therapy for metastatic disease. He had mild toxicity but did not require dose reduction or interruption. Ten weeks after starting pazopanib, a mixed response was seen on imaging. Although his pulmonary metastases were stable to slightly improved, his disease had clearly progressed in the liver (Fig. ). The patient was started on everolimus at this time.\nDisease in the lung, liver, adrenal gland, and nephrectomy bed was significantly improved after 11 weeks of everolimus therapy. His lesions continued to regress at the 6- and 9-month time points and remained stable for 3 years (Fig. ). At that time, an MRI of the orbit was ordered to evaluate ptosis and proptosis of the right eye. A solitary site of metastatic progression was discovered in the right frontal sinus causing erosion of the calvarium with extension to the scalp, mass effect on the right frontal lobe, and extension to the right orbit and ethmoid sinus.

The size of the neoplasia was 4.0 cm \u00d7 4.0 cm, 3.0 cm \u00d7 3.0 cm and 2.5 cm \u00d7 3.0 cm (Fig. ).\nEnhanced CT and MRI of the maxillofacial region were performed preoperatively. The surgery area was simulated using 3D image technology for the virtual surgery design and operation to be implemented. A safe resection range of 1.5 cm on the outer edge of the lesion was designed. One day before the surgery, the shape and range of the perforating branches were determined by Doppler ultrasound. The size and shape of the SCAIFP were designed to be elliptical and 15 cm \u00d7 7 cm in size.\nThe maxillofacial tumour extended resection and supraclavicular flap repair operation was performed. The neoplasia was completely resected, and the facial nerve was preserved. The defect was approximately 18.5 cm \u00d7 7.5 cm. Pathological analysis of the frozen tissue showed low-medium differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with negative margins. Based on the position of the transverse carotid artery, the final flap size was 19.3 cm \u00d7 8.3 cm, which was larger than the initial flap design (15 cm \u00d7 7 cm). The larger size was a result of the defect being larger than initially expected and due to flap tension (Fig. ). On the surface of the deltoid muscle, the flap was dissected from distal to proximal, and the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia was reserved.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 60-year-old man. Abdominal ultrasonography indicated that he had an abdominal mass. He reported having perceived lower abdominal pain 7 months before the initial examination, but it spontaneously remitted. The patient had no fever nor any history of conditions such as hypertension. A blood test revealed that he did not have anemia, thrombocytopenia, or coagulation abnormalities. The patient demonstrated slightly elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (4.7 ng/ml) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (603 U/ml), tumor markers that are elevated in gastrointestinal cancers and malignant lymphoma. Contrast-enhanced CT showed a 33\u00d7 31 mm abdominal aortic aneurysm and a 106 \u00d7 81 mm mass peripheral to the abdominal aorta. The mass did not feature a contrast effect, and its margin was enhanced in the venous phase (Fig. ). Sigmoid wall thickening and inferior vena cava thrombosis were also observed (Fig. ). We suspected the patient had a neoplastic disease, such as a malignant lymphoma or sigmoid colon cancer. Detailed examinations were consequently performed, and direct oral anticoagulant therapy was initiated to treat the inferior vena cava thrombosis.\nThe FDG-PET revealed an abnormal accumulation of FDG in the margin of the mass and the sigmoid colon, but not in any other organs. Colonoscopy showed only mild inflammation in the sigmoid colon, and a sigmoid colon biopsy revealed no significant findings. Chronic inflamed fibrous connective tissue was harvested from the periaortic mass using CT-guided biopsy.

She is off medication for the past 7 years as per her previous therapist's advice following absence of any psychiatric symptoms for 2 years after treatment of the second episode. She presented with symptoms of elevated mood, increased talk, overfamiliarity, and decreased need for sleep for 5 days following a financial stressor. There was no history of aggression or psychotic symptoms and the symptoms did not affect her work or conflicted with her family members or colleagues. There is no history of any medical illness, use of other medications, or substance-use disorders. She belongs to the low socioeconomic status, with a family history of mental illness in the first- and second-degree relatives, suggestive of a depressive disorder.\nOn mental status examination, she was adequately groomed with normal psychomotor activity. Her talk was increased in tone, tempo, and content, but there were no formal thought disorders. Her mood was euphoric and there were no ideas of guilt, depressive ideas/death wishes, or psychotic symptoms.

Upon presentation, the patient was evaluated using Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) principles. He had a patent airway on arrival and was breathing spontaneously on room air. His initial heart rate was 87 beats per minute, and his blood pressure was 124/63 mmHg without signs of significant hemorrhage. He had an initial Glasgow coma score (GCS) of 15 with equal and reactive pupils. The patient admitted to consuming alcohol and had a serum alcohol of 243 mg/dL. A later CT of the head demonstrated a subcutaneous hematoma without any intracranial abnormalities. His remaining physical examination revealed left lower quadrant abdominal pain without signs of peritonitis, ankle deformities bilaterally, pain with hip range of motion, and blood at the urethral meatus. Given his physical examination findings, subsequent imaging confirmed an unstable pelvic fracture with diastasis of the symphysis pubis of 6 cm, widening of the left sacroiliac joint, a left ischial pubic ramus fracture, and a urethral injury (). He also had a left ankle dislocation and a right compound fracture of the distal tibia and fibula. No intraabdominal injuries were identified on CT imaging of the abdomen. The pelvis was stabilized with a binder by the orthopedic surgeons with subsequent emergency irrigation, debridement, and open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the open ankle fracture as well as reduction of the left ankle dislocation. He was extubated after the procedure and monitored in the ICU while the remaining preoperative medical workup was completed including X-rays and CT scans with 3D reconstructions of the pelvis reconstructions. A hydromorphone patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump was utilized for pain control.\nOn hospital day 2, the patient was deemed fit for surgery and was taken to the operating theater",

Unfortunately no medical records of the patient's radium treatment could be found. She had always had a reddish pigmentation left at the spot (Fig. ), but she had recently developed an ulcer in the area that would not heal. Upon examination, there was a 10 \u00d7 15 mm superficial skin lesion with an ulcer on the skin of the ventral side of the left forearm. The element was excised with a 5-mm margin and sent to pathological examination. The pathology report showed a mixed tumour with sarcoma and carcinoma component, resulting in the diagnosis of sarcomatoid carcinoma (Fig. ). According to the pathologist the tumour fell under the classification of pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma. The case was discussed with the sarcoma team, which suggested re-excision with a 3-cm margin and postoperative radiotherapy. Furthermore, the patient underwent a PET-CT scan that showed a malignant suspicious process in the right liver lobe, thickening of the colon ascendens wall, and several enlarged lymph nodes over and under the diaphragm and the left inguinal area. A biopsy of the liver showed metastasis from adenocarcinoma with the colon as the possible origin. Furthermore, an enlarged lymph node from the left inguinal area was extirpated and the pathology report revealed chronic lymphatic leukaemia. Biopsies taken from the colon through colonoscopy showed adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the liver.

The tumor, about 3 cm in diameter, was located on the right side of the lower rectum 3 cm above the anal verge. The pathological analysis of the biopsy sample revealed that the tumor was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that the rectal cancer invaded into the muscularis propria without distant metastases and that lateral pelvic lymph node (LPLN) was not enlarged with a maximum long-axis diameter <3 mm. The most important problem was that the patient had a huge benign prostatic hypertrophy, the size of which was 85 \u00d7 80 \u00d7 70 mm (Fig. a\u2013c). To achieve complete TME with negative CRM, a hybrid transabdominal-transanal approach for ISR was conducted.\nFirst, vascular division and mobilization of the left colon were performed laparoscopically. The transabdominal approach was continued until the anterior dissection of the rectum became difficult due to a huge prostatic hypertrophy. Next, the circumferential rectal incision and subsequent intersphincteric dissection were performed under direct vision to enable attachment of a single port device (GelPoint Mini; Applied Medical). After closure of the anal orifice, the GelPoint Mini was placed to start the transanal approach. Posterior side of the rectum was first dissected until the transanal approach was connected to the dissection layer made by the transabdominal approach. The dissection procedure was extended to the lateral side. Bilateral pelvic splanchnic nerves were identified at the 5 and 7 o\u2019clock positions. At the anterior side, the proper dissection layer cannot be easily identified because of the perineal body and the enlarged prostate. Once the dissection plane between the rectum and the prostate could be identified, it was relatively easy to continue along the same plane. The assistance provided by the laparoscopic approach was useful to determine the appropriate dissection line in the transanal approach.",

The patient had been buried for 48 hours in the ruins after an earthquake. She had undergone more than 30 surgical procedures within the previous 6 years. Her legs and abdomen were severely injured in the earthquake. She underwent left, total leg and right below-knee amputations, left hip resection due to clostridial necrotizing fasciitis, transverse colostomy, cystic and vulvar reconstructions, and colostomy reversal surgery approximately 2 years before becoming pregnant. In addition, she also suffered from spinal shock after the accident. Her sensory and motor function below the level of T10 did not recover until 8 months later. In addition, the patient had progressed to a chronic stage in which her reflex activity was regained. This stage was characterized by disuse atrophy, flexor spasms, and exaggerated reflexes.[ To bear the weight of her body, she had to sit, lie down, or lie on her side. As a result, the uneven distribution of the stress caused compensatory changes in her spine, leading to severe scoliosis.\nThis patient had 2 episodes of congestive heart failure during her previous surgical interventions that required hospitalization in an intensive care unit (ICU). When she was admitted to our hospital, the fetal heart rate and movement were monitored closely. Dexamethasone was used to promote fetal lung maturation. At 36.4 weeks of gestation, her uterine contractions became more frequent, and preterm delivery was inevitable. Spontaneous vaginal delivery was not an option because of the patient's incomplete pelvis structure due to the previous left hip resection and extensive keloid tissue over the perineal region (Fig. ).

    "original_text": "This 65-year-old female presented with the clinical signs of neck pain and subjective systemic spasticity spanning over recent few years. However, the objective finding acquired during the detailed clinical examinations was limited to an intractable cervicalgia provocation only especially during the neck extension without any neurological deficits.\nThe initial dynamic radiographs of the cervical spine revealed the AAD instability phenomenon on neck extension, which was completely reducible during the patient\u2019s self-flexional maneuver, suggesting a flexibility for this condition (). The main background causing this AAD instability was found out to be the inherent existence of an orthotropic type of Os odontoideum, as revealed through the 3-dimensional reconstructed images by the computed tomography (CT). Surprisingly, as concomitantly featured inside the same frame through these CT scans, there were coexistent anomalous features of the inherently fused cervical spine between C2\u20133 level and inside C3\u20134 vertebral bodies, respectively. This congenitally fused, bony bridging was most notable along the both anterior and posterior vertebral body margins as well as between the lateral masses and spinous processes across the C2\u20133 ().\nIn a whole spinal evaluation in order to detect the other feasibly affected levels, she was also compromised with the multilevel butterfly vertebrae formations when traced from the lower cervical down to the thoracic-lumbar junctional levels by the CT work-up process ().
