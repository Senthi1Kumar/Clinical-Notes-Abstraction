    "original_text": "Miss. SM, a 9-year-old girl presented with a 2-month history of continuous coughing and irritable mood that has increased in frequency in the past 2 weeks. The onset of the cough was abrupt which was not associated with any sore throat, fever, frequent throat clearing, or any sensation of postnasal drip. Her parents informed that the cough usually subsides while she is sleeping. At the initial phase of evolution of cough, she was admitted at a hospital and thoroughly examined; although investigations failed to yield any relevant result, a provisional diagnosis of allergic bronchitis was made and she was put on antihistamines and steroids. With the above-mentioned medications, her cough subsided in intensity and she was discharged. However, the parents informed that when they were traveling home after discharge, the cough resurfaced with similar intensity. The patient was seen by numerous physicians thereafter without any benefit.

    "original_text": "A 34-year old lady presented with intermittent lower abdominal pain associated with abdominal distension for five months. There was no history of gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea or vomiting and the bowel habits were normal. There was no history of seizures, mental retardation, behaviour problems, and skin abnormalities suggestive of tuberous sclerosis. She had undergone a caesarean section, seven months back. On examination there was a midline reducible incisional hernia with minimal tenderness in the right iliac fossa.\nComputed tomography scan demonstrated an unexplained right iliac fossa density, which could represent a caecal or pericaecal abnormality (figure ). An infraumbilical incisional hernia containing bowel loops was also seen. Colonoscopy showed erythema at the ileo-caecal junction. Biopsies from this area were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of the mass in the right iliac fossa. It was separate from the caecum and lying inferior to it. The differential diagnosis was an inflammatory mass or a pedunculated lesion from the small bowel such as a pedunculated tumour or even a Meckel's diverticulum. Both ovaries were normal.

Current medications included clozapine 150 mg by mouth at bedtime, aspirin 81 mg by mouth daily, docusate 100 mg by mouth twice daily, and cholecalciferol 2000 units by mouth daily. He tried and failed multiple antipsychotics prior to initiation of clozapine 4 years ago. His mental health had been stable since initiating clozapine, and he resides in a group home. He gained 9.5 kg the year after clozapine was initiated, and then weight stabilized. He had difficulty controlling his diet at the group home and ate what was prepared for him. Despite lifestyle education, he continued to visit the vending machine frequently for soda (2 cans per day), candy bars (1 per day), and chips (1 bag per day). He was referred to a dietitian but was unable to successfully implement dietary changes. He did not have access to exercise equipment at his group home and did not walk outside due to inclement weather.

Six years prior to this presentation he had an isolated left testicular mass detected on physical examination and CT which proved to be a malignant germ cell tumour. He underwent left orchiectomy but retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) was not carried out as the CT showed no enlarged lymph nodes and histopathology showed the presence of a teratoma and yolk sac tumour. No further details however were mentioned. Accordingly, he received four cycles of chemotherapy (Cisplatin, Bleomycin, and Etoposide). He did well for six years, had no major complaints, and underwent only one follow up ultrasound which showed no suspicious abdominal swellings. He presented to us with on and off upper abdominal pain of six months duration, with no other associated symptoms. On physical examination he was vitally stable with a soft and lax abdomen but mild tenderness in the upper central part of the abdomen and a deep mass. Groin examination revealed signs of a left orchiectomy; the right testicle was in normal position with no swelling or other abnormality detected. Abdominopelvic US showed a large retroperitoneal semisolid mass measuring 8 by 6\u202fcm, abating the body and tail of the pancreas. Chest and abdominopelvic CT scan with IV and oral contrast were carried out and showed two lesions, one abating the head of the pancreas (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fcm in size) and the other baiting the body and tail of the pancreas with clear separation distal (). All tumour markers, including B-HCG, AFP, CA 19-9, CEA, and CA 19-9, were within the normal range. The patient underwent midline laparotomy and complete resection both retroperitoneal masses with preservation of the pancreas ().

    "original_text": "We evaluated a 62-year-old Caucasian male with an asymptomatic nasal radix mass and nasal airflow obstruction. Twenty-six years ago he had undergone reduction rhinoplasty with an uneventful postoperative period; however, nasal obstruction had not improved.\nA nasal dorsum mass, measuring 5 \u00d7 5 mm was noted three months postoperatively and slowly increased in size over the years. On physical examination, the nasal dorsum and tip were firm on palpation and a small deformity was present in the upper nasal dorsum, appearing as a 2.0 \u00d7 2.0 cm round, soft, and painless mass located on the midline of nasal radix (). A computerized tomography (CT) scan was conducted to exclude possible bone involvement and revealed a heterogeneous, large cystic mass on the nasal radix, measuring 68 Hounsfield units (HU), adhering without erosion to the nasal bones cranial part. It contained a cystic aspect including a homogenous density foreign body (), which was first thought to be a silicone implant.\nIn consideration of clinical and CT-features, a presurgical diagnosis of nasal radix cyst as a consequence of previous augmentation rhinoplasty was made.

    "original_text": "A 76-year-old man with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presented with a feeling of fatigue, weight loss, and reduced physical activities. He was diagnosed with COPD at the age of 69 years and had retired from work the following year. His smoking history included 40 cigarettes per day between the age of 14 and 69 years; his airflow limitation was classified as severe by the Global initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease; and a chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed severe emphysema. He had started long-term oxygen therapy at the age of 72 years and is currently inhaling 3 L/min of oxygen. Medical and family histories were otherwise unremarkable. Cardiac ultrasound excluded comorbid congestive heart failure or pulmonary hypertension, and CT pulmonary arteriography also excluded chronic pulmonary thromboembolism. As the patient had a history of acute exacerbations of COPD more than twice a year with extreme respiratory symptoms, he was prescribed a combination of inhaled long-acting antimuscarinic antagonist, long-acting beta2-agonist, corticosteroid, and oral carbocysteine, ambroxol, and theophylline. He reported symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, depression and anxiety, and a decrease in physical activity. He also experienced anorexia with a weight loss of more than 5 kg in a year, and no other possible causes of weight loss, such as tuberculosis and malignant tumor, were observed. Therefore, in addition to respiratory pharmacotherapy, we prescribed an antianxiety drug and provided nutritional supplement therapy, patient education, and pulmonary rehabilitation. However, the patient's mental and physical symptoms did not improve after 4 months. Furthermore, he exhibited deterioration in activities of daily living as well as physical and mental weakness; hospital visits were difficult and therefore, he considered home care.

Surgery had been performed 24 years prior due to an aortic root type A aneurysm and severe aortic regurgitation with a bicuspid aortic valve. The coronary arteries were directly reimplanted into the graft with the \u2018button\u2019 technique. A dual-chamber ICD was implanted 14 years later for secondary prevention due to episodes of unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT) with normal echocardiography and coronary angiography at the time; however, further details and clarification of the substrate of the arrhythmias are not available. He was hypertensive but had no family history of cardiac-related disease or sudden death, and his physical appearance was normal.\nOn presentation to our clinic, the patient was mildly cyanotic and reported dyspnoea on exertion. Interrogation of the device showed that the discharges were not caused by malignant ventricular arrhythmias but by episodes of AF with fast conduction entering the VF (ventricular fibrillation) treatment zone (). The device was programmed in DDD mode with two zones of therapy; VT at 176 b.p.m. and VF >207 b.p.m. The transthoracic bedside echocardiographic exam revealed two large aneurysms at the ostia of the coronary arteries. Both atria were markedly enlarged, and there were signs of mild pulmonary hypertension. The left atrium on the long axis was 60 mm, and the right ventricular systolic pressure was 35 mmHg. Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation were mild. The right ventricle was dilated but had preserved good function, and the left ventricle was normal (Video 1).

She had had several episodes of non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting for 36 hours, and her last normal bowel movement was 2 days prior. Although the patient had a history of sickle cell anemia confirmed by electrophoresis from her first year of life, she had not experienced any sickle cell crises and had not needed blood transfusion or hospitalization. She had no history of diarrhea, either. Family history for celiac disease was positive in a second-degree relative. On admission, her vital signs were normal. Blood analysis indicated low hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration of 9.3 g/dl, but other initial laboratory results were normal. Abdominal examination showed tender distended abdomen. Abdominal ultrasonography suggested the presence of intussuscepted bowel in the right iliac fossa with free fluid between the bowels. Hydrostatic reduction (HR) was not successful, so she underwent surgical reduction. Although no lead points were found, there were multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes and edematous ileocecal junction. On the third postoperation day, the patient again developed similar symptoms, and this time ultrasonography revealed IS in the left side of the abdomen. There was no improvement in symptoms for 24 hours, and ultrasonography revealed the same results after an HR attempt. The patient was operated on a second time, and manual ileoileal IS () reduction and prophylactic appendectomy were performed. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 3 days later. Three months later, the patient developed abdominal pain, and the diagnosis of IS was confirmed via ultrasonography. This time, IS reduced over 24 hours of observation. As no lead point was found through the later laparotomy, further investigations were conducted. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed and showed a mosaic pattern of the duodenum mucosa suggestive of CD. On microscopic evaluation, sections reveal advanced atrophy of duodenal villi with occasional intraepithelial lymphocytes (>30/100 IEL). Crypts show moderate hyperplasia",

Computed tomography (CT) examination showed a multiloculated lytic lesion in the right posterior mandible and had an incisional biopsy done but did not report back to the hospital.\nThen after a month, the patient consulted in another hospital when the swelling increased to the size of 3 cm \u00d7 2 cm and was obliterating the right buccal vestibule in the right posterior mandible. Incisional biopsy suggested a mixed tumor with epithelial and connective tissue components.

This was followed by further hospitalization for outbreaks of erysipelas, which resulted in worsening of the edema and ulceration. At 18, the patient presented much exudate from the open ulcer and as the edema had worsened, she consulted with a vascular surgeon in Porto Alegre in her home state who, after an examination, indicated lymphedema treatment in a vascular service in S\u00e3o Paulo.

The patient's past medical history was significant for hypertension, with a smoking history of 50 pack-years. Physical examination and routine laboratory tests revealed no significant findings. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 2.1 \u00d7 1.7 cm sized mass in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe (RUL), along with a 3 \u00d7 2.3 cm sized mass in the superior segment of the right lower lobe (RLL)(Fig a). The nodule in the RUL was suspected to be primary lung cancer, while the nodule in the RLL was suspected to be a benign neoplasm or double primary lung cancer. Therefore, we performed a staging workup for suspected lung cancer. Positron emission tomography showed increased uptake only in the RUL and RLL (Fig b). Bronchoscopy showed no endobronchial involvement. As the pulmonary function test indicated no contraindication, we recommended surgery because of the possibility of malignancy in each nodule. Thoracoscopic wedge resection was performed with a frozen section for each nodule. The intraoperative frozen section revealed adenocarcinoma with poor differentiation in the RUL and non-small cell lung cancer with very poor differentiation in the RLL. CT findings showed a RUL lesion with spiculated margins and a RLL lesion with well-defined margins. We performed an additional upper lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection after the thoracotomy considering the CT findings and an insufficient wedge resection margin of the RUL.

At first, he had been admitted to a local hospital on 24 November 2017, a month before visiting Chosun University Hospital with a history of 5 days of chills and fever. In the local hospital, in view of the possibility of acute pyelonephritis, he was first treated with intravenous ceftriaxone at a dosage of 2 g daily. Two days after admission, back pain started. During antibiotic treatment, blood cultures taken on admission yielded Salmonella enterica. He remained on ceftriaxone (2 g daily) for 18 days including initial treatment to cover S. enterica. Upon follow-up blood culture, no bacteria were detected on the 8th and 25th days after starting treatment, and the patient no longer had fever; he was subsequently discharged from the local hospital on 19 December 2017. However, he consistently suffered from lower back pain, nausea, and vomiting; he was re-admitted to the same local hospital 9 days after his discharge. When he was re-admitted to the local hospital again on 30 December 2017, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed and L1 spondylitis was demonstrated. MRI revealed whole bone marrow oedema with endplate lytic changes in the L1 body and focal marrow oedema in the upper endplate of L2 bodies. Additionally, mild destruction of intervertebral disc at L1\u20132 was shown. These findings were considered to be indicative of pyogenic spondylitis (Fig. a, b, c). He was empirically treated with cefazolin (1 g, 3 times a day) for 10 days to cover the possibility of Staphylococcus aureus infection, which is a common cause of pyogenic spondylitis.

A review of medical records from this early infancy time period showed a pediatric cardiology consultation that confirmed a normal heart on echocardiogram. In addition, a thrombophilia work-up, including activated protein C resistance, antithrombin level, protein C and S levels, antiphospholipid antibodies, homocysteine serum concentration, and factor-V Leiden mutation, was negative.

Her preoperative echocardiography findings were dilated aortic root (3.7 cm), mild left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction (70 %). Evaluation by cardiac catheterization revealed severe aortic regurge and normal coronary arteries. An 8 cm median sternotomy was performed. The distal ascending aorta was cannulated at blood pressure of 100 mmHg systolic and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was initiated with good flow and pressures in the cannula. The surgeon noticed a hematoma around the cannulation site. With the aid of Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) done by the anesthesiologist, diagnosis of a type A acute aortic dissection was made, that was extending to the aortic root and the descending aorta (Fig. ). CPB was terminated without any significant event, and right common femoral artery was cannulated for alternate route of CPB. The sternotomy incision was extended to a full sternotomy. Cooling for 48 min to 18 degrees Centigrade nasopharyngeal temperature was achieved for deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Bentall procedure with a composite Carpentier-Edwards Perimount 23 mm tissue valve and a 28 mm Hemashield graft was performed. Circulation was resumed and patient was rewarmed. Both coronary arteries buttons were attempted but failed due to frail intima at the coronary ostia. Left main coronary artery was reimplanted via a Cabrol procedure with an 8 mm Hemashield graft. Bypass of the right coronary artery with reverse saphenous vein graft was also done. We weaned the patient from CPB but there was progressive dilatation of the right ventricle and left ventricular dysfunction, so we were concerned with the graft for the left main coronary artery. We went back on CPB to perform bypasses to the left anterior descending artery and the obtuse marginal artery using reverse saphenous vein grafts. Then, we weaned the patient from CPB again with difficulty on high doses of inotropic support.",

There were no known past illnesses and there was no family history of similar illness. She was given pain medications and antibiotics on various occasions but there was no improvement.\nHer general appearance was not acutely sick looking. Her vital signs were within normal limits. The pertinent abnormal finding was right-sided abdominal mass with well-defined medial and inferior border extending to right subcostal region. Complete blood count (CBC), urine analysis, and organ function tests were all normal. Ultrasound and a computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a huge vascular suprarenal mass displacing her right kidney caudally; it measurements were 16 \u00d7 19 cm and it contained multiple internal calcifications. There were no enlarged regional nodes and no vascular invasion.\nLaboratory tests for functional adrenal tumors including serum and 24-hour urine metanephrines were all normal.\nA working diagnosis of huge nonfunctional adrenal tumor was made and our patient underwent exploratory surgery through a bilateral subcostal incision. The operative findings were a well-capsulated and highly vascularized mass arising from the superior aspect of her right kidney, which got a significant blood supply from the right lobe of the liver. The mass was successfully and completely resected and the specimen subjected to histopathology.\nThe histopathology report showed 18 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 12 cm white solid mass with necrotic center arising from right adrenal gland.

    "original_text": "A 56-year-old man who had a positive result on a fecal occult blood test was referred to our hospital. Advanced rectal cancer 2 cm from the anal verge was detected by colonoscopy and barium enema (Figures A and B). Lymph node metastases on the right and left sides of the internal iliac artery and lung metastases on both sides were suspected upon inspection of computed tomography (CT) and [18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans. The patient underwent APR of the rectum with lateral lymph node dissection on both sides (Figure C). While performing lateral lymph node dissection, we partially resected the retroperitoneum on the pelvic wall. After sigmoidostomy through an extraperitoneal route, we performed closure of the retroperitoneum with knot sutures.\nAlthough the patient\u2019s postoperative course was uneventful, he experienced a sudden onset of intense abdominal pain on the ninth postoperative day. Emergency CT showed the loop of a poorly enhanced edematous small intestine that was strangulated by the sigmoid colon and abdominal wall (Figures A and B). Immediately after we made the diagnosis of strangulation of the small intestine caused by the stoma-associated internal hernia, an emergency laparotomy was performed. The surgical findings showed that the sutured mesocolon and lateral peritoneum were separated and that a segment of the small intestine from the terminal ileum with a length of 110 to 180 cm passed through the space between the sigmoid colon loop and the abdominal wall in a cranial-to-caudal direction (Figure C). Although the segment of protruded small intestine showed moderate ischemic change, the strangulated segment was reduced and its color quickly normalized. Both the cranial and caudal sides of the hernia orifice were closed by suture to prevent recurrent herniation. The patient was discharged on the 28th day after the second operation without any further complications. No recurrence of herniation was observed until the patient died 21 months after surgery owing to recurrent cancer and progression.",
