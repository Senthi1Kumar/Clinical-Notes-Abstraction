    "original_text": "We report the case of a previously healthy 17-year-old Caucasian male with exercise-induced pain of the right foot that had deteriorated over the course of three months. During the last week prior to presentation at our emergency department, the symptoms had progressed from intermittent to constant calf pain. At clinical examination, the right foot was pale and cool with delayed capillary refill and absent pedal pulses consistent with the clinical picture of acute limb ischemia. The left foot was warm and well perfused with palpable pedal pulses.\nDoppler ultrasound study of the right lower limb showed an occlusion at the proximal part of the right popliteal artery (PA). With magnetic resonance angiography the presence of a four-centimeter thrombus occluding this section of the PA was confirmed.\nFurthermore, Doppler ultrasound study of the asymptomatic, contralateral (left) popliteal region revealed an occlusion of the PA with sufficient collateralization and unimpaired three-vessel runoff to the foot.\nBy conventional transfemoral angiography, the previously identified occlusion of the right PA and its aberrant course were demonstrated again (). An attempt of continuous intraarterial thrombolysis of the occluded right PA was undertaken by the use of actilyse and continuous heparin applied via a lysis catheter over 24 hours. The required therapeutic dose was controlled with aPTT between 60 and 80 seconds. This resulted in a significant reduction of thrombotic material within the PA, but the vessel was still considerably occluded (70-80%). After 24 hours of catheter-directed thrombolysis, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in therapeutic dosage and continuous infusion of iloprost (over 4h) were given daily.

The patient had initially been referred to a hospital for treatment and underwent muscle and skin surgery with 3-0 Vicryl mattress sutures (), but was admitted 2 weeks later to our reconstructive and hand surgery clinic as an outpatient. This investigation was performed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. The patient provided written informed consent both for surgery and for follow-up. The follow-up study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee (AG_1). Information regarding the initial procedure (including the operative report from the outside hospital) was unavailable.\nA physical examination revealed abundant purulent secretions from the wound. The patient reported tingling and numbness in the median nerve distribution and displayed a flexion motor deficit of the long fingers and the opponens pollicis. The patient also presented with median palsy and was unable to abduct and oppose the thumb (ape hand deformity), indicative of a lesion of the main trunk of the median nerve proximal to the emergence of the anterior interosseous nerve branch. He reported sensory loss in the thumbs, index fingers, long fingers, and the radial aspect of the ring finger with impaired pronation of the forearm (due to involvement of the pronator branch) and difficulty flexing the wrist and fingers at the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints.

She had two prior uncomplicated full term vaginal deliveries and received Rh immunoglobulin during and after each of her previous pregnancies. She has no significant past medical or surgical history.\nDuring this pregnancy, her first trimester studies revealed an anti-D titer of 2048. The fetal status was noted to be RHD positive on amniocentesis.\nOn her initial evaluation at 19-week gestation at our center, the middle cerebral artery (MCA) Doppler revealed a peak systolic velocity (PSV) of 2.37 MoM. There was mild ascites and cardiomegaly.\nAfter counseling the patient underwent the first in a series of combined intravascular/intraperitoneal intrauterine transfusions (see ). The ascites and cardiomegaly resolved after the second transfusion.\nThe fourth transfusion was complicated by an episode of transient bradycardia with spontaneous recovery after removal of the procedure needle from the umbilical vein. On a preoperative ultrasound prior to her sixth procedure, thrombosis of one of the umbilical arteries was noted (see ). A review of earlier ultrasounds indicated two patent umbilical arteries although visualization of the cord was not specifically undertaken postoperatively after the fourth procedure or before and after the fifth procedure. Based on the reassuring status of the fetus, a decision was made to continue serial intrauterine transfusions. Antenatal testing was initiated with weekly biophysical profiles and daily kick counts.\nIn addition to fetal anemia, this pregnancy was complicated by diet controlled gestational diabetes and mild polyhydramnios with an AFI of 29. The estimated fetal weight at 35 weeks ultrasound was 3193gms (87th %ile).

Although the tumor precluded visualization of the glottic gap, deliberate endoscopic manipulations revealed that the vocal cords were intact. To diagnose the epiglottic tumor in the simplest manner, we used forceps to partially puncture its anterior wall under local anesthesia () and noted that liquid contents did not drain from it. Therefore, it was diagnosed as solid rather than cystic.

    "original_text": "An 11-year old girl was referred to our department with a ten-year history of difficulty in walking diagnosed as cerebral palsy (CP). The history obtained revealed that the patient was followed up regularly by paediatric neurologists for her CP, and she had multiple botulinum injections when she was 8 years old. The physical examination based on the walking analysis illustrated limited range of motion in addition to 55\u00b0 of increased femoral anteversion in either hips. From the data of walking analysis, physical examination and radiological findings, the increased femoral anteversion and excessive soft tissue contractures due to CP were considered the primary reason for her walking difficulty. To improve her gait pattern, a combination of soft tissue procedure and distal femoral derotational osteotomy were planned.\nUnder general anaesthesia, the tendons of adductor longus, iliopsoas, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, gracilis, and gastrocnemius were released from the musculotendinous junction bilaterally. Bilateral distal femoral derotational osteotomy was then performed just above the metaphysis level with a lateral approach, and osteosynthesis was obtained by dynamic compression plate and screw fixation. Bilateral long leg casts were applied postoperatively to maintain osteosynthesis. The patient was discharged on the third post-operative day, casts were removed one month later and routine rehabilitative physiotherapy was instituted.\nAt one-year routine follow-up, there was complete union of the osteotomy. Although pre-operative radiographs of the right knee showed no evidence of any cystic or tumoral lesions around the distal femur (), the second-year follow-up radiographs revealed an asymptomatic large bone cyst in the distal part of the right femur.

    "cleaned_text": "an 11-year old girl was referred to our department with a ten-year history of difficulty in walking diagnosed as cerebral palsy (cp). the history obtained revealed that the patient was followed up regularly by paediatric neurologists for her cp, and she had multiple botulinum injections when she was 8 years old. the physical examination based on the walking analysis illustrated limited range of motion in addition to 55\u00b0 of increased femoral anteversion in either hips. from the data of walking analysis, physical examination and radiological findings, the increased femoral anteversion and excessive soft tissue contractures due to cp were considered the primary reason for her walking difficulty. to improve her gait pattern, a combination of soft tissue procedure and distal femoral derotational osteotomy were planned.\nunder general anaesthesia, the tendons of adductor longus, iliopsoas, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, gracilis, and gastrocnemius were released from the musculotendinous junction bilaterally. bilateral distal femoral derotational osteotomy was then performed just above the metaphysis level with a lateral approach, and osteosynthesis was obtained by dynamic compression plate and screw fixation. bilateral long leg casts were applied postoperatively to maintain osteosynthesis. the patient was discharged on the third post-operative day, casts were removed one month later and routine rehabilitative physiotherapy was instituted.\nat one-year routine follow-up, there was complete union of the osteotomy. although pre-operative radiographs of the right knee showed no evidence of any cystic or tumoral lesions around the distal femur (), the second-year follow-up radiographs revealed an asymptomatic large bone cyst in the distal part of the right femur. a computed tomography (ct) scan identified the lesion as a large cystic lesion located just above the lateral femoral condyle expanding from metaphysis to the femoral diaphysis involving the osteotomy site with cortical thinning (). the initial diagnosis was an aneurysmal bone cyst. to verify the diagnosis, an incisional biopsy was performed under general anaesthesia. cortical bone was partially destroyed by the lesion",

She presented to the emergency room with a chief complaint of seeing vivid organisms with tentacles in her food and stool. The patient was well-kept, organized, alert, and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. She provided a very detailed history, stating that the vivid hallucinations started eight weeks ago. She would see them in her eggs when she ate breakfast and when she drank water or juice. She had seen the hallucinations in her stool as well. The patient meticulously collected samples of her food and stool in containers and brought them to an urgent care center for evaluation. From the urgent care center, she was sent directly to the emergency room. During her admission, the patient stated she understands and is fully aware of the fact that the tentacles are visual hallucinations. Her symptoms have been a significant source of worsening stress and anxiety over the past few weeks. Her vitals, labs, blood, and urine cultures were all normal. Her urine toxicology screen was negative. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed no acute intracranial findings and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was negative for any acute changes, as seen in Figure .\nPsychiatry was consulted, and our team determined that her insight was fully intact. Her symptoms could not be attributed to an acute psychotic episode. We then began to discuss the possibility of Charles Bonnet Syndrome and Anton-Babinski Syndrome as potential differential diagnoses.

In January 2019 the patient started to develop abdominal pain of the right upper quadrant, bloating, nausea and vomiting, which led to a weight loss of 10 kg within 6 months. On physical examination the liver was greatly enlarged with a palpable mass into the pelvic region (). No ascites, signs of jaundice or lower extremity edema where observed.

He subsequently underwent a reported gross surgical resection, which led to a diagnosis of low-grade oligodendroglioma. Postoperatively, the patient remained seizure-free for 12 years until age 21, when he began experiencing both simple and complex partial seizures 1\u20132 times monthly. He was placed on carbamazepine and gabapentin, and an MRI at that time was unrevealing for recurrent tumor.\nFrom age 21 to 31, the patient underwent serial MRI scans every other year, each of which demonstrated a stable resection cavity with no disease recurrence when compared to prior examinations. In 2006, at age 33, the patient's surveillance MRI demonstrated a nonenhancing mass spanning the right parieto-occipital junction without peritumoral edema or mass effect, concerning for tumor recurrence in the resection cavity of the surgery 24 years prior. The patient elected to defer surgery and continue medical management of his epilepsy. Over the next several years, he continued to develop worsening seizures refractory to three antiepileptic medications. Surveillance MRIs demonstrated progressive nodular enhancement of the lesion []. In 2013, at age 40, the patient was recommended intracranial monitoring to delineate his seizure focus, prior to tumor resection. He underwent stereo-electroencephalography, which revealed a seizure onset zone in cortex anterior and inferomedial to the recurrent lesion. The patient subsequently underwent gross total resection of the mass and adjacent seizure onset zone [].\nHistopathological evaluation identified the characteristic features of DNET in both specimens [].

He was a product of a nonconsanguineous union, whose birth history did not involve instrumentation and whose past medical, surgical, and developmental histories were all noncontributory. This sensation was experienced simultaneously with bilateral numbness of the posterior tongue and difficulty in speaking, both of which lasted fifteen seconds with gradual attenuation.

Her initial presenting symptoms were drooping eyelids, double vision and difficulty swallowing with diurnal variation and characteristic fluctuation of symptoms. She initially failed her bedside swallow evaluation with notable aspiration to thin liquids on modified barium swallow (MBS). She underwent plasmapheresis with complete resolution of symptoms following IVIG as her swallowing functions didn\u2019t improve with the latter. Eventually patient\u2019s repetitive nerve stimulation study and antibody titers confirmed the diagnosis of postsynaptic neuromuscular junction disorder. Prior to discharge patient was started on pyridostigmine 60 mg 4 times daily, gradually up-titrated dose of prednisone 30 mg daily and mycophenolate 1000 milligrams twice daily. Her past medical history included generalized anxiety disorder and allergic rhinitis for which she continued to follow with her primary physician at discharge.\nDuring her routine neurology clinic follow-up patient was noted to have recurrence of drooping eyelids and change in voice with concerns of impending myasthenia exacerbation. As she responded very well to plasmapheresis compared to IVIG, she was started on regular plasma exchange, 3 exchanges every 4 weeks. She continued to take rest of her medications including prednisone 30 mg daily and mycophenolate 1000 milligrams twice daily. Patient\u2019s CT chest showed 6.7 cm lobulated soft tissue mass in anterior mediastinum with no local invasion, consistent with thymoma or thymic carcinoma.

She had frequently been admitted to hospital due to lung disease exacerbations and treated with various antibiotics leading to rapid decrease in her FEV1 (30% from a baseline of 64%). Three years later, in January 2014, she was registered for LT program in Adult Cystic Fibrosis Centre. While waiting for the LT, in July 2014 the patient presented with right-sided pneumothorax, which recurred four months later. In between, she had been admitted to hospital many times due to exacerbations of her CF. Her lung function continued to decrease rapidly reaching an FEV1 of only 19.7%.\nA double LT under ECMO support was performed on January 17, 2015 in AKH Wien. The postoperative course was prolonged due to a reperfusion edema with the need for continuous ECMO support and complicated with MDR A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa infections. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed two abscesses on the left lung, one in pleural cavity and another in the lung parenchyma.\nThe lung abscess was drained with a pigtail catheter and antibiotic therapy was initiated\u2014colistin and piperacillin/tazobactam intravenously (iv) with tobramycin inhalations. The treatment led to significant reduction of the abscess cavity so after 10 days the pigtail catheter was removed.

The patient stated that he has a long history of previously diagnosed rosacea of his nose and cheeks. A shave biopsy was performed on the enlarging lesion which demonstrated a typical nodular basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The patient was subsequently scheduled for Mohs surgery.\nThe area was prepped with Hibiclens and local anesthesia was injected. The tumor was first debulked with a curette and subsequently excised as per Mohs protocol. The first stage was clear of any residual BCC but the lateral and deep margins demonstrated a dense population of poorly characterized spindle cells. After two more stages failed to yield clear margins, the surgeon decided to dress the wound and defer further excision until a definitive histological diagnosis was made. The specimens from the Mohs procedure were sent to offsite pathology for further characterization. Immunohistochemistry was positive for CD31, ERG and Ki-67. A diagnosis of angiosarcoma with spindle cell differentiation, high-grade cytology, anastomosing vascular spaces and solid growth was made.\nFollowing the pathology report, the patient was referred to plastic surgery for further resection and reconstruction. Initially, the surgeon excised the lesion with a margin of 5 mm and sent the specimen to surgical pathology for analysis. Margins were not clear of the tumor, and a 1-cm margin around the lesion was subsequently excised and sent to pathology ().

This was associated with morning stiffness, lasting more than 1 hour, affecting his daily activity with limited range of motion and improving on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). He had no other joints\u2019 involvement, ocular pain, redness or any acute visual disturbance, no shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, or bowel disturbances. There was no skin rash or lesions. He was not known to have any medical illnesses before. He sought multiple medical advice and was diagnosed with AS based on bilateral sacroiliitis on MRI.

Six months prior to admission, her relatives had started recognizing neurological symptoms, such as gait disturbance, memory loss and behavioral disturbances (irritability and aggression). Over the six month period that preceded the admission to the hospital, a rapid deterioration of her cognitive function was observed. She also displayed visual hallucinations and delusions requiring antipsychotic treatment.\nOn admission, the patient was bedridden, incontinent, severely confused with generalized hyperreflexia, bilateral Babinski sign, startle responses elicited by mild external stimuli, and multifocal generalized myoclonus which evolved to rhythmic. Two months later she developed akinetic mutism. The patient died three months after hospitalization.\nRoutine hematological and biochemical examinations produced normal results. CSF examination (protein, glucose and cell count) was normal, while EEG showed generalized findings, periodic triphasic sharp waves, recurring at intervals of 0.5\u20131 sec (Fig ). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed no significant abnormalities, except for a minor brain atrophy which could be related to the patient's age.\nThere was a lack of family history concerning neurological disorders. Although the clinical course followed the typical rapid progression of CJD, the relatives did not consent to having a neuropathological examination carried out, neither did they agree to further genetic investigation of the immediate family members, and thus it has not been possible to determine if the mutation has been passed to the patient's offspring.\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected by lumbar puncture.

The pain radiated to his left shoulder tip and was worse on deep inspiration. He attended the Emergency Department, and while he was being triaged it was noticed that he was tachycardic with decreased air entry on the right. He was slightly tachypnoeic but oxygen saturations were acceptable on high flow oxygen via a reservoir bag. The working diagnosis was spontaneous pneumothorax, and as he was stable no immediate action was taken. A chest radiograph was requested whilst he awaited formal medical assessment and treatment (fig. ). This was initially interpreted as an apical pneumothorax with a possible effusion. While this was being reviewed and the significance of the effusion discussed he become very anxious and his blood pressure suddenly dropped from normal to unrecordable. He was tachycardic with a faint, thready pulse and oxygen saturations of 93% despite receiving 15L of oxygen a reservoir bag. His trachea was pushed anteriorly with visible hyperexpansion of the left hemithorax, and he was clammy with rivulets of sweat on his chest. A new diagnosis of tension pneumothorax was made, and the pleural cavity was immediately decompressed with needle thoracostomy followed by prompt insertion of chest drain using the Seldinger technique. This was seen to be functioning well, and within minutes there was an improvement of symptoms, with blood pressure and oxygen saturations restored to normal. A few minutes later he again became anxious with difficulty breathing and complained of feeling dizzy. His blood pressure fell again and he became cold and clammy.

It interfered with her movement, making her bed bound. She reported a 1-day history of subjective fever and diarrhea a week before the onset of symptoms, which subsided spontaneously. Weakness was not associated with double vision, shortness of breath, slurred speech, abnormal movement, or confusion. She did not have fever, diarrhea, or abdominal pain and did not have similar attacks previously.\nShe lost approximately 40 kg in 2 months; she did not receive any vitamin supplementation after surgery. The patient reported vomiting three to four times daily postoperatively until a month before her presentation.\nExamination showed that the cranial nerves were intact with no motor or sensory abnormalities. Her UL and LL tone was normal. There was a symmetrical decrease in power in her ULs both proximally and distally. LL power was also decreased. Her reflexes were diminished but elicitable, but her plantar response was mute with various maneuvers. The sensory examination was unremarkable and her coordination was intact.\nThe patient was admitted to hospital as a case of postbariatric surgery myeloneuropathy or GBS. IVIG was given for a complete course of five continuous days. Thiamine loading and maintenance were given parentally. Vitamin B12 and D levels were within normal limits. She was discharged with persistent weakness to undergo rehabilitation. No MRI or NCS was done at admission.\nShe presented again with the same concern and was admitted to neurology inpatient services.

The patient reported excellent pain improvement in response to the trial, although the itching persisted for weeks after the trial leads were removed. She was treated with diphenhydramine to decrease the itching, as she reported allergies to gabapentin and pregabalin.

The patient's past medical history was significant for a complicated course of gallstone pancreatitis that occurred eight months prior to his current presentation. Chart review revealed several prolonged hospital courses, totaling 53 hospital days, with multiple complications, including necrotizing pancreatitis status after necrosectomy and cholecystectomy, interval placement and subsequent removal of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube with jejunal arm (PEG-J) for enteral feeding, Clostridium difficile diarrheal infection for which he had received fourteen days of treatment with oral metronidazole, and a new diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Additionally, he had been found to have new portal vein and splenic vein thromboses during that hospitalization and had since completed six months of therapeutic anticoagulation, originally with Apixaban, which was later switched to Rivaroxaban.\nAt the time of the patient's current presentation for ascites, most of the above medical problems had resolved. He was tolerating a regular diet and was being followed by his PCP for management of recurrent ascites felt to be due to the above-mentioned portal vein thrombosis.\nThe patient reported no symptoms other than decreased appetite secondary to bloating and pain in his right groin likely from nonincarcerated hernia. He had no fever, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or significant constipation.\nUpon presentation to the ED, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed large volume ascites with no propagation of the portal vein or splenic vein thromboses with interim development of collaterals.\nOn exam, the patient's heart rate was normal with a regular rhythm, his lungs were clear, and there was no lower extremity edema.

In physical examination, there was no special abnormality in his heart, lungs, and abdomen. Table shows the clinical characteristics on admission. His C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased up to 13.36 mg/dL, suggesting the presence of inflammation. An increase of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and uric acid was observed which we think was probably due to dehydration. Although he had high fever and high CRP, all the infection markers that we examined were negative. In addition, several antibodies which we examined were all negative. Taking into account these data, we thought it unlikely that he had some inflammatory disease and/or autoimmune disorder such as collagen disease. Since his blood glucose level was relatively low and the number of eosinophils was relatively high, we examined the possibility of adrenal deficiency. As shown in Table , ACTH and cortisol levels were low and urinary cortisol level was also low, suggesting the presence of ACTH deficiency and adrenal insufficiency. An increased prolactin level was also observed which we assumed was induced by the side effect of dopamine blockers.\nNext,",

    "original_text": "A 47-year-old woman reported acute left elbow pain after leaning back onto a hard object with her hand while sitting on the ground, a motion wherein axial pressure was applied to the hyperextended elbow. She experienced severe pain along the posterior aspect of the elbow and subsequently a sensation of \u201ccatching\u201d during elbow flexion and extension. One year after the injury, she was referred to our hospital. On physical examination, elbow extension of 10\u00b0 was possible on the asymptomatic right side, whereas it was limited to 5\u00b0 on the left. Full extension of the elbow elicited tenderness posteriorly, and crepitus was palpable posteriorly with the elbow in full extension. There was no instability of the ulnar collateral ligament and lateral ulnar collateral ligament. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to evaluate the joint space. Comparison with images of a normal elbow revealed a hypertrophied posterior fat pad interposed between the olecranon and olecranon fossa in the left elbow (Figures and ). An MRI of the contralateral side was obtained because we suspected the posterior fat pad had hypertrophied naturally. The posterior fat pad in the right elbow was also hypertrophied (). The posterior fat pad in the left elbow was located more inferiorly than that in the right elbow. This constellation of clinical symptoms and imaging findings was compatible with posterior impingement caused by a hypertrophied posterior fat pad.\nUse of an anti-inflammatory agent provided no therapeutic benefit. An intraarticular injection of 2% procaine hydrochloride (2 mL) with dexamethasone sodium phosphate (1.65 mg) was administered in the elbow joint. The patient experienced 30% pain relief immediately after injection that lasted for a few days, after which pain with the elbow in extension returned. Surgical intervention was discussed with the patient after nonoperative treatments failed. A left elbow arthroscopy was then performed 2 months following her initial visit.\nDuring surgery, the patient was placed in the right decubitus position.",

Computed tomography indicated a contrast-enhanced wall thickness of the neck of gall bladder and swelling of the lymph node measuring 1.2 cm in diameter (Fig. ).\nMRI showed dilated common bile duct at 18 mm in diameter and no finding of the anomalous connection with the pancreatic duct (Fig. ). Although, the dilated intrahepatic bile duct was seen in left liver; this finding was consistently observed in the patient\u2019s clinical course and indicated no malignant disease.\nAccording to these findings, we diagnosed the patient with gallbladder carcinoma with lymph node metastasis and performed open cholecystectomy and lymph node dissection of the hepatoduodenal ligament. An analysis of intraoperative frozen sections revealed tumor invasion to the cystic duct; therefore, we additionally resected the extrahepatic bile duct and regional lymph nodes. The concentration of biliary amylase was not elevated at 196 IU/l.\nThe gross appearance showed a papillary-expanding tumor at the neck of the gallbladder (Fig. ) and the swelling of the lymph node.
