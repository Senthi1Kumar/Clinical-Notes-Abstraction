This was on the background of being regularly reviewed following radical cystoprostatectomy, urethrectomy, and ileal conduit formation 3 years prior to presentation for recurrent superficial T1G3 urothelial carcinoma throughout the bladder and anterior urethra lasting 3 years. Histology from this previous surgery revealed a completely excised high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma of the bladder with possible invasion into submucosa but no lymphovascular invasion. The urethra was clear.\nExamination revealed a hyperaemic 4 \u00d7 5 cm hard and nodular lesion in the scrotum, which was fixed to the overlying skin but separate to both testes. Bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy was palpable. Ultrasound revealed the mass to be solid. Computerized tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis confirmed bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy and no other obvious metastases.\nA core biopsy revealed atypical papillary and glandular structures indicating a neoplastic process, but was not enough to make a definitive diagnosis on its own.\nDue to the increasing size and possibility of the mass fungating through the skin, a partial scrotectomy with selective lymphadenectomy was performed [].\nThe microscopic sections showed a malignant tumor expanding the dermis and extending into subcutaneous tissue. The tumor had papillary and micropapillary architecture, comprising arborising fibrovascular cores covered by tumor cells, along with infiltrative smaller tumor cell clusters surrounded by stromal retraction. There was striking nuclear pleomorphism with frequent mitotic figures, along with a variable amount of pale to clear cytoplasm with focal apical snout formation. In the overlying dermis, in situ carcinoma was present in adnexal epithelium.

The patient was incidentally diagnosed through a routine chest X-ray, which revealed a widened superior mediastinum (Figure ) in June 2014.\nFurther physical examination revealed an absent left radial pulse. Subsequently, a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram confirmed the presence of a dissecting aortic aneurysm, which measured 7 cm in length and was inferior to the origin of the left subclavian artery (occluded) (Figure ). The CT scan also revealed an atrophic right kidney and a hypertrophied left one. Thus, the patient was placed on prednisone as well as methotrexate and booked for endovascular repair surgery. The woman later successfully underwent endovascular stent grafting of the thoracic aorta in April 2015. After developing pneumonia, the patient was switched from methotrexate to azathioprine (AZA) and maintained on amlodipine (5 mg), aspirin, and prednisone.\nThe lady's antenatal care was under the feto-maternal unit (FMU) at the Women\u2019s Hospital. Simultaneously, the patient was regularly followed by her rheumatologist and vascular surgeon. The patient resumed her medication during pregnancy; and serial ultrasound scans revealed a normally developing fetus. The antenatal period was uneventful except for gestational diabetes mellitus.

Thus, the patient delivered a healthy baby girl, weighing 2279 g, and her postpartum period was uneventful.

Oncological markers were in the normal range and the patient had no hepatopathies (HBV and HCV markers were negative).\nA first line abdominal US showed a hepatic hypervascularized neoplasm of 10 \u00d7 7 centimeters. Thus, an upper abdominal CT scan was performed and the hepatic neoplasm was confirmed and shown to grow from a Riedel's segment towards the right iliac fossa with a close contiguity with ascending colon and caecum. A colonoscopy was also performed without any evidence of disease in the colon. The possibility of preoperative CT or US-guided biopsy was excluded on account of the hemorrhagic risk due to the CT hypervascularized appearance of the neoplasm. Therefore, the patient was scheduled for a wedge hepatic resection of the V-VI segments. However, at laparotomy, the understatement of the CT scan was evident. A wedge resection of the V-VI segments, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, omentectomy, and removal of few peritoneal neoplastic implants were performed in order to attain an apparently R0 resection. The histopatological exam evidenced a well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma with osteoclast-like cells that were well-represented especially in the peritoneal implants (see ). Immunohistochemistry revealed the expression of CD68, which is one of the markers of osteoclasts in osteoclast-like giant cells in the tumor. In situ hybridization revealed the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (RANK) in the giant cells and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) in the tumor cells. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged in the 8th postoperative day. Two months later, the patient was readmitted with severe anemia (Hb 7.3) and underwent a CT scan which showed a diffuse intraperitoneal carcinomatosis associated with huge ascites. At the palliative paracentesis the haemorrhagic character of ascites was seen and the patient died few",

During this period the patient observed a weight loss of 2 kg, but did not show any B symptoms. A colonoscopy was performed without pathological findings. A subsequent CT examination of the abdomen showed two separate fat-containing retroperitoneal masses one in the adrenal gland and the second lateral of the psoas muscle inferior to the right kidney, outside the peri-renal adipose tissue. The lesions were separate and had no connecting tissue in between them (Figure ). To further confirm the obtained CT scan results an MR imaging was performed and showed again a fat-containing lesion in the adrenal gland and a 7 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 cm soft tissue-tumour inferior to the right kidney without invasion of the right kidney, urethra or renal vasculature. Both lesions appeared similar in the CT and MR imaging and were consistent with a well-differentiated liposarcoma (Figure ). Aware of the fact that a liposarcoma of the adrenal gland is extremely rare, a primary benign and fat containing tumour derived from the adrenal gland itself, such as a lipoma or myelolipoma was considered. Regarding tumour markers, only increased levels of CA 19-9 were detected (81.86 U/ml reference < 37 U/ml, CEA 2.2 \u03bcg/l, reference < 5 \u03bcg/l). To exclude a neuroendocrinological pathology additional tests were performed but did not reveal any noticeable conspicuities.\nConsequently, we assumed a combination of a retroperitoneal liposarcoma and a primary benign, lipomatous tumour of the adrenal gland. Alternatively, the very rare case of the combination of a retroperitoneal liposarcoma and an adrenal liposarcoma was taken into consideration. Therefore, two therapeutic options were considered on these accounts.

It was initially considered as a subcutaneous abscess because of slow growth and fluctuation on palpation. Ultrasound of the lesion reported as subcutaneous abscess. Needle aspiration of the lesion did not reveal any pus thus infection was ruled out. At the one-month follow-up, the overlying skin of the mass became whitish and its periphery turned reddish and inflamed. Patient also developed pain and tenderness locally. The size of the mass increased from 2x2 cm to 5x5 cm and involved the middle part of the sternum.\nLaboratory tests were within the normal range. CT scan revealed a mass of 8x5 cm occupying the anterior mediastinum, eroding the sternum, extending subcutaneously as an expanding necrotic area. A thymic tissue of 4x2 cm and conglomerated lymph nodes without definite borders were also noted (Fig. 1). The second percutaneous needle biopsy of the lesion gave no aspirate. Pathological examination of the trucut needle biopsy could not prove malignancy. The patient was considered as having a sternal mass. For both the diagnosis and treatment, the anterior mediastinum was explored. Frozen section examination showed malignancy. Skin flaps were elevated over the tumour mass. The pectoral muscles were dissected from the chest wall laterally and superiorly. Total gross excision of the lesion was performed. The resection included the two thirds of sternal body, the anterior aspects of the third to sixth ribs bilaterally to the costochondral junctions. A discrete mediastinal mass of 8x10 cm and the attached thymus were also excised.

    "original_text": "A 73-year-old British Caucasian gentleman, had been diagnosed with prostate cancer one year previously and was on hormone therapy. Three months after diagnosis, he was found to have a rising PSA (prostate specific antigen) and ALP (alkaline phosphatase) as well as pain in his right hip. A bone scan revealed bone metastases. Radiotherapy made no difference to the hip pain. He then tried a variety of analgesics from the family doctor including a NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and oral morphine but adequate dosing was hindered by nausea and vomiting.\nHe was eventually referred to a palliative care physician who commenced him on a subcutaneous infusion of diamorphine 20 mg and cyclizine 15 0 mg over 24 hours. This controlled the nausea and eased the pain although not completely.\nThe patient was then referred for hospice admission for respite and further symptom control. An increase in diamorphine to 30 mg over 24 hours in the syringe driver gave him good pain control. As he was doing so well, a trial of oral morphine and cyclizine was initiated. However, the nausea and vomiting recurred within a few hours and so he was recommenced on the syringe-driver, again with good effect. He was then discharged.\nThe patient had been reasonably symptom-controlled the first 3 weeks after discharge. Unfortunately he had then become unwell with diarrhoea and had experienced more pain.

The patient reported that he was well until 4 days prior when he was intoxicated and awoke with the symptoms. For 4 days, slight improvement of weakness occurred. He had no history of antecedent trauma, injury, infection, or mononeuropathy. Neurologic examination revealed weakness of the left wrist and finger extension (Medical Research Council grade II). Finger abduction appeared weak, but strength improved when the hand was passively extended to the neutral position. Wrist and finger flexion was intact. On sensory examination, there was a well-demarcated area of hypoesthesia and a tingling sensation over the lateral dorsum of the left hand between the thumb and index finger extending into the proximal phalanges of the 2nd finger. In addition, reddish skin color and slight edema were observed in the same area (Fig. ). There was no definite change in skin temperature and no pain. Reflexes were normal at the biceps and triceps brachii muscles, but the left brachioradialis reflex was absent. Routine blood analysis showed white blood cell count, C-reactive protein level and uric acid level were normal. According to the clinical information and neurologic examination, he was diagnosed with compressive radial neuropathy. After approximately two weeks of observation without specific treatment, the skin color recovered along with a marked improvement of the weakness and aberrant sensation.

He underwent a colonoscopy and was diagnosed with a moderately differentiated rectal adenocarcinoma with intact mismatch repair protein expression based on biopsy results. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a T3N0 rectal cancer with extensive involvement of the sphincters, extending from the anorectal junction to 1 cm from the anal verge (Figure ). Computed tomography images found no evidence of metastatic disease and the carcinoembryonic antigen level was 1.9.\nHe was described as youthful and had relatively few comorbidities. He had a history of prostate cancer, for which he underwent brachytherapy eight years prior.

The history revealed multiple surgical episodes for implant placement at a dentist's clinic 4 months back, following which there was considerable discomfort and swelling over the right side of face which lasted 7-10 days. This was followed by loss of all implants over a period of 3 months.\nThe patient currently wore a complete tissue borne denture in maxillary arch. Intra-oral examination revealed considerable hard and soft tissue loss with lack of good bound-down keratinized tissue. Radiographic investigations by way of an orthopantomograph showed two implants in the right maxillary sinus with one of them close to the floor of the orbit []. A complete maxillary rehabilitation was planned for implant-supported prosthesis with bilateral sinus grafts and anterior maxillary onlay grafts under general anesthesia.\nOn raising a mucoperiosteal flap in the right maxillary sinus region a perforation was seen in lateral wall of the maxilla, the sinus membrane was tense and fluctuant [].

The antenatal period had been uneventful until this emergency presentation. There was no evidence of antenatal ultrasonography in the private health services as the patient did not present any information or reports of such an investigation. She was not known to have diabetes mellitus. Her past surgical/medical/gynecological history was not contributory.\nAt admission, the patient was calm, afebrile and the vital signs were normal. There was no abnormality in the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Obstetric examination confirmed a 31 weeks of gestation, the fetus in breech presentation and the presence of normal fetal heart sounds. She was managed conservatively, and she was placed on prophylactic antibiotics. A course of dexamethasone injections was given, and she was transferred to the antenatal ward. After 8 hours, the patient was readmitted to the labor ward complaining of labor pains, and pelvic examination revealed that the cervix was fully dilated with a frank breech presentation at station 1 cm below the ischial spine. An assisted breech delivery of a premature baby, birth weight 1570 g, was conducted.

In his medical history, he underwent open surgery due to a large bladder stone at 24 years of age. A nontender mass was palpable around the orifice on physical examination. The urinalysis revealed pyuria and microscopic hematuria, but the urine culture was sterile. An abdominal ultrasonography was done, but no remarkable pathology was reported. A computerized tomography (CT) cystogram demonstrated an aberrant connection between the anterior bladder wall and the external surface of the skin (Fig. A). Subsequently, under general anesthesia, patient was placed in a low lithotomy position. Cystoscopy was performed to visualize and cannulate the fistula tract with a 6-Fr ureteral catheter. A midline infraumblical incision was made involving the circumscribing incision around the fistula. The fistula tract was identified until the bladder with blunt dissection. After excision of fistula tract with wide perivesical tissue debridement, a peritoneal cavity was opened and an omental V-shaped flap was prepared (Fig. A). An omental flap was based on a more reliable right gastroepiploic artery and brought down to the surgical field and placed upon the anterior bladder wall. The omental flap was sutured and quilted on the bed of the anterior bladder wall with the interrupted 2-0 polyglactin sutures (Fig. B). The border of the suture lines included from the bladder neck to the posterior bladder wall and up to endopelvic fascia at the lateral sides. A closed pelvic drain was also placed.

There were warmth and tenderness over the thigh on examination. An ultrasound of the thigh revealed bulky musculature and evidence of pus in the anterior and medial compartment of the thigh. A Doppler study revealed normal vasculature. An incision and drainage was performed and approximately 500 mL pus was drained from the anterior and medial compartments of the thigh. An appropriately collected sample was sent for culture and antibiotic sensitivity.\nOver the next few days there was continuous discharge of pus from the operative site. The culture report showed growth of Klebsiella species which was sensitive to meropenem, amikacin, tigecycline, and colistin.

Her laboratory data revealed obstructive jaundice and cholangitis, and tumor marker levels were elevated with carcinoembryonic antigen at 3.6 and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 at 4573.9. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an enhancing mass in the biliary duct hilum and dilation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, and there was no evidence of lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed a luminal filling defect in the biliary hilum (Fig. ). We diagnosed the tumor as a Bismuth type 1 cholangiocarcinoma, and performed endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage. Biopsies of the tumor revealed adenocarcinoma. The estimated volume of the postoperative liver remnant was less than 35%. Therefore, percutaneous transhepatic portal vein embolization (PTPE) of the right branch of her portal vein was performed (Fig. ). Twenty-one days later, the volume of the left lobe of her liver increased, and we performed right hepatectomy, caudate lobectomy, extrahepatic bile duct resection, and lymph node dissection. Node dissection included resection of hilar and pericholedochal nodes in the hepatoduodenal ligament, common hepatic artery nodes, and those at the celiac trunk, and posterior and anterior pancreaticoduodenal nodes.\nHistological examination of the tumor showed moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma without regional lymph node metastasis, a pathological stage II tumor according to the Union for International Cancer Control classification of malignant tumors, 7th edition (Fig. ). Postoperative blood laboratory tests showed that liver enzymes were slightly elevated, but that total bilirubin was within normal limits. Resumption of diet started on postoperative day (POD) 3.

She underwent resection of sigmoid colon cancer (StageIIA T3N0M0) five years previously. She did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Recent computed tomography scan revealed a mass in the left upper lobe of the lung, and she was admitted to undergo video-assisted thoracoscopic LUL lobectomy. She had a history of hypertension and osteoporosis, treated with raloxifen, alfacalcidol, fexofenadine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine and esomeprazole magnesium hydrate. She smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 45 years. Physical examination on admission was unremarkable.

    "original_text": "This 16-year-old male presented to the emergency department with new onset headache and visual changes of 2 days duration. The headache was described as sudden in onset, constant in nature, and bitemporal in location. This was associated with development of vision loss 1 day characterized by darkening of his vision, progressing from the superior to the inferior visual fields that lasted approximately 30 minutes with subsequent persistence of blurry vision. Without resolution of his symptoms, he presented to the emergency department.\nOn questioning, there was no prior history of seizure activity or of precocious puberty, or of genital abnormalities at birth. He had undergone corrective surgery for polydactyly of the left hand at 9 months of age. Polydactyly was also reported in his mother and elder brother.\nHis neurological examination was benign without abnormalities of extraocular movements, pupillary reflexes, facial motor strength, or sensation; he did not have papilledema.

According to the patient\u2019s father, his symptoms started three months prior when he developed pain in the lower back. Symptoms were gradual in onset, continuous and progressively increasing in intensity from moderate to severe. The pain was worse at night and was relieved by taking paracetamol (acetaminophen). It was also associated with weakness in the lower limbs, with a left-sided predominance. A week prior to presentation, the patient developed urinary retention and constipation. His birth and family histories were insignificant. Vaccination and developmental milestones were up to date. General physical exam was unremarkable. Systemic examination revealed decreased power in the lower limbs, bilaterally positive straight leg response and absent plantar reflexes.\nConsidering the presenting complaints and examination findings, the patient was admitted for further workup. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the whole spine was performed which revealed an intramedullary lesion extending from T8 to L1 vertebrae involving the conus. The maximum dimension of the lesion was 138 mm (Figure ). A decompression laminectomy for excision of space occupying lesion was performed. The resected specimen was sent for histopathological review, where the diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme was established (Figures , ).\nImmediate post-operative MRI of thoracic and lumbar spine demonstrated post-surgical changes along with hemorrhage at the site of surgery with cord edema (Figure ). MRI brain showed no metastatic disease. Post-operatively, the patient had noticeably reduced sensation and power in the lower limbs, making him bedbound.

Treatment consisted of percutaneous modulated arc radiotherapy with single doses of 3.0 Gy five times a week up to a total dose of 36.0 Gy. The planning target volume was 102 ccm. Radiation was combined with fluorouracil (225 mg/m2/d) as continuous infusion.\nFour weeks after the completion of chemoradiation, the patient presented in the emergency room with vomiting and rapidly increasing pain in the upper left abdomen, and gastrointestinal obstruction due to progressive disease was suspected. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed an intrasplenic cyst () with a size of 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 16 cm. Fine needle aspiration revealed mesothelial cells and elevated levels of lipase but no tumor cells. Therefore, the diagnosis of an intrasplenic pancreatic pseudocyst was made. There were no signs of a splenic rupture or peritonitis. Because of the massive painful enlargement and the risk of intraperitoneal rupture, we performed a gastrocystic drainage from the cardia into the upper part of the intrasplenic cyst. The technique was undertaken with a short needle path, with less splenic tissue between the gastric wall and the cyst, using endosonography to place a 4 cm double pigtail. The pigtail drainage produced brown cloudy liquid without the presence of any tumor cells.\nWithin the following days, the patient experienced relief from pain and had bowel movements. A CT scan and ultrasound showed shrinkage of the cyst and air in the parenchyma of the spleen as the organ returned to its typical shape (). Free intra-abdominal air was not detected.

The patient did not present with any respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or chest pain. Complete resection of the tumor was performed under general anesthetic in September 2011 (). During surgery, tumor cell invasion into the superior vena cava and left innominate vein, and pericardial adhesion were observed. The pathological evidence established a diagnosis of thymic squamous cell carcinoma (), with positive lymph nodes under the clavicle. Treatment with GP (1.4 mg gemcitabine, days 1 and 8; 100 mg cisplatin, day 1; one cycle lasting 21 days) and GC (1.4 mg gemcitabine, days 1 and 8; 400 mg carboplatin, day 1; three cycles lasting 63 days). Subsequent to chemotherapy, the patient received post-operative radiotherapy to the mediastinum with a total dosage of 56 Gy (2 Gy/day over 28 days).\nAt the follow-up visit, the patient had no discomfort and the disease had not progressed. However, in late February 2013, thoracic CT revealed several unequal nodules in the right lung and under the pleura. The disease had recurred following 18 months of progression-free survival. Subsequent to two cycles of chemotherapy with DP (docetaxel, 100 mg on day 1; cisplatin, 100 mg on day 1 for two cycles lasting 42 days), the patient was reexamined. This time, thoracic CT revealed the presence of metastatic lesions in the right lung, which were larger than those previously observed and were considered unsuitable for DP therapy. Paraffin-embedded sections of the thymic carcinoma were then analyzed for the 18\u201321 mutation of the EGFR gene. The results of the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) revealed a mutation in L858R of exon 21. The patient was administered gefitinib and a month later was reexamined",

There was a corneal epithelial defect with a scar, superficial punctate keratitis, and no infiltrate in the left cornea.\nShe had computed tomography and MRI reports from another hospital showing multiple left orbital masses, for which an incisional biopsy was scheduled.\nShe underwent a left orbital mass biopsy; however, the first impression of the initial pathologist was suggestive of idiopathic inflammatory disease, for which corresponding IHC stains such as CD3, CD20, and CD68 were requested [Figure -]. Meanwhile, the patient was treated with oral corticosteroids for 2 weeks until the next follow-up. Upon follow-up, the patient's symptoms improved slightly.

Considering future concern of coronary intervention, easy access to the coronary ostia is expected for selection of the THV. Aortic root dimensions and the access site were precisely measured using computed tomography (CT) angiography, with the aortic annulus having a perimeter of 67 mm and an area of 320 mm2. While iliac and femoral severely calcified stenosis contraindicate a conventional femoral route, the Doppler and CT studies of supra-aortic vessels did not show any abnormalities. The right common carotid artery was free from calcifications, and its internal diameter was 7 mm at puncture level. The implantation of an S-size ACURATE neo\u2122 aortic valve (Boston Scientific, MA, USA) via the right carotid artery was collegially retained by the local heart team. The choice of this valve was mainly driven by an easy access to the coronary ostia if repeated percutaneous revascularization were requested in the future in this coronary diseased patient. After obtaining the patient\u2019s consent, the TAVR procedure was performed according to local standard protocol in a hybrid operating room. Intravenous heparin was administrated to maintain an activated clotting time of \u2265250 s.

There was no significant family or psychosocial history. He did not take any medications. He was a computer engineer and his job scope was mainly office work. He lived with his wife and one child in a small flat in Istanbul. He was an active tobacco smoker with a 10 pack year smoking history. Currently, he smoked five cigarettes a day. He did not consume alcohol. His physical examination revealed tenderness and swelling in the sacral region. His vital signs were stable with blood pressure 125/65, pulse rate 70/minute, and temperature 36.2 \u00b0C. A systemic examination was normal and no neurological abnormality was detected. Vertebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a pathological fracture in L5. After a Tru-Cut biopsy, he was diagnosed as having chondroid chordoma. He was treated with preoperative stereotactic radiotherapy to L5 vertebra at a total dose of 15 Gray in two fractions with CyberKnife followed by surgery in May 2012. We aimed to reduce surgical complications by preoperative stereotactic radiotherapy. Two years later, in May 2014, he presented with lumbosacral region pain and MRI suggested recurrent tumor involving L4, L5, and S1 vertebrae. He was not eligible for surgery and was treated with definitive radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) mainly for palliative intent. Between 7 July 2014 and 8 August 2014, he received 40 Gray to L4, L5, and S1 vertebrae in 20 fractions 5 days a week for 4 weeks. In January 2016, he presented with paraplegia. Control imaging showed local recurrence, multiple lung nodules, and sternal metastasis. Imatinib 400 mg was started in February 2016 and continued until July 2017 when control imaging showed the progression of his disease. He received a total of 16 months of treatment. During this period, he received 400 mg/day",

The fever and anaemia responded well to broad-spectrum antibiotics and blood transfusions, respectively. An EBV-viremia (18.500 DNA copies/mL) was detected, and the patient was treated with acyclovir followed by rituximab.

She had presented to the referring hospital eight days earlier, with a two-week history of high-grade fever and a one-week history of a generalized abdominal pain and diarrhea. She had an exploratory laparotomy at the referring hospital. Intraoperative findings include a feculent intraperitoneal collection and a single perforation on the antimesenteric border of the terminal ileum. An intraoperative diagnosis of perforated typhoid enteritis was made, and the perforation was closed in two layers. One unit of blood was transfused postoperatively. On the first day of postsurgery, the patient developed darkish discoloration of the left hand and both feet which were associated with pain. She was not a known sickle cell disease patient and had no past histories suggestive of intermittent claudication. On the second day of postoperation, a purulent discharge from the lower aspect of the laparotomy wound was noted, and there was darkening of the feet and duskiness of the distal one-third of both legs. Due to the progressive worsening of the patient's condition, she was referred to our hospital on the seventh day of postoperation.\nAt presentation to our unit, she was acutely ill looking, febrile with a temperature of 38.1\u00b0C, dehydrated, not pale, and anicteric. Her respiratory rate was 30/minute with reduced air entry and coarse crepitations in both lower lung fields. She had a pulse rate of 130/minute, which was regular and of moderate volume. Only first and second heart sounds were heard. Her abdomen was full, and did not move with respiration, and had a midline dressing soaked with a feculent fluid. There was a complete wound dehiscence of the abdominal wound, with both edges being necrotic",

Positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography was performed due to suspected relapse of breast cancer, and it showed possible local recurrence involving the left thoracic wall and metastasis to a mediastinal lymph node (Fig. ). The biopsy of the thoracic wall region showed recurrence of breast cancer, and immunohistochemistry was positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, but negative for tissue HER2 over-expression. Gadolinium contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and spine showed no abnormalities, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was negative for malignancy. Considering a paraneoplastic syndrome, the antibodies were checked, but there were no abnormalities. Although a second CSF analysis was also negative, the third analysis demonstrated malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma of the breast (Fig. ).

She also could not be treated with systemic chemotherapy due to her condition because of the potential side effects, and she was started on oral letrozole, which has a low incidence of side effects. After 4 months of letrozole therapy, the strength and numbness of her extremities improved gradually, and she was finally able to walk. At 11 months of letrozole therapy, CT showed reduction in size of the left thoracic wall\u2019s recurrence and the mediastinal lymph node metastasis. There were no adverse events.

Her past medical history included invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast (ER positive, PR negative, and HER2 negative) treated by mastectomy two years prior to presentation. On clinical examination, she was found to have paralysis of the right vocal cord, and a follow-up CT scan of the neck revealed an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple bilateral thyroid nodules. FNA of a right-sided 3.5 cm thyroid nodule was diagnosed as atypia of undetermined significance (Bethesda category III). A repeat FNA three months later yielded a diagnosis of benign follicular nodule (Bethesda category II). Persistent hoarseness and compressive symptoms, combined with atypical findings on the initial FNA, necessitated right thyroid lobectomy and right vocal cord injection. Intraoperatively, the right thyroid lobe was noted to be moderately enlarged with multiple nodules but no evidence of extrathyroidal extension.\nThe right lobectomy specimen measured 4.6 cm in greatest dimension and weighed 16 grams. The cut surfaces of the thyroid parenchyma showed multiple variably sized brown gelatinous nodules, with focal areas of hemorrhage and cystic change.\nHistologic examination revealed evidence of nodular thyroid hyperplasia, along with multiple scattered subcentimeter foci of metastatic breast carcinoma, which were present in 7 out of the 16 submitted tissue sections. Most of the smaller metastatic foci, measuring around 1 millimeter each, consisted of a few irregularly shaped nests of epithelioid tumor cells interspersed between thyroid follicles (). The largest metastatic focus measured 0.6 cm and was comprised of tumor cell nests arranged along the periphery of a sclerotic stroma containing cords of tumor cells showing retraction artifact (Figures \u2013). These areas resembled the dense amyloid-type stroma often seen in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Additionally, there were numerous areas of rimming of the thyroid follicles by the tumor cells, which mimicked the appearance of C cell hyperplasia (CCH) (",
