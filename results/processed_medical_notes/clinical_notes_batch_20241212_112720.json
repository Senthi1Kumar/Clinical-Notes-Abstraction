Malignant lymphoma (ML) was first suspected, but aspiration cytology and biopsy of the lymph node suggested metastatic adenocarcinoma resulting from breast cancer. However, no evidence of breast cancer was found on ultrasonography and mammography examinations. Whole-body computed tomography (CT) showed systemic lymph node swellings (left supraclavicular and multiple para-aortic lymph nodes) but no primary lesion (Figure ). Upper Gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed no evidence of malignancy. The patient was diagnosed with unknown primary cancer and referred to our hospital for further examination in November 2009.\nWe reevaluated the lymph node biopsy specimen obtained by the referring hospital. The tumour cells with oval to round nuclei with prominent nucleoli were found to be showing partial ductal structures, leading us to suspect poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Additionally, immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies showed the biopsy specimen to be negative for cytokeratin 7 (CK7), and positive for CDX2, an intestine-specific homeobox transcription factor, and cytokeratin 20 (CK20), a cytoskeletal protein usually found in the colonic epithelium. These IHC results strongly suggested the metastasis from a primary colorectal cancer (Figure ). We performed a total colonoscopy and detected a small protruding lesion in the transverse colon (Figure ). The tumour was very small, with a diameter of only about 12 mm, and contained a depressed component, leading to a diagnosis of macroscopic type with 0-Is+IIc according to the Paris classification []. Furthermore, the severely thickened stalk and irregular pits visible in a magnified image of the depressed area combined to suggest direct invasion of the deep submucosa (Figure ) []. We concluded that this lesion was the primary site of the metastatic cancer despite its small size.\nA diagnostic endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) was performed and the specimen removed was serially dissected into three sections and examined.

Her past medical history was significant for asthma, genital HSV, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. She was admitted to the psychiatry service for evaluation of her acute behavioral changes and cognitive decline. During her admission, she developed new onset grand-mal seizures and was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit. She continued to have frequent seizures and began to develop worsening catatonia. The neurological workup included multimodal imaging and CSF studies that were positive for GluN1 antibodies, supporting a diagnosis of anti-NMDARE. Subsequent workup including CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, ultrasound of the pelvis, and a PET scan was negative for a tumor etiology. Our patient did not have a tumor etiology.\nAs the frequency of seizures increased, her mental status deteriorated and she was intubated for airway protection on hospital day 18. She had escalating episodes of autonomic instability, manifested by episodes ranging from narrow complex tachycardia with heart rates in the 140\u2013160 bpm to severe bradycardia induced by vasovagal maneuvers such as coughing, suctioning of the endotracheal tube, and defecation. These episodes were initially self-limited but over subsequent days necessitated active pharmacologic intervention including combination of multiple rounds of glycopyrrolate and/or atropine and low doses of epinephrine during the episodes.\nThe initial treatment of the bradycardic episodes was targeted at reduction of vagal stimuli and triggers for bradycardia. This included suppression of coughing episodes with intravenous fentanyl and premedication with inhaled lidocaine before endotracheal suctioning.

Several days prior to his first visit to our clinic, the pain suddenly got worse and he consulted an orthopaedic doctor, who took x-rays and MRI of his right shoulder and then referred the patient to our clinic.\nHis pain was located at the lateral portion of the right shoulder. The intensity of pain assessed by visual analog scale was 00/100 at rest, 25/100 during motion, and 00/100 at night. There was no muscle atrophy and no positive impingement sign. There was a slightly limited range of motion of the right shoulder: flexion, 150 degrees; abduction, 120 degrees; external rotation, 75 degrees; and internal rotation, T4.\nAn anteroposterior radiograph showed osteolysis of the subchondral area of the medial part of the humeral head. MRI (T1- and T2-weighted images) revealed an inhomogeneous low signal area in the medial part of the humeral head with high signal in the joint space on T2-weighted image. Although administration of any kind of steroid, history of sickle-cell disease and other risk factors for osteonecrosis were denied, based on the clinical findings, we primarily established a diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the right humeral head. According to the classification system of Cruess \n[], the lesion was classified as stage 3, which was characterized by the crescent sign (subchondral fracture).

    "original_text": "A 57-years-old female presented with complaints of recurrent chest infections. She also complained of dull, aching left-sided chest pain associated with dyspnea and orthopnea. She had no complaints of palpitations, exertional dyspnea, heartburn, jaundice, nausea, and vomiting. There was no history of a change in bowel habits and occurrence of abdominal pain. However, the patient narrated a longstanding history of recurrent lower respiratory tract infections associated with a productive cough and fever. She would seek medical care from a local doctor who used to treat her illness conservatively by prescribing antibiotics. Her symptoms usually resolved over a couple of months. The maximum interval between consecutive episodes was three months. Keeping in view her cumbersome condition, she was referred to the Nishtar Medical University Hospital in Multan, Pakistan for further evaluation and management. The patient was thoroughly re-assessed. On general physical examination, the patient was hemodynamically stable with a pulse rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg and an oral temperature of 39\u00b0C.

Technetium 99m-methyl diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) single-photon emission-CT revealed multiple bone osteogenic metastases throughout the body (Fig. ). This presentation was strongly suspected to indicate the presence of a prostate malignancy. For confirmation, 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT imaging was performed (Fig. ). The results showed high metabolite levels within the range of the bilateral peripheral lesions of the prostate. The prostate lesions showed a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 11.7 and a bone SUVmax of 28.4, with a striking increase in metabolism in the right lobe of the liver (a mass of about 7.8 cm), which exhibited an SUVmax of 27.5. These results further confirmed that the patient suffered from PC with multiple bone metastases. Tumor marker analysis revealed that the level of alpha-fetoprotein was 108.2 ng/mL and the level of PSA was 53.32 ng/mL. No abnormality in any other marker was detected. We sought to determine whether the patient suffered from liver metastasis that originated from PC or PC combined with primary liver cancer.

    "original_text": "A 16-year-old Bangladeshi boy was brought to the Department of Otolaryngology of Dhaka Medical College Hospital in March 2010 with severe respiratory distress and cyanosis. A short history from his father suggested he might have impacted a live fish in his throat. A quick examination of the throat was carried out and some lacerated areas were found in the oral cavity, oropharynx and hypopharynx. No foreign body was found but the patient was in severe distress, vigorously coughing and unable to talk. To relieve respiratory distress and secure life, an emergency tracheostomy was carried out under local anaesthesia. Still, respiratory distress was not relieved. A quick examination of the inside of lower trachea through the tracheostome revealed a tail fin of a fish directed to the right side of the bronchus. It was grasped with an artery forceps and pulled out of the trachea. Respiratory distress was relieved immediately. The patient was moved to the recovery room and monitored. The fish removed from the trachea was locally known as Guchi Baim fish (Macrognathus pancalus) (Figure ). It was about 16 cm long and about 2 cm wide at its central region. It was very slippery.\nAfter the emergency procedure, detailed history was taken from the parents. They said that on the Eid day (a Muslim religious festival), the boy with his friend had gone to a nearby canal to catch fish. He found two fishes at a time, and at one point held one\u2019s head between his teeth while trying to catch the other one, keeping both hands free. Then suddenly the live moving fish slipped into his mouth and the boy immediately rushed home. Initially his family members saw the fish in his mouth and tried to pull it out with hands by holding the tail end, but couldn\u2019t do so, as it was live, moving and very slippery.

Clinico-radiological examination confirmed severe bilateral osteoarthritis changes. He had more symptoms on his right knee than his left one. In June 1999 he underwent arthroscopic washout and debridement that confirmed severe tricompartmental degenerative changes.\nHe was managed non-surgically until May 2002 with anti-inflammatory medication and physiotherapy. His symptoms progressively deteriorated, which in turn necessitated TKA on his right knee. In September 2002, a subtotal knee replacement that spared the patella was performed on the patient. After the operation he complained of an anterior knee pain that was already interfering with his daily activities and his job. Failing any improvement in his symptoms he was offered patellar replacement which was performed in May 2003. A size 41 poly implant prosthesis was cemented in place, which was subsequently noted to have a normal intraoperative tracking.\nThe patient made a good recovery after the operation, but he complained of aching and clicking when flexing his knee from time to time. His symptoms improved and he was discharged from the clinic within one year. He presented again in January 2006 with a painful locked knee following a sudden flexion movement of his right knee. Radiographs taken in casualty showed that the prosthesis was dislodged and had displaced into the infrapatellar area (Figure ). His blood test and inflammatory markers were unremarkable. Knee aspirate performed in theater to rule out infection was unremarkable.\nHe underwent revision surgery of his right knee.

    "original_text": "A 78-year-old man, who underwent left orchiectomy due to severe epididymitis approximately 40 years ago, noticed painless swelling of the left inguinal region and underwent a physical examination in the general surgery department. He was diagnosed with a left inguinal hernia and was followed up. The left inguinal enlargement continued to increase after 10 months. CT scans showed a large fat-density mass, that was not the intestine or omentum, in the left inguinal canal. A left SCT was suspected based on MRI findings, and the patient was referred to our department. MRI revealed a 13.9 \u00d7 4.5 \u00d7 3.6 cm tumor in the left inguinal canal, extending to the retroperitoneal space through the internal inguinal ring. The tumor touched the sigmoid colon and iliac vessels, and obviously invaded the abdominal wall muscles (Fig. ). Blood and urine test results were normal, and positron emission tomography-CT showed no abnormal lymph nodes or distant metastasis. We suspected a left malignant SCT and performed surgery.\nUnder general anesthesia, we used a 4-port transperitoneal approach with the patient in the supine open-leg position. The first trocar (12 mm) was placed 1 cm above the umbilicus with an open technique. After establishing the pneumoperitoneum, a 0\u00b0 laparoscope was inserted through the first port, and the remaining three ports were placed 2 cm medial to the left anterior superior iliac spine (12 mm), 2 cm medial to the right anterior superior iliac spine (5 mm), and at the midpoint between the suprapubic rim and umbilicus (5 mm). The lateral peritoneal reflection of the mesosigmoid over the left SCT was incised; however, parietal peritoneum invasion was not observed (Fig. ).

Two foetuses joined at the chest and abdomen were identified by two-dimensional ultrasound, and further confirmation was made by three- and four-dimensional ultrasound. There was blood incompatibility between the parents (the husband was A+ whereas the mother was A\u2013). Anti-D was previously administered after delivery of her first child, a single viable healthy male baby. She had no history of abortion or miscarriage. Her height was 165 cm, weight 63 kg, looked normal, was neither anaemic nor hypertensive and had no history of chronic diseases.\nThe last menstrual date of this twin pregnancy was unknown. The mother did experience normal foetal movements. She had no vaginal discharge or hyperemesis gravidarum. Her abdomen was slightly large for the date of pregnancy. There was no family history of twins.\nA Voluson 730 ultrasound machine from GE Healthcare (Waukesha, WI) was used. The transabdominal ultrasound was performed and two conjoined female foetuses were detected; each foetus was with a single head and a pair of arms and legs. The twins were joined at the lower chest and the upper abdomen. Only one functional foetal heart was observed centrally between both the foetuses with slight tendency towards one of the foetuses ( and ). Single anterior placenta was seen with the umbilical cord and a normal amount of liquor. The colour Doppler study showed two aortic arches emerging from the single functional heart ().

Intraoperative pathology consultation revealed left submandibular gland with characteristic epithelial proliferation and focal myxoid changes of pleomorphic adenoma. Permanent histopathology diagnosed MPA of the left submandibular with 58/59 nodules positive for the lesion as well as 3 out of 5 left parotid gland nodules positive for lesion. The margins of surgical specimen were free of tumor (see Figures , , and ). Therefore, this patient presented with local recurrence and simultaneous metastatic disease. Immunohistochemistry staining done on this tumor tissue revealed positive immunoreactivity for p16 (similar positive immunoreactivity in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments) and Bcl-2, whereas negative for Ki-67 and p53.

He also complained of tingling in the sole of the left foot. He was not able to walk and stand easily and his sitting position was extremely limited and painful. In physical examination, there was a left truncal shift (list) in the standing and walking position. One leg lumbar extension test was negative but left straight leg rising test was positive. Motor testing was normal while examination of deep tendon reflex revealed weakness in the left ankle reflex.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed degenerative disc disease at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1 levels with a sequestrated L5-S1 disc herniation at the left side (). Plain lumbosacral radiographies did not show any underlying instability and electrophysiologic study confirmed left S1 radiculopathy. Due to the truncal shift and refractory complaints, surgical decompression was recommended to the patient. As the patient\u2019s predominant complaint was leg pain, we planned a simple L5-S1 lumbar discectomy.\nPros and cons of the surgery were explained and the patient signed the informed consent. Surgery was performed through a minimal skin incision and sequestrated disc was easily excised. At the time we were trying to remove loose remnants of the degenerated disc, some advancement of the pituitary rongeur anteriorly was felt but no active bleeding was observed from the disc space and vital signs were completely normal and remained stable throughout the procedure.

With a history of type II diabetes mellitus and transient ischemic attacks, the patient was initially evaluated at our institution for cardiac disease. He was found to have triple vessel coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure requiring coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and placement of a prophylactic AICD (St. Jude Medical Fortify Assura VR 1257-40Q ICD). During preoperative assessment for CABG, an incidental left apical lung mass appeared on chest radiograph. The decision was made to follow the mass without intervention at that time.\nTwo months after surgery, he returned to the hospital for a fall during a hypoglycemic episode, at which point a chest radiograph revealed a persistent 3.0 by 2.2 cm mass in the left upper lobe as well as left hilar and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, this time prompting evaluation for malignancy. Biopsy and staging studies confirmed T1bN3M0, stage IIIB poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung. Due to the complexities involved in radiation therapy (RT) to patients with AICDs, the final treatment plan included interdisciplinary input from radiation oncology, medical oncology, and cardiology.\nThe radiation oncology team hesitated to deliver RT to the patient with an AICD located within the field of radiation due to the risk of AICD malfunction. Multiple discussions were held with cardiology, St. Jude Medical, and with the physicians and radiation oncology physics teams about the patient. However, repositioning of the AICD was not possible in this patient's case.

He was initially managed in the ICU for status asthmaticus requiring heavy sedation and paralysis. His asthma improved, but his course was complicated by bilateral segmental PE detected on computed tomography angiography (CTA). TTE revealed mild RV dilatation and normal RV function. He was treated with low molecular weight heparin and eventually received a tracheostomy because of respiratory weakness, likely from critical illness polymyoneuropathy. While out of the ICU, he underwent placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, for which anticoagulation was held for one day. The day after PEG placement the patient became acutely hypotensive, with systolic blood pressures between 70 and 80 mmHg. He received a 2 liter normal saline bolus, after which he suffered an asystolic cardiac arrest. ROSC was achieved after 6 minutes of CPR and he was transferred back to the ICU. His arterial blood gas was notable for a pH of 7.05 and pCO2 77 mmHg. He required 20 mcg/min of norepinephrine, 2.4 mL/hr of vasopressin, 300 mcg/min of phenylephrine, 5 mcg/kg/min of dobutamine, and 40 ppm inhaled nitric oxide. TTE demonstrated severe decreased RV function with bulging of the interventricular septum into left ventricle. Due to high suspicion for massive PE, 10 mg of alteplase was administered, followed by a 90 mg infusion over 2 hours. 18 hours later he had continued evidence of severe RV strain on bedside TTE, including unchanged vasopressor and inotropic support.

He attributed these complaints to the mounting stress at work over the past 10 days. His wife reported that he was irritable at home and had stopped participating in routine household activities and pleasurable activities such as playing with the child. The patient also reported increasing nervousness, uneasiness, worrisome thoughts, and sweating predominantly at workplace. There was no history of any abnormal sensation or movement. There was no history of sensory or motor complaints, memory loss, gait disturbance, or disturbance of consciousness. Bowel and bladder functions were normal. There was no history of bone or joint swelling, pain, or fever.\nOn examination, his pulse rate, blood pressure, general physical examination, and systemic examination were normal. On central nervous system examination, there were no signs of raised intracranial tension or meningitis. Ophthalmoscopic examination was also normal. On mental status examination, the patient was well kept and had increased psychomotor activity with irritable mood and anxious affect. A provisional diagnosis of acute stress reaction was made, and tablet etizolam 0.5 mg twice a day was started. The patient was advised adequate sleep and nutritional supplements and was evaluated on a daily basis in the outpatient setting. He was advised medical rest for 3 days. The patient's clinical condition improved. Two days after joining his office, he experienced diffuse headache which was severe to the extent that he could not continue with the office work. On further evaluation, he reported headache which was exaggerated with office stress, associated with nausea, and at times vomiting.

Abdominal palpation revealed tenderness on right lower quadrant as well as costovertebral tenderness. No abnormalities were noted on routine blood and urine tests. Investigation by an abdominal CT scan revealed an obstructing cortical mass, with mixed solid and cystic components, at the middle third level of the right kidney.

Stereotaxic radiation was performed on each new brain tumor and pazopanib at 800 mg per day was resumed. Some neurological symptoms appeared with several transient episodes of aphasia together with some degree of mental confusion, 4 months after the last radiation treatment.

The MRI showed infratentorial atrophy, whereas potentially epileptogenic lesions were not detected. Before surgery, the patient experienced several seizures per day despite medication with several seizure-suppressing drugs. The seizure semiology and phase I EEG monitoring with scalp electrodes suggested seizure origin in the left supplementary sensor-motor area (SMA). To better localize the SOZ and to monitor seizure propagation pathways, an extended phase II EEG monitoring with additional electrodes outside the left SMA was performed. Altogether 10 depth electrodes were implanted symmetrically (96 contacts in total, 69 of them inside brain parenchyma and free of permanent artifacts). Four depth electrodes targeted the mesiotemporal structures of both hemispheres. Several clinical and subclinical seizures with stereotypical EEG pattern starting in the left SMA and rapid propagation to the contralateral hemisphere were recorded per hour. Seizure onset was localized to the left superior frontal gyrus. To reduce the seizure rate, surgery was performed in the left SMA, initially leading to almost seizure freedom. Six months after surgery, the seizure rate had increased again and 24 months after surgery was back to the presurgical state.\nOur quantitative analysis of preictal EEG revealed that linear signal interrelations were stronger and more extended in the right than in the left hemisphere, see Figure a,b and . Nonlinear excess interrelations in the standardized electrode implantation recording from the mesiotemporal structures were mainly found in the left amygdala (channels AmL01, AmL02, AmL04, AmL05, see ), that is, ipsilateral to the visually determined seizure onset but not touched by the resection. Repeating our analysis with the full EEG data set revealed that the contacts in the left SMA indeed did interact nonlinearly (mainly channel SMAL05), see Figure c,d and . However, the percentage of nonlinear excess NS removed after surgery was only 13.",

He had multiple recent teeth extractions and several artificial crowns. In addition, he had 20 pounds of weight loss as well as night sweats for the six months prior to presentation. He had no fever, neck mass or external neck draining ulcers.\nHis past medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He had a history of penicillin allergy (rash). He had been recently prescribed oral clindamycin for one month for his oral lesion with no improvement.\nHis vital signs were normal. Mouth examination showed exposed bone around the root sites of teeth #18 and 19 (see arrow), with artificial crowns over several teeth in the lower jaw (). There were no enlarged cervical lymph nodes and examination of other systems was unremarkable.\nBiopsy of the left mandibular bone around the root sites of teeth #18 and 19 was obtained and sent for histopathology, aerobic and anaerobic bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial cultures. Bacterial culture grew alpha hemolytic streptococcus, Eikenella corrodens and Micrococcus spp. Fungal and mycobacterial cultures were negative.\nLaboratory blood work including complete blood count, electrolytes and kidney function were completely unremarkable.\nComputerized tomography maxillofacial imaging showed a lytic lesion in left ramus of the mandible with loss of bone matrix (). Chest radiograph was completely normal. Differential diagnoses considered in addition to actinomycosis included nocardiosis, tuberculosis, osteosarcoma of the mandible and endemic fungal infections.\nHistopathological examination of the mandibular bone showed osteonecrosis, sulfur granules and embedded organisms on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain",

Her height and weight were 153 cm and 48 kg (increased to 57 kg during pregnancy), respectively. No previous medical history was noted, other than the cardiac surgery, and she had no history of drug addiction. A permanent PM was not implanted because she showed no symptoms and refused the procedure. Her fetus followed a normal course of development, with no signs of growth retardation. During regular antenatal checkups, she remained asymptomatic without medication, had no restriction on exercise in daily life, and received no contraceptive advice. Her blood pressure remained at about 100/55 mm Hg, and proteinuria was absent. A Holter monitor before pregnancy showed a minimum heart rate (HR) of 34 beats/minute (bpm) and a maximum HR of 82 bpm (mean, 50 bpm). Cardiotocography and echocardiography of the fetus showed no abnormalities. Because of acquired CAVB and the patient's request, an elective C-section was chosen after discussion with multidisciplinary professionals, including a cardiologist. C-section was scheduled at 37 weeks and 4 days of gestational age. A preoperative 12-lead electrocardiogram showed CAVB in which not every QRS complex followed a P wave. The HR was 44 bpm, and the QRS duration was 94 ms (Figure ). Blood test results were all within normal limits, except for atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide, which showed small increases of 104.6 pg/mL and 101 pg/mL, respectively, but were unchanged compared with prepregnancy values.
