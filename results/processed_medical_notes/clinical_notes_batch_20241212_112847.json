    "original_text": "A 83-year-old woman underwent cataract surgery in the left eye. She was pseudophakic in the right eye. The operation was complicated by posterior capsule rupture and displacement of nuclear fragments into the vitreous chamber. After anterior vitrectomy was performed, surgery was terminated and she was left aphakic. On the next day, she was referred to our centre for vitrectomy, nucleus remnants removal, and secondary IOL implantation. Her visual acuity was 20/200 and the eye presented mild corneal oedema, Descemet's folds, and nuclear fragments in the vitreous chamber. The surgeon (PL) scheduled surgery for the following day due to the lack of an adequate IOL for implantation. A +28 diopter foldable sutureless scleral fixation Carlevale IOL was chosen. This is a single-piece 25% water content hydrophilic acrylic IOL with 2 anchor optics on either side that are fixated transclerally. The IOL was ordered from the supplier. The morning of the planned surgery the IOL was delivered the operating room with a travel time of approximately 90 min. The external temperature was \u22121\u00b0C. Presumably, the temperature within the vehicle of the shipper was higher: The IOL was stored in the operating room at 19\u00b0C one hour before implantation. Under peribulbar anaesthesia, a 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy was performed uneventfully, with successful removal of the nuclear fragments from the vitreous chamber. Immediately after removing the IOL from its package, before folding it inside the injector, it presented an altered colouring to milky white of the central optic which was initially attributed to light reflection under the microscope (shown in Fig. ). Once the IOL was implanted into the eye it showed a white colouring of the central optic which tended to increase to dense white at the end of surgery. A decision not to explant the IOL was taken after contacting the supplier, who ascribed the opacification to temperature changes and stated that clouding was temporary",

    "original_text": "The patient was a 63-year-old male who presented to our clinic with left axillary pain and significant shoulder movement limitation. His symptoms started 15 years ago and did not subside despite using several pain killers. Initially, his pain was vague and sensed over the entire left shoulder. However, after 7 years, his pain changed in nature to a paroxysmal and lancinating one localized to the left axilla. He did not state any history of trauma. He had undergone radiologic and cardiologic work-ups several times without achieving a definite diagnosis. From 6 years ago, he noticed an axillary lump, assuming it to be an insignificant lesion unrelated to his chief complaint. According to the patient, the mass was sensitive to cold temperature and obliged him to wear warm clothes. As the mass size became larger and the pain was exacerbated, he became worried and came to our clinic for further evaluation.\nUpon physical examination, his lump was revealed to be a fixed and painful mass located at the patient's left chest wall (in the mid-axillary line). No enlarged axillary lymph nodes were detected. His left shoulder's passive motion was in full range, but his active range of motion, especially active forward elevation, was limited.\nThe chest X-ray and shoulder X-ray of our patient were insignificant. His left shoulder magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 5-cm (in the largest diameter) left axillary soft tissue mass at the mid-axillary line. The tumor was deep to the fascia and over the posterolateral chest wall extending from third to fifth ribs with no visible rib cage involvement [Fig. ].\nOur differential diagnoses were schwannoma, hemangioma, glomus tumor, lipoma, and their malignant counterparts.

The patient was one of two identical twins. He had not congenital anomalies and the other twin was normal. Two months earlier, he had undergone herniorrhaphy for right inguinal hernia. Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a 73\u00d779 mm and 75\u00d778mm heterogeneous mass without calcification in the right and left kidney, respectively and lymph node in Para-aortic area with 25mm in diameter. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen findings were similar to that of ultrasound without evidence for inferior vena cava and renal vein involvement. Chest CT scan did not show evidence of metastases. Then open biopsies from both kidneys were performed. The histopathology showed infiltration of both kidneys with blastemal cell predominant component, vascular invasion in the tumoral tissue and favorable histology without anaplasia ().\nPara-aortic lymph node biopsy was positive for tumoral involvement. Complete blood count with differential, liver and renal function tests were all within normal range. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 89mm/hr.

She was delivered at full term by caesarean section and weighed 3 kg, without asphyxia. Her parents were non-related and her mother was healthy during pregnancy. She was fed formula milk after birth. No family history of the genetic disease was available for assessment. She had no history of infectious diseases, no history of exposure to toxic substances or contaminated water, and no history of surgery, traumatic injury, blood transfusion, and drug or food allergies. Her vaccinations were performed as planned. At age of three, she was hospitalized for skin purpura, but no abnormality was observed in the bone marrow smear and she was diagnosed with \u201cidiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura\u201d. Afterward, her platelet count decreased after each cold, and she was hospitalized intermittently. At age of eight, the patient was admitted to our department for \"thrombocytopenia\". Her blood urea concentration was 7.78 mmol/L and total bilirubin was 41.6 \u03bcmol/L. After symptomatic treatment, her platelet count returned to a normal level, but the blood urea concentration was still elevated. The patient took prednisone for approximately 3 months. After discharge, she did not experience nausea, vomiting, swelling, reduced urine production, etc. At age of nine, the patient was hospitalized again in our department for \"acute gastroenteritis\".

The patient had a history of dislocation of the patella 2 weeks ago. Physical examination showed tenderness on palpation over the upper pole of the patella and absence of active movement of the knee accompanied by swelling and joint effusion. A plain radiograph showed an avulsed fragment of the superior pole of the patella (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a superior pole patellar avulsion fracture and dysfunction of the knee extensor mechanism (Fig. ). There were no signs of damage to the articular cartilage, meniscus, and cruciate ligament caused by previous dislocation.\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient underwent open surgery for reduction of the patellar fracture and reconstruction of the knee extension apparatus through an anterior approach. All of the above-mentioned imaging findings were further confirmed during surgery. Through a midline incision above the quadriceps tendon, careful dissection was performed to expose the injury site. Intraoperatively, a sleeve-like piece of bone was detected above the patella, and the proximal quadriceps tendon was attached to the bone piece (Fig. ). Then, complete removal of the blood clot and tissue debris was performed in the joint cavity and around the torn ends of the quadriceps tendon.

Six months prior, the patient had abdominal distention, decreased diet, and increased abdominal circumference without obvious inducement. These symptoms were accompanied by lower abdominal discomfort and increased frequency of defecation. Ultrasound examination revealed peritoneal effusion and a pelvic mass that had a maximum cross-sectional area of 14.5 cm \u00d7 10.7 cm. Abdominal swelling and a palpable lower abdominal mass with irregular surface and tenderness were found by physical examination. The gynecologist considered that the poor mobility lesion was formed by the uterus and adhesive bilateral ovarian masses, but there were still some gaps between the mass and pelvis wall. The lower margin of the lesion went deeper into the posterior of the uterus and rectum, and no obvious metastatic nodules were found in the vaginal fornix. Premenopausal and postmenopausal ROMA index were increased (99.24% and 99.46%, respectively). Neuron-specific enolase was increased (21.16 \u03bcg/L) and sugar antigen-24, \u2212 19, and \u2212 153 were all increased. CT examination found cystic and solid masses (with cystic components) in the bilateral ovarian area (Fig. ). The peritoneum, greater omentum, and mesentery were thickened and accompanied by multiple nodules. All lesions were contrast enhanced in different degrees, with a large amount of fluid in the pelvic cavity.\nDuring the operation, about 500 mL of red ascites was sucked out, a few miliary nodules on the top of the diaphragm were found, and the liver surface was smooth. The maximal omental mass of about 4 cm in diameter was attached to the spleen.

Two months earlier, an MRI had been performed for dysmenorrhoea lasting for a year. The MRI revealed 2 separated uterine bodies and cervices. The anatomy of the vagina was difficult to view. Left-sided haematocolpos/haematometrocolpos was noted (66 \u00d7 43 \u00d7 67 mm). Both ovaries were noted to have small follicles; the dimensions of the right ovary were 31 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 25 mm, and those of the left ovary were 20 \u00d7 34 \u00d7 21 mm ().\nThe patient attained menarche at 12 years of age. After menarche the patient experienced slightly heavy and painful regular menstruation every 28 days that lasted for 7 days each.\nMenstrual history the year before the investigations revealed successively increased pain with each cycle, reaching a peak at the 3rd or 4th cycle, during which she experienced very heavy and painful menstruation. A brief spontaneous relief of symptoms was followed by successively increased pain in the manner described before. The patient was not sexually active at the time of the investigation. She denied chronic diseases, medication intake, or any surgical operations.\nA 6-cm lump above the anterior vaginal wall on the left side was felt on bimanual examination. Ultrasound examination revealed the lump to be a cystic lesion with heterogenic echogenicity of the fluid content (dimensions 60 \u00d7 50 mm). Diagnostic hysteroscopy under general anaesthesia was considered.\nHysteroscopic examination revealed normal vaginal walls. A small cervix was observed to the right side of the vaginal vault. A hysteroscope was introduced through the cervical canal and reached the uterine cavity.

Full blood count, lever function, serum glucose, urea, creatinine, LDH, and electrolytes levels revealed no abnormalities throughout his hospitalization. Patient's biomarkers, CEA, AFP, CA-19.9, and PSA, showed also no abnormalities. Unfortunately no \u03b2-HCG was measured preoperatively from the surgery department.

The patient was apparently normal before 2 weeks after which he noticed spontaneous bleeding from gums while brushing. His medical history revealed that the patient had undergone a renal transplant 1 year ago and was under tacrolimus medication since then. The patient had no deleterious habits and his vitals were normal.\nOn extraoral examination, there were no gross facial asymmetry and no palpable lymph nodes seen. The intraoral examination revealed the presence of generalized, soft, edematous, fibrotic enlargement of the gingiva, involving the marginal, attached and the interdental papilla. The patient demonstrated a poor oral hygiene. Profuse bleeding on probing with a pocket depth varying between 6 and 8 mm throughout the dentition was observed. The hard tissue examination revealed congenitally missing \u2013 12; nonvital \u2013 11; Ellis Class II# in relation to 21. Based on the clinical parameters, it was diagnosed as a case of generalized grade III gingival enlargement [Figure \u2013].\nThe treatment was planned accordingly and was initiated with a Phase I nonsurgical therapy, which included supra- and sub-gingival scaling and root planing and prescribed with 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash twice daily for 2 weeks. This was followed by the re-evaluation of Phase I therapy by the end of 2 weeks' interval.\nSurgical excision of the lesion has been planned. The patient was explained about the surgical procedure, and written informed consent form was obtained.

Four months earlier, he had sustained two vertebral fractures (T10 and T11) due to falling; these were treated by kyphoplasty under computer tomography (CT) guidance. Because the back pain persisted 2 weeks after the procedure, he received a zygapophyseal joint steroid injection under CT guidance. Three days later, his C-reactive protein level was 12.5 mg/l and hyperleukocytosis was moderate (13 G/L including 10 G/L neutrophils) and the patient had no fever. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings revealed infectious spondylodiscitis (Fig. ). A Staphylococcus saccharolyticus isolate was recovered after 90 h of incubation from one single vial of a first series of three blood culture (BC) sets. The same microorganism was identified from two additional BC series collected 5 and 10 days later after 83 and 100 h of incubation, respectively. It was not possible to perform either culturing or molecular diagnostics using the tissue sample as the patient\u2019s condition did not permit disc biopsy. However, the findings from the blood culture tests indicated a definite diagnosis of spondylodiscitis, though a catheter or spinal device was not inserted in the patient. Using disk diffusion assay, the isolate was multi-drug susceptible including to penicillin and cefoxitin. The patient was treated with 2 g of amoxicillin three times a day for a total duration of 4 weeks after consultation with the infectious disease team. Pain and inflammatory syndrome both gradually regressed, and MRI performed after 12 month showed decrease in hyperintensity (Fig. b). No clear source of the bacteria was identified. The infection was presumably from skin and the bacteria was likely introduced in the surgical site during the kyphoplasty procedure. However, we could not identify any defect in the surgical skin preparation and infection control procedures as well as any particular event causing exposure during the kyphoplasty procedure.",

On admission, the patient was in good general condition. Blood pressure (BP) and pulse were normal. Heart auscultation was unremarkable except for a faint pericardial rub; chest examination showed normal breath sounds. Blood tests showed hemoglobin 11.5 g/dl, leukocyte count 7000/mm3, platelet count 250 \u00d7 103/mm3; liver and renal biochemistry, clotting profile, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were normal. At this time chest X-ray showed a mild cardiomegaly. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed normal sinus rhythm without acute ischemic alterations.

    "original_text": "A 66-year-old woman with a mass on her face was transferred to us from dermatology for excision. There were multiple skin-colored indurate nodules in the right perioral area (). She had first noticed it 20 years previously. At that time, it was a small pimple-like mass. It had grown very slowly for 20 years since then. On palpation, the mass was firm, immovable, and located at the subcutaneous level.\nThe lesion was diagnosed as desmoplastic trichoepithelioma in a preoperative punch biopsy carried out by a dermatologist (). While immunohistochemistry can help distinguish MAC from other tumors, it was not done by our pathology department.\nWe performed an excisional biopsy of the lesion under local anesthesia. Contrary to our expectation, intraoperative findings showed that the lesion was ill-defined and invading the perioral muscles and vessels. We could not perform a complete excision due to the tumor's ill-defined margins and benign preoperative biopsy diagnosis.

The patient denied vision changes or other ocular symptoms. His past ocular history was significant for uncomplicated bilateral cataract surgery in 1993, twenty-three years prior to presentation. He denied any recent ocular or head trauma. Ten months prior to presentation, the patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery which was complicated by postoperative cardiac arrest for which he required cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which included chest compressions.\nOn examination, the patient was noted to have an IOL dislocated into the anterior chamber of the right eye with inferior iris capture of the optic and a fractured inferior lens haptic as noted in Figure .\nOther findings included mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in both eyes without macular edema. There was no evidence of pupillary block, intraocular inflammation, iris chafing, or vitreous prolapse. The patient\u2019s visual acuity was 20/20 and the intraocular pressure was within normal limits. Given the lack of ocular symptoms and his unstable cardiac condition, observation with close follow up was recommended. The patient remained asymptomatic until five months later when he developed photophobia, hyperemia, and was found on examination to have intraocular inflammation with associated macular edema. Visual acuity in the eye at this time was 20/100. The implant's position had not changed since the previous visit. Due to his unstable cardiac status, surgical options were limited, and the patient was treated with three rounds of subtenon's triamcinolone acetonide (40mg) injections at six- to eight-week intervals along with topical prednisolone acetate 1% drops. Following cardiac clearance, the dislocated IOL was surgically explanted and the patient was left aphakic.

Family history was negative for colonic malignancies as well as for gastrointestinal bleeding. The physical examination revealed a well-looking pacient, not pale and normal weighted (BMI 26 kg/m2).The abdominal examination was unpainful, with no palpable masses, with normal liver and spleen. Laboratory investigations, including cell blood count and routine biochemical tests were within normal limits. Although no hepatic involvement was suspected after clinical examination, other serological markers for identifying liver diseases were ordered. The patient had no evidence for hepatitis B or C, for drug-induced liver disease or other specific liver diseases as hemochromatosis, alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson\u2019s disease, autoimmune liver disorders. Taking into account the digestive symptoms, an investigation of lower gastrointestinal tract was imposed. Colonoscopy was performed and showed dilated submucosal veins throught the entire colon, a finding consistent with extensive colonic varices (). In order to clarify the etiology of colonic varix, supplementary investigations were undertaken. Abdominal ultrasound evidenced a normal appearance of the liver, spleen and pancreas, without other pathological findings; no signs of thrombosis of the portal axis were detected in Doppler examination.

He complained of severe low back pain. When he visited the emergency department, he did not complain of muscle weakness or decreased sensation in both lower extremities. Physical examination confirmed no neurological deficit caused by the spinal cord injury. Recent compression fractures at T11, 12, and L1 and narrowing of the left T11 neural foramina were observed in the T-L junction on MRI. Therefore, surgery for posterior fusion of T10\u2013L2 was performed on March 31. The patient's general condition improved, and he was transferred to the rehabilitation department on April 14 for active rehabilitation treatment.\nWith increasing abdominal pressure, for example, when standing up or coughing, an approximately 15- \u00d7 15-cm marked protrusion on the left flank following the T11 dermatome was observed (Fig. ). No palpable mass, pain, tenderness, or rebound tenderness was observed. Previously, he was in a bedridden state, so he did not notice such symptoms. The patient complained of hypoesthesia confined to the left T11 dermatome, and some gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal discomfort and dyspepsia.\nAbdominal hernia was ruled out because no defects were found in the musculofascial layers of the abdominal wall in the initial abdominal CT scan. In addition, hematoma and ascites were not detected in the CT scan. Therefore, the cause of the abdominal protrusion was considered to be a pseudohernia. To confirm this, 3 tests were performed. To quantitatively analyze muscle activity, US and sEMG were used to demonstrate muscle weakness and needle EMG to demonstrate denervation.\nFirst, the thicknesses of the 3 layers of abdominal muscles were measured using US (Fig. ). Measurements were performed in the area with the most severe herniation and on the opposite side. A 2-step test was conducted as follows: first, while",
