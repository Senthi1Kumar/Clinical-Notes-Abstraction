Twelve weeks later, we exchange her tissue expander for the largest anatomical implant available, a full-height extra-projection 775 ml implant (width = 15.5 cm, height = 16 cm, and projection = 7.1 cm). She also undergoes a contralateral reduction of 300 g to achieve better symmetry. The final result is shown in Figure .

He passed meconium at birth and had no other complications including prolong neonatal jaundice or dehydration. His CF NBS showed serum IRT 139 ng/ml and was negative for the 40 gene mutations panel. At 1 month of age, he developed a wet cough without any other symptoms. He was followed by his primary care provider (PCP), and no treatment was given at the time. His symptoms continued on and off until 1 year of age. At 1 year, the mother noticed increased frequency of productive cough, lack of appetite, and poor weight gain.

Five years before the time of this report, when she underwent an annual medical check-up, an abnormal shadow was noted in the left lower lung on chest radiography. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed partial atelectasis in the left S8. Two years later, CT showed similar findings (Figure ). CT was repeated 2 years subsequently and it showed no obvious changes (Figure ). However, CT performed 1 month before the patient presented to our hospital revealed that the atelectasis had developed into a mass, suggesting malignancy. Thus, she was referred to our hospital for further investigation and treatment. In our institution, a CT scan showed a 45 \u00d7 37 \u00d7 32 mm mass with fine calcification in the left S8 (Figure ). Contrast-enhanced CT showed enhancement around the mass (Figure ). There were no suspicious findings of malignancy or infection in other lung fields or other organs. The patient had no subjective symptoms or previous episodes of pneumonia or other infections. White blood cell count and C-reactive protein level were within normal limits, and the levels of tumour markers for lung cancer (carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin 19 fragment and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide) were also within normal limits. Bronchoscopy was unable to visualize the mass due to B8 obstruction. FDG-PET/CT showed accumulation consistent with the mass, with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 8.91 (Figure ). Based on these results, we performed surgery to confirm pulmonary malignant tumour, including the recurrence of carcinoid, although it had been a long time since carcinoid resection was performed.

He was also suffering from a fever and cough since three days and complained of symptoms that indicated respiratory distress for a day. According to the patient\u2019s mother, the swellings were noticed by her when he was born. However, there was no cause for concern until he had turned one year old. In the last three days, the patient developed a fever and cough, and due to worsening condition, he was brought to the outpatient department. On further questioning, we established that the patient\u2019s respiratory complaints were of a recurrent nature. The patient had already presented and been treated for respiratory infection and distress twice the same year, though further evaluation of his chest swellings had not been carried out. Furthermore, the family was told that the child could have a congenital heart disease, but no relevant work-up had been done. The patient had no contact history with tuberculosis (TB), which is a major contributor to such symptoms in our country. The patient did not have any significant surgical, drug, allergy or blood transfusion history. Interestingly, the patient had a positive family history when it came to the bony outgrowths, with the father, a paternal uncle and his paternal grandmother having similar deformities at different sites over their bodies. However, none of them had the outgrowths over their ribs, nor did they have any features of recurrent respiratory infection. The patient\u2019s appetite, sleep and bowel habits seemed to be normal as well.

He had been re-implanted with a dual chamber cardiac pacemaker 6 months ago on the opposite infraclavicular region, following erosion and pus discharge from previous implant site. His blood investigation showed total leucocyte count 4000/dl and platelet count 85,000/dl. Blood and urine culture showed growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was treated with appropriate intravenous antibiotics based on sensitivity report (amikacin and piperacillin- tazobactam) for 14 days. Ultrasonography examination of thorax showed a 5 mm fluid filled area along the lead in the left infraclavicular region. Transthoracic echo reported both leads in situ and left ventricular ejection fraction of 55-60%. The 18F-FDG PET/CT study showed increased focal tracer uptake along the pacemaker lead in the right atrium suggesting localized infection in the right atrium []. He was planned for surgical removal of the pacemaker and infected lead followed by epicardial pacemaker insertion via median sternotomy under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).\nIn the operating room after instituting standard monitors and invasive radial artery monitoring, anesthesia was induced using intravenous administration of fentanyl, titrated doses of propofol. Injection vecuronium was used to achieve muscle relaxation. Tracheal intubation was achieved using flexible fibreoptic bronchoscope in view of limited neck mobility. Pre CPB, TEE confirmed pacemaker leads in the right atrium and right ventricle, with no extraneous mass in either of the chambers, normal valves and biventricular function []. Detailed TEE examination in the modified ascending aortic short axis view and modified bicaval view showed an irregular echogenic mass (0.6 cm) around the lead in the superior vena cava (SVC).

Antenatal ultrasound screening had not been performed. There was no history suggestive of birth asphyxia or trauma. The parents gave history of increasing constipation for which laxatives and enemas had been advised but did not provide relief. The child passed small amounts of urine at short intervals.\nThe child weighed 7.2 kg and other anthropometric parameters including head circumference were appropriate for age. Chest examination revealed multiple rib defects on both sides but air entry was normal without any added sounds. Abdominal examination revealed a cystic mass in the suprapubic region arising out of pelvis and reaching up to umbilicus. Digital rectal examination showed normal tone of the normally placed anus but a large cystic mass was felt posteriorly which precluded higher examination. Examination of the spine at the back did not show any bony defects. There was no neurological deficit.\nHematological investigations showed hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, TLC of 12,000 per cc and platelets of 117\u00d7103 per mm3. Kidney function tests were normal.\nX-ray chest [] showed multiple segmentation anomalies of cervicodorsal vertebrae along with fusion anomalies of ribs on both sides. Echocardiogram did not show any associated cardiac anomaly. Ultrasound of abdomen demonstrated a cystic lesion posterior to urinary bladder measuring 9\u00d74 cm with well-defined dome shaped upper margin and tapering inferiorly.

It progressed to a generalized swelling of the right shoulder and right side of the neck, restricting his arm movements. He also voiced the concern of worsening shortness of breath which started with the swelling. He did not report any personal or family history of thrombophilia. There was no previous history of any excessive upper extremity exertion or catheterization in the neck. Vital signs on presentation were a blood pressure of 127/61 mmHg, pulse rate of 79/minute, good volume, regular rhythm with no radio-radial or radio-femoral delay, respiratory rate of 19/min with a saturation of 93% on 3-liters nasal cannula, and temperature of 97.5oF. Physical examination revealed right upper extremity swelling without any sensory or motor deficits, right-sided neck swelling, and right-sided facial plethora. Examination of the contralateral arm, as well as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, was normal. Biochemical investigations were within normal limits. The patient underwent a right upper extremity duplex ultrasonography which revealed an acute non-occlusive thrombus in the proximal right internal jugular vein (Figure ) and right subclavian vein (Figure ) at the cephalic vein confluence. At this point, Factor V Leiden, anti-thrombin III, protein C, and protein S levels were ordered which were normal. The patient was admitted to the medical ward and an intravenous heparin infusion was initiated. Chest radiography did not reveal any cervical rib, and computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.

The patient was previously diagnosed with ventricular arrhythmia by cardiovascular departments in numerous hospitals, without any other significant findings. The patient was not administered regular treatment for the headaches or hypertension as the symptoms were considered insignificant. One month prior to surgery, the patient underwent a detailed health checkup and an abdominal mass was identified using abdominal sonography. A large, well-encapsulated pancreatic tail tumor, measuring 9 cm in length, was observed on abdominal computed tomography (). The patient was consequently transferred for surgical intervention.\nOn admission, mildly elevated BP (138\u2013160/80\u201390 mmHg) with a heart rate (HR) of 70\u201390 beats per minute (bpm) was noted. The ECG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with two ventricular premature contractions (VPCs). Other laboratory tests showed no significant abnormalities. An exploratory laparotomy with a resection of the tumor was scheduled. Thoracic epidural anesthesia was initially performed without adverse events, followed by general anesthesia. When the pancreas was approached, no any abnormal lesions were identified, with the exception of a bulging mass from the retroperitoneal region.

The radiographic interpretation showed an angular bone defect mesial and/or distal to the first molars (Fig. ). Because the patient was systemically healthy except for the presence of periodontitis, and based on the patient\u2019s history, clinical periodontal records, and radiographic findings, she was diagnosed with localized aggressive periodontitis [].

He presented with multiple skin abscesses, fever, headache, macular rash and low blood pressure at 102/49. He was treated with intravenous cefazolin and clindamycin. Five minutes after starting his clindamycin infusion, he complained of throat tightening and dyspnea. Physical examination revealed angioedema, conjunctival hyperemia, generalized hives and wheezing. Saturation decreased to 88%. He was immediately treated with epinephrine, diphenhydramine, salbutamol, hydrocortisone, and symptoms were rapidly controlled except for remaining low diastolic blood pressure. Clindamycin was suspected and discontinued. However, he continued to be febrile and the addition of clindamycin to his penicillin treatment was suggested to inhibit the production of exotoxin associated with toxic shock syndrome, as currently recommended. Considering that infectious episodes can simulate drug allergic reactions, that clindamycin allergy is rare, and that he had never received clindamycin in the past to explain sensitization, we decided to perform a graded drug provocation test. After infusion of 380 mg, he developed throat tightness, hand pruritus, dyspnea, wheezing, and his oxygen saturation went down to 84%. Symptoms were rapidly controlled with epinephrine. The patient was subsequently treated with vancomycin and as his clinical evolution was favorable, there was no indication to proceed with clindamycin desensitization. At follow-up 2 months later, skin prick test (SPT) and intradermal tests (IDT) were performed, and both were positive. Undiluted SPT with clindamycin (150 mg/ml)) was positive with an 8 mm wheal diameter and a negative saline control. IDTs were positive at dilutions of 10\u22125 and 10\u22123, with respective wheals of 10 mm and 12 mm with surrounding erythema compared to a negative IDT saline control. These dilutions were reported as non-irritating []. Because it was the first time that he received clindamycin antibiotherapy, we asked the parents to look for other sources of exposure to clindamycin.",

His tremors were aggravated by nervousness and relieved when asleep. He had had a history of hypertension and took a daily dose of 5 mg amlodipine. The patient had no history of any other chronic illnesses and was not on any other type of medication. Neither the electrocardiogram nor the Holter monitor showed any abnormalities. His baseline recumbent-upright blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were normal prior to treatment with piribedil, as shown in Table . He was diagnosed with PD based on the Movement Disorder Society clinical diagnostic criteria []. Initially, he received dopamine replacement therapy of 50 mg piribedil per day. Although there was no significant improvement in symptoms neither did he feel any discomfort. Therefore, starting the first dose change of piribedil, he added extra 50 mg to his dose.

He received standard combination treatment for AA with cyclosporine 225 mg orally twice daily, horse anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) 40 mg/kg daily for 4 consecutive days, and prednisone 1 mg/kg daily. His other medications included daily Pantoloc 40 mg orally, daily Valtrex 500 mg orally, and daily Dapsone 50 mg orally for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis due to a reported allergy to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. He had recently quit smoking and denied alcohol use but actively used other recreational drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, and methamphetamine. He was unemployed. He had no known other medical co-morbidities and was taking no other medications prior to developing AA. The etiology of AA was felt to be idiopathic because he had no improvement after an initial trial of sobriety. AA improved following immunosuppressive therapy and, although human leukocyte antigen typing was performed, a subsequent bone marrow transplant was deferred not only because of the medical therapeutic response but also due to his ongoing recreational drug use. Although he was no longer transfusion dependent a month after starting immunosuppressive therapy, his treatment compliance waned overtime due to regular ongoing recreational drug use of cocaine and methamphetamines.

    "original_text": "A 19-year-old male presented in the emergency department with one episode of melena per day, for one week. It was associated with vomiting, shortness of breath and palpitations. His hemoglobin level on initial complete blood count was 5.80 g/dL, signifying severe anemia according to WHO guidelines []. His lab parameters on admission are presented in Table .\nImmediately packed red blood cells (RBCs) were requested from the blood bank. On forward typing his blood group was labeled as O positive and his serum showed strongly positive indirect Coomb\u2019s test with a negative direct Coomb\u2019s. On extended 11 cell panel antibody testing, his serum demonstrated pan-agglutination which matched with monoclonal panel cells having anti-Kell, anti-Lub, and anti-Kpb antibodies. On cross match with four O negative and four O positive packed RBCs, +4 incompatibility was seen with all. Meanwhile a detailed history of the patient revealed two distinct episodes of epistaxis in childhood and a family history of his paternal grandmother having an increased bleeding tendency. In view of his past history of fresh frozen plasma infusions, it was interpreted that the patient may have multiple alloantibodies in blood leading to gross incompatibility. Considering the urgency of the situation, one unit of the least incompatible (O negative) packed RBCs was issued after washing with normal saline thrice, to the emergency department. Transfusion was started under strict monitoring by the emergency department physicians. After slow transfusion of around 10 ml blood, the patient started shivering and his temperature spiked to 101\u00b0F with tachycardia and hypotension. The transfusion was stopped immediately and the patient was given intravenous antihistamine and hydrocortisone.

On admission, echocardiography revealed severe PH with a TR-PG of 100 mmHg. Enhanced CT showed a small defect of fresh thrombus in the bilateral pulmonary arteries at the segmental or subsegmental levels and signs of CTEPH including intimal thickening and abrupt narrowing and occlusion in the bilateral pulmonary artery (). Laboratory investigations showed a D-dimer level of 9.1 \u03bcg/mL. Although anticoagulation therapy with heparinization was initiated, her condition rapidly deteriorated, leading to severe hypoxemia and hypotension. On the day after admission, ECMO was initiated. She was managed with heparinization and was attempted to be weaned off ECMO. Four days after the initiation of ECMO, mPAP was still 55 mmHg and it was impossible to wean off ECMO without any additional interventions. Therefore, we decided to perform rescue BPA. Pulmonary angiography revealed only a small fresh bloody thrombus in the right A1 and left A9 and chronic thromboembolic lesions of webs, subtotal occlusion, and total occlusion in the bilateral pulmonary arteries at segmental levels (). We performed BPA in the right (A3, A5, A9, A10) and left (A8, A9, A10) pulmonary arteries (). Immediately after BPA, her condition stabilized; however, hemoptysis was observed 1 hour later, requiring frequent tracheal suction. Small-vessel injury was suspected despite the careful wiring approach and ballooning, and bleeding was difficult to manage for 2 days. After hemostasis, her cardiorespiratory status improved and ECMO was successfully discontinued 2 days after rescue BPA.

An enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 77 mm \u00d7 67 mm irregular anterior mediastinal mass with heterogeneous enhancement compressing the mediastinal great vessels, invading the LBCV and growing into the right atrium, associated with intraluminal filling defects. Multiple collateral vessels were seen in the right anterior chest wall (Fig ). Fine needle aspiration (FNA) was carried out and revealed a diagnosis of thymoma.\nThe patient underwent a radical excision of the mediastinal mass, the invaded parts of the mediastinal pleura and the pericardium, double partial upper lobes, SVC, LBCV and RBCV, with reconstructions of LBCV and RBCV to the right atrium with grafts in August 2011. Intraoperatively, the mass was located in the superior anterior mediastinum and encased the LBCV. It invaded into the right atrium through the LBCV, RBCV and SVC and formed tumor thrombi. Pathologically, the tumor was described as a huge grayish yellow tough mass of 12 cm \u00d7 8.5 cm \u00d7 7 cm in size (Fig ). Microscopically, the tumor consisted of neoplastic epithelial cells and non-neoplastic lymphocytes. Most areas were type B2 thymoma, epithelial cells were arranged in sheets or cords, and some lymphocytes could be seen between tumor cells (Fig ). The tumour had a highly vascular appearance. Some areas were type B1 thymoma (lymphocyte-rich thymoma), and a few neoplastic epithelial cells could be seen against a background of lymphocytes.

Four antihypertensive drugs were used (nifedipine 30 mg, chlorthalidone 25 mg, doxazosin 4 mg, and minoxidil 5 mg). In addition, irbesartan 150 mg, spironolactone 25 mg, verapamil 240 mg, and carvedilol 25 mg were administered. However, his hypertension could not be controlled; his systolic BP was >170\u2013180 mmHg, occasionally >200 mmHg. The cardiologist at our institution evaluated the causes of hypertension to exclude secondary hypertension, and concluded that he had essential hypertension. The cardiologist considered that the main factor in the resistance to controlling hypertension was obesity (weight: 106 kg, height: 177 cm, body mass index (BMI): 33.8). However, the weight loss strategy failed. Two years ago, when the patient was 16 years old, the cardiologist tried a new approach, the renal denervation procedure. However, there was no significant improvement in his blood pressure. The patient was referred to our pain center for a celiac plexus block (CPB) six months ago and we performed a prognostic CPB with local anesthetics (1% lidocaine 10 cc per side). We performed a fluoroscopic-guided CPB using the bilateral paravertebral posterior approach. The needle was advanced alongside the vertebral body to avoid the transverse process, visceral organs, and vascular structures. After diffusion of contrast material was confirmed, local anesthetics were injected. One h after the procedure, the systolic and diastolic BP dropped to ~150 mmHg and ~90 mmHg, respectively. The BP was maintained at a similar level for four days. It was checked hourly for six hours and four times a day for the next four days. Then the systolic BP increased to 170 mmHg. This result confirmed the short-term effect of the CPB procedure in terms of a decrease in BP. We planned CPB with botulinum toxin at the next follow-up and",

Our patient had an unremarkable medical history except she was taking antihypertensive medication. Flexible laryngoscopy detected a mass approximately 1 cm in diameter on the posterior wall of her subglottic region that blocked approximately 80 % of her trachea (Fig. ). Neck computed tomography, without limiting her vocal cord movement, was performed owing to the suspected malignant tumor in her subglottic region. A well-localized 1 \u00d7 0.8 cm polypoid mass was detected in the posterior wall of her subglottic region (Fig. ).\nOur patient underwent a bronchoscopic biopsy using a bronchus endoscope. Examination of the specimen showed the presence of epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Consequently, a tracheostomy and laryngeal microsurgery were performed under general anesthesia for a final biopsy and complete excision, with consideration given to the signs and symptoms of tracheal obstruction.\nA laryngeal microscopic examination revealed the round 1 \u00d7 0.8 cm protruding mass at the bottom of the interarytenoid space. Above this, the 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 cm mass protruded like a spire. Complete excision of the masses was possible using a carbon dioxide laser because there was no adhesion between the masses and the surrounding larynx (Fig. ).\nThe gross findings of a histopathological examination were of ash-colored masses and a microscopic examination showed a tube-shaped structure composed of two layers. The inner layer was an oval or round monolayer of cells and the outer layer had polygonal cells with transparent cytoplasm (Fig. ).

Patient first noted bead like nodular growth over the gums which progressively enlarged to the present size covering almost entire teeth interfering with further cleaning of teeth.\nThe patient was hypertensive since 1.5 years and was under medication Coronol-AM (atenolol, 50 mg + amlodipine, 5 mg) once daily. He denied the history of any adverse habits.\nThe patient was moderately built and nourished with no signs of anaemia and jaundice and noncyanosed. His vital signs were within the normal range.\nIntraoral examination revealed generalized enlargement of attached gingival extending up to marginal and interdental gingiva. Surface of the gingiva appears lobulated with loss of scalloping (). Poor oral hygiene status of patient was assessed by the presence of local irritating factors which surrounded the teeth.\nBased on drug history and clinical examination of the patient provisional diagnosis of combined gingival enlargement was made. Complete hemogram of the patient was done, but all the parameters were within the normal range. Orthopantomogram was taken which revealed generalized bone loss ().\nAfter this, incisional biopsy was done. Histopathological report revealed few areas of hyperplastic orthokeratinized and parakeratinised stratified squamous epithelium and connective tissue exhibiting mixture of dense and loose fibrous component. Inflammatory cell infiltrate with PMLs and dilated blood capillaries with few areas of calcifications were also evident.\nCorrelating history, clinical examination, and investigations, final diagnosis of combined gingival enlargement (amlodipine induced and inflammatory) was made.

There was no dental history of trauma or any hereditary conditions. Medical history was non-contributory.\nOn clinical oral examination, the right mandibular second molar had deep occlusal caries exhibited abnormal crown morphology with a paramolar on the mesiobuccal aspect of the crown []. Distinct developmental occlusogingival grooves between the paramolar and its normal counterpart were noticed. However, the probing depth was within the normal limits, that is, between 1 and 3 mm. Despite the presence of the grooves, there was no discernible separation between the two teeth. The fused teeth showed increased buccolingual width with a wide distinct crown. The right mandibular first molar also showed the deep carious lesion adjacent to fused tooth. Other oral examinations revealed absence of both right and left mandibular third molars and had no history of extraction.\nOn electric pulp testing, right mandibular second molar showed delayed response compared with adjacent teeth and was tender on percussion. Preoperative radiographs taken at different angulations revealed union between the right mandibular second molar and the paramolar []. Based on clinical and radiographic examinations, a diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis with acute apical periodontitis was made.\nLocal anesthesia was administered and endodontic access cavity preparation was done under rubber dam isolation []. The prongs of the rubber dam retainer had to be trimmed to accommodate the unusual anatomy of the tooth. The pulp chamber of second molar was large with visible dentinal map, whereas the pulp chamber of paramolar was small with a round orifice.

    "original_text": "A 52-year-old male with a history of Stage IIIb melanoma initially underwent a wide local excision with a sentinel lymph node biopsy for a 2.1 mm in-depth melanotic lesion of his left upper arm melanoma. The sentinel lymph node biopsy at that time was negative for malignancy. Two years later he returned with an in-transit metastasis proximal to the original lesion. He underwent re-excision and axillary lymph dissection at that time. Following the removal of this lesion he was started on ipilimumab at 6 mg/kg. He had completed two injections spaced 1 month apart before he returning to clinic with complaints of diarrhea and significant abdominal pain. At that time a CT scan (Fig. ) and colonoscopy with biopsy were performed, both were consistent with active colitis. Adjuvant therapy was suspended and the patient was started on prednisone at standard dosage. The patient\u2019s symptoms improved over the course of the next week. However, 2 weeks following initiation of immunosuppresion he presented acutely to the emergency department with hypotension, peritonitis and free air beneath the diaphragm. He was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy. Following entrance to the abdomen via a midline incision extensive inflammation was noted from the terminal ileum to the mid-transverse colon. Perforation of the cecum was the salient finding (Fig. ). A right extended hemicolectomy was performed with end ileosotomy. Pathology was consistent with ipilimumab-induced perforation colitis (Fig. ). The patient tolerated the procedure and was cared for in the surgical intensive care unit overnight before being released to the general surgery floor in the morning.

    "cleaned_text": "a 52-year-old male with a history of stage iiib melanoma initially underwent a wide local excision with a sentinel lymph node biopsy for a 2.1 mm in-depth melanotic lesion of his left upper arm melanoma. the sentinel lymph node biopsy at that time was negative for malignancy. two years later he returned with an in-transit metastasis proximal to the original lesion. he underwent re-excision and axillary lymph dissection at that time. following the removal of this lesion he was started on ipilimumab at 6 mg/kg. he had completed two injections spaced 1 month apart before he returning to clinic with complaints of diarrhea and significant abdominal pain. at that time a ct scan (fig. ) and colonoscopy with biopsy were performed, both were consistent with active colitis. adjuvant therapy was suspended and the patient was started on prednisone at standard dosage. the patient's symptoms improved over the course of the next week. however, 2 weeks following initiation of immunosuppresion he presented acutely to the emergency department with hypotension, peritonitis and free air beneath the diaphragm. he was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy. following entrance to the abdomen via a midline incision extensive inflammation was noted from the terminal ileum to the mid-transverse colon. perforation of the cecum was the salient finding (fig. ). a right extended hemicolectomy was performed with end ileosotomy. pathology was consistent with ipilimumab-induced perforation colitis (fig. ). the patient tolerated the procedure and was cared for in the surgical intensive care unit overnight before being released to the general surgery floor in the morning. his postoperative course was complicated by continued symptomatic enteritis for the next 2 weeks; however by week 3 repeat colonoscopy revealed evidence of regeneration and healing of the colonic mucosa. he was discharged home and will likely be scheduled for ileostomy takedown in 6\u20138 weeks following cessation of immunosuppression.",

This symptom was preceded by a sudden diffuse pain in the right mandible which lasted a few hours one month before the development of the neurological impairment. A dental extraction in the anterior region of the mandible was performed by dental practitioner due to severe periodontal disease after the onset of the first sudden mandibular pain. History taking of the patient revealed that she suffered from hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and an IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (IgM-MGUS). At the first clinical evaluation she was taking methotrexate (MTX) (10 mg once a week), folic acid (5 mg/daily), prednisone (7.5 mg/daily), ibuprofen (80 mg/daily), and calcium.\nThe intraoral clinical examination was unremarkable, but an ulcer of 1 cm wide could be seen in the lower lip. A painful hard swelling was evident on palpation in the lower right vestibular fornix in the premolar area and in homolateral submandibular space. Lymphadenopathies were detected in the right later cervical, supraclavicular, and subaxillary groups and in the left axillary group. The patient suffered from chronic periodontitis which during years determined tooth loss and prosthetic therapy with dental implants and partial removable dentures. There were no direct dental or other local causes which could explain the onset of anaesthesia of right inferior alveolar nerve.\nA dental panoramic tomography (DPT), a maxillofacial CT scan, and an ultrasound (U/S) of the neck were performed to assess the morphology and the limits of the lesion. The DPT revealed a radiopaque area diffused from 4.5 to 4.8 with some microlacunae on the alveolar ridge and lower mandibular cortex.

These symptoms included body ache, back pain, runny nose, stomach cramps, feeling restless, with lack of appetite and sleep, and constipation. The patient had been married during this time but was unable to abstain from heroin consumption despite his spouse's multiple pleas. He was therefore admitted to a deaddiction facility where he stayed for 1.5 months. However, he relapsed within a week postdischarge due to craving. In the last 8 years, there were four episodes of overdose requiring hospitalization, and several of his friends expired due to heroin overdose during this time.

This patient experienced the influenza-like symptoms 2 days prior to hospitalization, and requested an ambulance due to the gradually exacerbating dyspnea 5 h prior to admission. The results of the laboratory tests are shown in . Multiple invasive development in the lung tissue was demonstrated by computed tomography and X-ray examination (shown in ). After admission, endotracheal intubation was immediately applied as the rescue approach, and antimicrobial treatment (i.e., moxifloxacin) combined with antiviral therapy (i.e., oseltamivir) were administered. The detection of the influenza B virus in the tracheal secretion was performed through reverse transcription-PCR. Moreover, bronchial secretion and a blood sample were collected immediately for pathogen detection using both NGS at BGI-Shenzhen and methods of bacterial culture commonly used in the clinical microbiological laboratory. After 4 h, the influenza B virus was identified in the tracheal secretion through reverse transcription-PCR. Subsequently, the patient received an injection with dexamethasone and ECMO was used as life support 8 h after admission. Unfortunately, the patient expired 11 h after admission. The details of the treatment process are shown in . Twenty hours after admission, NGS at BGI-Shenzhen identified S. aureus in both the tracheal secretion and blood sample of this patient. Moreover, NGS identified 2,037 sequence reads (8.40934%) uniquely corresponding to the S. aureus genome; the identified S. aureus was a positive carrier of the PVL genes () (the virulence factors of S. aureus identified via NGS are shown in ). The PVL genes were also amplified through PCR using the blood sample of this patient as previously described (). In contrast, the commonly used bacterial culture methods were negative for the blood sample and tracheal secretion. Collectively, these results supported that the influenza virus",

His past medical history includes atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease stage III, and chronic systolic heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction 30%-35%). The patient had been prescribed to wear a LifeVest wearable cardioverter defibrillator but was described by family as non-compliant. As per emergency medical services (EMS), the patient\u2019s heart rate was at 26 bpm and he was hypotensive. Administered atropine elicited no response. A transcutaneous pacer was placed, raising his heart rate up to 70 bpm, but showed intermittent capture with an amplitude up to 175.\nIn the resuscitation bay, the patient was hemodynamically unstable with a heart rate as low as 20 bpm.

    "original_text": "A 57-year-old man with cough and minimal whitish expectoration was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma after a biopsy was conducted on the upper lobe mass of his left lung on March 4, 2016. Mutational analysis revealed that he lacked EGFR mutations or ALK gene rearrangements. CT scans showed that this patient had developed multiple metastases, including mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, and also to the right intrapulmonary lymph nodes. He received 6 cycles of Pem-Cis chemotherapy, followed by thoracic radiation. Review of the CT scan at completion of sequential chemoradiotherapy treatment resulted in a significant shrinkage in the primary tumor in his left lung, while simultaneously resulting in a slight increase in metastatic lymph nodes (Fig. ). In February 6, 2017, CT scans showed that the tumor progressed rapidly. He was then scheduled to receive gemcitabine plus nedaplatin (Gem-Ndp) chemotherapy. However, the patient had to discontinue the planned 2nd cycle of this regimen as he developed moderate pneumonia. After systemic antibiotic treatment, the patient improved symptomatically and became increasingly energetic. However, CT scans on March 29 revealed that his tumors had progressed further. Owing to his poor physical condition after Gem-Ndp treatment, the chemotherapy regimen was changed to Pem-Cis. However, CT scans on May 11 failed to detect any shrinkage in his tumor. In addition, lymph node metastases increased post-treatment. The patient subsequently started standard of care pembrolizumab treatment at 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. During hospitalization, the general condition of the patient was good, with signs of fatigue only present at the first 2 days after each pembrolizumab infusion. The treatment failed to result in an anti-tumor response. The patient then received 2 cycles of initially used chemotherapy regimen Pem-Cis. Interestingly, we detected a significant shrinkage in the enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph node metastases, with the primary site in the left lung exhibiting no further progression.",
