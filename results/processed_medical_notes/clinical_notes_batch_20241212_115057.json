Her first pregnancy was induced by IVF with donor eggs. Placenta previa was diagnosed by sonographic examination at 23 weeks of gestation. The patient was advised to terminate her pregnancy by Cesarean section at 25 weeks of gestation because of uncontrollable genital bleeding. After evacuating the baby and placenta, a transverse fundal incision was repaired with two suture layers. The patient had no history of abnormal bleeding after CS. The present pregnancy was also induced by IVF with donor eggs. There was no mention of her uterine scar before embryo transfer at the 10th week of gestation (). The exact location of her gestational sac (GS) was determined at the first day of hospitalization at 11 weeks of gestation; her GS had implanted in the scar or the niche of a previous Cesarean delivery (). The diagnosis was based on finding a GS at the site of the Cesarean scar in the uterine cavity associated with a thin myometrium by transvaginal ultrasound. We suspected that the pregnancy was a CSP. After careful examination, radiological imaging and management options were planned. The following day, the patient complained of sudden lower abdominal pain. Observations showed a pulse of 106 beats per min and a blood pressure of 84/46 mmHg.

It was decided to maintain observation only with close surveillance, because the mammography findings were assessed as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category 3 (). After 3 months the patient was readmitted to the clinic with a palpable axillary mass. The mass was hard and fixed in the right side of axilla and an irregularly shaped axillary mass including microcalcifications, was identified on ultrasonography.

In addition, the patient had no exposure to any toxic substances and no significant relevant family history. A clinical diagnosis of cervical spondylosis was originally considered based on X-rays of the cervical spine, and the patient received small needle-scalpel treatment for relieving pain relief, which was administered by a rural doctor. When no obvious improvement was observed 20 days later, the patient was admitted to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. The patient was experiencing progressive neurologic deterioration involving both upper and lower limbs. Upon neurological evaluation, he exhibited reduced response to light touch and pinprick, with a sensory level below the angle of the mandible. He had trouble during urination and significantly decreased muscle tension. He was subsequently incapable of antigravity power in his upper limbs (the left and right muscle strength was graded as 4/5 and 2/5, respectively) and had a significant loss of motor function in both lower extremities (the muscle strength was graded as 1/5). Urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine demonstrated a right spinal epidural hematoma located at the posterior spinal epidural space with severe cord compression and subcutaneous soft tissue hemorrhage, extending from the C2 to C7 spinal vertebral level (). Routine laboratory investigations indicated that renal and liver functions, serum potassium and coagulation index were normal. Given his progressive symptoms and MRI results, the diagnosis of cervical extradural hematoma was finally considered. The patient had received the ventilatory and adjunctive therapy, omeprazole, mannitol, and a high dose of steroids after the diagnosis of cervical extradural hematoma. Unfortunately, the patient refused urgent surgery; thus",

Extraoral examination revealed facial symmetry and no skeletal malocclusion. The child was examined with particular attention to hair, nail, eyes and ears, all of which appeared to be normal. No sweating abnormality was reported by the patient's mother. An intraoral examination revealed the presence of maxillary right and left primary second molars, mandibular right primary second molar, mandibular left primary canine, first and second molars. The teeth were of normal size, shape, and color. The alveolus present was very thin. There were no carious teeth and the patient has good oral hygiene. None of the teeth were mobile. Her oral range of motion was within normal limits. No temporomandibular joint sounds or masticatory muscle pain was noted. Panoramic radiograph revealed congenital absence of 14 primary teeth which included maxillary right and left central incisors, lateral incisors, canines (cuspids), and first primary molars. It also showed absence of right and left lower central incisors, lateral incisors, right canine and right first primary molar and also revealed the presence of all four first permanent molar tooth buds, lower left first and second premolar tooth buds and lower right and left second permanent molar tooth buds. Radiograph showed the beginning of calcification of cusp of lower right second premolar and probably early beginning of calcification of left mandibular second premolar ().

    "original_text": "A 73 year-old Japanese woman underwent arthroscopic surgery of the knee for a torn medial meniscus. She had a surgical history of excision of a right frontal meningioma 11 years ago. She was receiving medications for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She had no history of trauma, headache or coagulation abnormalities.\nFrom around four years before presentation to our center, our patient started to experience right knee pain and was treated at her local hospital with intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid and physical therapy. She was referred to our center because of deterioration of pain and a catching sensation on the medial side of her right knee joint. Examinations at presentation detected pain from the medial side to the popliteal region of her right knee joint, a restricted range of motion to -10 degree extension and 110 degree flexion and a positive McMurray test. A plain radiograph showed findings of osteoarthritis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a degenerative tear of the medial meniscus. Arthroscopic surgery was scheduled and our patient was admitted.\nSpinal anesthesia was conducted by puncturing the L4-5 space with a 26-gauge spinal needle and injecting 2.3 mL of 0.5% isobaric bupivacaine. The puncture was successful on the first attempt, and the course of anesthesia was without incident. During surgery, arthroscopic examination showed wear of the articular cartilage and a degenerative tear of the medial meniscus; partial excision of the medial meniscus was conducted. Her intraoperative vital signs were normal and the surgery was completed uneventfully. The operation time was 87 minutes. At discharge from the operation room, her sensory block region was below the 10th thoracic vertebra.\nOur patient used a wheelchair one day after the operation and started physiotherapy on her third postoperative day. There were no symptoms of a postdural puncture headache, and the postoperative course was uneventful. On the fifth postoperative day, our patient started to have a headache with vomiting at 6 a.m. while defecating in the toilet. The severe headache persisted even in a supine position,",

On routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, a 15-mm gastric cancer in the remnant stomach was discovered after 3 years. We performed endoscopic submucosal dissection at the first therapy. However, the vertical margin was positive in a pathological result. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed no metastasis in other organs.\nWe performed total gastrectomy with Roux-Y reconstruction and D1 lymph node dissection with laparotomy. Operative findings showed an atrophic liver with liver cirrhosis. When we performed blunt dissection around the gastroesophageal junction, the left pleura was damaged because of severe adhesion around the gastroesophageal junction after laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy. As a result, the left chest cavity was connected through the abdominal cavity. Moreover, we knew that the previous anastomotic site was located in the posterior mediastinum by preoperative diagnosis. Therefore, we dissected the crus of the diaphragm for pulling out the anastomotic site and the esophagus. We did not repair the pleural defect because the orifice of the hernia was small and it was difficult to confirm a defect of the pleura. Two days after the operation, the patient was suspected of having an intrathoracic hernia by chest X-rays (fig. ).

    "original_text": "A 25-year-old man with no significant medical history presented with a rectal foreign body. According to the patient, it was PUF. He used to insert many different kinds of materials, but this was the first time that he could not retrieve it himself. Digital rectal palpation revealed a hard mass with a smooth surface in the anal canal. Laboratory findings and physical examinations were almost normal. A plain radiograph in upright and supine positions showed an increase of colorectal gas without bowel distension, but, unfortunately, an abnormal shadow that looked like a foreign body was not detected. The gas distribution in the rectum and left colon on both upright and supine positions was strangely almost equal (Figures and ). On initial CT images for detecting the exact location of the foreign body and adverse abdominal events, perforation and intra-abdominal bleeding were not detected. Moreover, the foreign body itself and its exact location were not depicted contrary to our expectations (). An endoscopy showed a yellowish mass with a sharply demarcated margin 7 cm from the anal ring, perhaps the lower edge of the foreign body. A physician promptly tried to retrieve it using alligator forceps, but the foreign body was fixed, brittle, easily crushed, and the strategy was not successful.

The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus and pregnancy-induced hypertension. Apgars were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. No neck mass was reported on prenatal ultrasound. The lack of maternal fetal medicine specialists at the community hospital might explain the quality of prenatal ultrasound. In the well baby nursery at the community hospital a right neck mass was noted. Due to history of spitting on regular infant formula, soy-based formula was started, but without improvement. She was transferred to the Regional Neonatal Center for further evaluation and management of the neck mass.\nThe baby was on room air for 1 week when she developed stridor. The neck mass had increased in size and a Pediatric ENT consult was obtained. An MRI demonstrated \"a cystic lesion in the nasopharynx and right neck which inferiorly followed the course of the right carotid artery probably consistent with cystic hygroma\" [fig. ]. The mass continued to increase in size so a follow-up MRI and MRA were done. MRI showed increase in size of right posterior retropharyngeal to right neck cystic mass measuring 4.1 cm and displacing the trachea and oropharynx to the left and the right carotid artery posteriorly and laterally [fig. ]. MRA showed the right common carotid artery displaced posteriorly and laterally without definite hemodynamic stenosis. But it is possible that neurovascular and respiratory structures of the neck were compressed during labor to cause fetal bradycardia. Carotid duplex ultrasound was recommended, which was severely limited due to displacement of vessels, presence of the mass and small size of the neck. To reduce fluid build up in the neck mass, the patient was started on 0.1 mg/kg of dexamethasone every 6 hours after the first MRI. She was later intubated for stridor and concern of potential airway obstruction. A team",

At the age of 12 years she showed bilateral muscle weakness on her peroneal muscles with absence of peripheral reflexes. Neurography and electromyography showed sensorimotor polyneuropathy and chronic neurogenic changes in her leg muscles. An MRI scan of the brain was repeated showing the same lesion as described at the age of 8 years (Fig. ).

Antibiotic administration failed to show any improvement, and the patient was referred to the Department of Vascular Surgery. His past medical history included psoriasis, ringworm in the extremities, thrombocytosis, and heart failure. Physical examination revealed obvious swelling of the left limb with local heat and pigmentation on the ankle. The patient did not have high body temperature or elevated inflammatory response. Color-flow Doppler ultrasonography revealed arterialized waveforms in dilated superficial veins, with increased PSV and high-velocity turbulent flow, especially in the pigmented area (). CT showed early contrast filling in the dilated superficial veins during the arterial phase, with no nidus in either limb ( and ). The left limb showed greater contrast filling of the veins in the arterial phase. No deep venous thrombosis or evidence of varices was observed. The refractory edema in the left limb was diagnosed as stasis dermatitis secondary to multiple AVFs. Compression therapy using elastic stockings did not reduce the symptoms. Erosive lesions and a large amount of effusion were present on the patients\u2019 left lower limb ().

She denied a history of fever on admission, but was treated with cyclophosphamide 1 month prior for an episode of cerebral lupus. She had noticed a papule over the left deltoid region which progressed to an ulcer over 1 week. Fever was noted following several days of hospital admission and the ulcer site became painful. She had worked in paddy fields several months prior to the admission when she was in good health. However, she could not recall any precipitating injury at the affected site during working. She is a mother of two and both pregnancies were uncomplicated. She denied history of alcohol abuse or smoking.\nOn examination she was emaciated and had a GCS score of 15/15 following recovery of status epilepticus. There was no obvious lymphadenopathy. At presentation, the size of the ulcer was about a 3 cm lesion and it gradually developed in to an ulcer with a necrotic center with surrounding erythema. A tentative diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum was made with the appearance of the ulcer (Figure ). It gradually advanced into the underlying muscle over 3 weeks of onset despite the antibiotic treatment. Examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory systems, and the abdomen was normal.\nHer full blood count, blood picture, and other supportive investigations showed evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia, which was suggestive of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura which resolved following plasmapheresis. Her ESR was persistently normal. Renal functions were stable during hospital stay, so were the liver profile. Chest radiography revealed evidence of bilateral mild pleural effusions and echocardiography revealed a thin rim of pericardial effusion and good cardiac function. MRI, MRA brain showed evidence of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome.

The patient was admitted for the elective cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation. She was referred from the rural primary care hospital where routine ultrasonography revealed low-lying placentation. A Doppler ultrasound at 35 weeks showed complete covering of the cervical os which was attached to the scar with incessant hemorrhagic lesions in the inner anterior myometrium, indicative signs of PA (Figure ). She had diagnosed placentation in the lower uterine segment and had given a history of irregular, painless bleeding of the vagina during the fifth and seventh months of gestation. Further, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, images still revealed that the placenta was completely covering the cervical os and suspected implantation of placental villi penetrating the full thickness of the myometrium, which further extending posteriorly up to the bladder wall and anteriorly displayed vascular engorgement (Figure ). On the day of surgery, an expert urologic surgeon had been involved along with the interventional cardiology team. During the cesarean, the uterus was opened along the midline in upper segment of uterus, and a baby of the 3 kg was delivered with a good Apgar score. Due to invasive placentation and bleeding, cesarean hysterectomy was proceeded immediately after the birth of the baby. The lower uterine segment was noted to be relatively thin but was covered by a plexus of deep vessels which spread over the bladder near the broad ligament which was covered by peritoneum. The bladder was opened and repaired due to continuous bleeding as the placenta extended to the bladder. Left-sided salpingo-oophorectomy was also performed due to constant bleeding from the left tubo-ovarian ligament. The estimated blood loss was approximately 3500 mL during the procedure. Afterward, three units of whole blood were transfused, and two hemaccel infusions were given. The patient was kept on inotropic support in postoperative ICU for 24",

The most recent surgery the patient had undergone was an operation for a rotator cuff lesion 7 years previously. Six days earlier she had received two red blood cell transfusions and one transfusion of pooled platelets. The patient was diagnosed with light-chain MM 7 years ago. During the following years she received several lines of treatment with alkylating chemotherapy, glucocorticoids, immunomodulatory drugs and radiation therapy. Two years ago, she developed transfusion-dependent anaemia and thrombocytopenia and a new bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetic karyotyping revealed therapy-related MDS. Treatment with 5-azacytidine and recombinant erythropoietin or thrombopoietin was ineffective. Subsequently the patient was put on supportive treatment with oral 12.5 mg prednisolone daily and supportive transfusion therapy. She was in partial remission for her MM at the time of infection. Due to severe thrombocytopenia and prednisolone treatment the patient had had several prior episodes with minor GI bleedings before the time of the infection.

The patient needed assistance with activities of daily living because of left hemiplegia due to cerebral infarction 1 year earlier. On arrival at the hospital, her vital signs were stable. Laboratory investigations revealed leukocytosis of 11,900 \u00d7 10\n6/L and elevated levels of CRP at 19.55 mg/dL. Urgent CT revealed a fluid collection and free air in an extremely dilated uterine cavity, although only a small amount of ascites was observed in the pelvic cavity (). The patient complained of abnormal purulent vaginal discharge, which lead to a diagnosis of severe pyometra. Transcervical drainage was performed with release of 180 mL of purulent uterine discharge. With administration of FMOX to treat of endometritis and pelvic peritonitis, the amount of vaginal discharge decreased but the fluid collection in the abdominal cavity increased gradually and CRP levels increased to 38.75 mg/dL. Three days after admission, repeat CT revealed a large increase in the amount of the fluid collection in the pelvic cavity and upper abdomen, up to the level of the liver, as well as a collapsed uterine cavity (). Treatment for progressive generalized peritonitis was considered. We selected laparoscopic irrigation and drainage, as minimally invasive interventions, in consideration of her advanced age, poor performance status (PS 4)and possibility of vaginal drainage. Laparoscopic surgery with 2 ports was performed 4 days after admission. Massive purulent ascites and inflammatory adhesions were observed in the entire abdominal cavity (). After extensive suction of the purulent material and irrigation, we found a small scar with serosal spotting on the anterior wall of uterine body, which was attributed to SPP (). The leakage of purulent uterine discharge into the abdominal cavity might have occurred through this site of perforation. Uterine contractions might have led to scarring by the time of laparoscopic surgery.",

She had been suffering from abdominal pain for about 1 year, and the pain has become more intense in the last 6 months. The pain was postprandial and localized to the right upper abdomen. She has become icteric with generalized spread plus itching since past 2 months. The patient had no history of alcohol consumption or smoking. The patient was referred to us with a highly probable diagnosis of pancreatic head and neck carcinoma to be consulted for surgery. Also, a plastic stent was implanted for her in the previous health center due to intra- and extrahepatic duct dilation for the relief of patient symptoms and signs. After admission to our hospital, she was evaluated by abdominal computed tomography (CT), endosonographic imaging, and diagnostic ampullary biopsy. The abdominal CT scan with contrast exhibited an 18 mm \u00d7 20 mm hypodense mass at the head and neck of the pancreas (). Also, endosonographic imaging was performed to rule out periampullary lesions (). A 20 mm \u00d7 19 mm lesion was seen in the pancreatic head and neck region, and the main pancreatic duct was slightly dilated in the body of the pancreas. Moreover, the common bile duct (CBD) was distally thickened and contained sludge. Subsequently, diagnostic biopsy for pathological assessment was done. The biopsy revealed an irregular gray-creamy soft tissue which had undifferentiated malignant tumor features at microscopic evaluations. During the Whipple procedure, after cutting the neck of the pancreas in the left side of the portal vein, the frozen section revealed more involvement of pancreatic tissue. Although additional 2 cm was resected, the pancreas residue still had tumor involvement, macroscopically. Therefore, the patient was undergone total pancreatectomy.\nPostoperative pathological studies were established and indicated a tumor with the greatest dimension of 4 cm which was extended to the duodenum.

The pathological diagnosis was spindle cell sarcoma, and the lesion recurred locally. She was referred to our hospital 2 months after the initial excision.\nPhysical examination of the right anterior knee region revealed the transverse excision scar and tumor at the medial side of the tibial tuberosity. The tumor was elastic and soft, and movable, and its longitudinal diameter was 3 cm. Diffuse swelling was seen around the tumor. The range of motion of the knee joint was normal. Plain radiographs showed no abnormality. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a well-margined mass adjacent to the patellar tendon and that a part of the tumor crept under the patellar tendon. The tumor showed low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Fat suppression T2-weighted images showed a high signal intensity area around the tumor, suggesting edema (). The swelling of the surrounding tissue was severe. Thus, if additional wide resection with the safety surgical margin including this edema area were to be established, the extent of skin and subcutaneous tissue excision was expected to be considerable. Therefore, preoperative radiation (total dose 25 Gy) was performed in order to reduce the surgical margin. MRI after preoperative radiotherapy showed the reduction of the tumor size (reduction rate 34%), and the extent of high signal intensity around the tumor was reduced on fat suppression T2-weighted images (). We established a 3 cm skin margin from the edema area, and performed wide resection of the tissues surrounding the tumor, including almost the full length of the patellar tendon (the patellar tendon was resected transversely 1 cm from the inferior pole of the patella), the infrapatellar fat pad, and the tibial tuberosity.\nA 4 \u00d7 10 cm portion of the fascia lata attached to iliac bone was harvested.

Eight years ago, she was treated with reduction and internal fixation of lumbar spondylolisthesis. The patient can walk independently without help, but is limited to 100 m due to knee pain. Many of her basic life activities cannot be completed, including wearing socks.\nPhysical examination: Right hip has sinus closure scar and hip joint fused in 15\u00b0 of abduction, 15\u00b0 of flexion, and 20\u00b0 of external rotation and ipsilateral knee joint fused in 20\u00b0 of flexion. There was tenderness in the medial joint space of the right knee and a sense of friction during activity. The patella grinding test was positive and patella lateral movement was less than 0.5 cm.

Relapse subsequently occurred, and at the age of 56 years, he received a diagnosis of a recurrent right inguinal hernia, for which the Kugel method was performed. Six years later, he visited a local physician with the chief complaint of lower abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) showed thickening of his bladder and cecal wall; mesh infection was suspected and he was referred to our department.\nMild tenderness was apparent in his lower abdomen at presentation. Hematologic findings revealed that although his white blood cell count was normal, his C-reactive protein was slightly increased to 1.44 mg/dl. His urine analysis was positive for occult blood and bacterial contamination, and enteric bacteria were detected in urine cultures. An abdominal CT showed a poorly defined mass in contact with the cecal wall in the right inguinal region; the mass was also in contact with his bladder wall (Fig. ). When lower gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed, a Kugel patch that had migrated into his intestinal tract was confirmed in the cecum wall on the side opposite to the Bauhin valve (Fig. ).\nBecause we suspected that the fistula formation in his intestinal tract and bladder was due to the mesh, we scheduled a mesh removal procedure, but our patient felt left testicular pain 2 days before surgery, and an ultrasound examination revealed swelling of the left epididymis. Therefore, we diagnosed epididymitis. We thought that a mesh-related urinary tract infection was the cause of the epididymitis and performed surgical removal of the mesh.\nFollowing laparotomy with a midline abdominal incision in which intraperitoneal observation was performed, the cecum was found to be firmly adhered near the right internal inguinal ring. There was no mesh exposure in his abdominal cavity, but when the adhesion was separated, we confirmed the presence of mesh migrating into his intestinal tract and piercing the",
