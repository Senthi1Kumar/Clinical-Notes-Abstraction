Additionally, several lesions believed to be metastatic lymph nodes were observed in the ipsilateral axilla (Figures and ). On mammography (MMG), fine pleomorphic microcalcifications with segmental distribution were noted in the lower outer portion of her right breast (). On MRI, the lesion showed about 6.5 cm sized, nonmass enhancement lesion with heterogeneous internal enhancement pattern and occupied most of the right breast, except the lower inner portion ().\nShe underwent US-guided core needle biopsy in the lower outer portion of her right breast and of the pathological lymph nodes in the right axilla. She was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ in the breast and metastatic lymphadenopathy in the right axilla. She underwent modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection, and the final diagnosis was invasive ductal carcinoma with axillary metastasis (T2N3M0; estrogen receptor positive; progesterone receptor positive; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative; Ki-67 10\u201320%). We analyzed DNA from peripheral blood in order to evaluate the presence of mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Specific coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sequence alterations were confirmed at the genomic level with PCR amplification, and no mutation was noted in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. She received postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

After undergoing surgery, he received DVT prophylaxis with two days of low molecular weight heparin while hospitalized and was then discharged home on 81 mg of aspirin daily. Prior to surgery, the patient led an active lifestyle, including regular elliptical use and golfing. Following his LKA he attended all physical therapy sessions. One month following surgery, he abruptly became lightheaded and dyspneic, with no relief of symptoms upon rest. He presented to his local emergency department where he was noted to have sinus tachycardia and hypoxia. CT pulmonary angiogram revealed a large saddle pulmonary embolism with an extension of the clot into multiple lobar and segmental branches (Figures -).\nCardiac enzymes were normal and EKG showed no ischemic changes. NT-pro-BNP was elevated at 154 pg/mL. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderately increased right ventricular size with moderately depressed right ventricular systolic function, and mild pulmonary hypertension, consistent with the diagnosis of submassive pulmonary embolism. He received high-flow nasal cannula and heparin and was admitted to the ICU.\nDuring his hospital stay, he also had a Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities revealing a non-occlusive deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the right popliteal and peroneal veins and a head CT due to dizziness which showed no acute process. He remained hemodynamically stable and supplemental oxygen was weaned. Intravenous anticoagulation therapy with heparin was transitioned to apixaban.

Serial transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) performed in our institution showed progressive degenerative aortic valve disease.\nAt presentation, his TTE showed degenerative bicuspid aortic valve with fusion of the right and left coronary cusps by an incomplete raphe. The appearance of the valve was consistent with severe aortic stenosis which was confirmed by hemodynamic Doppler assessment that revealed a peak gradient of 65 mm Hg, aortic valve area of 0.9 cm2 derived from the continuity equation and a dimensionless velocity index (DVI) of 0.24. Left ventricular function was normal with an ejection fraction (EF) of 59% by Simpson's method. Further evaluation of the aortic valve and aorto-iliac anatomy was pursued by a Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT).

Following the IVC insertion, he had been treated with warfarin for one year and had been on anti-platelet therapy since.\nHe had been admitted to the hospital three days prior to transfer after presenting with progressive bilateral lower extremity pain and decreased sensation in his gluteal region. Acute bilateral DVTs involving the common femoral and popliteal veins were diagnosed. Over 48 h, despite receiving unfractionated heparin, he developed anuric renal failure and shock.

Electrocardiography showed T wave inversion at leads V1-5, III, and aVF, right axis deviation, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Initial echocardiography revealed an echogenic mass in the main pulmonary artery with significant flow obstruction and right ventricular dysfunction suggesting pulmonary embolism. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed an embolism-like mass in the pulmonary trunk and in both sides of the main pulmonary arteries (). Pulmonary artery endarterectomy with pulmonary valve replacement and pulmonary artery reconstruction were performed. The surgical specimen showed an ill-defined, protruding polypoid mass that was 4.8 cm in the greatest dimension. The pathology revealed pulmonary artery intimal sarcoma, which was supported by positive smooth muscle actin and negative desmin in immunohistochemical staining (). Involvement of the resection margin by the tumor was noted. She received radiation therapy (4,500 cGy fractionated) and chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and dacarbazine) as adjuvant treatments. During follow-up, she was regularly checked by echocardiography and chest CT. There was no evidence of local recurrence on echocardiography. On initial follow-up chest CT (November 2001, 2 years after initial surgery), mild diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland with multiple small low density lesions was discovered. It is hard to know if these findings existed before the initial operation, because the preoperative chest CT did not include the neck. She showed normal thyroid function tests. This lesion was just followed up with chest CT yearly and showed no change for 3 years.\nIn August 2004 (4.7 years after initial surgery), she was referred to an endocrinologist for abnormal thyroid function tests.

Her medical history was positive for hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, and anxiety disorder. She was hospitalized in the ICU for 15 d and kept on mechanical ventilation for 5 d. The patient was subjected to neurological evaluation because of her report of mental confusion, visual and auditory hallucinations, insomnia, and psychomotor agitation soon after sedation removal. After discharge to the infirmary, she showed spontaneous improvement of agitation, though with persistent complaint of short-term memory problems and executive dysfunction. The patient also complained of a burning pain in inferior members and imbalance when walking, being able to walk only with assistance. Upon neurological exam, the patient was alert, conscious, and temporally disoriented. The oculomotor exam revealed paresis of the conjugated downward gaze without nystagmus. She also had discrete cerebellar dysmetria of the upper extremities, ataxic gait needing assistance to walk, compromised static balance, and a positive Romberg test.

His diagnosis of multiple myeloma was made four months prior after he was found to have lytic lesions in the right humerus, left tenth thoracic vertebra, left first lumbar vertebra and right sacrum on imaging performed after a right humeral pathological fracture. The imaging also revealed a large left chest wall mass, thought to be likely from extraosseous involvement by myeloma. Staging workup was completed including skeletal survey and bone marrow biopsy. Bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellularity with 90% involvement by atypical plasma cells which appear as large-sized, binucleated cells with dense chromatin and prominent nucleoli (Figure ). Syndecan-1 (CD138) and kappa light chain IHC staining showed extensive plasma cell involvement belonging to kappa subtype (Figures ). The cytogenetic analysis also revealed multiple chromosomal abnormalities compatible with a complex cytogenetic profile of male karyotype with derivative chromosomes 17, 14 and 10. Serum protein electrophoresis detected a monoclonal spike, with immunofixation detecting IgA kappa type. Serum IgA levels were 2519 mg/dL (normal reference range: 66-436 mg/dL); immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels were decreased. The patient was determined to have stage III using the revised international staging system (R-ISS). The treatment plan was to start the patient on nine to 12 weeks of bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone velcade, revlimid, low dose (VRd) regimen followed by re-staging.

He works as an electrician and described a chemical spill on his right hand in 2013. He described the substance as consisting of hydraulic fluid, glycol, and penetrant. He was noted to have abnormal skin changes and intermittent swelling in his wrist and hand. At that time, he had been prescribed topical steroids without relief. He reported worsening of his right hand and wrist swelling over the past 2 months, shortly after helping his wife move a fish tank. He does not believe that his hand was in the water tank. He is frequently outdoors and works with the soil in his yard. He also frequently swims in a freshwater lake. His physical exam was abnormal for profound swelling of the right thumb, the volar aspect of the right wrist, and the right 5th finger (). Initial laboratory results showed a slightly elevated CRP of 1.4 mg/dL and normal ESR at 13 mm/h. An MRI demonstrated enhancement of the flexor tendon sheaths in the wrist and hand (). He underwent a radical synovectomy of the hand and wrist (). He was initially started on intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam.\nPathology was suggestive of necrotizing granulomatous tenosynovitis. The initial piperacillin/tazobactam was discontinued. Given the patient's history of exposure to a fish tank, the biopsy tissue was sent for an acid-fast bacilli (AFB) culture. The AFB smear was positive. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was thought to be less likely, given the lack of tuberculosis exposure history and environmental exposures concerning for an atypical mycobacterial infection.

Biochemical and radiological assessment showed features of acute pancreatitis in terms of elevated pancreatic enzyme level, and CT abdomen finding showed edematous pancreas with normal ductal system. It was attributed to hormonal replacement therapy after thorough investigation. Although the patient had stopped the implicated medications, she still had recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis.\nSince there was no obvious cause found for her recurrent episodes of pancreatitis, autoimmune pancreatitis was suspected.\nThen, she underwent endoscopic ultrasound in 2015 which revealed mass swelling at the duodenal ampulla, and biopsy was taken. The biopsy showed ampullary adenoma with high-grade dysplasia (Figures and ).\nThen, the patient decided to go abroad for further assessment where she underwent Whipple's procedure and histopathology confirmed the presence of ampullary adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.\nUnfortunately, she continued to have recurrent episodes of pancreatitis despite the removal of the ampullary adenoma.\nIn 2016, while she was admitted under care of a surgical team for another episode of pancreatitis, she was reviewed by the rheumatology team to rule out autoimmune condition. Therefore, IgG4 level was tested (1.49 g/L (149 mg/dl)). The biopsy was reassessed and found to have increased IgG4-positive plasma cells around 30\u201340 per high-power field with the background of adenoma with high-grade dysplasia. Accordingly, she was diagnosed to have both IgG4-related disease and ampullary adenoma.\nShe was started on oral prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg and rituximab therapy with significant improvement over 1 year of follow-up as the pancreatitis attacks have reduced from around once in every month to around once in every 3 to 4 months after 3 months of rituximab therapy, and currently she remained attack free for around one year.",

At physical examination, a palpable nodule of ~2 cm in size was detected in the isthmus of the thyroid. There were no palpable cervical lymph-nodes. An US evaluation confirmed an isolated lesion located in the isthmus, showing an isoechoic solid nodule with smooth margins; its size was 18 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 6 mm with intra and perilesional vascularity (Figure ). Therefore, a FNA was performed and cytological results revealed a TIR3A lesion.

Thus, we assessed the risk factors associated with the isolated TIR 3A nodule of our patient. According to the ATA guidelines we repeated the FNA which confirmed the same result (TIR3A). The second US (after 6 months) showed that there were no clear signs suggesting malignancy such as microcalcifications or taller than wide-shaped nodules. However, we found a small hypoechoic cranial component in the nodule with blurred margins and elastography revealed an increased stiffness in this cranial component.

There was no history of trauma or excessive physical exercise. He had no other complaints and used no medication. Medical history recorded a subdural haematoma, as a result of trauma. According to the family history, his mother and aunt were both diagnosed with ADPKD. Our patient was a non-smoker, with no history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus or hypercholesterolaemia.\nOn physical examination, the blood pressure was 155/102 mmHg and the pulse 72 beats/minute; other vital parameters were normal. Electrocardiography showed a sinus rhythm of 65 beats/minute and ST elevation in the precordial leads (). Creatine kinase was 249 U/L, creatine kinase MB was 17.4 U/L and troponin T was 0.21 ng/mL. The other laboratory test results were normal. Twelve hours later, the cardiac enzymes increased to higher levels. Echocardiography revealed a hypokinetic septum and a slightly impaired left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 45\u201360%.\nBased on these results, a presumptive diagnosis of acute septal myocardial infarction was made. The patient was immediately transported to the University Medical Centre for cardiac intervention. Coronary artery angiography (CAG) revealed a transient occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, most probably as a result of myocardial bridging (). Other coronary arteries appeared normal. Percutaneous coronary intervention was not performed due to small vessel size. The myocardial infarction was treated with anti-platelet therapy, statin and metoprolol.\nHowever, the chest pain returned 3 days after the presentation. A second electrocardiography showed persistent inverted T waves in the precordial leads without ST elevation. The cardiac enzyme levels were again increasing. A second CAG was performed because of suspicion of recurrent myocardial infarction. It disclosed an open LAD with a dissection in the distal part and a double lumen, which was not observed",

    "original_text": "A 71-year old woman was admitted to the hospital in November 2018. The clinical examination showed no abnormalities. Biochemical parameters in blood showed normal values apart from slightly elevated gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) (160 U/l, normal up to 40U/l). She never smoked and had no family history of lung or gastrointestinal cancers. She developed dry cough over the last 6 weeks, which was resistant to treat. Therefore a chest X-ray was done, which showed an irregular left border of the heart. A subsequent chest CT-scan showed a paracardiac nodule with 2 \u00d7 1.8 cm in diameter (Fig. ), no mediastinal lymph nodes enlargement and no pleural effusions were detected.\nA bronchoscopic examination with bronchial lavage was done. The lavage revealed acid proof rods, which were immediately tested for M. tuberculosis by quantiferon screening. Since the medical report was negative for tuberculosis, surgery was performed for histological diagnosis.\nThe exploration of the entire hemithorax left showed massive dorso-basal adhesions between the lower lobe and the thoracic wall, as well as the diaphragm. After adhesiolysis, the tumor within the lingual segment was exposed, biopsied and a histopathological frozen section examination was performed, which showed malignancy. The tumor was then anatomically resected using video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) to remove both segments of the lingual. Complete mediastinal lymph node dissection was done.

Samples and medical history were collected with the full informed consent of the patient and his parents in accordance with the declaration on the human genome prepared by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization. This study was approved by.\nUrine analysis revealed the sample was occult blood + and protein ++. Serological analysis revealed elevated urea nitrogen, creatinine, and cystatin C (26.55 mmol/L, 719.0 \u03bcmol/L, and 3.56 mg/L, respectively). In addition, the CT examination of the urinary system revealed that the patient's left and right kidneys were 53 \u00d7 22 mm and 61 \u00d7 27 mm, respectively, indicating bilateral renal atrophy (Figure ). In addition, except for continuous nocturia, there were no obvious abnormalities on physical examination. In terms of treatment, the patient began continuous peritoneal dialysis after admission to relieve renal deterioration.\nThe patient had occasional chest tightness, palpitations (heart rate 113 bpm), no dyspnea, chest pain or discomfort, and exercise was not restricted under normal conditions. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, pulmonary hypertension, and no atrial fibrillation. The results of echocardiography indicated a slight increase in left ventricular diameter (left ventricular end-diastolic diameter 56 mm and end-systolic diameter 34 mm), with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%.

Three weeks prior to presentation, the patient had completed a course of treatment with azithromycin for otitis media, with subsequent perforation of her tympanic membrane.

She had a four-week history of non-specific left-sided abdominal pain, nausea, reduced appetite, passing dark stools, and breathlessness on exertion. The patient was given 10 mg of oral vitamin K and two units of packed-cell blood transfusion followed by an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which did not reveal any source of upper gastrointestinal bleeding or abnormality. Four days later while an inpatient, she became acutely confused and unwell with symptoms and signs of a chest infection including fever and severe hypotension, which did not respond to intravenous antibiotics and intravenous fluids. Further investigations revealed results, which prompted endocrinology assessment. The patient\u2019s past medical history consisted of hypothyroidism for which she took levothyroxine 125 \u00b5g daily and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) for which she took warfarin tablets 3 mg daily for previous cranial vasculitis and thromboembolic episodes. She had been tried on hydroxychloroquine in the past but this was stopped because of visual side effects, and her SLE was under control. Apart from that, the patient was usually fit and well. There was no past history of prolonged high-dose corticosteroid usage, but she had received a short course (prednisolone 10 mg daily for one week) two years prior to this presentation.\nOn the day of admission, she was pale and had mild tenderness in the left iliac fossa on abdominal examination.

Her immunosuppressive regimen in the immediate posttransplant period included tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid, and prednisone. In July 2016, a diagnosis of possible tacrolimus-related posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome was made on the basis of clinical and radiologic findings, and her immunosuppression was changed to everolimus-based therapy.

She was also admitted due to a headache that was triggered primarily by coughing. Vital signs on admission were as follows: a blood pressure of 202/90 mmHg, a heart rate of 137 bpm, a respiratory rate of 20, and a temperature of 36.6 Celsius. Physical exam revealed Janeway lesions. She was found to have a neutrophilic leukocytosis, with white blood cell count at 20.4 cells/mm3 and neutrophils at 17.4 bil/L. Troponin was elevated at 1.85; this was deemed to be noncardiac in nature as the patient's pain was relieved with ibuprofen and her EKG showed no acute findings. ESR and CRP were elevated at 95 mm/hr and 24.8 mg/dL, respectively. A computed tomography of the brain showed a high-density mass in the right occipital lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema. The patient continued to deny any visual changes or symptoms other than what was discussed above. An ophthalmologist was consulted to perform a dilated fundus exam, which was positive for small intraretinal hemorrhages that were deemed to be secondary to the patient's hypertension and less likely positive for Roth's spots. There was no evidence of disc edema. A brain MRI with and without gadolinium showed multiple small punctate bilateral areas of acute or subacute infarctions indicative of embolic phenomenon.

She had a past medical history of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and uterine fibroids. In the month prior to her presentation she had sustained a traumatic comminuted fracture of her right third metacarpophalangeal joint which was managed conservatively with splinting.

Following delivery she was not on any regular medications. There was no history of drug allergies. Following assessment at the maternity day unit it was concluded that her shoulder tip pain was related to her fibroids and she was discharged with analgesia and safety-netting.\nTwo days later, she was admitted as a priority call to our emergency department with a working diagnosis of possible massive pulmonary embolism from the ambulance service.

Vital signs on admission were as follows: a blood pressure of 202/90 mmHg, a heart rate of 137 bpm, a respiratory rate of 20, and a temperature of 36.6 Celsius. Physical exam revealed Janeway lesions. She was found to have a neutrophilic leukocytosis, with white blood cell count at 20.4 cells/mm3 and neutrophils at 17.4 bil/L. Troponin was elevated at 1.85; this was deemed to be noncardiac in nature as the patient's pain was relieved with ibuprofen and her EKG showed no acute findings. ESR and CRP were elevated at 95 mm/hr and 24.8 mg/dL, respectively. A computed tomography of the brain showed a high-density mass in the right occipital lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema. The patient continued to deny any visual changes or symptoms other than what was discussed above. An ophthalmologist was consulted to perform a dilated fundus exam, which was positive for small intraretinal hemorrhages that were deemed to be secondary to the patient's hypertension and less likely positive for Roth's spots.

She developed foetal bradycardia 6 hours after initiating induction. An emergency caesarean section was done under general anaesthesia as the epidural catheter which had been timed for established labour had not yet been inserted. She was given frusemide and antibiotics peri-partum. A 2020g live baby was delivered. She was discharged from hospital on day 7 on warfarin and was stable when reviewed by both physician and obstetrician 14 days postpartum.

A mild mitral regurgitation (MR) was noticed, while aortic valve leaflets and function were normal. Left cardiac catheterization showed 50% stenosis of left main and chronic total occlusion of the right coronary artery; therefore surgical myocardial revascularization was scheduled. The medical history of this patient was significant for impaired glucose tolerance, previous smoking, and Hodgkin's disease (HD) when he was 33 years old. Because of this, he was submitted to mediastinal radiation therapy (RT), with negative follow-up thereafter.

Ascending aorta (AA) and pulmonary artery were partially covered by fibrotic tissue, and dissection to allow side clamping of the aorta was demanding. Finally, we did not succeed in punching the aortic wall, because it was abnormally hyperplastic; we decided to change strategy, preparing a composite Y-graft (SV to LITA) for obtuse marginal branch.

Follow-up lumbar puncture showed 510 white cells per mm3 (82% lymphocytes), 144 mg/dL protein and 61 mg/dL glucose. CSF culture studies were negative for bacteria, fungi and tuberculosis. PCR of the CSF confirmed the presence of HSV1. The patient was free of neurological symptoms, with a Glasgow Coma Scale of E4M6V5, and was admitted for close observation and continuation of iv acyclovir. Corticosteroid treatment was discontinued upon her admission. On day 3 of hospitalization, the patient presented with a sudden onset of vomiting and severe headache. Brain CT showed an increased amount of temporal lobe hemorrhage and a leftward shift in the midline (Fig. ). Mannitol was administered but did not seem to have a significant effect. The patient became increasingly drowsy, and her right pupil became dilated. She underwent emergency right decompressive craniectomy, expansile duraplasty and ICP monitor insertion. Postoperative brain CT showed alleviation of midline shifting (Fig. ). The patient recovered fully 5 days after the surgery.

    "original_text": "We present a 10-years-old girl with a history of tissue swelling involving the third digit of left hand, bilateral wrists and ankles. At 2 years of age, she first developed soft tissue masses above both wrists and ankles without pain, warmth or redness. She did not receive any treatment and the soft tissue masses enlarged slowly. Two years later, she underwent surgery to remove the ankle masses and pathology was reported to be consistent with chronic bursitis. However, swelling gradually recurred near the surgical sites within 1 year.\nAt 6 years of age, a new mass appeared on the palmar aspect of the left hand at the base of the third digit (). The mass was resected and histology illustrated hallmark features of GCTTS including an abundance of multinucleated giant cells (; see for full images). This diagnosis was confirmed by three independent pathologists that reviewed the histology. One year later, the patient started experiencing joint pain and gradual decline in the range of motion of wrists and ankles. Pain and swelling affected additional joints including bilateral elbows and the fifth PIP joint of left hand.\nWith progression of symptoms, the patient was referred to our Rheumatology Clinic for evaluation. Physical examination was notable for symmetric soft tissue masses along the anterior tibialis tendon of ankles and extensor tendons of the wrists (). She had tenderness and reduced range motion of those joints, suggestive of active synovitis. Laboratory investigations including complete blood count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, HLA-B27, T-Spot, rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies and anti-nuclear antibodies were all unremarkable.

Repeat scan at 8 weeks revealed absent cardiac activity and evacuation was carried out at a local hospital. Immediate postabortal period was uneventful.\nShe was febrile with significant tachycardia and no pallor. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in left iliac fossa and hypogastrium with no palpable mass. Vulval inspection revealed asymmetry at the introitus with a bulge on the left side and unhealthy vaginal discharge. Swab was taken for C and S. Per speculum examination not carried out due to severe tenderness. On bimanual examination cervix felt high-up and to the right side, cephalad and posterior to a tender cystic mass of about 10 cm \u00d7 8 cm on the left side, uterine body normal in size, and tender on palpation.

    "original_text": "The deceased donor was a 67-year-old man with a kidney Doppler ultrasound (DUS) that was negative for any nodular lesion. As part of the routine postoperative follow-up management, the recipient underwent DUS to assess the patency of the graft on postoperative day 1. The DUS finding was suspicious for an acute arterial thrombosis but did not reveal any focal irregularities. Consequently, a computed tomography (CT) scan was urgently obtained but it did not show any arterial complications. However, it serendipitously revealed a 2.4-cm lesion on the upper pole of the renal allograft which was not detected during the back-table or ultrasonography monitoring. A biopsy of the lesion was performed, and its histology revealed an epithelial proliferation of large cells with finely granular cytoplasm and medium round nucleus vesicular acidophilus, arranged tubules, and alveoli and cords immersed in a connective tissue stroma. This picture was consistent with oncocytoma. However, because the eosinophilic variant of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (RCC) may morphologically resemble renal oncocytoma, immunohistochemical staining was performed using Ki-67 antibodies and RCC antigens. The results were negative, ruling out chromophobe RCC. The therapeutic options and potential related outcomes were clearly discussed with the patient. Given the low risk of malignant transformation in an oncocytoma [], we found no reason for resection of the lesion or an allograft nephrectomy. Consequently, we opted for active surveillance of the benign tumor with ultrasonography, every 2 months, for the first year and, then, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), every year (Fig. ). The patient received mycophenolate-mofetil, tacrolimus, and prednisone throughout the 5-year follow-up period and the regimen for immunosuppression was not changed despite the presence of the renal mass. After 60 months of active surveillance, we report that radiological studies have shown no growth, regression, or any other interim morphological changes to the lesion, and the patient is alive and well (Fig. ).",
    "cleaned_text": "the deceased donor was a 67-year-old man with a kidney doppler ultrasound (dus) that was negative for any nodular lesion. as part of the routine postoperative follow-up management, the recipient underwent dus to assess the patency of the graft on postoperative day 1. the dus finding was suspicious for an acute arterial thrombosis but did not reveal any focal irregularities. consequently, a computed tomography (ct) scan was urgently obtained but it did not show any arterial complications. however, it serendipitously revealed a 2.4-cm lesion on the upper pole of the renal allograft which was not detected during the back-table or ultrasonography monitoring. a biopsy of the lesion was performed, and its histology revealed an epithelial proliferation of large cells with finely granular cytoplasm and medium round nucleus vesicular acidophilus, arranged tubules, and alveoli and cords immersed in a connective tissue stroma. this picture was consistent with oncocytoma. however, because the eosinophilic variant of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (rcc) may morphologically resemble renal oncocytoma, immunohistochemical staining was performed using ki-67 antibodies and rcc antigens. the results were negative, ruling out chromophobe rcc. the therapeutic options and potential related outcomes were clearly discussed with the patient. given the low risk of malignant transformation in an oncocytoma [], we found no reason for resection of the lesion or an allograft nephrectomy. consequently, we opted for active surveillance of the benign tumor with ultrasonography, every 2 months, for the first year and, then, with magnetic resonance imaging (mri), every year (fig. ). the patient received mycophenolate-mofetil, tacrolimus, and prednisone throughout the 5-year follow-up period and the regimen for immunosuppression was not changed despite the presence of the renal mass. after 60 months of active surveillance, we report that radiological studies have shown no growth, regression, or any other interim morphological changes to the lesion, and the patient is alive and well (fig. ).",

On physical examination, the lesion appeared firm with irregular margins. Axillary lymphadenopathy was negative and there were no palpable supraclavicular nodes. On breast imaging, ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic mass with partially defined contours measuring 4.0 \u00d7 3.0 cm, located at the upper region of the right pectoralis major muscle at the 12 o\u2019clock position with muscle infiltration (Fig. ). Histological examination of core biopsy samples revealed a malignant tumor. Preoperative exams, such as X-rays and chest CT scan, abdominal US did not show any signs of disease. Radical mastectomy was then performed, due to pectoralis major muscle infiltration, consisting in removal of the breast along with the major and minor pectoralis muscles. Biopsy of the sentinel lymph node was performed. Gross examination revealed a solid tumor measuring 3.7 \u00d7 3.5 cm with a yellowish-tan cut surface and local foci of hemorrhage. Histopathology showed intravascular papillary proliferation of endothelial cells, spindle cell areas and necrosis, atypia and prominent mitotic figures, consistent with the diagnosis of high-grade angiosarcoma with areas of infiltration of the pectoralis major muscle (HE staining, magnification of 400\u00d7) (Fig. ). Histopathology also demonstrated a surgical specimen with clear margins, absence of angiolymphatic and perineural invasion, in addition to sentinel lymph node free of metastasis. Immunohistochemical study revealed a tumor positive for CD31 marker (Fig. ), confirming the vascular nature of the tumor. At the two-week follow-up of the surgical procedure, adequate wound healing was observed, without any evidence of the disease. The patient was transferred to the clinical oncology department, where he presented with severe headache and seizures after the second cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel.

His 59-year-old father had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease 5 years ago and had peripheral neuropathy as well as carpal tunnel syndrome. He also had a 32-year-old sister who was in good health.\nOn examination, he was a tall, lean man, with a height of 195 cm. He had weakness of the muscles of the proximal left upper limb, particularly the shoulder girdle. He was unable to abduct his left shoulder and had weakness on elbow flexion. Maximum weakness was observed in the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, deltoid, rhomboid, and triceps muscles, with a relative sparing of other muscles in the distal upper limb. Reflexes were preserved. The working diagnosis was that of a brachial plexopathy.\nThe MRI scan of his spinal cord and brachial plexus, performed pre- and post-gadolinium, were normal. Nerve conduction studies, which were performed on August 9 2010, indicated an underlying peripheral neuropathy with mixed features to suggest an axonal and demyelinating polyneuropathy (table ).
