He was immediately intubated with a provisional diagnosis of hypertensive encephalopathy. All investigations being inconclusive to establish a diagnosis, the history was reviewed. It was revealed that at night the child was sleeping on the floor in open air. He suddenly woke up at 3.30 a.m. and complained of severe abdominal pain before going to sleep again. Two hours later he again woke up and complained of difficulty in breathing, swallowing and speaking. He also developed double vision. On his way to the hospital he had an episode of convulsions followed by unconsciousness. Considering the clinical history, physical findings (bulbar and motor paralysis) and inconclusive investigations, an Elapid snake bite was suspected. However, the absence of fang marks or localized swelling and the unusual presentation (hypertension, convulsions and unconsciousness) led to a mistaken diagnosis that stopped us from administering anti snake venom (ASV). Meanwhile the child was managed with ventilator support, Nitroglycerine infusion, intravenous Phenytoin and broad spectrum antibiotics. However, persistent motor paralysis with no improvement in GCS for more than 20 h with no identifiable cause led us to consider an ASV trial. Accordingly, 10 vials of polyvalent anti-venom were administered following which there was a dramatic improvement in both GCS and motor power. However, as he still had abdominal respiration another 10 vials of ASV were administered. Despite the full course of ASV the respiratory muscles appeared weak as tidal volumes generated were low requiring high pressure support mechanical ventilation",

    "original_text": "A 31-year-old male patient visited Severance Hospital for a scalp and skull defect and uncontrolled wound infection (). Two years earlier, the patient had a decompressive craniectomy for traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracranial hemorrhage due to a motorcycle accident. Subsequently, drainage and insertion of an external ventricular drain for a subdural abscess were performed. Cranioplasty with cryopreserved autologous bone graft was performed 6 months after the trauma. The patient continuously scratched the surgical site with his hand, which resulted in a subsequent scalp wound and infection. The infected bone graft was removed, and the soft tissue defect was repaired with local flap advancement. However, surgical site infection and scalp defect recurred, and it was not improved with continuous wound care, debridement, and antibiotic treatment for 3 months. The patient was admitted to our hospital for infection control and reconstruction. At the time of the admission, his level of consciousness was alert, but he was quadriplegic and showed a low score (19) on the Mini-Mental State Examination. Previously grafted artificial dura was exposed, and Klebsiella pneumonia, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Acinetobacter baumannii were identified in wound cultures.\nSince resolution of the infection was a priority, removal of the exposed artificial dura, extensive debridement including infected bone, massive irrigation, duroplasty with Biodesign dural graft (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA), and defect coverage with LD myocutaneous free flap and split-thickness skin graft were performed ().

There was no local erythema or skin lesions, and no palpable lymphadenopathy. There were pain and limitation of abduction, internal and external rotation of the right limb.\nThe remainder of the physical examination was normal. Radiographs revealed a diaphyseal pathologic fracture involving the right humerus with a periosteal reaction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right arm (Figure ) showed an eccentric mass in the diaphysis of the humerus, accompanied by an overlying periosteal reaction. The mass extended to a height of 11 cm, and into surrounding soft tissues. The shoulder and elbow appeared normal. There was no skip metastasis.\nA biopsy was performed. Microscopic examination showed fascicles of spindle cells with areas of collagen fibers, with an elevated mitotic index (Figure ). The microscopic aspect suggests the diagnosis of high grade FS of bone.\nA technetium-99 m labeled methylene diphosphonate radionucl ide (Tc 99 m/HMDP) bone scan revealed an area of increased uptake in the right proximal humerus, without other foci of abnormal isotope uptake that corresponded in location to the abnormalities visualized on MRI. Computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the thorax performed revealed no abnormalities. Laboratory test results were normal, left ventricular fraction ejection (FEV) was normal and equal to 69%.\nSurgical resection is the standard treatment of FS of bone. Early studies support the use of amputation [].

Cardiolite stress test revealed no ischemia, and a 2-dimensional echocardiogram demonstrated normal left ventricular systolic function with no wall motion abnormalities, no significant valvular heart disease, and no pericardial effusion. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, and no acute changes were noted.\nBased on her history of continued symptoms, the patient underwent 2 cardiac catheterizations. The first catheterization revealed normal right-sided heart pressures and 80% stenosis of the left circumflex artery and was followed by percutaneous coronary intervention. The second catheterization occurred 2 months after the first and revealed a patent left circumflex artery stent, but 70% stenosis of the right coronary artery, for which the patient again received percutaneous coronary intervention.\nThe patient continued to experience exertional dyspnea and chest pain, and she subsequently developed dysphagia to solid foods and episodic dizziness. Consultations with a pulmonologist, gastroenterologist, and otolaryngologist revealed no underlying cause for these symptoms apart from evidence of esophageal dysmotility.

She was diagnosed with dry eye by a local physician and prescribed rebamipide ophthalmic suspension to be applied four times a day, which she did for ~4 years until March 2018. In early April 2018, the patient experienced pain and pruritus around her left eye and in mid-April 2018 visited a general practitioner, who prescribed anti-allergic eye drops. Five days later, she experienced severe pain and swelling around her left eye and visited Tsukazaki Hospital for treatment.\nThe patient's visual acuity on the first visit was 20/20 for the right eye; the visual acuity of the left could not be measured because the eyelid was difficult to open. The intraocular pressures were 8 mmHg for the right eye and 13 mmHg for the left eye. Redness and swelling were observed around the nasal side of her left lower eyelid (). Plain computed tomography performed on the same day revealed a high-density mass in the lacrimal sac, ocular cellulitis, and ocular deformation due to an orbital abscess (). On the same day, an incision was made on the lower orbital margin and the intraorbital abscess was drained.

The mass was noted immediately at birth and had slowly grown. The mass did not cause respiratory obstruction and did not obscure the visual field. Postnatally, the baby was diagnosed with a cardiac ventricular septal defect and a patent ductus arteriosus, for which she underwent an uncomplicated open banding procedure at the age of 2 months. The family reported normal development of the child and no concerns regarding milestone achievements compared to her fully healthy twin sister.\nOn clinical examination, she had a large right-sided irregular \u201celephant trunk-like\u201d lesion measuring 10\u00d712 cm that extended from the right medial canthal area to the right side of her oral commissure. The cephalic component of the mass was soft and compressible, but the caudal segment had a bony block, as shown in . The mass completely obstructed and distorted the right nasal airway. The child was able to open her eyes fully. She did not have any intraoral lesions. Intranasal examination showed a bony bar stemming from the inferior turbinate and obstructing the right nasal airway passage. She had a mild hypertelorism.

She had gone to her primary care physician, who performed a chest X-ray and urged her to come to the hospital. Upon presentation at the emergency department, her oxygen saturation was above 95% on room air, and she was not in any respiratory distress, but her exam was significant for decreased breath sound on the right. A chest X-ray confirmed a large right-sided pneumothorax with small pleural effusion. A chest tube was inserted on the right side for the resolution of the pneumothorax, and subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed bilateral diffuse bullous disease of the lung with multiple cysts (Figure -). The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for right thoracoscopic wedge resection of a lung bleb and talc pleurodesis. Gross examination of the specimen revealed several dilated air-like spaces ranging from 0.2 cm to 0.4 cm in size. The hospital course was complicated by postsurgical pneumonia, but she recovered fully and was discharged to home with only minimal symptoms of dyspnea on exertion. Upon further investigations, she was found to have multiple small lesions of angiomyolipoma on the right kidney with diffuse retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

EMT was called by a family member after the patient was found to be less responsive and difficult to arouse. The patient received 4 mg of naloxone subcutaneously in field by the EMT which improved patient's responsiveness but pushed her into severe opiate withdrawal. In the emergency department, the patient was found to be awake, alert, and anxious. She was not oriented but was able to follow simple commands. The patient was also diaphoretic, tachypneic with respiratory rate in 30 and tachycardic with heart rate in 150 s. Lungs were clear on auscultation with good bilateral air entry. Cardiovascualr exam was unremarkable with regular rhythm good pulses present in all four extremities. Abdominal exam was also unremarkable. Neuromuscular exam showed tremulousness and muscle fasciculation in different muscle groups of the face, upper limb, and lower extremities, exacerbated deep tendon reflex and normal motor strength with severe pain on movement of left hip. The patient had a past medical history of AIDS, hepatitis C, and bipolar disorder but as per her home medication list she was not on any treatment for them. At home, the patient was on 150 mg of methadone for maintenance and oral morphine sustained release and immediate release for pain control for her recent hip fracture.

    "original_text": "We present a case of a 28-year-old G1P0 female at 39 weeks coming for a primary cesarean delivery due to breech presentation. The past medical history was significant for extensive substance use disorder. On initial pre-operative consultation, it was discovered that the patient had oscillated between extensive drug use and rehabilitation cycles for a dozen years, experimenting with multiple illicit substances, causing her family and husband a lot of anger and strife. She underwent extensive rehabilitation and behavioral therapy through the years and was able to stabilize on maintenance dose buprenorphone + naloxone combination lozenge (Suboxone\u00ae) 8 mg/2 mg daily. She had been on this stable dose for 2 years prior to discovering that she was pregnant and was seen in consultation 4 weeks prior to her scheduled cesarean delivery.\nThe patient\u2019s major concern was fear of receiving opioids and relapsing back into the addiction spiral. To appropriately plan, a large multidisciplinary team comprised of her addiction specialist, the in-house pain management physician, obstetrical anesthesiologist, the patient\u2019s obstetrician, and labor and delivery charge nurses was assembled. An exhaustive discussion was held that covered all narcotic, non-narcotic, regional and alternative options for the perioperative period. All options, possibilities and acceptable expectations were discussed at length. The patient\u2019s family was a major support structure and with her permission, they too were involved in the final planning. After two pre-operative visits, a plan was agreed upon and the cesarean delivery was scheduled.\nThe patient was the first case of the day and she took her daily Suboxone\u00ae maintenance dose.

Physical examination revealed no abnormal findings associated with the abdomen except a surgical scar on the right side of his chest. Evaluation of laboratory data on admission revealed that his hemoglobin level was 7.0 g/dL and hematocrit value was 23.1%.

She had one prior antenatal visit but no ultrasound was done. Her history was also remarkable for pregnancy on IUD contraception. She was seen at a health center with a history of sudden onset severe abdominal pain followed by general body weakness and was referred to a district hospital where ultrasound showed miscarriage of an intrauterine twin pregnancy at 18 weeks of gestation and an additional intra-abdominal fetus dead as well. They suspected uterine rupture and transferred the patient to RMH after initiating IV fluids and transfusion. Travel time was approximately 3 hours, and she reached RMH 12 hours after the onset of symptoms in hypovolemic shock with tachypnea and tachycardia of 144 bpm. She was pale with a distended abdomen and rebound tenderness. Point of care ultrasound showed an intrauterine twin pregnancy with no cardiac activity for both fetuses. A third fetus was seen outside the uterus without cardiac activity and there was free fluid in the abdomen. Results of the full blood count (FBC) at admission came with Hb of 11.6 g/dL, WBC of 28.31 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL, and Plt of 280 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL. The patient was immediately taken to the operating room for explorative laparotomy, and consent for possible hysterectomy was signed. Intraoperatively, approximately 4 L of blood and clots was aspirated. A right side interstitial ruptured pregnancy with a dead male fetus in the abdomen with its placenta still attached to the ruptured site was found ().

The patient had no history of abdominal surgery. On arrival, his vital signs were normal. Abdominal findings revealed distension and tenderness in the entire abdomen without any muscular defense signs. Laboratory examinations showed a white blood cell count of 7420/mm3, a C-reactive protein level of 0.3 mg/dL, and all other measured values within their normal limits.\nAn abdominal X-ray examination showed a dilatation and an air-fluid level of the small bowel. Abdominal computed tomography revealed an extensively dilated small bowel and a closed loop of small bowel in the mesosigmoid (). There was no blood flow obstruction at the closed loop of the small bowel. The patient was diagnosed with an intestinal obstruction due to an incarcerated internal hernia involving the mesosigmoid. An ileus tube was inserted to decompress the small bowel prior to an elective single-incision laparoscopic surgery that was performed six days after admission.\nThe operation was performed using a 2.0 cm transumbilical vertical incision. The fascia and peritoneum were then vertically opened, and three 5 mm trocars were inserted into the abdomen to introduce endoscopic instruments. Carbon dioxide was used to inflate the abdomen at 8 mmHg pressure. The operator used two 5 mm forceps, and the first assistant handled a 30 degree 5 mm laparoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). During the surgery, it was observed that the ileum had herniated into the intersigmoid fossa. Furthermore, there were mild adhesions of the herniated ileum at the hernial orifice ().

Nasopharyngeal endoscopy and biopsy already had been performed in another hospital, showing nonkeratinizing undifferentiated NPC. This histopathologic diagnosis was confirmed in our center. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the nasopharynx and neck revealed the tumor was confined to the nasopharynx and the bilateral locoregional cervical lymph nodes enlarged with its greatest dimension of 2 cm. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound of abdomen, and whole-body bone scan ruled out distant metastases. So clinical staging was determined to be T1N2M0, IIIA according to American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM Staging System for NPC (7th ed, 2010).\nThe patient was treated with definitive IMRT to 7050 cGy for primary tumor and 6600 cGy for infiltrated regional lymph nodes.

A preoperative coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries without evidence of ostial obstruction. SAVR was successfully performed using a 23 mm diameter Magna bioprosthetic valve. During the surgery, antegrade cardioplegia was first administered to achieve electromechanical arrest. From this point, a dose of cold blood retrograde cardioplegia was administered to the coronary sinus every 15 minutes. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and had returned to her usual lifestyle. A postoperative echocardiogram demonstrated a normal ejection fraction and a normally functioning bioprosthetic aortic valve with a mean gradient of 8\u201310 mmHg across the valve. The patient had been compliant with medications, including aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker. In June 2017, the patient presented with pressure-like exertional chest pain. An electrocardiogram demonstrated 1 mm ST segment depression in leads I, aVL, V2, and V3 (). Laboratory investigations revealed elevation of the serum troponin I level to 2.3 ng/ml (normal value: less than 0.032 ng/ml). Guideline-directed medical therapy for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) was begun, and the patient was assigned to an invasive strategy. Diagnostic coronary angiography demonstrated isolated severe ostial stenosis (99%) of the right coronary artery with significant catheter pressure waveform dampening but no evidence of thrombus (). It showed dramatically tapered appearance from what appeared to be normal arterial segment to a critical ostial stenosis. The lesion was less likely a catheter-induced spasm because (1) there was no direct catheter engagement or deep intubation of the vessel and (2) it persisted despite bolus administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin as well as continuous intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin prior to and during the procedure. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) could not be considered due to severity of the stenosis. The lesion was successfully treated using balloon",

She had gone to her primary care physician, who performed a chest X-ray and urged her to come to the hospital. Upon presentation at the emergency department, her oxygen saturation was above 95% on room air, and she was not in any respiratory distress, but her exam was significant for decreased breath sound on the right. A chest X-ray confirmed a large right-sided pneumothorax with small pleural effusion. A chest tube was inserted on the right side for the resolution of the pneumothorax, and subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed bilateral diffuse bullous disease of the lung with multiple cysts (Figure -). The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for right thoracoscopic wedge resection of a lung bleb and talc pleurodesis. Gross examination of the specimen revealed several dilated air-like spaces ranging from 0.2 cm to 0.4 cm in size. The hospital course was complicated by postsurgical pneumonia, but she recovered fully and was discharged to home with only minimal symptoms of dyspnea on exertion. Upon further investigations, she was found to have multiple small lesions of angiomyolipoma on the right kidney with diffuse retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. One of the lymph nodes was biopsied, and pathology revealed predominantly spindle cells positive for HHF35 and smooth muscle actin, consistent with the diagnosis of leiomyoma. At the eight-month follow-up at the pulmonology clinic, her pulmonary function test (PFT) showed normal vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), but moderately reduced diffusion capacity, which may also be related to LAM. At her 12-month and 24-month follow-up visits, her PFT results showed improvements in peak flow and diffusion capacity, and the patient continues to report no symptoms other than minimal dyspnea on exertion.",

Computed tomography revealed a displacement of the interbody cage into the left subarticular zone of the spinal canal. There was also subsidence around the interbody cage at the 4th and 5th vertebral bodies, and periscrew loosening (identified by a halo effect) was observed in all transpedicular screws. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a severe spinal canal stenosis on L4\u20135 with compression of the left L5 nerve root by the migrated interbody cage ().\nFirst, the rods connected to the loosened pedicle screws on L4 and L5 were removed in posterior revision to create a sufficient interbody space by retraction with the lateral approach.\nOnce the lateral disc space was reached via the lateral approach, we followed a procedure for detaching the interbody cage from the L4 and L5 endplates using a Cobb retractor and osteotome. We made a gap between the interbody cage and endplates of the 4th and 5th vertebral bodies to make them movable and loose. After the interbody cage was completely loosened with additional curettages for surrounding scar tissues, we attempted to remove the interbody cage with a hook or pituitary force.\nHowever, the presence of subsidence entrapped the interbody cage into the body, and the interbody cage was difficult to remove from the intervertebral space.

He was diagnosed as having hepatobiliary adenocarcinoma with retroperitoneal metastasis. He had received multiple anti-tumor treatments during the past 3 years, and had had a pain in the right side of the abdomen for 8 months. Imaging revealed enhanced soft tissue thickening around the right paraspinal site at T11\u201312 (Fig. A). Thus, the patient underwent paravalvular palliative radiotherapy at a dose of 25 Gy. However, the analgesic effect of radiotherapy was negative. He complained about a persistent dull, burning pain and soreness accompanied by paresthesia in the T11\u201312 dermatome, with an average VAS score of 6 points (8 points at its worst, 3 points at its least), and an average DN4 of 6 points. The patient received oxycodone (120 mg/day) and pregabalin (300 mg/day), but his pain scores were not reduced as a result of the treatment. In addition, his sleep quality was severely affected and he could not even lie on his right side. According to the diagnostic criteria of the expert consensus, we diagnosed the patient as having refractory cancer pain. Then, this case was introduced through our multidisciplinary channel, and further analgesic strategy for this patient was developed by multidisciplinary decision making and a comprehensive informed consent. We decided that the neuraxial neurolysis could be one of the best next analgesic approaches for him because the metastasis was indenting the thecal sac at the T12 level, which is a potential contraindication for intrathecal pumps. In addition, further palliative radio- and chemotherapy or surgery were infeasible according to the experts\u2019 decisions.
