A piece of bone from the femur was lost at the site of injury. He did not have any other injury except fracture of the femur. At the primary center, he received wound lavage and splinting of the limb along with systemic antibiotics. Due to lack of facility at the primary center, the patient was referred to the secondary center. After five days of index injury, the surgeon in the secondary hospital performed surgical debridement of the wound and applied external fixator. Culture reports and antibiotic profile of the index surgery are not available due to lack of documentation. The wound healed satisfactorily, and stitches were removed in two weeks. After 15 days of the first surgery (20 days from injury), the operating surgeon removed the external fixator and did intramedullary nailing of the femur without bone grafting (Figure ). The incision wound healed with routine removal of skin stitches. After three months of intramedullary nailing of the femur (nearly four from injury), a blister developed in the lower thigh, which later burst with purulent discharge. The same surgeon after culture and sensitivity of pus administered systemic antibiotics and the discharged decreased after 20 days of antibiotics. After 15 days (five months from injury), the patient presented to another surgeon with similar discharge and was administered empirical systemic antibiotics for a period of 30 days. The patient had marginal improvement with occasional fever and knee pain. Following intramedullary nailing, no further wound washout or debridement was performed by earlier surgeons.

The patient noted a recent history of a twisting injury of his right ankle 6-months before presentation at our specialty orthopedic clinic. The injury occurred while playing football. Initially, he was treated by his general practitioner, who assumed it to be a severe sprain injury and had placed him on a course of ice compress and anti-inflammatory medication followed by a below knee plaster cast for a period of 3 weeks. Following this treatment protocol, the patient was able to walk but reported on-going pain while walking once the plaster cast was removed.

The primary lesion was excised followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Initial follow-up was for 10 years before discharge. In 2008 she represented with a lump at the left angle of mandible. A fine needle aspiration was suggestive of either benign pleomorphic salivary adenoma or recurrent ACC.

Unfortunately, previous surgery and radiotherapy meant that only the superficial gland could be removed safely. Histological examination confirmed recurrence of salivary gland ACC.\nA routine follow-up CT in February 2013 demonstrated a focal liver lesion that was suspicious of metastasis. No other metastases were found on further CT scans of the brain, head, neck, and chest. An MRI of the liver confirmed the presence of a solitary lesion (see ). A biopsy of the lesion confirmed the histological appearance of a metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma that was of identical morphology to the parotid tumour excised in 2010.

The patient delivered a viable female infant weighing 3757 grams with APGARs of 8 and 9 at 1 minute and 5 minutes, respectively. Following spontaneous delivery of the placenta, the fundus was noted to be slightly prolapsed through the internal os. A fourth degree laceration occurred at the time of delivery due to the emergent maneuvers utilized to replace the uterus. Brisk vaginal bleeding was noted and 500 cc of blood clot was removed the uterus. Given the patient's inability to tolerate the exam, 1000 mcg of cytotec was placed rectally and the patient was moved to the operating room where general anesthesia was administered. Manual exploration of the uterus was again performed and an additional 1000 cc of blood clot was removed and an anterior fibroid with partial prolapse of the uterus was noted. The fundus was manually replaced superiorly and attention was then turned to the 4th degree laceration which was repaired in standard fashion without complication. Following the 4th degree repair, the uterus was noted to be atonic again and uterine massage and manipulation elicited an additional 500 cc of blood clot. The patient was given two doses of hemabate 250 mcg and the uterus was noted to be firm and hemostasis was confirmed. Total blood loss at the time of delivery was estimated to be 4.5 liters and the patient received 8 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma. The postpartum course was uncomplicated and she was discharged home on postpartum day three.\nAt seven weeks postpartum the patient presented to the local health department with complaints of persistent vaginal bleeding since delivery.

The LAD was successfully opened and a Vision 3.5 \u00d7 15 mm bare metal stent was deployed, the procedure was covered with heparin and abciximab and an intra-aortic balloon pump. There was moderate circumflex and right coronary artery disease which was not intervened upon. Cardiac enzymes were elevated with peak CK of >4000 iu/L and troponin I of 98 \u03bcg/L. A transthoracic echocardiogram the following day showed a mildly dilated left ventricle (LV) with mild hypertrophy. The anterolateral wall was akinetic with moderate to severely impaired LV function.

On physical examination, mild abdominal tenderness at lower quadrants was noted. Routine blood counts and biochemical analyses indicated the presence of an inflammatory condition (WBC: 13200/mm3 and CRP: 35). Urine analysis showed fecal content and increased number of bacteria accompanied with elevated WBC count in the urine sample, which suggested a possible enterovesical fistula. USG examination revealed mildly increased bladder wall thickness and accumulating sediments at the base of bladder. Appendix could not be visualized, but intraperitoneal fat planes around caecum showed increased echogenicity which suggested an inflammatory process. Ultrasound also revealed heterogeneous fluid collection which located lateral to the anterior aspect of the urinary bladder. Prostate and distal portions of the ureters were normal. We obtained an oral contrast CT scan to elucidate the underlying reason. CT examination demonstrated collection of fluid extending from the right anterolateral border of the bladder to the caecum. Outer diameter of the appendix exceeded normal limits (measured approximately 9 mm) and appendix was attached to the right anterolateral part of the bladder. Additionally, hyperdense fecalith image was seen in the distal portion of appendix; also there were 2 cm calculi in bladder (). But our CT scan was not optimal for detection of possible fistula because bladder was not fully filled during CT scan.

Two weeks prior to this admission she was seen at Frenchay Hospital with cauda equina symptoms. She has had an MRI of the spine, which showed a disc prolapse but did not explain the symptoms. The patient was discharged. However, her pain continued to worsen, and sensation changes progressed across the whole of the perianal region. She was unable to sit down for 8 weeks due to pain on flexion and started using a stick as her right leg was weak.\nOn examination she had a decreased sensation in the perianal area. Neurological examination of the upper limbs revealed a slight numbness of the radial side of the forearm. Neurological examination of the lower limbs revealed the following: reduced power in the right hip flexion (1/5) and extension (2/5), the power in the left leg was 4/5, absent reflexes in both legs, reduced sensation in the right medial aspect of the distal right calf dorsum of the foot sole and the lateral dorsum of the left foot and the sole of the left foot. On examination of her visual fields, she demonstrated a loss of outer vision in her left eye.\nCT and MRI of the head showed metastases in the right parietal occipital region, together with some smaller metastases associated with the dura and skull base (fig ). MRI of the spine revealed fairly diffuse infiltrating nodules in the nerve roots of the lumbosacral plexus.

    "original_text": "A 58-year-old woman operated with proctocolectomy and an ileal J-pouch 11 years earlier due to ulcerative colitis complicated by colonic cancer presented at a local hospital because of abdominal pain and failure of faecal evacuation. There was a previous history of similar but short and self-resolving episodes of obstruction without clear explanation. A CT-scan aroused suspicion of twisting of the pouch along its longitudinal axis causing an obstruction at the ileoanal anastomosis. An intestinal tube was passed into the pouch for decompression which resulted in relief of symptoms lasting also the day after removal of the tube. She was therefore discharged and referred to our hospital for follow-up with pouchoscopy. However, on the same day as she had been discharged, she presented as an emergency case at our hospital with identical symptoms of obstruction and was admitted to a surgical ward after the application of a tube into the pouch for deflating. Repeated CT-scans at presentation and after application of the tube showed again volvulus of the pouch, which resolved after tube insertion as did the symptoms (). Endoscopy of the pouch including 50 cm of the afferent loop was easily done with no signs of ischemia or obvious twisting. The following day a laparotomy was done in order to fixate the pouch to prevent further episodes of twisting. The pouch was found to be enlarged but in its regular position without twisting and not surprisingly there were no adhesions, either in the pelvis or in the abdomen, which made the pouch completely mobile. A loop of the distal ileum was also found to be twisted behind the mesentery of the afferent loop of the pouch as a remaining part of the volvulus ().

In view of these findings, warfarin therapy was discontinued and as part of the workup a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed and revealed a 4 \u00d7 6 mm mass on the aortic valve and a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with bidirectional shunting (right to left after the intravenous injection of agitated saline), mild bi-atrial enlargement, mildly dilated but normally functioning right ventricle, normal left ventricular systolic function and no significant valvular regurgitation.

    "original_text": "A 68-year-old non-smoking Chinese woman with SIT was referred to our hospital because of an abnormal shadow on chest radiography for 4 days. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed an irregularly shaped nodule (measuring 38 \u00d7 27 mm in diameter) in the pleural area of the left lower lobe and SIT () and a 5-mm nodule in the dorsal segment of the lower lobe of the left lung (). Bronchoscopy confirmed that the left and right bronchial branches were mirror images of each other. Because we were unable to obtain a definitive diagnosis by the bronchoscopic approach, we performed CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy and surgery was planned for diagnosis and treatment. Intraoperatively, we established that the location of the superior vena cava and azygos vein mirrored the normal distribution, and that the aortic arch was absent from the left thoracic cavity. The left lung was well lobulated into three lobes and the anatomy of the left side of the pulmonary artery had features typical of the normal right side.\nOn 9 January 2018, the patient underwent thoracoscopic wedge resection of the left lower lobe of the lung plus lymphadenectomy.

Two weeks prior to her presentation, she reported fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and pain on the right side of the abdomen. She had presented to the ED one week prior due to abdominal pain with a mild elevation in her liver enzymes. No acute pathology was discovered, and she was told to follow-up with her primary care physician (PCP). She then presented to an urgent care facility in which she was prescribed ciprofloxacin with eventual improvement in her diarrhea and vomiting. Three days prior to arrival, she began to note numbness and weakness of her fingers and toes. Her weakness was most noticeable in the distal aspects of her extremities, and she experienced some difficulty ambulating and a prominent decrease in her grip strength. This prompted her to schedule an appointment with her PCP. She followed up with her PCP, who was concerned for demyelinating disease. The PCP urged her to present to the ED for further evaluation. Despite not having any respiratory symptoms or fever, her PCP tested her for COVID-19 and influenza given her abdominal pain and diarrhea. Both tests returned negative.\nFurther history revealed the patient had reported a prior presentation to the ED roughly 10 months earlier for right upper quadrant abdominal pain. She was told she had elevated liver enzymes at that visit and was told to follow-up with her PCP. Her PCP had tested her for hepatitis C, which was negative, and she eventually had resolution of her clinical symptoms. She denied any recent travel, fevers, or shortness of breath. She had mostly been indoors for the past two months, without reported sick contacts.\nPhysical examination upon presentation to the ED was notable for 4/5 strength in the bilateral upper extremities with flexion and extension of the elbow and wrist.

A second resection was performed in May 1999, and during the next 16 years, the patient underwent several surgical approaches that were consistently followed by disease recurrence. Some of the procedures were conservative surgeries, but others were radical procedures that left her with several deforming scars. She presented to our clinic in January 2015 with a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that evidenced a right, triangular aspect, paracellarlesion, extending to the homolateral cavernous sinus (13 \u00d7 9 mm), which was suspected to be a residual lesion that would have achieved the cavernous sinus by contiguity growth after several surgeries. Her last surgery had been performed in April 2014 and was followed by local radiotherapy in May 2014. She was asymptomatic and not willing to undergo a new invasive procedure. She decided to be followed without further intervention.\nFor the next 18 months, she was clinically stable and asymptomatic, but she returned in July 2016 with intense pain on the right side of her face that required multiple hospital visits for intravenous analgesia.

She then developed an excruciating headache accompanied by a complete loss of balance and involuntary jerking movements, which resulted in her mother bringing her to the hospital where she was admitted for one night. She was brought back to the hospital daily for several days as increasing and intensifying symptoms developed. The first doctor to assess her wrote, \u201cHysteria, possible conversion disorder\u201d in her notes. Following this impression, no relevant investigations were performed. Patient B was left deteriorating and untreated, by which time she was having constant seizures and needed a wheelchair. Her mother repeatedly told them that Lyme disease was highly suspected since the family lived in a region known to be epidemic for Lyme disease and other relatives had been diagnosed with the disease and begged them to help her daughter. These appeals were ignored. Her mother took Patient B to a private clinic where a consultant thoroughly examined her and diagnosed encephalitis and possible encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the brain/brainstem/spinal cord), probably due to Lyme disease. She was immediately put on intravenous antibiotics at the clinic for four days. In 36 hours, the seizures had stopped, and her headache slowly improved. Her blood tests came back positive for Lyme disease. The hospital admitted their error and gave an unreserved apology. On instructions from the consultant, Patient B had a further three months of daily intravenous antibiotic treatment at a National Health Service Hospital. After about two months, Patient B was able to walk again, but when the antibiotics were stopped, the seizures and other symptoms returned. The family raised funds to take Patient B to the United States for treatment by a physician who had experience with such cases.

His medical history consisted of CF and segmental intestinal resection due to small bowel obstruction in his first year of life. In 2009, he developed both exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency, necessitating pancreatic enzyme replacement and the use of insulin therapy. A continuing deterioration of his lung function resulted in the need of a bilateral lung transplantation in 2018 from which he recovered clinically well. Recently, he was analyzed because of jaundice. We saw a slightly icteric man with a body mass index of 21 kg/m2 and a serum bilirubin of 56 \u00b5mol/L. Abdominal ultrasound revealed dilated intrahepatic bile ducts and common bile duct. CT confirmed an ampullary tumour of 30 mm with extension into the duodenum (Fig. ). There were no regional lymph node or signs of distant metastases. A particular finding on the preoperative CT scan was the replacement of the entire pancreas with fat (Fig. ). The pancreatic duct could not be visualized. Biopsy of the ampullary tumour revealed an intestinal type adenocarcinoma and therefore our patient was scheduled for a pancreatoduodenectomy. The patient received a single dose of long acting somatuline (120 mg) preoperatively. During the operation, we noticed a lipomatosed pancreas and following transection of the pancreas we could not identify a pancreatic duct in the fatty pancreatic tissue. Taking into consideration that there was no possibility to anastomose the pancreatic duct to the jejunum in a patient using immunosuppressive medication in whom we could not permit pancreatic leakage, and pancreatic insufficiency, which was already known before the operation, we decided to perform a total pancreatectomy with sparing of the splenic vessels. The postoperative course was uneventful and on the 9th postoperative day, the patient was discharged in a clinically good condition, with stable glucose levels and no change in his need for insulin.

At the same time, he was associated with dizziness and fatigue. The patient was diagnosed as acute pancreatitis and was treated conservatively with good outcome 3 years previously. He was a chronic alcohol abuser, consuming about 200 mL of alcohol daily for the preceding 30 years. On physical examination, his heart rate was 90 BPM and blood pressure was 100/70 mm Hg. He appeared pale and there was no abdominal mass found on palpation. Blood routine examination showed decrease of the hemoglobin values down to 8.4 g/L, a clue of the presence of active bleeding. Intravenous fluid administration and whole blood transfusion of 400 mL were administered. During 12 h of hospital stay and bowel preparation for colonoscopy, the patient had experienced six episodes of hematochezia approximating 1,700 mL. Six units of packed red cell transfusion and intravenous fluids were given following these events. Emergent colonoscopy showed a lot of blood clot at the location of colonic splenic flexure 70 cm distal to anus and the colonoscopy was difficult to pass it, but there was no mass or ulcerative lesions detected. Subsequent emergent DSA of superior mesenteric artery and inferior mesenteric artery did not reveal any abnormalities (). Angiography of celiac trunk was neglected because of suspicious bleeding source from lower gastrointestinal tract. Then abdominal contrast-enhanced CT scan was required for searching the source of gastrointestinal bleeding. Axial CT images and its reconstructed images after contrast injection revealed pancreatic pseudocyst and splenic arterial pseudoaneurysm within it (), an uncommon complication of chronic pancreatitis.

Nine months prior, he visited a local hospital after a motorcycle traffic accident and was diagnosed with an open fracture of the left femur shaft and an intra-articular fracture of the proximal tibia. He underwent an operation using the Ilizarov external fixator at the femur and tibia. Two months after the first surgery, the Ilizarov fixator was removed and changed into a monoaxial external fixator for the left femur and converted to internal fixation with a screw for the left tibia. One month later, he underwent an operation for conversion to internal fixation with intramedullary nailing of the left femur. At that time, he underwent manipulation of the knee joint for ankylosis. On physical examination at the initial visit to our hospital, he had tenderness and dimpling in the superior aspect of the patella and markedly decreased mobility of the patella (including mediolateral and superoinferior translation). He had quadriceps atrophy (a 3-cm decrease in mid-thigh circumference as compared to the contralateral limb). His left knee ROM was between flexion contracture of 30\u00b0 and further flexion of 90\u00b0. On plain radiographs, nonunion of the left proximal tibial fracture and femur shaft fracture were shown.

    "original_text": "Our patient is a 48 year old woman with a screen-detected left breast cancer. She was found to have an abnormal bilateral screening mammogram which demonstrated a suspicious area of architectural distortion in the right breast and an obscured nodule in the left breast. This prompted further imaging with diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. This was especially concerning for a solid microlobulated nodule in the left breast measuring 7 mm in size at 3:00 and a persistent suspicious area of architectural distortion in the right breast with two adjacent simple cysts. Bilateral breast biopsy was performed. Ultrasound guided core biopsy of the suspicious right breast lesion was consistent with sclerosing adenosis with usual ductal hyperplasia. No atypia or malignancy was noted. Ultrasound guided core biopsy of the left breast lesion was consistent with grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma, ER 10%, PR 0%, Her2/neu negative (1+), Ki 67 1%. Bilateral breast MRI was performed which showed no suspicious lesions in the right breast and a 2\u20133 mm ovoid rapidly enhancing nodule with plateau kinetics reflecting a portion of the originally biopsied cancer. No other suspicious lesions were noted within the left breast, left axilla, or internal mammary chain. Her case was reviewed, and the multi-disciplinary decision was to proceed with breast conservative surgery first. She was taken for right partial mastectomy and left partial mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy. Final pathology of the right breast did not show any evidence of malignancy. Initial pathology of the left breast was initially concerning for a biologically unfavorable invasive ductal carcinoma, NOS type. However, further pathologic review revealed that the patient had a grade 2, 8 mm secretory carcinoma. The diagnosis of secretory carcinoma was suspected based on histologic findings which included a microcystic and tubular growth pattern with luminal secretions.

Her history began six months prior to her visit when she presented with recurrent urinary tract infections. A cystoscopy and TUR revealed a high grade infiltrating urothelial carcinoma in the lateral right wall of the bladder (T2a). Staging CT scans were performed and showed metastatic disease mediastinal and hiliar lymph nodes, multiple and bilateral lung nodules, and metastases located in the internal iliac lymph nodes. The patient was initially treated with six cycles of chemotherapy with gemcitabine 1200 mg/m2 on day 1 and 60 mg/m2 cisplatin on days 1 and 8 every 21 days, showing a partial response after three cycles. The disease was followed up until January 2009, when imaging studies demonstrated the presence of a single metastatic lesion in the left lower lung lobe. A second line of chemotherapy using carboplatin AUC = 3 on day 1 and 1500 mg/m2 gemcitabine on day 1 every 15 days was initiated, and after eight cycles, new progression of the described lung lesion was documented. A third line of chemotherapy was proposed, and in June 2009, the patient was started on cisplatin 60 mg/m2 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 day 1 every 28 days. She had a partial response after two cycles, and after four cycles of chemotherapy, a slight increase in the size of the left lower lung nodule was revealed on the CT scan, although a bone scan was negative.\nWith the diagnosis of a recurrence of a single lung metastatic nodule measuring 56 \u00d7 53 \u00d7 51 millimeters, in October 2009, a hypo-fractionated course of SBRT was delivered to the lung nodule.

He had an EGD at an outside facility 2 years earlier for evaluation of abdominal pain which showed a 1.2 cm duodenal polypoid lesion in the second portion of the duodenum. Pathology of the polyp revealed heterotopic gastric mucosa with benign lobules of gastric glands. He also was found to have chronically active H. pylori gastritis with numerous Helicobacter organisms and atrophic gastritis with patchy areas of intestinal metaplasia. At that time, he was instructed to follow up for a repeat endoscopy for surveillance in two years. As recommended, two years later he presented to our office for surveillance of his duodenal lesion. Due to his history of atrophic gastritis and a large duodenal lesion, we performed an upper endoscopy that showed atrophic gastritis, duodenitis, and a single 10 mm polyp in the second portion of the duodenum. The duodenal polyp was biopsied. Pathology revealed polypoid gastric metaplastic mucosa with focal epithelial atypia including nuclear enlargement, stratification, nucleoli, and few mitoses. The patient was referred for endoscopic ultrasound to further characterize the lesion and complete resection. Several weeks later he underwent an endoscopic ultrasound that revealed a 13-mm pedunculated and sessile polyp on the lateral wall opposite to the major papilla in the second portion of the duodenum (). The polyp was removed en bloc using a hot snare following a 4-mL saline lift. Two endoclips were placed for hemostasis. Pathology revealed a pyloric gland adenoma (Figures , , and ) with predominantly low grade dysplasia (Figures and ) and some small areas of focal high grade dysplasia. The slides were read by the in-house pathologist and were also reviewed by a GI expert pathologist at the University of Michigan.

She has a past medical history of aortic valve replacement secondary to aortic valve infective endocarditis, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.\nShe underwent two attempts of ultrasound-guided thrombin injection of the pseudoaneurysm. On ultrasound, the size of the pseudoaneurysm was found to be 5 cm \u00d7 3 cm \u00d7 4.6 cm. The neck of the pseudoaneurysm was measured to be 0.8 cm long. The two attempts involved using a 21 gauge needle to administer 1000 units and 2000 units of thrombin, respectively, into the pseudoaneurysm under ultrasound guidance and with the assistance of compression. Due to the size of the aneurysmal cavity and a relatively large pseudoaneurysm neck, injections were found to be unsuccessful on follow-up ultrasound (Figures and ). It was then decided to attempt endovascular closure of the neck of the pseudoaneurysm. All risks were discussed with the patient.\nAfter identification by the attending surgeon, the patient was transferred to the procedure room table in the catheterization lab. The patient received IV sedation, and local anesthesia was used prior to ultrasound-guided percutaneous access to the left common femoral artery. During the procedure, vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, were monitored by an ACLS certified nurse.\nAfter a 21 gauge needle was placed into the projection of the vessel lumen, a guidewire was placed into the left iliac artery. An angiographic catheter and guidewire were used to perform selective cannulation of the contralateral right common iliac artery.

The diaphragmatic hernia was suspected to be chronic given the lack of any significant trauma, symptoms, and the history of a suspected previous repair. Given the likely chronic nature of the hernia, the decision was made to perform the repair semielectively.\nOn hospital day 2, the patient was taken for a robotic-assisted, laparoscopic repair of his diaphragmatic hernia. An abdominal approach was chosen due to surgeon discretion, as the patient had both previous abdominal and thoracic surgeries and thus adhesions were likely to be encountered with either approach. At exploration, the hernia was found to be lateral and posterior, and a significant amount of scar tissue was dissected further confirming its chronic nature. The diaphragm was unable to be completely primarily repaired, and a Phasix\u2122 ST Mesh was used as an interposition graft with Prolene sutures to secure it to the diaphragm.\nInitially, the patient did well; however, on postoperative day 5, he had an episode of desaturation and a large amount of hemoptysis. A CT was done and showed significant intra-abdominal and mediastinal air with the suspicion of tracheobronchial injury.

He had undergone multiple investigations and was thought to have underlying Crohn's disease. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of his abdomen in January 2000 demonstrated a large abdominal mass. A laparoscopy was performed for tissue diagnosis of a possible lymphoma. However, at the time of laparoscopy, a large gelatinous mass was found and the diagnosis of PMP was confirmed by histopathology. Debulking surgery with small bowel resections was performed following this diagnosis at the Royal University Hospital of Saskatchewan. Since then he remained well and was reviewed regularly in the outpatient clinic. Four years later (2003), the patient began experiencing obstructive symptoms again due to recurrent disease and he had a further extensive debulking surgery in January 2004. This was followed a year later by another cytoreductive surgery with small bowel resection in 2005. He is currently doing well at a 3 months post-operative follow-up visit.\nThe specimens from 2000 consisted of a portion of small bowel with several gelatinous, \"mucinous\" masses attached to the peritoneal surface of the serosa of the bowel wall accompanied by the presence of lobulated polypoid gelatinous tissue (Figure ).

Over the subsequent four days, he developed increasing abdominal distension and pain, with hematemesis developing in the hours preceding his second presentation to hospital.\nOn examination the patient was hypovolaemic with persistent tachycardia. He had a tense, distended abdomen with a paucity of bowel sounds. An urgent oral and intravenous (IV) contrast computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen demonstrated significant duodenal hematoma with no evidence of acute extravasation of oral contrast. The hematoma was associated with a degree of gastric outlet obstruction with minimal contrast observed in the small bowel. To further investigate the level and degree of gastric outlet obstruction, an oral Gastrogaffin meal study was performed six hour later, which showed complete gastric outlet obstruction ().\nBased on the combination of clinical and radiological findings, the patient was managed conservatively with a nasogastric tube (free drainage and four hourly aspirations) and total parenteral nutrition. The patient initially displayed high daily nasogastric outputs (\u223c1500 ml), but this started decreasing gradually over the subsequent two-week period. A few days after admission, the patient developed sudden elevation of serum lipase levels raising the suspicion of delayed manifestation of pancreatic injury.

He had mild tenderness, an obvious bowel pattern and hyperactive bowel sounds; he was able to pass gas occasionally. Before admission, he suffered progressive abdominal distention and gradual deterioration, and he developed malnutrition for two months. A total alimentary tract angiography showed partial enlargement of the ascending colon and transverse colon and partial dilation of the distal small intestine (Fig. ). He was diagnosed with \u201cadult megacolon\u201d and recommended for surgical treatment. However, the operation was not performed because of a significant decrease in platelets (with a minimum of 19 \u00d7 109/L) and severe malnutrition. He had been in a car accident 2 years previously. He was the driver and was wearing a seat belt at the time of the accident. During that admission, he was always conscious and was found to have left clavicle fractures and multiple rib fractures. Abdominal examination showed seat belt marks and mild localized tenderness at the site of the abrasions. An abdominal CT scan showed a small amount of fluid (approximately 150 ml) in the abdominal cavity with no solid organ abnormalities. He was hemodynamically stable and was able to pass gas and defecate. He improved rapidly with conservative treatment, was discharged after several days and was asymptomatic. Two months after discharge, he started to have episodes of abdominal distension and intermittent mild tenderness, and he passed gas less frequently than before. However, he improved rapidly again after receiving treatment with traditional Chinese medicine.\nAfter admission, we first tried to improve the general condition of the patient by strengthening parenteral nutrition and correcting electrolyte imbalances.

Previously, in March 2009, the diagnosis of an ulcerated nodular solid malignant melanoma of the left cheek (thickness 30 mm, Clark level 5) with infiltration of the left parotid gland had been made. The neoplastic cells carried wild-type B-RAF alleles, but an oncogenic mutation in exon 2 of the N-RAS gene was found. The past medical history was unremarkable except for hypertension, for which antihypertensive combination therapy was given. In March 2009, the patient underwent surgical excision and neck dissection, during which a total of 16 lymph nodes were removed, which histologically did not show any signs of tumor invasion at that time. Subsequently, however, in October 2009, a soft tissue metastasis developed at the base of the resection area, which was treated with local irradiation over a course of 2 months. In December 2010, another subcutaneous metastasis was found above the left base of the mandible, which was surgically resected. Histopathological analysis showed clear resection margins.\nAdjuvant immunotherapy with 3 million units of interferon-\u03b1 thrice weekly was initiated in January 2011 but terminated in May 2011, when increasing serum concentrations of the tumor marker S100 indicated disease progression under therapy.

On ultrasound, the size of the pseudoaneurysm was found to be 5 cm \u00d7 3 cm \u00d7 4.6 cm. The neck of the pseudoaneurysm was measured to be 0.8 cm long. The two attempts involved using a 21 gauge needle to administer 1000 units and 2000 units of thrombin, respectively, into the pseudoaneurysm under ultrasound guidance and with the assistance of compression. Due to the size of the aneurysmal cavity and a relatively large pseudoaneurysm neck, injections were found to be unsuccessful on follow-up ultrasound (Figures and ). It was then decided to attempt endovascular closure of the neck of the pseudoaneurysm. All risks were discussed with the patient.\nAfter identification by the attending surgeon, the patient was transferred to the procedure room table in the catheterization lab. The patient received IV sedation, and local anesthesia was used prior to ultrasound-guided percutaneous access to the left common femoral artery. During the procedure, vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, were monitored by an ACLS certified nurse.\nAfter a 21 gauge needle was placed into the projection of the vessel lumen, a guidewire was placed into the left iliac artery. An angiographic catheter and guidewire were used to perform selective cannulation of the contralateral right common iliac artery. Then, a 6 French long access sheath was placed to perform an angiogram. The neck of the pseudoaneurysm was visualized (), and a 0.014 guidewire was placed into the proximal portion of the neck.\nA 21 gauge needle was used to cannulate the proximal portion of the neck percutaneously",

The patient was thereafter transferred to the ward for further treatment, but his parents chose to take him home. Three weeks later, the patient was admitted to the operating room for an emergency operation to evaluate and possibly evacuate the mass and also to assess and repair the carotid artery rupture and coarctation ( and ). Before the decision for surgery had been made, a Doppler examination of the carotid artery ruled out a pseudoaneurysm of the carotid artery under the hematoma. Volatile anesthetics, supplemented with ketamine, were planned for the patient; and under standard non-invasive monitoring, 3mg/Kg intramuscular ketamine plus 1.5% halothane was administered. With the patient breathing spontaneously under deeper levels of anesthesia, laryngoscopy showed that the glottis was not difficult for intubation. A peripheral intravenous line was established for muscle relaxants, and the trachea was intubated without any need for extra devices. Additionally, an arterial line in the right brachial artery was established to commence invasive arterial monitoring. The left subclavian approach was chosen for the insertion of the central venous line at the first attempt, which demonstrated the central venous pressure waveform.\nThe patient was operated on in the supine position with a roll below the neck to extend the neck gently and produce a \u201cthyroid position\u201d. The surgical approach was initially based on making the proximal and distal control of the right external carotid, but the hugeness of the cervical mass rendered it impossible.
