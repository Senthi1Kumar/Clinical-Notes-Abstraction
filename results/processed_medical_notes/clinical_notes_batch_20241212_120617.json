He had been diagnosed with chronic renal failure of an unknown cause ten years before and was recommended to undergo dialysis, which was not conducted because he refused the treatment. Nine years ago, an arteriovenous shunt was performed after emergency dialysis through catheterization of the internal jugular vein due to serious uremia accompanied by edema and fatigue. Neck pain and redness occurred on the area where the arteriovenous shunt was inserted and a cervical MRI showed an extradural abscess in the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae.

Thereafter, he started peritoneal dialysis but due to recurrent peritonitis, he began to receive hemodialysis six years ago. Five months before his visit to our hospital, he displayed symptoms of edema of the bilateral lower limbs together with skin thickening of the bilateral upper and lower extremities. Contractures of the shoulders, wrists, hip joints, and knee and ankle joints then gradually occurred.

Evaluation of the anus at that time revealed a prolapsing purple-black mass below the dentate line thought to be a thrombosed hemorrhoid. Local excision was recommended at that time however patient and daughter declined surgery because her pain had been improving and her bowel habits had been regular.

A physical examination revealed tenderness to palpation of the lower abdomen without signs of peritoneal irritation. There was no previous history of comorbid medical or surgical illness except for a recurrent feeling of abdominal discomfort that had persisted for several years. Laboratory data showed slight leukocytosis (WBC 112 \u00d7 102/\u03bcL) with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP 30.67 mg/dl).\nA computed tomography (CT) image revealed an irregular polycystic mass that was connected to the small intestine and measured 7.5 cm in diameter in the lower abdomen (). The preoperative diagnosis was either a massive Meckel's diverticulum or a small intestinal tumour. We planned to perform laparoscopic-assisted surgery. During the laparoscopy, the lesion was found to have caused torsion and congested. After dividing the inflammatory adhesions, the lesion was removed through the umbilical incision (). We confirmed that the lesion was located 130 cm from the ileocecal valve and 50 cm from the ligament of Treitz. Partial resection of the jejunum, which included the lesion, was performed. The specimen was a solid irregular mass that looked like an extraintestinal growth tumour with a narrow neck (Figures and ). Macroscopically, an irregular polycystic appearance was observed on the cut surface, and the mass was fluid-containing. One of the cysts showed fistulation with the submucosal layer of small intestine; however, communicating links with the lumen were not apparent (Figures and ).

The patient had no special medical history other than hepatitis B infection and had not experienced back pain before. Since he did not show other neurological symptoms besides back pain at the time he visited a private hospital, he received conservative treatment such as medication and physical therapy. Afterwards, the patient experienced weakness in lower extremity 7 days after the injury while performing his daily routine. At that time, he felt that his trunk was swaying slightly while he was walking. The gait disturbance symptoms gradually progressed and there was onset of additional symptoms such as impotence and lower extremity hypoesthesia. Consequently, he was admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery by the emergency room on the 30th day of the occurrence of injury. No external wound was observed at the time of the patient's hospitalization, and the pain was only in the back and lower extremity. According to the radiologist's reading of the whole spine MRI examination (), there had been findings of a wedge-shaped vertebral body but no findings of spinal cord damage was observed. From the initial blood test, the white blood cell count was 5,900/ul; the segmented neutrophil was 41.3%; the ESR and CRP was within the normal range; and the VDRL, HIV test, plasma lgG, anticardiolipin antibody (ACA), anti-phospholipid, antinuclear antibody (ANA), and blood bacterial culture test results were found to be negative. There were findings of five types of white blood cells, and no lgG in the CSF based on the cerebrospinal fluid test.

She denied any injury to the area or loss of range of motion (ROM), and her condition was not improved by analgesia. X-rays of the region demonstrated a fairly extensive ground glass lesion (Fig. ) in her left femoral neck, which is a classic sign of FD.

She was managed conservatively for 6 months; however, because the pain did not improve she was referred to Keio University Hospital for management. She opted for surgical treatment of the lesion for pain relief and to prevent future fractures and to return to her active lifestyle.

He described his initial symptoms as beginning 7 years ago, with altered sensorium that occurred while driving. He developed mild left-fingertip numbness 2 years later. An MRI of his brain was performed at that time to aid in diagnosing his neurological symptoms. This demonstrated periventricular white matter lesions, and he was diagnosed with MS. He was initially treated with interferon-beta; however, recently he has been experiencing injection fatigue and stated that he is considering a transition to oral medications. He also described left-sided ear pain and shoulder dysesthesia, which began 5 years ago. He had tried multiple medications for this neuropathic pain, including gabapentin, pregabalin, and carbamazepine, with little clinical relief. Based on the described location of the pain, he was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia and referred to our Neurosurgery service for consideration for surgical treatment.\nOn detailed questioning, our patient described episodic rapid-onset pain in his left shoulder that lasted 30 seconds and radiated to his ear and retroauricular region. These episodes did not have a trigger and had been progressively worsening. On a systematic review we noted that he described difficulty coordinating his left arm and leg over the past 5 years as well, corresponding to the duration of his pain. On examination he was alert and oriented, and recalled his history well. He showed no abnormal signs on a cranial nerve examination. Examination of his extremities demonstrated subtle left deltoid muscle wasting and weakness. His fine touch perception showed a left-sided patchy loss in his left C3\u20135 dermatomes. In his lower extremities he had a positive crossed-adductor response on his left leg, but no clonus was elicited and his reflexes were otherwise normal. An MRI of his brain and cervical spine demonstrated multiple demyelinated plaques in his corpus callosum, particularly prominent in his splenium, and a plaque on his left",

Two months preceding the onset of these lesions, he also had an ongoing history of pain in the right hip which worsened on exertion.\nTwo years back he had similar lesions, one over the dorsal aspect of right feet and two over the back that resolved with cribriform scarring.

He was, thereby, put on antituberculous therapy (ATT), DOTS Category 1 which he abruptly stopped after 2 months of intensive phase. His physical condition was uneventful, until the preceding 2 months of his presentation to us.\nExamination revealed two ulcers of sizes 10 \u00d7 8 cm and 3 \u00d7 2 cm, each with a purulent base and violaceous, undermined edges over the anterior and anterolateral aspect of left lower leg [Figures and ].

On examination, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 0, and the ABCD2 (A: age; B: blood pressure at presentation; C: clinical features; D: duration of symptoms) score was 0. The presence of diabetes (1 point) score was 3. There was carotid bruit bilaterally with higher intensity on the right and no focal neurological deficits. Stroke alert was called initially in the emergency department. A stat computed tomography (CT) brain revealed no acute intracranial abnormalities. The patient was not a candidate for alteplase, as the NIHSS is 0 and the symptoms had resolved, and aspirin 325 mg was given immediately. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain was done the same day and showed no acute ischemic or hemorrhagic infarct. We diagnosed the patient with a transient ischemic attack, and further workup was initiated to evaluate the underlying cause. The 12-lead electrocardiogram and cardiac monitoring showed no dysrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation. The transthoracic echocardiogram ruled out any intracardiac source of emboli. The carotid ultrasound revealed 50%-69% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery and no stenosis in the right carotid system.

Examination of the patient was unremarkable with the exception of bilateral lower limb weakness. Computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed a large lobulated heterogeneous hyperdense lesion in the left posterior fossa. The lesion exerted a mass effect compressing the 4th ventricle and brainstem structures, with supratentorial triventricular hydrocephalus () accompanied by permeative bone reaction in the left occipital bone ().\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed evidence of an infratentorial posterior fossa extra-axial mass that appeared to be dural. There was invasion of the marrow space of the left occipital bone (). In addition, heterogeneous signal intensity in T2-weighted images with multiple areas of central higher signal intensities representing necrosis was observed (). MRI with contrast enhancement showed the mass invading the inner skull table and intradiploic space ().\nDue to the primary malignancy, there was a significant mass effect over the left cerebellar hemisphere. The plane of cleavage between the tumor and the cerebellum was lost, indicating invasion. Furthermore, the tumor was noted to protrude through the foramen magnum, causing compression and displacement over the brainstem, especially over the upper medulla.

His brain MRI was normal and his EEG showed generalized spike waves, implying generalized epilepsy. Otherwise, he was healthy and had no family history of syncope or sudden death. As he had complained of cramping abdominal pain with diarrhea 2-3 times per week for one year before this event, he was scheduled for a colonoscopy under the suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease. Initially, his vital signs were stable and his heart rate was 72 beats/min. After a meperidine injection for pain control before the colonoscopy, he complained of chest discomfort and lost consciousness. Three-lead ECG monitoring revealed polymorphic VT and ventricular fibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed (). The patient was successfully defibrillated with 300 Joules of direct current energy. After pulseless ventricular arrhythmia, his ECG showed a prolonged QTc interval, over 500 msec, and serum electrolytes were within the normal range. His QTc interval remained prolonged at 597 msec and his rhythm remained sinus bradycardia at 54 bpm the day after the event (). His QTc intervals normalized slowly over the following 3 days. He was transferred to our hospital 5 days after the event, showing a normal QTc interval of 424 msec and a heart rate of 67 bpm. To establish the repolarization abnormality, an epinephrine challenge test was performed. The QTc interval became prolonged up to 567 msec from the baseline (398 msec) 30 seconds after the epinephrine bolus injection (0.1 \u00b5g/kg), followed by continuous infusion (0.1 \u00b5g/kg/min) (). The steady state QTc was 425 msec. Both the treadmill exercise test and 24-hour holter monitoring were normal, and there were no cardiac abnormalities seen on the echocardiogram.

CT, performed upon admission in a pediatric university hospital, showed wide a subarachnoid space with signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage (Fig. ). MRI performed 2 days after admission showed diffuse cerebral atrophy, abnormal white matter signal intensity and bilateral subdural hematomas. Fundoscopy showed no retinal hemorrhages. On skeletal survey fractures of the sixth and seventh rib were seen (Table ).\nThe boy remained in a permanent vegetative state and more than one year after the initial incident died. As child abuse was the cause of the initial incident, a judicial autopsy was performed.\nThe neuropathological examination showed a bilateral, at least several months old, neo-membrane of collagenized connective tissue with normal sized capillaries, iron deposits and small recent hemorrhages. The brain was atrophic weighing about half of normal (430 g\u2014normal weight approximately 925 g). Microscopy of the basal ganglia showed total loss of cortical and subcortical cerebral neurons, diffuse reactive gliosis, atrophy of the subcortex and subcortical small to medium-sized cavities mostly in the frontal and temporal lobes. There was a large cavum septum pellucidum and significant enlargement of the lateral and the third ventricle.

Laboratory examination showed no elevation of either carcinoembryonic antigen or cancer antigen 19-9. Colonoscopy showed a 20-mm SMT in the anal canal (Fig. ). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a 20-mm cystic tumor on the right site of the lower rectum with no evidence of lymph node or distant metastases (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also showed a 20-mm cystic tumor on the right site of the lower rectum (Fig. ). These findings strongly suggested a benign cyst in the anal canal; therefore, the patient underwent trans-sacral resection for precise diagnosis of the tumor. The pathological diagnosis of the resected tumor was a mucinous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia (Fig. ) with negative surgical margins. The patient was observed in ambulatory practice. Follow-up CT and MRI 14 months after surgery showed a new cystic lesion near the site of the removed tumor (Fig. ). To evaluate whether the new cystic tumor was a recurrence, the patient underwent trans-sacral resection of the cystic tumor again. Pathological examination of the second resected tumor revealed that the tumor was a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the lower rectum (Fig. ) with a possible remnant tumor at the local site. After providing sufficient informed consent, the patient underwent anal sphincter-preserving intersphincteric resection (ISR) with partial resection of the external sphincter along with prophylactic lymph node dissection. Pathological examination showed that the tumor cells were located at the anal gland under the mucosa of the anal canal and that these cells produced mucin and fibrosis (Fig. ).

Follow-up endoscopy performed on hospital day 12 showed a healing ulcer in the prepyloric region (Fig. ) and a distinct opening to the duodenum at the edge of the healing ulcer that was different from the original pylorus. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed circumferential thickening of the muscularis propria layer of the pylorus with a maximum thickness of over 10 mm (Fig. , arrowheads). Pathological examination of multiple biopsy specimens taken from the ulcer and surrounding mucosa showed no evidence of malignancy.

Her last visit was 3 years before this referral, and she had been lost to a regular follow-up. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the right eye was hand motion and IOP was 42 mm Hg. A diagnosis of neovascular glaucoma of the right eye was based on extensive peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) and neovascularization of iris (NVI). Intravitreal anti-VEGF injection and maximal tolerated medical therapy (MTMT) were ineffective, and thus, AGV implantation was performed. IOP on the first postoperative day was 33 mm Hg and visual acuity was light perception. In addition, severe blood clot formation was observed on the peritubal area of the AGV (Fig. A). Since clots blocked the tube lumen, they were removed by tube irrigation with BSS. However, intractable hyphema was observed in anterior chamber and some peritubal blood clots were not completely removed because they were firmly attached to the outer surface of the tube. Due to the risk of recurrent tube obstruction, we injected air into the anterior chamber with about 50% air fill assuming that the air in front of the tube opening would prevent blood clots formation in the tube opening. The patient was instructed to adopt a head up position. The day after the procedure, intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg and remnant air was observed in the superior part of anterior chamber. Although a blood clot was observed in the peritubal area, the tube opening remained patent (Fig. B).

The diverticulum was punctured, and a drainage catheter was inserted for 3 days.\nThree months later, transvaginal ultrasonography showed that the size of the diverticulum had not reduced. Subsequently, she was transferred to our department for further examination and treatment. In order to assess the diverticulum, MRI was performed, which revealed a periurethral tumor ().

The pain started three years earlier, at which point the patient sought help from a local orthopaedic surgeon. At this initial presentation it was thought that his pain was attributable to his physically demanding job. A CT-scan and MRI-scan were performed and revealed a bone cyst with sclerotic borders without destruction of the cortical bone (Figs. , ). Signs of malignancy were not present. Accordingly, the patient was treated with physical therapy, chiropractic treatment, and pain control.\nOver time his pain increased to the point of requiring opioids for pain control and presenting to our hospital. In the interim, he changed his job and decreased his physical activity, neither of which alleviated his pain.\nOn physical examination the patient had tenderness to palpation and vibration over his right sacroiliac joint. Peripheral motor and sensory functions were intact, no pathologic reflexes were present. The patient was in a good general state of health. A CT-scan was repeated and showed a slightly enlarged bone cyst compared to the previous CT-scan three years ago. However, no cortical breakthrough was present (Fig. ).\nFor further diagnostic workup an open biopsy of the lesion was performed one week later. The histological examination of the tissue demonstrated the formation of abundant collagen fibers and spindle shaped cells with medium to low cell density. The nuclei were without pleomorphism and mitotic activity. In immuno-staining the nuclei of the tumor cells were positively labeled for the adhesion protein \u03b2-catenin. In addition there was a partially positive staining recognized for S-100.

The aggravating swelling and pain of the left calf impelled her to seek medical advice. After admission to our hospital, the patient developed septic shock symptoms characterized with diminished consciousness, pale skin, hypothermia, lack of urine output, and undetectable blood pressure. Laboratory studies revealed a white blood count of 13.8 \u00d7 109 cells/L, neutrophil count of 12.24 \u00d7 109 cells/L, and 88.7% polymorphonuclear neutrophils. She was admitted to the intensive care unit, receiving intravenous fluids and broad spectrum antibiotics treatments. Besides, she denied any history of diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, liver diseases, or trauma.\nIn the intensive care unit, the swelling increased and extended proximally to left knee and foot, complicated with blisters (Fig. A). Additionally, the patient developed cutaneous necrosis in the left ankle and popliteal space. Clinical examination showed her entire left calf was tensely swollen both medially and laterally, and the most obvious pain was localized to the bit area of the left calf. She had a loss of superficial touch sensation and 2-point discrimination over the entire sole of the left calf. She was unable to move her left leg actively, and any passive movements of the left calf, knee, and ankle joints caused severe pain. Palpation of the whole left leg revealed a mildly increased skin temperature and exquisite pain compared with her contralateral leg. The main differential diagnose was from deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Subsequent venous Doppler ultrasonography found no evidence of DVT, and only subcutaneous edema at the lower leg.

The patient reported having a left-sided hemangioma removed at the age of 3 years but persisted with a port wine stain on her left flank since that time. Approximately 3 years prior to presentation, the patient had her first pregnancy and reported that during her third trimester, she noticed a mass developing on her left flank. During this time, the mass slowly grew to approximately its size at the patient's presentation at our institution. Following delivery of her first child, the patient reported medical evaluation had demonstrated the mass to appear to be a recurrence of her hemangioendothelioma. Following her second pregnancy, the size of her tumor did not significantly change, nor did it affect her pregnancy. It was at this time when she presented to us for evaluation for possible surgical resection after undergoing biopsy showing a Dabska tumor. The patient then presented to the Plastic Surgery Division at Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School for evaluation of reconstruction in conjunction with her planned tumor resection.\nDuring radical resection, the tumor was dissected down to the abdominal wall fascia, as the tumor did not appear to violate the fascial space. Specimens were submitted intraoperatively to pathology for frozen section, with final diagnosis ultimately showing a 30 \u00d7 22 \u00d7 4 cm3 Dabska tumor. After tumor extirpation, the patient had a defect extending from the umbilicus to the mid-posterior back from the tenth rib to below the hip ().

He was normally fit and well with no significant past medical history and not on any regular medication. There was no history of trauma. General examination was normal but examination of the right elbow revealed exquisite tenderness over the lateral epicondyle. A diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis was made and he was treated with a corticosteroid injection. However, this only provided symptomatic relief for two weeks. Before a second corticosteroid injection was administered, on this occasion with slightly longer pain relief, plain radiographs of the right elbow were requested. In addition, various blood tests including full blood count (FBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and blood cultures were arranged. The radiograph showed a small joint effusion. The CRP and ESR were both elevated at 80 mg/L and 40 mm/hr, respectively, FBC was normal and blood cultures negative at 48 h. Aspiration of the joint effusion was unsuccessful.\nThree months after initial presentation, the patient was seen in the orthopaedic outpatient clinic as his right elbow pain had returned, together with a marked reduction in range of movement of the joint. On examination, he was still tender over the right lateral epicondyle, but there was also clinical evidence of synovial thickening on the lateral aspect of the right elbow together with a significant fixed flexion deformity of 30\u00b0. An MRI scan of the right elbow revealed a large joint effusion with marked marrow oedema and loss of cortex of the lateral epicondyle, highly suspicious of osteomyelitis (Figure ).

A faint scar was also observed 20 mm along the white roll of the central upper lip.\nThe patient was born normally at term, denied any history of trauma, and did not disclose any maternal alcohol use. In an attempt to correct the flat philtrum, triamcinolone had been injected in the midline of her upper lip three separate times 10 years earlier. Furthermore, the patient also underwent an operation 5 years earlier to achieve a definite philtrum. However, we were not able to determine the exact surgical procedure used based on observation.\nBased on a previously published anthropometric analysis of the mouths of Koreans, a philtral reconstruction was designed so that the postoperative philtral width would be 12 mm at the peaks of the Cupid's bow and 10 mm at the columellar base []. Under local anesthesia, a 26 gauge needle dipped in gentian violet was used to puncture the area along the designated line, thus marking the orbicularis oris muscle at the area where a philtral column would be created. A linear incision was made. The subcutaneous dissection was done to the columellar base, so that this skin flap could be elevated. After dissection, a vertical incision was made on a superficial layer of the orbicularis oris muscle of the central upper lip, and an orbicularis oris muscle flap about 2 mm thick was elevated to the area marked with gentian violet. Both sides of the elevated muscle flap were then folded to the lateral side. The incisional margin of the muscle flap was sutured using a horizontal mattress stitch onto the lateral portion of the orbicularis oris using an absorbable suture. In the area of the folded orbicularis oris muscle, the upper",

    "original_text": "A 2-month-old girl child with a history of eczema initially presented for reflux, colic, feeding difficulties, and failure to thrive. The patient's maternal family history was significant for Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, but her mother was healthy. The patient's father and his family did not have a history of autoimmune disease. The physical exam upon presentation was normal, except for well-controlled eczema. She had several formula changes due to feeding difficulties and was subsequently diagnosed with reflux and cow milk protein enterocolitis. She had a normal upper gastrointestinal tract radiography and oral pharyngeal motility swallow study, and she was followed by feeding therapy. She was treated with a proton pump inhibitor and was started on high-calorie hydrolyzed formula to support with weight gain until 1 year of age. At 1 year of age, dairy was added to the diet. Diarrhea started at 14 months of age. By 16 months of age, diarrhea progressed to include blood. Stool study results included negative stool culture, positive fecal occult blood, and significantly elevated calprotectin (shown in Table ). An upper and lower endoscopy at the age of 16 months showed mild chronic active gastritis, and chronic active colitis with eosinophils, cryptitis, crypt abscess formation, without granulomas (shown in Table ; Fig. ). The histology showed nonspecific morphologic features that may be seen in various conditions such as allergic colitis, infection, and IBD. The medical team decided that these were features of an allergic enterocolitis. She was switched to amino acid-based formula at 17 months of age and asked to avoid dairy. Despite months on this formula, she continued to have diarrhea and intermittent hematochezia. She was transitioned to 100% amino acid-based formula at 40 cal/oz, given both orally and via a nasogastric tube to mimic enteral nutritional therapy treatment in case this is early Crohn's disease. Eventually, the patient required a surgical gastrostomy tube for persistent feeding issues. A second calprotectin at 20",
