She takes eyedrops for glaucoma in her left eye and her intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg in both eyes under good control. Her right fundus showed a ruptured RAM at the superotemporal vascular arcade with subinternal limiting membrane and subretinal hemorrhages not involving the macula (fig. ).

There was a history of defect in the lip and palate since birth. Family history was noncontributory. On extraoral examination, there was bilateral complete cleft lip with forward placed premaxilla []. Intraoral examination revealed a median cleft of the palate involving complete soft and hard palate []. After detailed history and examination, a diagnosis of nonsyndromic CLP was made. Parents' counseling was done to allay their anxiety. They were explained the treatment plan for fabrication of feeding plate and consent was obtained.\nIt was planned to make the maxillary impression when the infant was fully awake, without any premedication or anesthesia. The infant was seated upright in his mother's lap in dental chair with face forward. Small size of the mouth opening did not permit the use of impression tray or flat wooden stick as carrier for the material. Thus, it was planned to make impression with finger-loaded impression material. Fast setting elastomeric putty impression material (Express\u2122 STD, 3M ESPE, USA) was mixed and loaded on the index finger and an adequately large piece of gauze was wrapped all over the loaded impression material with loose ends wrapped toward the hand [Figures and ]. The gauze permitted control over the material and restricted the excessive displacement of impression material toward the nasal cavity and pharynx []. Thick consistency of the impression material did not permit leakage of material through the gauze and kept it within the flexible confines of the gauze.

Although the patient was treated with anticoagulants, he developed recurrent VTEs; therefore, the level of international normalized ratio was kept between 3.0 and 3.5. The patient also had a history of chronic thrombocytopenia with an element of pseudothrombocytopenia, as the platelet count was consistently higher when measured in citrated whole blood with added paraformaldehyde (PFA). Consequently, all platelet counts were measured in triplicats (EDTA, citrate, and citrate with PFA) and agglutination occurred in EDTA and citrate tubes. Therefore, in the following paragraphs, all mentioned platelet counts are counted in citrate tubes with added PFA. The patient developed a subdural hematoma during an episode with a very low platelet count of 30 \u00d7 109/L and therefore warfarin treatment was discontinued. Successive treatments with prednisone, dexamethasone, intravenous immunoglobulins, romiplostim, and rituximab were initiated on suspicion of immune thrombocytopenic purpura; however, a substantial increase in the platelet count was not achieved. Consecutive bone marrow examinations performed in 2002, 2009, and 2015 showed no dysplastic features. During a period with headache and severe thrombocytopenia (9 \u00d7 109/L), a cerebral computed tomography (CT) scan revealed progression of the persistent subdural hematoma and a new subdural hematoma in the opposite hemisphere (A). The patient did not present any neurological deficits at the time and the Glasgow coma score was 15. Treatment with platelet transfusions and tranexamic acid was initiated. During the next 24 h, he developed epistaxis, increasing headache, dyspnea, and swelling of the left crus. A CT scan showed progression of the right subdural hematoma with centerline displacement (B). At the same time, a",

His right leg, which had a threatening vascular injury, was debrided and kept under close observation. He underwent three procedures before a decision was taken to amputate his right lower limb, below knee. However an epidural was not performed, as sepsis was a consideration, and he was put on IV fentanyl infusion for postoperative pain relief.\nSubsequently he was put on oral analgesics and rescue doses of IV morphine. On the fifth postoperative day, he complained of severe pain from the non-existing part of his leg with pins-and-needle sensations from the stump. The pain management team was then involved in managing his emerging phantom limb pain. We found an extremely anxious boy with a history suggestive of phantom limb pain and sensations. The pain was not continuous, varied from moderate to severe in intensity (average Visual Analogue Score 8/10), with a shooting character, which went to burning at times. On an average there were 15 \u2013 20 episodes of severe pain (VAS of more than 6/10) per day. Hyperalgesia and cold allodynia were also noted. The boy also had generalised pain due to other injuries. A lumbar epidural catheter was inserted aseptically and he was put on continuous epidural analgesia with 0.1% bupivacaine, along with oral ibuprofen, gabapentin 100 mg BD, and amytryptline 10 mg HS. This made a drastic difference, with his pain score coming down to 3/10 from 8/10. However, he complained of increasing pain on the third day of epidural infusion. After checking for a functioning epidural, gabapentin was increased to 150 mg BD. On the next day, as the pain became more resistant, he was put on rescue doses of IV morphine. On the fifth day, the IV morphine used was 30 mg, a decision was taken to discontinue the epidural.",

Pathological finding revealed the histologic pattern of tumor was glandular, and some of the glands contained luminal eosinophilic material (Fig. ), and the immunohistochemical results in our institution showed positive staining for PAX8 (paired box gene 8), CD10, GATA3 (GATA binding protein 3) and TTF-1 (thyroid transcription factor 1) (Fig. A\u2013D), while negative staining for ER (estrogen receptor), PR (progesterone receptors), P53, and P16 (Fig. E\u2013H).

During the initial studies, a left-sided AP was identified, yet cannulation of the coronary sinus (CS) could not be achieved. No ablation was performed, and it was suggested that perhaps a prominent Thebesian valve or maldevelopment of the CS ostium had prevented access.\nThe patient's physical examination was unremarkable, and her electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with a PR interval of 108 ms, a QRS axis of -10 degrees and a QRS duration of 112 ms.

She was referred to a tertiary care institute for a fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT, in which multiple poorly FDG avid skeletal lesions were reported with no evidence of primary malignant pathology. The patient was referred to our institution for further management. A review of the FDG PET/CT revealed a rounded lesion measuring 2.2 cm with mild FDG uptake superior to the upper pole of the left lobe of thyroid just inferior to the left submandibular gland lateral to and abutting the left lamina of thyroid cartilage. Her renal function was deranged for at least last 1 year, and last serum creatinine was 1.9 mg%. She was also having celiac disease. In view of clinical history, we ordered a parathyroid hormone (PTH) assay which showed a value of more than 3000 pg/ml from two different laboratories. Her serum calcium was 10.4 mg/dl (laboratory normal 8.80\u201310.60) and serum phosphorus was 3.60 mg/dl (2.40\u20134.40), and Vitamin D levels were consistently in deficient range.

She was living on a farm where the hens, rabbits and dogs were present and also had a history of smoking 20 cigarettes a day for 19 years. The patient reported progressive worsening of the shortness of breath on exertion for the last year. A diagnosis of PAP was performed based on the HRCT and BAL results. One-sided lung lavage was repeatedly performed with the final procedure being complicated by acute respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation. The therapeutic effect of the lavage treatments was short-lived and was followed by progression of the disease. Oxygen saturation on room air at rest (SpO2) was measured as low as 80 %. The patient was therefore dependent on a long-term home oxygen therapy. One year following the diagnose of PAP, SpO2 at rest on room air dropped to 72 %. The patient\u2019s health status began to deteriorate, withan insufficiency of the right heart developing and a Mycobacterium intracellular lung infection was diagnosed and was subsequently repeatedly treated with a combination of antibodies.

The patient reported that, for the previous two months, she had noted some redness, warmth, and swelling in inferior portion of her left breast. She received two courses of outpatient antibiotic for presumed infectious mastitis, without any improvement. In fact, the breast area had started to turn black. A few days before her presentation to the ER, she saw her primary care physician, who did a skin punch biopsy of the left breast lesion. Because of worsening finger pain, the patient decided to come to the ER.\nIn the hospital, a complete review of systems revealed right leg weakness, which started approximately seven days earlier, causing unsteady gait and multiple falls. The patient denied having any fever or chills. She had no left breast drainage or nipple discharges. She denied any headache, change in vision, or upper extremities weakness. She also denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, or coughing, abdominal pain, or change in bowel movement or urination. No skin rash was observed. No weight loss or night sweats were noted.

Physical examination revealed that he could not move his lower extremities or control urination and defecation. His tendon reflex had disappeared completely in the lower extremities. Some enlarged lymph nodes were found in the neck region. The chest coronal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a dumbbell-shaped mass in the thoracic cavity between T3 and T5 that measured up to 5 cm in diameter (Fig. a). Horizontal MRI indicated that the mass extended to the spinal canal and paravertebral region through an enlarged intervertebral foramen. The spinal cord was compressed and obviously displaced (Fig. b). The mass was considered an extradural and paravertebral dumbbell-shaped neurilemmoma. On April 3, 2018, the patient underwent surgery for excision of the lesions using a posterior approach. Under general anesthesia, he was intubated with a double-lumen endotracheal tube and was placed in the right semilateral position. Initially, laminectomy was performed from the lower T3 to the upper T5 by making a vertical linear skin incision from T3-T5. An encapsulated yellowish tumor attached to the dura mater was observed through the left intervertebral foramen between T3 and T4. The mass was connected to the root of the third intercostal nerve, which was ligated and sheared. Subsequently, the chest surgeon induced the collapse of the lung and inserted a thoracoscope through the fourth left intercostal space of the clavicular midline. The mass was observed to protrude from the parietal pleura of the third left intercostal space. Therefore, two thoracic portals were added along the fifth intercostal space of the anterior chest wall.

    "original_text": "A 3 year-old boy who was a known case of febrile seizures was brought to our hospital with an episode of focal seizure lasting for 12 min. Child had low grade fever prior to the seizure.\nOn examination, child was febrile and in postictal drowsy state. Reflexes were brisk with plantars being flexor. No signs of meningitis or raised intracranial tension were detected. Patient was admitted in the ward and recovered from postictal state in few hours.\nAfter 3 days, child again developed an episode of complex partial seizure with perioral chewing. Subsequently, he became drowsy. On examination, child had altered sensorium and brisk reflexes. After recovery, mother also complained of diminution of child\u2032s vision. The visual evoked potentials were normal.\nEvaluation of blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid were negative for an infectious etiology. Serum chemistry, complete blood count, and liver enzymes were unremarkable. An initial electroencephalogram performed few hours after the termination of seizure was normal.\nOn MRI of brain done on day 4, there were diffuse symmetric areas of restricted diffusion in bilateral cerebral hemispheres, involving mainly white matter. Adjacent cortices were also hyperintense []. Corresponding areas did not reveal any signal abnormality on T1 and T2 weighted images []. The perirolandic regions and basal ganglia were spared, excluding the diagnosis of hypoxic-ischemic injury.

There were two other masses of the same echogenicity: one was occupying the left ventricle (LV) and the other was in the left atrium attached to the interatrial septum at the site of fossa ovalis (, Videos ). The left ventricular dimensions and function were normal. Cardiac magnetic resonance showed similar findings with no septal invasion and tissue characterization suggestive of multiple myxomas (). Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed the same findings () in addition to an enlarged thyroid nodule and a left adrenal cyst that measures 65 \u00d7 57 mm (). Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland revealed a markedly enlarged right lobe of the thyroid with normal vascularity. Serum aldosterone, dexamethasone suppression test, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and 24-hour urine metanephrines were within normal limits.\nThe patient underwent surgery where all three masses were excised. However, the tricuspid valve was inseparable from the RV mass; hence, it was replaced with a tissue prosthesis. The masses were grossly reddish grey in color, fleshy, and gelatinous in consistency (). The histopathological examination of the excised masses revealed myxomatous cellular proliferations with sparse collagen fibers consistent with multiple myxomas (Figures and ).

She was admitted to the emergency department with palpitations on effort and recurrent syncope. The electrocardiogram (ECG) () showed a wide QRS complex tachycardia with left bundle branch block, leftward axis and heart rate of 210 beats per minute, and she required direct electrical cardioversion because of poor clinical tolerance with severe hypotension. The ECG during sinus rhythm showed a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block and non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. The AFL relapsed in the next hour after cardioversion so the treatment with betablocker alone was continued. All biochemical markers of myocardial ischaemia and electrolytes were within normal limits. The echocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed no structural heart disease, with no chamber dilatation or hypertrophy and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65%. With the clinical diagnosis of AFL with 1:1 AV conduction an electrophysiological study (EPS) was done in the next 72 hours.\nDuring the EPS, the patient was in persistent AFL with a cycle length of 255 ms associated with a typical isthmus-dependent circuit. The AV conduction was variable with a HV interval 90 msec. Cavotricuspid isthmus ablation stopped the tachycardia () restoring sinus rhythm with AH interval 78 msec and HV 90 msec (). After complete bidirectional isthmus block, we continued the EPS with programmed ventricular stimulation to complete the wide QRS tachycardia study protocol. With 2 extrastimuli we reproducibly induced the sustained clinical tachycardia. Diagnostic criteria for bundle branch re-entrant ventricular tachycardia (BBR VT) were typical ECG morphology, reproducible initiation of tachycardia with critical V-H interval prolongation, fixed HV interval longer than baseline, spontaneous changes in VV intervals preceded by similar changes in HH intervals and right ventricular apex entrainment with fusion and a post-pacing interval of <20 msec ().",

He was able to communicate and perform simple daily activities independently. He had a past medical history of epilepsy and allergic rhinitis. He was recently discharged from hospital about a week ago after being treated for pneumonia. His mobility was limited by poor vision. He had had multiple falls, some of them with head injuries. His regular medications included chloral hydrate, ferrous fumarate, calcium, vitamin D supplements, and sodium valproate. He did not smoke or drink alcohol [, ].\nThe fracture was treated conservatively. During the admission, his sodium was noted to be 128 mmol/L. Other blood test results are shown in . He was referred to the medical team for review when the sodium levels subsequently dropped to 120 mmol/L on day 3 of admission. Tracing his previous blood test results, his sodium has always been within the range of 124 to 126 mmol/L, and the chronic hyponatremia was previously attributed to psychogenic polydipsia. The previous tests done to investigate hyponatremia were not available for review. Physical examination did not reveal any significant findings. The patient was apyrexial, had a stable blood pressure of 125/80 mmHg with a heart rate of 80 beats per minute. He was clinically euvolemic. Postural blood pressure and heart rate measurements did not show any significant variation.\nAs there was a drop in sodium levels from his usual baseline, the hyponatremia workup was repeated.

On presentation in another health facility, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan, with incomplete imaging of the iliofemoral axis, revealed a type A aortic dissection (DeBakey type I). Following transfer to our center, physical examination showed a pulseless left femoral artery, while no sign of acute limb ischemia was present. The patient underwent a mechanical Bentall procedure with hemiarch replacement under circulatory arrest for a total procedure time of 7 hours, 45 minutes. The immediate postoperative course was uneventful. The femoral pulses were symmetrical and well palpable once the patient rewarmed. Thirty-six hours after surgery, the patient was extubated and complained of severe pain to his left buttock. The lower limb pulses were present and no sensory or strength deficit was found. The left limb was normal, while the buttock was tense and painful especially upon flexion and adduction of the hip. A GCS was suspected. A CT angiography scan of the pelvis showed a dissection flap ending proximal to the iliac bifurcation without direct involvement of the iliac arteries. The false lumen was thrombosed and preferentially oriented toward the common left iliac artery. The opacification of the left internal and external iliac arteries was good. Preoperative CT angiography showed left gluteus muscle swelling (\n). This was likely related to a malperfusion following thrombotic or embolic occlusion (\n).

In addition the patient developed recurrent episodes of dysphagia, cyanotic episodes and respiratory tract infection. At six months the patient was admitted again because of severe stridor and dyspnoea. Clinical examination on patient showed mild respiratory distress, respiratory rate of 55/min, pulse rate of 122/min, SPO2 of 93% with oxygen by hood and a blood pressure of 75/50. On systemic examination the patient showed normal air conduction on both sides with mild bilateral crackles.\nBronchoscopy revealed compression of the trachea along with laryngomalacia. Echocardiography did not reveal any significant abnormality. A suspicion of vascular ring was made on clinical grounds and bronchoscopy findings and a contrast CT of chest was advised. Contrast enhanced helical CT was done using 64-slice Light speed VCT (GE Medical systems, Milwaukee, Wisconsin). Maximum intensity projection (MIP) and volume rendered (VR) images were also obtained for better delineation of the anatomy.

This patient is an active patient at our center and continues to follow up with the neurologist at the age of 61 years. The patient's data were reviewed for the past 19 years when she was first diagnosed with MS (). The clinical data included over 30 encounters, office visits, pharmacy notes, and radiology reports among others. She was first referred to a neurologist at the age of 43 years with the complaint of sudden onset of pain in the right shoulder while lifting heavy weight at work. Her past medical history was positive for depression treated with paroxetine, intermittent blurred vision, slurred speech, and occasional episodes of imbalance. The family history included a stroke in her father at 40 years and a brother who died from a stroke at an unknown age. A living brother and son endorsed migraine headaches. Cervical spine imaging demonstrated a C1 dorsal signal abnormality contiguous with the medulla. Degenerative changes were noticed in the cervical spine at C5-6 and C6-7 with spurring and some left foraminal stenosis. Electromyography (EMG) was performed that showed subtle findings of denervation of right-hand muscles. An initial diagnosis of cervical myeloradiculopathy was considered secondary to her shoulder injury, and she was prescribed pain medication for symptom relief. Her symptoms continued to deteriorate with increasing pain in both arms and finger paresthesia. An MRI of the brain demonstrated confluent T2 hyperintensities in the temporal lobe, lenticulostriate nucleus, thalamus, and the brainstem for possible MS.

Confirmation of the tumor was made by tissue biopsy of a mass located in the right supraclavicular region approximately 2 years ago. During her initial presentation in July 2009, we performed a wide excision of the mass and a sentinel lymph node biopsy of the right neck and axillary lymph nodes. Using a marking pen, we drew an elliptical incision around the mass to create a 2-cm margin from its palpable edge. In total, we excised an ellipse of tissue with diameters of 15\u00d710 cm. After resection, the patient received four cycles of radiation therapy to the right supraclavicular region. She had been in good health since the diagnosis, and her outpatient medical regimen consisted only of a proton-pump inhibitor for treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

In addition, she complained of visual loss on rightward gaze and loss of balance with head movement.\nOn presentation to the emergency department, her vital signs remained within normal limits.

Three years ago, the patient was found to have a mass on the left femur. Biopsy revealed poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of unknown primary. He had undergone surgical resection of the left femoral tumor and above-knee amputation with adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin and etoposide) and radiation therapy. Routine surveillance imaging showed no evidence of malignancy. Chest computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen/pelvis with contrast were performed at three-month intervals for the first year followed by six-month intervals. The patient was in clinical remission for the last two years.\nOn physical exam, his blood pressure was 119/76 mmHg, heart rate was 104 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and jugular venous pressure was elevated. Grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur was present at the left sternal border and rales at the lung bases. Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large mass measuring 8.10 X 6.54 cm within the right ventricle causing right ventricular outflow obstruction, and the left ventricular ejection fraction was 60-65% (Figure ). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the mass extending from the right ventricular free wall with compression of the left ventricle and dilated right atrium (Figure ). A positron emission tomographic/computed tomographic scan showed increased standardized uptake value activity of 9.3 in the right ventricular mass (Figure ). Cardiac biopsy of the right ventricular mass was consistent with metastatic neuroendocrine tumor (Figure ).

In addition, a saccular aneurysm protruding dorsally from the coarctation was observed (Fig. a, b). Calcification in the saccular aneurysm wall was not observed. However, high calcification in the aortic area except for the aneurysm was observed (Fig. c). No other abnormalities were observed in the heart or large vessels.

Her last delivery was four years ago and she has been well at routine activities ever since. The exacerbation of symptoms occurred within recent three months. Echocardiography had revealed mild LV dysfunction (EF:40%). Surface ECG showed repetitive nonsustained monomorphic VT three months ago and her cardiologist began Sotalol to control her arrhythmia. The symptoms was not relieved after three month of treatment for heart failure and arrhythmia. She was then referred to us due to frequent PVCs and runs of nonsustained VT. ECG recorded during the non-sustained VT showed a left bundle branch block pattern in the precordial leads and an inferior axis and early transition in precordial leads in V3-V4 (). This pattern fulfilled the criteria of VT originating from the aortic sinus cusp reported by Ouyang et al. (1); although this QRS morphology could be seen in PVC\u2019s originating from Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT)as well. Having obtained the informed written consent from the patient, she underwent Electrophysiologic study in fasting state, using the standard technique, with no antiarrhythmic agents. Quadripolar catheters were placed in the right ventricular apex and His bundle region via the right femoral vein. At first, using classic method, the right ventricular outflow tract was mapped, but pace map failed to find any matched QRS with the spontaneous PVCs.
