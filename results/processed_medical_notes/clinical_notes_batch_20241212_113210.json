    "original_text": "The patient was a 24-year-old high school educated, married male farmer by occupation, who initially started chewing tobacco at the age of 17 years in the company of his friends. He developed dependence in the form of tolerance, withdrawal, and craving over a period of 6-8 months. At the age of 18 years, he took 2-3 tablets of Tramadol (as a combination preparation of 37.5 mg with Paracetamol 375 mg) on the advice of some friends who used the same to allay fatigue after working in the fields. These were freely available without prescription at the neighborhood pharmacy. The patient found it beneficial to allay fatigue and felt elated after its use and started to take it on a regular basis. Over the next 6-8 months, he developed tolerance and had to take 5-6 tablets/day to derive the same benefit and he experienced a craving to consume these tablets and would often start his day with these tablets. He also started to experience symptoms, of that he claimed were non-specific such as headache and fatigue when he did not take the regular dose of these tablets. This would be relieved on taking the tablets. Over the next 4-6 months, he also started to consume Alprazolam at the dose of 1-2 mg/day, again on the advice of friends who claimed it would help him relax. This too was available freely locally. Over a period of 1 year, he developed dependence to Alprazolam as well.

MRI () showed a mixed high and low signal intensity in the left distal femur, which formed a large soft tissue mass. The patient was finally diagnosed with osteosarcoma of the left distal femur by biopsy and was administered two courses of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) and one course of ADR and DDP at the same dosage as previously reported (HDMTX, 10 g/m2; ADR, 60 mg/m2; and DDP, 120 mg/m2) ().

Upon fundus examination an inferior macular involving chronic retinal detachment was observed (Fig. a). The patient was scheduled for a left eye vitrectomy and had an uneventful surgery on the 21st of September 2012. On the 1st post operative day his visual acuity was noted to be counting fingers with a reattached retina. At the next visit 1-week post surgery, he complained of pain in the left eye and vision remained limited to counting fingers but improved marginally to 6/60 with pinhole. At a subsequent visit he complained of reduced vision and foreign body sensation. His vision was reduced to hand motion, and he developed hyperemia and keratic precipitates. Posterior segment examination revealed opaque silicone oil. A faint retinal view could be seen. At his next visit few days later, there was severe conjunctival hyperemia, increasing number of anterior chamber cells and hypopyon. Due to this presentation and a heightened index of suspicion for SORE, the patient was scheduled for immediate silicone oil removal. On the 5th of October 2011, the silicone oil was removed. The procedure involved extraction of the silicone oil, multiple irrigation of the vitreous cavity with vancomycin and ceftazidime (in a concentration of 1 mg/0.1 ml and 2 mg/0.1 ml respectively) into a fluid filled eye. After this irrigation of the vitreal cavity, multiple air fluid exchange was performed. Then, 0.1 ml each of vancomycin, ceftazidime and dexamethasone was injected into the vitreous cavity.

Three months ago, she was hospitalized and treated for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae bacteremia. A year ago she was treated for S. maltophilia bacteremia secondary to an infected dialysis catheter. Past medical history was also significant for hypertension, atherosclerotic vascular disease pending elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and sudden cardiac arrest followed by ICD placement. With the current presentation, both blood and catheter cultures obtained at the dialysis clinic were positive for S. maltophilia, prompting her subsequent arrival to the emergency room. She presented with a continuation of fever and chills, as well as tachycardia and episodic hypotension. She was noted to have mild epigastric tenderness. There was no surrounding erythema, discharge, or tenderness noted around the tunneled dialysis catheter on the right anterior chest. Initial workup showed elevated troponin and procalcitonin. Chest X-ray findings were suggestive for left lower lobe pneumonia. Within the ER, the patient's hypotension resolved with fluid resuscitation and intravenous levofloxacin therapy was started with blood cultures drawn.\nCardiology was consulted for persistent elevation of troponins and it was presumed secondary to impaired clearance in ESRD. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was done to evaluate for endocarditis given the presentation of bacteremia and fevers. TTE revealed artifact noted on an abandoned ICD lead in the right heart concerning for possible vegetation. Repeat blood cultures were positive for S. maltophilia and the patient was continued on levofloxacin.

He referred severe psychomotor symptoms as well as anxiety, aggressiveness, agitation, weakness, diaphoresis, and decreased visual acuity occurring at any time of the day and improved by eating. Upon further questioning, our patient, who worked as a truck driver and whose symptoms had reflected poorly in his workplace, also expressed overall discomfort with life and wishes of death due to the intensity of his symptoms. He had no history of tobacco smoking or excessive alcohol consumption. Medications taken prior to admission included candesartan 16 mg and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg once a day for hypertension.\nDuring the following weeks, the symptoms increased in severity and frequency, with continued unremitting anxiety and weakness accompanied by loss of consciousness and extreme burning sensation in his entire body. After this acute episode, he was evaluated by a primary care physician in a local hospital and hospitalized for 4 days, where he continued to present recurrent episodes of irritability and aggression to self and others.

    "original_text": "A 33-year-old Caucasian woman presented with complaints of episodic burning pain and flushing of her face, ears, upper chest and, occasionally, her upper extremities. She presented with photographs displaying bright erythema from her lower neck extending upwards to her face and head. Her symptoms were precipitated and worsened with lying down or warm temperature exposure, and were abated by cooling measures. She maintained her home air temperature at 60\u00b0F. She denied similar symptoms amongst family members, and there was no family history of EM. She was in good health until 2001 when she began to experience these painful burning and flushing episodes.\nOver time, the episodes increased in frequency and severity until presentation when she was experiencing multiple daily episodes, each lasting minutes to hours. Her symptoms were disabling and she was forced to leave her job. Physical examinations during multiple visits revealed normal vital signs except for a reduced core body temperature of 94\u00b0 to 95\u00b0F. She had dry skin with a diffuse blanching erythema mainly over her face, and loss of her fingernails. She underwent an extensive evaluation which included a normal comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count (CBC) with differential. She did have a low free thyroxine level with a mildly elevated thyroid stimulating hormone level and was started on levothyroxine for primary hypothyroidism, but this did not change her symptoms. Approximately 1 year after the onset of symptoms, she developed oligomenorrhea and this later progressed to amenorrhea.

Volume control with drugs, such as diuretics, was unsuccessful and he was started on hemodialysis. Thereafter, he received various antibiotics for bacterial infections, including pneumoniae and urinary-tract and catheter-related infections. Simultaneously, he had continuous watery and sometimes bloody diarrhea, the etiology of which was considered to be CDAD due to a positive stool test for CD toxins. Despite treatment with metronidazole and vancomycin, the severity of the diarrhea was not ameliorated. Abdominal X-ray and computed tomography did not reveal any causal factors, and laboratory tests showed only slight elevations in the white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level. We suspected involvement of uncontrollable CDAD or other type of infection (such as mycosis, tuberculosis, or cytomegalovirus infection) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\nColonoscopy showed multiple segmental ulcers in the ascending, transverse, and sigmoid colon, but not the rectum, which suggested infectious colitis or ischemic colitis (Fig. ). A biopsy specimen showed loss of glands, fibrosis, congestion, and edema, suggesting ischemia, with no findings of infection (Fig. ). Given these results and the fact that the patient was on dialysis and had severe arteriosclerosis, we provisionally diagnosed ischemic colitis caused by arteriosclerosis and hemodialysis. We stopped or adjusted enteral nutrition, avoided low blood pressure, and withdrew antibiotics; however, his diarrhea persisted. It was impractical to perform a second colonoscopy, as his performance status was severely worsened. Finally, he died of cardiac arrest 193 days after admission. The autopsy showed longitudinal and annular ulcers in the sigmoid colon.

She did not give any history of drugs intake, fever, anorexia, weight loss, seizures, hearing loss, nor having any physical or mental disorder. Also, family and postnatal history was non-contributory.\nExtra oral examination revealed that patient has incompetent averted lips and convex profile.\nAn intraoral examination revealed generalized diffused, nodular enlargement of gingiva, more on the right side. Gingiva was fiery red in color with soft and spongy consistency and bleeding on slightest of provocation. The teeth were covered with enlarged gingiva till the middle one third, with some teeth showing grade I mobility [Figures \u2013].\nPanoramic radiograph revealed generalized bone loss [] and, teeth no. 11, 21, 45, and 46 were root canal treated with crowns on them.

The intraocular pressure (IOP) was 50 mmHg in the right eye and 14 mmHg in the left. A slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment revealed corneal edema, rubeosis of the iris, a dilated pupil, the loss of the light reflex, lens opacity and a vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye. A normal anterior segment was observed in the left eye. The retina of the right eye was invisible. A clinical examination of the retina of the left eye revealed a small cotton-wool patch above the disk, hemorrhagic foci at the posterior pole and a laser spot on the peripheral retina ().

    "original_text": "A 52-year-old Japanese man presented at our hospital for evaluation and treatment of rectal cancer. He had been diagnosed with rectal cancer by colonoscopy for screening of rectal bleeding. He had a history of chronic hepatitis C. He had no family history. He had no tenderness of the abdomen, and no mass was palpable. Laboratory results were unremarkable. Barium enema showed a filling defect at the rectal ampulla (Figure ). Colonoscopy revealed a type 2 tumor localized in the lower rectum (Figure ). Following biopsy, the lesion was confirmed to be papillary adenocarcinoma. Contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) did not reveal swollen lymph nodes or distant metastases but did reveal multiple hypervascular spots in the pancreatic body and tail and abnormally expanded IMV at an arterial phase. During the arterial phase, there was early filling of the portal vein, splenic vein, proximal portion of the superior mesenteric vein, and the abnormally expanded IMV. The IMV, which was approximately 10 mm in diameter, lead tortuously down to the pelvic space and connected to the right internal iliac vein (Figure ).

Upon fundus examination an inferior macular involving chronic retinal detachment was observed (Fig. a). The patient was scheduled for a left eye vitrectomy and had an uneventful surgery on the 21st of September 2012. On the 1st post operative day his visual acuity was noted to be counting fingers with a reattached retina. At the next visit 1-week post surgery, he complained of pain in the left eye and vision remained limited to counting fingers but improved marginally to 6/60 with pinhole. At a subsequent visit he complained of reduced vision and foreign body sensation. His vision was reduced to hand motion, and he developed hyperemia and keratic precipitates. Posterior segment examination revealed opaque silicone oil. A faint retinal view could be seen. At his next visit few days later, there was severe conjunctival hyperemia, increasing number of anterior chamber cells and hypopyon. Due to this presentation and a heightened index of suspicion for SORE, the patient was scheduled for immediate silicone oil removal. On the 5th of October 2011, the silicone oil was removed. The procedure involved extraction of the silicone oil, multiple irrigation of the vitreous cavity with vancomycin and ceftazidime (in a concentration of 1 mg/0.1 ml and 2 mg/0.1 ml respectively) into a fluid filled eye. After this irrigation of the vitreal cavity, multiple air fluid exchange was performed. Then, 0.1 ml each of vancomycin, ceftazidime and dexamethasone was injected into the vitreous cavity. Intravitreal 10% C3F8 was used as tamponade after which the three sclerostomy sites were securely closed using 8\u20130 vicryl sutures.\nMicrobiology study: silicone oil and fluid mixture yielded heavy growth of gram-negative bacilli, which was isolated and identified as P. aeruginosa.

She is a patient without a specific history. She could not walk on crutches without being in pain as well as limping and dragging her right leg. Rt. knee MRI findings showed near complete tear of the ACL at the femoral attachment, partial tear of the LCL, disruption of meniscopopliteal fascicle, and nonvisible popliteofibular ligament (Fig. ). She also had joint effusion with loculated fluid in subpopliteal recess. First, the effusion was aspirated under ultrasound guidance. The hematogenous effusion was aspirated about 30cc. After joint effusion was aspirated and resolved, ultrasound-guided PDRN injections were carried out 5 times at intervals of about 2 weeks. The procedure was as follows: First, the triangular bony contours of the medial margins of the femur and tibia were identified, and the probe was placed over the medial knee joint in the longitudinal plane for injection. Using an out-of-plane approach, the needle trajectory is adjusted under real-time ultrasound guidance in order to enter the center of the knee joint through the triangular space. The needle does not appear in the ultrasound if it is well placed in the intra-articular space. The injection can begin once this has been achieved. With an intra-articular injection on the inferior side of the knee, patients usually have to pose with full flexion of the knee joint, because joint recess is easily palpated and exposed with full knee flexion. However, our patient could not move her knee because of severe pain. We were also concerned about an aggravation of the ligament tear. Thus, the procedure was guided with MRI.

Her visual acuity was counting fingers at a distance of 50 cm from the right eye, while that of the left eye was 0.06. Corneal stromal edema and Descemet's folds were found in both eyes (). Corneal opacity was involved in all layers of the cornea, and epithelial bullas were found in the center of the right cornea. Lens, vitreous, and fundus were normal. The patient had neither a personal medical history nor familial history of eye disease. We performed penetrating keratoplasty in the right eye without a precise diagnosis. Visual acuity was maintained at 0.2 during the first few months after surgery.\nVisual acuity proceeded to decrease, and ocular pain recurred four years after the first surgery. Right eye visual acuity was hand motion, and slit-lamp biomicroscopy showed recurrence of epithelial edema and stromal opacity (). In July 2005, the patient underwent a second penetrating keratoplasty in the right eye due to recurrent corneal opacity and neovascularization in the cornea. Despite mild corneal opacity and corneal edema, visual acuity was maintained at 0.08 during the first two years after the second surgery.\nA third penetrating keratoplasty was performed on the right eye in July 2008, due to worsened corneal opacity and visual acuity decrease to 0.02 (). Total serum protein level, which had remained at a normal level until 2008, was elevated to 10.4 g/dL after preoperative evaluation. Electrophoresis revealed elevated M protein in the serum (2.72 g/dL) and urine (29.3 mg/dL). Immunofixation electrophoresis showed elevated kappa light chains.

    "original_text": "A 59-year-old gentleman presented with a history of right iliac fossa mass. The CT scan showed a solid mass not obviously attached to the small or large bowel and had a possible fatty component at the edge (). The biopsy was reported as a malignant pleomorphic spindle cell lesion, which demonstrated strong positivity for SMA and desmin, whilst S100 and c-kit were negative. There was one mitosis per 10 hpf and no necrosis. Taking the radiological information into account, differential diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma with myogenic differentiation or a primary retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma were suggested. Resection specimen received later comprised of a small bowel, the midpart of which was markedly distended by a pale mass measuring 14 \u00d7 11.5 cm. The nodular mass had a firm-cream yellow cut surface and approximately 60%\u201365% appeared to originate from the bowel wall. Several satellite lesions with similar macroscopic appearances were noted away from the main lesion.\nHistology showed the lesion to be composed of well-differentiated liposarcoma (atypical lipomatous tumour) with abrupt transition to areas with an extensive dedifferentiated component. The well-differentiated areas were represented by adipose tissue in which atypical adipocytes and lipoblasts were easily identifiable (Figures and ). The dedifferentiated areas were represented by high-grade pleomorphic and spindle cell sarcoma that expressed diffuse strong SMA and desmin positivity indicating divergent myogenic differentiation (Figures , , and ). H-caldesmon was negative in the dedifferentiated areas. A diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma with myogenic divergent differentiation was therefore made.\nThe tumour appeared to originate from the bowel and the well-differentiated component was seen extensively infiltrating the bowel wall including the small bowel submucosa.

The mother of the patient denied any previous trauma or constitutional symptoms but did endorse foreign travel; they were living in Japan at the time of presentation to our department. The patient was current on all vaccinations.\nThe initial orthopaedic evaluation revealed a well-appearing, healthy child in no acute distress. The gait exam revealed that she refused to weight bear on the left lower extremity. The patient had very mild generalized tenderness in the left midfoot region; otherwise, no other area of tenderness was appreciated upon further examination of the lower extremities. She had full, painless range of motion of her hip, knee, and ankle joints. There was no erythema or swelling of the left foot; however, there was a mild effusion of the ankle. She was neurovascularly intact with normal reflexes.\nShe was afebrile, and vital signs were within normal parameters. Radiographs of the left lower extremity revealed no osseous abnormality (). Laboratory findings revealed a slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 34 mm/hr; otherwise, the white blood cell count (10,200 cells/\u03bcL), differential (45% segmented neutrophils, no bands), and C-reactive protein (<0.05 mg/dL) were normal []. An MRI of her left ankle showed an ankle joint effusion, a 16 mm fluid collection with a high T2 signal with surrounding bone marrow edema, and a low signal on T1 (Figures and ). The findings were consistent with a Brodie abscess with surrounding osteomyelitis and a possible septic ankle.

On examination, the patient had tenderness to palpation in the right iliac fossa, with significant rebound tenderness and guarding. Body temperature was recorded at 38.5\u00b0C.\nThe patient's past medical history was significant for an incident of similar pain six months prior to presentation. He was diagnosed with sigmoid diverticular disease confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan and managed conservatively. A subsequent colonoscopy confirmed the diagnosis, and did not reveal any other colonic pathology.\nFurther investigations revealed a raised white blood cell count of 16,000 per microliter. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis disclosed evidence of extensive free gas under the right dome of the diaphragm confirming suspicion of a perforation. Fluid-filled prominent loops of small bowel were noted. However, none of them were dilated to suggest obstruction. Mild bowel thickening was also noted around the cecum. Pneumatosis coli suggestive of ischemic bowel, extending from the cecum to the proximal ascending colon was seen. A blind ending structure with calcifications was also seen (Figure ). Other significant findings on the scan included a liver cyst, consistent with the patient\u2019s previous CT scan, and consolidation at the base of the right lung.\nSubsequently, the patient underwent an emergency laparotomy and a diffuse four-quadrant peritonitis was seen. A giant perforated MD, 80 cm proximal of the ileocecal valve was identified as the cause of the peritonitis. The giant MD measured approximately 10 cm in length and 2.5 cm in width (Figure ).

The result from the hospital's dietician showed the causes of overweight are frequent drinking and meat consumption at late evening hours.\nTo determine the diet responsible for the weight loss, change in the intakes of total calorie, carbohydrate, and fat (especially animal fat) were analyzed based on the diet history of the case. The result showed that overall intakes of total calories, carbohydrate, and protein were evenly decreased after the diet intervention, and the reduction in large amount of animal fat was observed by cutting down the consumption of fish and meat.\nShe regularly participated in hazardous drinking twice a week.
