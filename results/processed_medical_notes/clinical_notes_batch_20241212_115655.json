It was first considered to be induced by treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) for mild hypertension, but she continued to have angioedema attacks for the next 6 years after discontinuation of ACE, with progressive aggravation during the last year. The previous multiple evaluations by many specialists in other hospitals did not succeed to give a clear diagnosis and treatment.\nThe patient had no relevant medical history and took no medication, except ACEI that was stopped some months after angioedema onset. No relation with possible allergic stimuli could be identified and she had no clinical manifestations between attacks. Angioedema was painful, not accompanied by urticaria or abdominal symptoms, located variably to neck, arms or buttocks, without facial involvement during 6 years. The attacks occurred at weeks or months intervals and usually lasted between 48 and 72 h, irrespective of corticosteroids and antihistamines treatment usually administered. The frequency of attacks had progressively increased from one at 2\u20133 months intervals to almost weekly during the last year before presentation. The last angioedema attack, determining emergency hospitalization in September 2014, was more severe and prolonged, accompanied for the first time by laryngeal edema and respiratory symptoms. The extended medical evaluation, including complete blood tests for inflammation, allergy, autoimmunity and cancer, were all negative (Table ). Full body CT scan and bone marrow examination were normal. No criteria for lymphoproliferative, mieloproliferative or autoimmune diseases could be found. Measurement of C1 inhibitor (C1INH) in plasma showed significantly decreased level at all measurements, with low activity ranging from 58 to 4% and constantly low C4 (Fig. ). Complement fraction C1q plasma level was measured twice and had normal value. Genetic tests were not performed, given the patient advanced age and lack of family history of angioedema,",

Ultrasound-guided core biopsies showed a benign fibroadenoma, as well as a fibroadenoma with associated atypical lobular hyperplasia, apocrine metaplasia, and microcalcifications. Excisional breast biopsy showed an ER-positive fibroadenoma with involvement by foci of ductal carcinoma in situ within less than one millimeter from surgical margins and atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH). The E-cadherin immunostain demonstrated loss of membranous expression in the ALH, while stains for p63 and SMMHC demonstrated retained myoepithelial cells throughout the lesion. Following a discussion regarding treatment options, the patient underwent a right partial mastectomy and axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy, with adjuvant radiation of the right breast. Pathology from this surgery showed no residual tumor, and no tumor was identified in the two sentinel lymph nodes.\nAbout one month following the completion of adjuvant radiation of the right breast, the patient underwent a thyroidectomy and pathology showed multifocal papillary thyroid cancer. Thyroid ultrasound prior to the thyroidectomy showed enlargement of both lobes, with heterogeneous echogenicity, and was suspicious for small calcification of the lower pole of the right lobe. This was followed by radioactive iodine therapy. About two and a half weeks later, she noticed edema, mild pain, and erythema of the right breast. The patient had previously experienced significant right breast skin changes as a result of her adjuvant breast radiation, including a dermatitis and skin hyperpigmentation; however, the radiation dermatitis had healed prior to the radioactive iodine therapy. We suspected the patient's new symptoms were due to radiation recall dermatitis. However, we decided to evaluate the patient for possible inflammatory breast carcinoma, and incisional biopsies of the right breast were performed. Pathology revealed moderate chronic perivasculitis with edema of the dermis and no evidence of malignancy (Figures and ). The patient was closely monitored, and her symptoms were noted to have improved on subsequent evaluation.",

He then became behaviorally dysregulated later on and refused to step out of the car. Later that evening, he refused to take his insulin. He was then found by his mother at nighttime somnolent and reported overdosing on his home insulin. This event led to him being brought to the hospital. Psychiatry was consulted to assess for continuous suicidal thoughts and guide disposition. The mother ended up enacting the durable power of attorney (DPOA) for the patient. The patient refused to take any psychotropic medications, and the team recommended that the patient would not benefit from acute inpatient psychiatric admission at this time; the patient was then discharged.\nThe patient's mother brought him to the ED for an assessment of violent aggressive behavior.

She reported tingling pain in the feet and lower legs as well as an impairment in detecting cold temperatures as a sign of small fiber involvement. In addition, the patient had recurrent shortness of breath. She had previously been diagnosed with a severe polyneuropathy of unknown origin. Besides the neuropathy, her medical history was empty. She denied gastrointestinal or visual disturbances.\nShe was a daughter of nonconsanguineous parents from Turkey. Her family history was empty regarding neuromuscular disorders. She has four brothers and two sisters. She is the mother of two healthy children (ages 5 and 7 years).\nHer clinical examination revealed a distal as well as left pronounced tetraparesis, hyporeflexia with absence of Achilles tendon reflexes, hypesthesia of the lower legs reaching the patellae and pallanesthesia at the medial malleoli. No compound motor unit potential could be measured on her lower extremities of the tibial or peroneal nerves bilaterally. Motor conduction studies of her upper extremities, including investigation of both the median and ulnar nerves, were unremarkable. No sensory nerve action potentials could be obtained on the upper or lower extremities. Signs of denervation in the distal muscles of the lower extremities, as well as signs of chronic neurogenic reorganization, were detected by electromyography. The extensive polyneuropathy work-up and rheumatology assessments did not produce any pathological results. No indication for a paraneoplastic origin of the disease was discovered. Standard screening methods did not reveal an associated monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or diabetes. However, proteinuria was discovered in the 24-hour urine collection, indicating renal involvement. Because she had dyspnea, a cardiac work-up was performed.

The true aneurysm extended almost the full length of the splenic artery, arising from the root to the splenic hilum. Interventional radiology was excluded from the therapeutic options because of risks associated with arterial recanalization, ischemic complications, and cost effectiveness. Therefore, we performed elective surgery with aneurysmectomy and splenectomy. The splenic artery was cut at its root without disturbing celiac arterial flow. After dissecting the pancreatic parenchyma to detect the intact portion of the dorsal pancreatic artery branching from the aneurysm, this artery was also cut. Because dense pancreatic capsule was adherent to the calcified aneurysmal wall, the aneurysm required dissection from the pancreatic parenchyma. The pancreatic parenchyma was preserved with its drainage vein, although the pancreatic parenchyma was widely exposed secondary to the aneurysmectomy (Figure ). Operative time was 250 min, and blood loss was 1907 ml.\nThe patient subsequently developed postoperative intractable pancreatic fistula, and refractory symptoms affected his postoperative course.

She was transferred to our hospital after pressure dressing of the wound and transfusion in the local hospital. Physical examination indicated that the patient\u2019s blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg and the pulse rate was 128 per minute. She was conscious, and her left lower extremity below the hip completely lost and the wound dressing unopened. Her blood pressure rose to 100/60 mmHg after transfusion. Debridement was performed 2 h after admission. During the surgery, we noticed that the left lower extremity beyond inguinal area was totally absent, and the area from the sacroiliac joint to the pubic bone was exposed. There were leaves and other foreign matter in the wound. The rectum, vagina and the bladder were exposed, and there was a 4 cm long laceration of the anal sphincter. The wound did not communicate with the abdominal cavity and there was no injury to the viscera. Left iliopsoas were completely avulsed from the original site and a large cavity was present in the retroperitoneal space below the diaphragm. The left common iliac artery and vein was transected and thrombosed 1 cm distal to its origin. Debridement was performed, the proximal ends of the left common iliac artery and vein were ligated and the wound was washed repeatedly. Due to the extensive skin loss, the wound was partly closed and the rest left open and covered with Vaseline Gauze after operation. Diverting colostomy was performed and thorough irrigation of the distal colon segment was conducted to prevent continued fecal contamination of the pelvic wound. The wound remained open initially, the granulation tissue gradually matured and the wound became self-contracted and closed spontaneously 6 weeks after the injury.

On examination, there were no positive signs except for localized pain. A radiologic examination on 3 April 2017 found no destruction of the shoulder (Fig. ). Pain at the shoulder joint became gradually aggravated, together with the appearance of shoulder joint dysfunction. Two months later, physical examination revealed mild swelling of the shoulder, and markedly restricted shoulder and elbow motion. Mild distal nerve function defects appeared gradually.

He had a history of diabetes and asthma, for which he had been pharmacologically treated for several years. He also had a history of open surgery to treat peritonitis 3 years before. Upon arrival at the hospital, he was in a lethargic state (Glasgow coma scale; E3V5M5), with a loss of direct and indirect light reflexes due to damage to the right optic nerve. Skull X-ray and cranial computed tomography (CT) showed comminuted fractures of the skull and multiple areas around the skull base, a Le Fort type II fracture of the facial bones, multiple comminuted fractures of the nose and around the orbit, and a small amount of pneumocephalus in the anterior recess (). Plastic surgeons decided to delay operating on the facial fractures because of severe edema of the face and orbit, and the patient was treated conservatively at the bedside. On day 8 following the trauma, the patient complained of severe headache and nausea, and CT performed on day 8 revealed a large tension pneumocephalus with a tented configuration and noticeably enlarged shadows of air compressing both sides of the frontal lobe (). As an emergency treatment, a rupture of the dura mater in the area of the right anterior cranial fossa was sutured using a subfrontal approach, and fixation surgery was performed on fragments of the comminuted fractures. Four days later, open reduction and fixation surgery were performed on the multiple facial fractures in the department of plastic surgery. On cranial CT performed 2 weeks postsurgery, pneumocephalus was no longer observed (). Subsequently, the patient did not have any specific abnormal symptoms and was discharged in a favorable condition.

Epiphysiodesis distal of the right femur was done at the age of 12 years and left femoral lengthening at the age of 14 years. Since, the age of 21 years the patient has had symptoms of lymphangitis, with an acute inflammatory process in the left thigh and leg as well as signs and symptoms of phlogosis, pain, edema, functional impairment and a fever of 39.5\u00b0C. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with left shift. Throughout the years, she suffered an additional thirteen episodes of lymphangitis, which was bacterial in some cases.\nAt the age of 29, the patient underwent curettage and filling of the femoral and tibial cavities with freeze-dried bone and autogenous cancellous bone from the iliac crest. As a result of these procedures, it was observed that this was a particular case of dysplasia as there was an accumulation of lymph in the interior of the cavity as well, which suggested lymphatic dysplasia or bone lymphangiomatosis. Reabsorption of the bone grafts was later observed, which coincided with two additional episodes of lymphangitis.\nThe differential diagnosis included neoplastic and proliferative bone marrow disorders, especially histiocytosis; as well as benign lesions such as solitary bone cysts, fibrous dysplasia, fibrous bone defects, cystic fibrous osteitis resulting from hyperparathyroidism and congenital generalized fibromatosis.

    "original_text": "A 56-year-old man presented with diplopia due to the right oculomotor nerve palsy. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results revealed a large sphenoidal tumor []. The patient underwent tumor resection, and the pathological diagnosis revealed an atypical meningioma. Diplopia improved after tumor resection and only a slight adduction disturbance of the right eye persisted. During the next 7 years, he underwent local radiation therapy at a total dose of 50 Gy, second tumor resection, and Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery to control the tumor\u2019s repetitive recurrence around the right anterior clinoid process. After the GK radiosurgery, residual tumor was controlled for the next 3 years [].\nThree months after his last visit, he started to suffer from intermittent diplopia. MRI revealed a rapid growth of the posterior part of the residual tumor [], and heavily T2-weighted imaging showed the involvement of the right oculomotor nerve within the tumor []. His symptom was intermittent involuntary diplopia, an involuntary inward deviation of his right eye, which resolved within 1 min [, ]. The symptom was mostly triggered by tight eye closing, which frequently occurred every day. The ophthalmological examination of the right eye showed restricted eye movement during upward and medial gaze []. The ophthalmologist diagnosed this intermittent involuntary symptom as ONM. The results of the ophthalmological examination also revealed worsening of the right vision and nasal hemianopia [].\nThe third tumor resection was performed through the right pterional approach to prevent further visual disturbance aggravation.

The patient lived in a remote rural area in Northern Brazil and was promptly transferred to a larger center to receive chemotherapy to avoid a surgical procedure.\nHe was treated with three cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), without clinical response. He was then submitted to a surgical procedure and the anatomopathological study of retroperitoneal lymph nodes was consistent with an infiltrative carcinoma. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed chromogranin and synaptophysin expression and also a Ki 67 < 3%. At this moment carcinoid related markers (glucagon, gastrine, prolactin, PTH, 5HIAA, and chromogranin A) were normal. Because of the discordance between the two biopsies regarding the histological diagnoses, a review was performed in both specimens and there were no histological findings suggesting lymphoma and the hypothesis of a low grade neuroendocrine tumor was confirmed. The patient was then treated with octreotide acetate until clinical recovery and then, without any clinical or radiological evidence of disease, treatment was withheld.\nOn December 2010, he presented with an abdominal obstructive syndrome and an exploratory laparotomy was necessary. The anatomopathological diagnosis of mesenteric lymph nodes resected was consistent with areas containing marginal zone B-cell lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia and neuroendocrine tumor. Bone marrow was not infiltrated and FDG-PET showed exclusively abdominal nodal disease which was compatible with lymphoma involvement. At this time he was treated with 6 cycles of CHOP and octreotide was started again. CT scan obtained at the end of the treatment showed complete response.\nThe patient's family history was revealed to be very unusual.

His major complaint was an acute, diffuse-patterned oral pain in the left mandibular area. The patient had no significant previous medical history. A clinical examination confirmed satisfactory dental hygiene without any apparently relevant findings. The patient explained that his mandibular left third molar had been extracted six month previously and that the surgery had been quite laborious and lengthy. Although the healing process had been satisfactory, considerable pain had recently begun in this area. The dental X-ray showed an image consistent with a piece of metal embedded in a subgingival distal caries at the mandibular left second molar (37), which was probably related to a previous tooth impaction process of the mandibular left third molar (38). Two periapical lesions detected at the mandibular left second molar roots might have justified his acute tooth ache due to acute exacerbation (Figure ).\nInitially, the differential diagnosis of this radiographic finding was that of a possibly loosened or released piece of amalgam. Nevertheless, the patient had never previously undergone any dental fillings.

His dentist was informed about the need to perform an occlusal access cavity in order to initiate a root canal treatment and remove the foreign body from the second molar (37).\nThe breakage of some instruments, such as endodontic files and dental burs, due to a number of factors including defective manufacturing, stress, fatigue, rust, and poor handling is not unknown in dentistry [].

On the next day, she began to bleed again and was referred to our hospital for endoscopic examination. At admission, she was conscious and lucid, although emaciated and pale. There were traces of blood in the oral cavity. Her blood pressure was 95/69 mmHg, and her pulse was 100 bpm. Pulmonary examination revealed decreased breath sounds at the right lung base.

There was no history of trauma or infection in and around the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) region or ear. The patient visited a local practitioner for the same problem and was suggested to have left TMJ ankylosis. For second opinion, he reported to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at Punjab Government Dental College and Hospital, Amritsar. The main concern of the patient was remarkable facial asymmetry with mandibular deviation toward the right side. Further, fullness of the cheek was noticed on the left side with flatness on the right side of the patient. In addition, the right side of the patient's lip line appeared to have an obvious downward slant. On palpation of the preauricular region, condylar movements on both the left and right sides were palpable with no associated tenderness or clicking. Lateral jaw movements were also found to be restricted. Further, inspection revealed that mouth opening (approximately 43 mm) was in the normal range. On biting teeth into occlusion, the midline was found to be deviated by 13 mm to the right of the maxillary dental arch midline, reflecting an asymmetric prognathism with ipsilateral open bite and contralateral crossbite []. The occlusal plane of maxillary arch was normal with no apparent cant. On radiographic examination, axial and coronal computed tomography (CT) scans revealed an opaque mass that was located on the medial aspect of the left mandibular condyle extending medially and superiorly. There was no evidence of any fusion of the condylar head with articulating surface. The upper joint space and the joint disk were identifiable on radiograph [Figures , ].

    "original_text": "A 9-year-old boy was brought to our Oral Surgery Clinic by his mother with the chief complaint of swelling on the ventral aspect of the tongue of 1 month duration. The swelling had gradually increased in size and interfered with speech and mastication. There was no history of trauma to the area, and the medical history was not significant.\nOn clinical examination, a bluish, nonulcerated, oval shaped mass measuring about 25 \u00d7 15 mm in size was noticed on the left ventral aspect of the tongue. The swelling was painless, soft and mucosa over the lesion was tensed (). On aspiration, the swelling recovered mucos. The swelling was clinically diagnosed as a mucocele of glands of Blandin-Nuhn based on the peculiar location. Blood investigation revealed the parameters within the normal limits.\nSurgical removal of the lesion was planned under local anesthesia with 2% lignocaine. A vertical incision was made on the ventrum of the tongue and excision of the lesion was attempted. In course of dissecting the lesion from the underlying tissue, the cystic lining ruptured leading to an immediate extravasation of mucos (). This made the lesion to collapse causing difficulty in further surgical exploration.\nTo improve the visual access of the lesion, a thin mix of alginate impression material was injected into the lesion through the ruptured wall using a 19 gauge needle. This technique helped in clearly demarcating the boundaries of the lesion ().

Initially, she developed an erythematous swelling of size 1 \u00d7 1 cm over the site; the swelling was insidious in onset and gradually progressive in nature. She subsequently developed intermittent, moderate grade fever associated with chills and rigors that subsided upon taking medication. The swelling grew to 15 \u00d7 12 cm size within 3 months, with tenderness, but no discharge. It also led to difficulty in flexion of the left knee joint. She underwent incision and drainage of the swelling at a private clinic. However, the swelling continued to progress and within one month of surgery, the swelling progressed to 15 \u00d7 10 cm size, filled with pus and associated with tenderness. Magnetic resonance imaging of the swelling showed it to be cellulitis and fine-needle aspiration cytology suggested an abscess. She again underwent incision and drainage. At the time of presentation to our centre, she had an annular plaque of size 15 \u00d7 12 cm having an erythematous to violaceous, raised, indurated and tender periphery and a centrally atrophied plaque extending from the lower third of thigh, involving the knee joint along with the popliteal fossa and downward up to the upper one-third of left leg []. The center of the plaque showed three hypertrophic scar marks of the previous incision and drainage []. Movements of left knee joint were restricted.

The swelling started as a small hard mass in the oral cavity on the roof of the mouth. It was a painless swelling which gradually but progressively increased in size with resultant severe facial deformity that almost totally blocked the right nostril. Apart from the facial disfigurement, the patient twice experienced fractures of the lower right limb at 3 years intervals.\nExamination revealed a healthy young boy who was well oriented to his surroundings. He had a short stature with bowing of right arm and right leg that forced him to walk with the aid of clutches. Generally, he had normal looking skin with irregular skin pigmentation on the neck. On local examination of the craniofacial region, the patient had facial disfigurement due to a swelling on the midfacial region. There was an increase in inter-canthal distance with deviation of the nose to the left. The swelling had normal temperature, non-tender, bony hard and fixed to the underlying structures (Fig. ). Intraorally, the lesion was on right side of the upper jaw, oval in shape, had normal overlying mucosa with more of palatal bone expansion compared to the buccal bone. The tumor caused some degree of displacement of teeth on the right side of the upper jaw without mobility. Based on these clinical findings a provisional diagnosis of McCune-Albright syndrome was made.\nThe work up done on the patient included, histopathological analysis, skeletal survey (CT scan of craniofacial region and conventional radiographs for rest of the body), complete blood count, calcium and phosphate levels in the blood, thyroid and parathyroid function tests, and echocardiogram.

The device was replaced in 2005 due to a recall from the manufacturer and in 2009 for battery depletion. In August 2010 the patient presented haemodynamic decompensation, widening of the QRS and modification of paced-QRS axis. A check on the device showed an increase in the impedance and loss of capture of the unipolar CS lead. The chest X-ray revealed a fracture of the conductor of the CS lead in the subcutaneous pouch.

She was second child, born out of a non-consanguineous marriage by full-term normal vaginal delivery. There was no family history of congenital disorders, and antenatal period was uneventful. Examination revealed shortening of right upper limb with slight flexion at elbow and radial deviation of wrist (Fig. ). The hand had seven well-formed digits arranged symmetrically as mirror images on either side of a presumptive sagittal axis (Figs. , ). Passive movements at shoulder were normal; elbow had fixed flexion deformity of 20\u00b0 with further flexion of 30\u00b0. Supination and pronation was grossly restricted at forearm; wrist movement was from 15\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 of palmar flexion. Child was able to flex and extend the fingers and occasionally grasped object between the fingers (although exact finger function could not be assessed as the child was too small). Function of opposite limb was essentially normal. Radiographs of affected limb show two ulnae, one following the other, with broadened distal end and absent radius (Fig. ). The hand bears seven triphalangeal digits with seven corresponding metacarpals all in one plane (Fig. ). We planned gentle manipulation at wrist and elbow, followed by serial corrective cast application at weekly intervals to correct as much deformity of wrist and elbow as possible. Correction of deformity can be maintained by suitable orthosis until the child reaches 1 year of age. After 1 year of age, staged surgeries can be planned because by that time the limb size becomes reasonably large for corrective and reconstructive surgeries and also the child can be trained well in use of hand and muscle training of pollicised finger.

On examination he was stuporous, with poor response to external stimuli. The patient was admitted to the hospital and vital signs and capillary glucose were determined. Glucose levels were 20 mg/dl and increased to 42 mg/dl after a 50 ml infusion of 50% dextrose. During his stay his mental status recovered after glucose levels were returned to normal parameters, requiring high doses of intravenous glucose. After his stabilization he was transferred to the internal medicine department. We confirmed that the patient was not taking medications that would cause hypoglycemia. On physical examination he was somnolent and pale, with slight oedema in both legs. A new episode of symptomatic hypoglycemia was observed while he was receiving an infusion of 20% dextrose. The infusion rate at that moment was 10.416 ml/hr. The infusion was not being weaned off or was an acute disruption. It caught our attention that although the patient was on a 20% dextrose infusion, he continued with hypoglycemia. Blood samples were taken and the results were abnormal ().\nAlthough hypoglycemia could be explained by chronic kidney disease, the diagnosis of insulinoma was considered, so a computed axial tomography with double contrast was taken but unfortunately there were no abnormal findings. During the patient's hospital stay he received several treatments that failed to achieve proper glucose control. We used ascending doses of diazoxide up to 600 mg/day with a poor response.

    "original_text": "A 50-year-old Caucasian male with autism presented with 1week of abdominal pain and vomiting progressing to obstipation. The patient\u2019s limited communication skills led to a delayed diagnosis of a complete bowel obstruction. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy which revealed extremely dilated loops of small bowel secondary to cecal volvulus, leading to a right hemicolectomy. He was discharged with instruction to return to the wound clinic for midline abdominal wound care. On return to the wound clinic, the patient\u2019s abdominal wound was found to have dehiscence with bowel evisceration. This complication arose as the patient had difficulty understanding postoperative instruction to refrain from using his abdominal muscles. The subsequent OR trip consisted of component separation along with mesh implantation to allow for decreased tension on the wound hoping for complete closure and healing. A full timeline of his hospital course is referenced in .\nThe patient was a 50-year-old intellectually disabled male who arrived at the hospital as a transfer from an outside facility for a diagnosed small bowel obstruction.

The patient had received irregular diazepam administration from the onset of the disease; however, the symptoms became increasingly more serious. The patient was prescribed 600 mg per day valproate sodium on admission to hospital to control the seizures, but experienced one or two attacks per month subsequent to the administration of valproate sodium. The past medical history of the patient was unremarkable. On examination, the patient was alert and his pupils adjusted to light. Neurological examination revealed intact cranial nerves, but decreased deep tendon reflexes and a decreased sensation of touch, pain and vibration. The gait of the patient was broad and he was unable to walk in a straight line. Full strength was observed in all the muscle groups. The results of the Romberg, heel-knee-shin and finger-to-nose tests were normal. An electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed diffuse spikes and slow waves, predominantly in the frontal and temporal lobes (). A further MRI scan was performed and revealed increased signal density on T2-weighted imaging and decreased signal density on T1-weighted imaging in the right temporal occipital cortical lesions. Local cortical atrophy was also observed in the left temporal-occipital cortex. In addition, the lactic acid concentration (5.2 mmol/l) had markedly increased. The results of the carotid ultrasound and electromyography were normal. A biopsy of the biceps muscle demonstrated a variation in fiber size and the presence of ragged-red fibers (). In addition to the prescribed 600 mg per day valproate sodium, the patient was administered 10 mg per day coenzyme Q10 for approximately 2 years. Two years later his symptoms relieved",

On examination he was stuporous, with poor response to external stimuli. The patient was admitted to the hospital and vital signs and capillary glucose were determined. Glucose levels were 20 mg/dl and increased to 42 mg/dl after a 50 ml infusion of 50% dextrose. During his stay his mental status recovered after glucose levels were returned to normal parameters, requiring high doses of intravenous glucose. After his stabilization he was transferred to the internal medicine department. We confirmed that the patient was not taking medications that would cause hypoglycemia. On physical examination he was somnolent and pale, with slight oedema in both legs. A new episode of symptomatic hypoglycemia was observed while he was receiving an infusion of 20% dextrose. The infusion rate at that moment was 10.416 ml/hr. The infusion was not being weaned off or was an acute disruption. It caught our attention that although the patient was on a 20% dextrose infusion, he continued with hypoglycemia. Blood samples were taken and the results were abnormal ().\nAlthough hypoglycemia could be explained by chronic kidney disease, the diagnosis of insulinoma was considered, so a computed axial tomography with double contrast was taken but unfortunately there were no abnormal findings. During the patient's hospital stay he received several treatments that failed to achieve proper glucose control. We used ascending doses of diazoxide up to 600 mg/day with a poor response.

She reported a 4 month history of progressive orbital fullness with worsening vision and eye pain over the preceding 3 weeks. She denied a history of infectious keratitis, contact lens use, ocular trauma, melanoma, lymphoma, or any other malignancy.\nThe patient originally presented for evaluation by an outside provider 3 months prior, after noticing blurry vision of the right eye with associated periorbital fullness and swelling for 1 month. Orbital MRI was obtained revealing an area of hyperintensity in the right orbit and an 8mm fluid collection contiguous with the superior aspect of the optic nerve sheath. The imaging findings were interpreted as being consistent with orbital cellulitis and a retrobulbar abscess and the patient was admitted for IV broad spectrum antibiotic treatment with ceftazidime, clindamycin, and vancomycin. Her visual acuity in the right eye at the time of admission was 20/200 and the globe was intact. Treatment with antibiotics was deemed ineffective and she was subsequently diagnosed with orbital inflammatory syndrome and started on systemic oral corticosteroids. A biopsy of the mass lesion was recommended but the patient was lost to follow-up.\nThree weeks later, a total of 4 months since the onset of eye symptoms, the patient presented to Bascom Palmer Eye Institute for management of presumed panophthalmitis. The vision in the right eye was no light perception and extraocular motility was restricted in all directions of gaze. Examination revealed an inflamed and tense right orbit with palpable firmness in both the upper and lower eyelids. The cornea was perforated with expulsion of the intraocular contents ( A&B).

Past medical history was significant for chronic kidney disease, secondary hypertension, chronic hepatitis C virus infection and arrhythmia. Ophthalmologic examination revealed best corrected visual acuity of 10/10 in the right eye and 4/10 in the left eye from the temporal field. Confrontation test revealed inferonasal visual field loss in the left eye. Direct and indirect light reflexes were normal in both eyes and there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Anterior segment examination was normal and intraocular pressure was 13 mmHg in both eyes. Dilated fundus exam demonstrated soft exudates consistent with hypertensive retinopathy in the right eye. Fundoscopy of the left eye revealed an area of pallor in the superotemporal quadrant and the macula with macular cherry red spot, which were consistent with occlusion of the superotemporal branch of the left retinal artery (). On OCT, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was within normal limits (). In the patient\u2019s visual field, there was an inferonasal defect in the left eye corresponding to the occluded region (). The patient was treated with a single dose of 500 cc intravenous dextran-40 and 200 mg intravenous pentoxifylline. In etiologic studies, Doppler ultrasonography revealed an atherosclerotic stenosis in the right and left main carotid arteries and a calcified plaque causing luminal narrowing in the left internal carotid artery. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed second- to third-degree aortic valve regurgitation and first-degree tricuspid valve regurgitation. There was no improvement in visual acuity or visual field despite treatment. At follow-up 7 months later, OCT showed thinning of the superior, inferior and temporal peripapillary RNFL ().

When she returned a week later, she had no alleviation, but labial paresthesia on the right side of her lip. As the cause of the new symptom remained unidentified, she was referred to the oral surgery group. Initially, the paraesthesia affected only the right side of the lower lip, but by this time it had spread to the skin of the right side of her chin. The oral surgeons decided to extract the lower right wisdom tooth, but the labial paraesthesia still persisted. Since there was an extended composite restoration in the lower right first molar, and translucency around its apical region was visible, the lesion was diagnosed as periapical granuloma. The lesion on tooth 46 was not close to the mandibular canal; this can be seen on Fig. . Therefore, root canal treatment was carried out, despite the uncertain result of the percussion, palpation and sensibility test.
