    "original_text": "A 28-week-old premature boy, with a birthweight of 1280 grams, was intubated with a 2.5 mm endotracheal tube via the nose and ventilated for severe hyaline membrane disease (HMD). After receiving two doses of surfactant, the premature neonate was successfully weaned off ventilation and extubated to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). On day 9, his clinical course was complicated by a pulmonary hemorrhage, requiring re-intubation. He was given another dose of surfactant and stabilized on high-frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV). The chest radiograph showed extensive bilateral pulmonary interstitial emphysema, with the left side more extensively involved in comparison to the right. A hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus was treated by intravenous paracetamol. The baby's condition did not improve, and he was selectively intubated into his right main bronchus. The position of the endotracheal tube was radiologically confirmed, allowing the right lung to be oscillated while the left lung was rested. The baby was nursed on his left side for a period of 36 hours, after which the endotracheal tube was retracted into the trachea and secured in that position. The baby's ventilatory status subsequently improved, allowing for extubation on day 7 after the relapse. On day 28 of life, he presented with severe stridor, requiring re-intubation. Difficulty during intubation suggested that subglottic stenosis might be present. One week after this re-intubation a flexible bronchoscopy was performed, which revealed two major findings. The first was a Cotton grade 2 subglottic stenosis, and the other abnormality was near-complete obstruction of the bronchus intermedius. The subglottic stenosis was dilated to 5 mm with the aid of a balloon dilator (Boston scientific Mustang\u2122 balloon dilatation catheter). The bronchus intermedius was extremely narrow, and a 2.2 mm flexible bronchoscope was not able to pass through the area of stenosis.\nAfter 2 weeks, the bronchoscopy was repeated and the subglottic region had improved to near normal",

The patient had surgical history positive for removal of a small keratoacanthoma in his right external auditory canal in 2001. Since then he had not experienced any discomfort or symptoms until a mass was found in his right external auditory canal during a routine physical exam in 2005. As the lesion was asymptomatic at that time, the patient refused immediate resection proposed by his doctor and decided to postpone treatment until after he retired. Myringoscope revealed a mass in the deep right auditory canal near the tympanic membrane (). The mass was approximately 1 centimeter in diameter, smooth in appearance, and with no sign of bleeding. CT scan revealed a well-circumscribed, slightly enhanced solid mass in the inferior wall of the right external auditory canal without bony erosion (). Facial electromyography, vestibular function tests, and pure tone audiogram all came back normal.\nThe mass was excised through a microscope-guided surgery, during which we removed the flesh-colored mass that was adherent to the surface of tympanic membrane and preserved the canal wall and the tympanic membrane. The excised mass was then sent to pathology.\nTissues were fixed in 10% formalin, imbedded by paraffin, routinely sliced, and HE stained. To our surprise, through light microscopy, we found that the tissues demonstrated cord, trabeculae, or cluster proliferations of moderately differentiated cells in dermal and proper layers, with pleomorphic nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli, in addition to frequent mitoses.

He first experienced moderate left knee pain five months previously when attempting to carry a heavy object up a flight of stairs. There were no reports of previous injuries to the feet, knees, hips, or back that required medical attention. The pain was self-managed using anti-inflammatory medication and glucosamine with chondroitin, however he still reported a moderate (4/10) amount of knee pain on most days. He was able to ambulate unaided, but occasionally used a cane when walking longer distances. Radiographs confirmed the presence of mild OA in the left knee with definite medial joint space narrowing and one small medial tibial osteophyte (Kellgren and Lawrence grade 2 []). Radiographs of the right knee were unremarkable. Clinical examination did not reveal any ligamentous laxity or patellofemoral involvement, or any observable difference in knee circumference or thigh muscle girth. In accordance with established and institutional safety guidelines for the use of TMS, the participant was screened for history of seizure, medication use, metal implants in the brain or head, and history of neurological diagnosis prior to inclusion in this study [, ].\nAssessment of neuromuscular function included measurement of CS excitability (as quantified using MEPs) and isometric muscle strength. CS excitability was assessed using TMS with a 70 mm double cone coil (Magstim Super Rapid, Magstim Company, Ltd.). Surface bipolar Ag-AgCl electrodes (10 mm diameter) were placed 25 mm apart on the belly of the left and right rectus femoris (RF), and a ground electrode was placed on the patella.

Her past medical history was significant for remote breast carcinoma, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and notable preoperative medications included aspirin, furosemide, and propanolol. Preoperative imaging had no evidence of prior infarcts. After induction of anesthesia, a right internal jugular central venous catheter and radial arterial catheter were placed and maintenance of anesthesia was performed with a combination of 0.5 MAC sevoflurane, propofol 50 mcg/kg/min, and remifentanil 0.125 mcg/kg/min infusions. Mannitol 1 gram per kilogram for a total of 80 grams was administered. The neurosurgeon placed an 80 cm closed-tip, barium impregnated lumbar drainage catheter with a 0.7 mm inner diameter (Medtronic USA, REF 46419) at the L3-4 level prior to the start of surgery.\nThe surgery commenced and was progressing unremarkably. Prior to opening of the dura, 20 mL of CSF was drained over 15 minutes per neurosurgeon request. After dural opening and during dissection of the aneurysm, the surgeon requested the lumbar drain to be opened allowing further drainage of CSF. After approximately 15 minutes, the blood pressure sharply increased over the course of 1 to 2 minutes from a baseline systolic blood pressure of 130 mmHg to over 205 mmHg with an associated decrease in heart rate from 60 bpm to 50 which resolved over the course of minutes.

The left ventricle was mildly dilated with normal systolic function (ejection fraction of 58%). A patent ductus arteriosus was also found (diameter of 0.6 cm). The estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure was 77 mmHg ().\nCMRI revealed a mass located in the left ventricular anterior and lateral walls (). The mass appeared hypointense on equally enhanced T1-weighted images () and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, showing unclear boundaries with the normal myocardium ().\nBecause the tumor was located in the left ventricle, the tumor was relatively large, and its benign or malignant nature could not be determined on preoperative examination. No surgical contraindications were identified. Arterial catheter ligation and total tumor resection were performed under extracorporeal circulation and general anesthesia. The patient recovered well after surgery and was discharged from the hospital 1 week later.

He had a history of smoking and hypertension, potential risk factors for coronary artery disease. Also his father at the age of 46 years had died suddenly with unclear etiology. At the time of the evaluation, the patient had been on antihypertensive therapy with beta blocker for 2 years. The chest pain was not typical for angina pectoris but the patient was very nervous due to his family history.\nThe physical examination did not reveal any abnormal findings. Blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg and pulse 72 beats/min. Cardiac and lung auscultation were normal. The electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray were normal. Routine blood and biochemical laboratory tests were within normal limits. Transthoracic echocardiograpic examination revealed normal left ventricular size and contractility. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 65%. For further evaluation an exercise test was required but this was not possible as the patient had recently undergone knee surgery for meniscopathy. Therefore, to evaluate chest pain and to detect or rule out coronary artery disease, the patient underwent computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA). CTCA was performed using a 64 slice CT scanner (Siemens Sensation 64, Germany). Scan parameters were as follows: Slice collimation, 32 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 0.625 mm; rotation time, 0.33 mins; tube voltage, 120 kV; tube current, 600 mA; and pitch, 0.2. The average heart rate was 71 bpm during the scan. The scan time was 7 sec. CT angiography was triggered automatically by the arrival of the contrast bolus (automatic bolus tracking).

Physical examination revealed a dome-shaped tumor, 22 cm \u00d7 14 cm in diameter. The tumor was elastic, hard, and asymptomatic. No regional lymph nodes were palpable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a multilobular intermuscular mass on the left buttock (Figures \u2013). The tumor was attached to the proximal femur, and the sciatic nerve was also involved. Abnormal signal extension along the muscle fascia of the gluteal muscles was obvious. An excisional biopsy showed spindle-shaped tumor cells in the loose myxoid stroma. The nuclei of the tumor cells were slightly hyperchromatic and irregularly shaped. Only a few atypical mitosis and necrosis were found. Based on the histopathological features, the tumor was diagnosed as myxofibrosarcoma (Figures and ). To determine the histological grade, the FNCLCC tumor grade was assigned using a modified updated version of the original FNCLCC system based on three criteria: tumor differentiation, the mitotic index, and tumor necrosis []. A score was attributed independently to each parameter, and the grade was obtained by adding the three attributed scores. Lesions with a total score of 2 or 3 were classified as grade 1, whereas total scores of 4 or 5 and 6 were deemed grade 2 and grade 3, respectively [].

The patient also suffered a right intertrochanteric and a peri-implant femur fracture as well as a nondisplaced ulnar styloid process fracture. The patient was transferred from an outside hospital for further care. Upon arrival the patient was remarkably asymptomatic, in normal sinus rhythm, hemodynamically and respiratory stable, maintaining an O2 saturation between 95% and 100% with minimal supplemental O2 via nasal cannula. The patient denied significant chest pain or shortness of breath despite his significant injury burden. ECG findings showed some ST wave abnormalities suggestive of early repolarization. An initial troponin level of 0.15 normalized within 24h of admission.

An ultrasound revealed a solid oval lesion with some internal vascularization in the right wing of the nose, measuring 15 x 11 x 19 mm, which apparently caused an interruption of the cortical bone. For additional characterization of the lesion, a CT scan was performed. The CT scan showed a homogeneous nodular structure of soft tissue, centered on the region of the frontal maxillary apophysis on the right, with its erosion, and extending into the nasal vestibule. The structure measured approximately 17-18 mm in diameter; it had smooth, regular contours, and the adjacent bone limit was molded, constituting characteristics suggestive of benignity (Figures , ).\nThe surgical removal of the mass was performed.

He has no other significant past medical history, in particular he had completed his puberty normally, and there was no previous history of GI malabsorption. There was no history of any long-term medication administration. There was no family history of osteoporosis or fractures. He did not smoke or drink alcohol. His body mass index (BMI) was 24.6 kg/m2 (weight 73.5 kg, height 1.73 m). Further history revealed that the acute severe bilateral leg pain started after taking part in a marching session of 200 meters during his 1st week of basic military training. Initially, he had pain in his left shin after the march, and this was followed by pain in his right shin a day later. Because of the pain, he was unable to walk. The march was not a particularly stressful exercise, and he was not carrying any weights. However, this was his first marching session, and he has always been very physically inactive throughout his childhood and does not exercise regularly.\nOn examination, there was tenderness on palpation of the both proximal tibias. There were no blue sclerae or hypermobile joints. He was at Tanner stage 5 for puberty. An X- ray of his legs showed cortical irregularity and lucency with sclerotic margins in the proximal shaft of the tibia, confirming stress fractures (). The radiograph did not show features of bowing.

Limited range of motion (ROM) of the right wrist was reported as well. Physical examination indicated the lump was an approximately 5 cm \u00d7 3 cm hard mass on the radial side of the right wrist, with obvious tenderness and unclear boundary. The skin was slightly red and swollen without ulceration. The right wrist was unable to flexion or extension due to the severe pain, with flexing limitation of his fingers.\nThe x-ray film and computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple osteolytic bone destruction occurred at the distal end of the right radius and the surface of wrist joint, with several discontinuous bone cortex. The distal bone was slightly enlarged, with slight periosteal reaction. After admitted to the ward, a percutaneous bone biopsy was performed, revealing osteogenic malignant tumor (Fig. ). A diagnosis of osteosarcoma was suggested.\nConsidering the rapid progress of tumor, after the patient and his family members gave informed consent (Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report details), we decided to perform a limb-salvage procedure to remove the tumor and reconstruct the wrist joint. In order to reconstruct the large structural defect after removal of the tumor without compromising the length and normal appearance of the radius, using a personalized 3D printed prosthesis was considered to be an ideal option.\nThe CT scan of hand, wrist and forearm were obtained by a scanner (Siemens) with 1.0 mm each layer.

The patient also suffered a right intertrochanteric and a peri-implant femur fracture as well as a nondisplaced ulnar styloid process fracture. The patient was transferred from an outside hospital for further care. Upon arrival the patient was remarkably asymptomatic, in normal sinus rhythm, hemodynamically and respiratory stable, maintaining an O2 saturation between 95% and 100% with minimal supplemental O2 via nasal cannula. The patient denied significant chest pain or shortness of breath despite his significant injury burden. ECG findings showed some ST wave abnormalities suggestive of early repolarization. An initial troponin level of 0.15 normalized within 24h of admission. Given the patient's injury pattern and troponin leak in the absence of known coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) pulmonary embolism (PE), or shock, a formal TTE was obtained. TTE revealed severe tricuspid regurgitation secondary to flail anterior tricuspid valve leaflet with preserved right ventricular geometry and systolic function. The cardiac surgery team recommended outpatient follow-up for elective repair in two months with repeat TTE.\nThe femur fracture was repaired on hospital day two under general anesthesia and the patient recovered well. The chest tubes could be sequentially removed without recurrence of pneumothoraces over the course of the admission. On hospital day three the patient experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response that responded well to a single 5 mg intravenous bolus of metoprolol.

The radiographic exam was conducted and revealed two metal-ceramic crowns on both first and second right lower molars with unsatisfactory marginal sealing (). The replacement of the inadequate metal-ceramic crowns by indirect ceramic restorations was then indicated.\nThe patient presented severe teeth grinding and, although metallic crowns seem to be the best indication in this case, patient refused to receive metallic crowns and opted for esthetic ones.\nThe first clinical step was to remove both crowns and place provisional acrylic-resin crowns. In the following session, endodontic treatment was conducted in the lower right first molar. Following root canals impression of the first molar and the placement of a new metallic post, tooth preparation was conducted, leaving enough space for the ceramic crown (approximately 2 mm from antagonist tooth) (). The metallic post of the second molar was maintained.\nInstructions of hygiene were given to the patient throughout the prosthetic treatment.\nAfter tooth preparation, laser phototherapy with low power laser was performed in all clinical sessions (total of six sessions) on the surrounding periodontal tissue, until the final luting of the ceramic crown was conducted (Figures , and ). Time interval between laser phototherapy applications varies between two and three days. Laser phototherapy was conducted punctually with a semiconductor laser (InGaAIP\u2014DMC, S\u00e3o Carlos, SP, Brazil), working at 660 nm, using an energy density of 3.57 J/cm2 per point and output power of 50 mW. The spot area was 0.028 cm2 (Figures , \u2013). Each point received a total energy of 0.1 J.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed initially at another hospital to identify causes of the abdominal pain and hypotension (blood pressure, 76/43 mmHg; heart rate, 140/min). He was recommended to visit a higher-level hospital because of sustained hypotension despite treatment. Thus, he was transferred to our emergency room.\nVital signs upon arrival at our hospital were as follows: blood pressure, 121/67 mmHg; heart rate, 134/min; respiration rate, 28/min; and body temperature, 36.7 \u00b0C. Detailed history taking revealed that lower abdominal pain arose 3 days ago immediately after 5 times of diarrhea. The patient showed tenderness and rebound tenderness on lower abdomen. CT scan performed at another hospital demonstrated both hydroureteronephrosis, distention of urinary bladder with diverticulum, enlarged prostate gland, and small amount of fluid collection around the bladder with suspicious bladder wall defect in bladder dome (Fig. ). The patient's symptoms strongly suggested peritonitis from a ruptured bladder. As a result, emergency physicians and the urologist planned to surgically repair the ruptured bladder diverticulum. However, an electrocardiograph (ECG) showed ST segment depression in V2 and V3 that might increase the risk of an acute coronary event. Furthermore, a blood examination revealed elevated cardiac enzyme levels and an echocardiography indicated regional wall motion abnormality in concurrence with results from ECG findings. In ECG, rhythm showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and right bundle branch block pattern (pathologic Q wave in II, aVF. ST depression in V2\u2013V3, Fig. ). In echocardiography, mild dysfunction of left ventricle was seen with ejection fraction of 45%.

On October 19, he was evaluated in the emergency department of hospital A for continued neck pain, nuchal muscle spasms, burning sensation in his right arm, and numbness in the palm of his right hand. He had no fever, chills, or other symptoms of infection. Dehydration was a concern because the patient reported he was unable to drink liquids because of severe pain and muscle spasms. The patient received a prescription for a steroid for muscle spasms and decreased sensation in the right arm and was discharged home.\nTwo days later, on October 20, the patient developed shortness of breath, tachypnea, and lightheadedness and reported he had not been able to sleep for 4 days; he was transported by ambulance to hospital B. The patient continued to have right upper extremity pain and severe esophageal spasms, causing him to refuse oral fluids. Because of his worsening symptoms and acute delirium, he was transferred to hospital C.\nOn October 21, the patient was intubated for airway protection. His symptoms worsened, with fever to 104.7\u00b0F (40.4\u00b0C), and he became comatose on October 25. Additional exposure history collected from family members included ownership of two healthy dogs and a healthy horse, and a recent grouse-hunting trip where the patient had dressed and cleaned the birds while wearing gloves. High-dose corticosteroid treatment was initiated for presumed autoimmune encephalitis. Because of refractory seizures beginning on October 26, he was transferred to hospital D on October 28, where steroids were continued. On November 3, an infectious disease physician was consulted at hospital D who noted that the patient\u2019s symptom of spasms when swallowing suggested a possible diagnosis of rabies.
