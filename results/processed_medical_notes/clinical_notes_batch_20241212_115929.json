The ulcer did not improve on treatment with various topical and oral medications. The lesions started with formation of red blister, which doubled in size within 2 days and ruptured to form an ulcer within 1 week period. It took about a year to heal forming a large hypertrophic scar. After around 1 year, she developed another ulcer over the scar, which progressed to the present size over 1 month. There was no history of any prior trauma, abnormal bowel habit, joint pain, or frequent bleeding from the ulcer. On examination, there was a well-defined ulcer of size 11.5 cm \u00d7 6.7 cm over a hypertrophic scar (20 cm \u00d7 8 cm) over the left lower leg []. The base of ulcer had red granulation tissue. The margin was pigmented with undermining at some portions and punched out edge. The healed scar had resulted in flexion deformity at the ankle joint []. The examination of other parts of skin was normal. The site of Bacille Calmette Guerin injection had healed without hypertrophic scar. Provisional diagnosis of PG, Marjolin ulcer and posttraumatic eczema was made. Biopsy from edge of ulcer was done for histopathological examination. All routine investigations, such as complete blood count, peripheral smear comments, were within normal limits. Pus on Gram stain and culture sensitivity did not show any organism. Biopsy showed subcorneal neutrophilic pustules with dermis showing neutrophilic infiltration [Figures -]. The upper and mid dermis showed fibrillar collagen in orderly arrangement [Figures and ]. Based on history, clinical morphology and histopathology a final diagnosis of PG over a healed hypertrophic scar was made. The patient was treated with dexamethasone pulse (100 mg dexamethasone in 300 mL 5% dextrose infused over 2 hours) on 3 consecutive days with 30 mg oral prednisolone and 100 mg dapsone daily.

The current pregnancy presented a low risk for aneuploidy according to the performed cell-free fetal DNA test.

On physical examination, there was a firm, large mass measuring 3 cm \u00d7 4 cm lying over the manubrium of the sternum and another bony mass measuring 4 cm \u00d7 5 cm over the right frontal area. The patient had a history of right renal mass three years earlier, for which radical nephrectomy had been performed. The histopathologic evaluation of the renal mass had been reported as mesoblastic nephroma. Thus, no further investigation and therapy had been applied for the patient at that time.\nFollowing his referral to our clinic, the patient underwent a thorough examination including brain, chest, and abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT), which were normal except for two bony mass lesions. A brain CT scan showed an expansile bone lesion in the right frontal bone, invading the surrounding soft tissues (, ). Similarly, a chest CT scan showed a heterogeneous mass in the manubrium of the sternum composed of soft tissue and bone components, in favour of metastasis (). Whole-body scintigraphy with 99mTc-MDP showed an increased uptake of radiotracer in the frontal bone and the manubrium of the sternum. The patient was scheduled for excisional biopsy of the sternum mass. Histopathological examination revealed fibromuscular tissue infiltrated with round tumour cells with small to moderate amounts of cytoplasm and high mitotic activity accompanied by vascular invasion, which was consistent with a small round cell tumour with sarcomatous pattern (, ). Re-evaluation of pathological specimens at the time of nephrectomy was carried out which was in favour of CCSK and revealed a misdiagnosis of mesoblastic nephroma in the earlier report.

The symptoms had started after a meal when the patient felt the sensation of a foreign body in the throat, which he reportedly swallowed with a bolus of food. As the initial evaluation with neck and chest X-rays was reported as normal, he did not receive any specific intervention. However, in the third week after ingestion, he developed chest pain and fever. On evaluation with a contrast-enhanced thorax, chest, and abdomen scan, he was diagnosed with a right-sided pleural effusion and a suspected foreign body in the periesophageal region of the lower thoracic esophagus close to the inferior vena cava (Figures , ).\nFrom the hiatus region, the foreign body was located at approximately 5 cm cephalad. An intercostal drain was placed under image guidance and approximately 750 mL of serosanguinous pleural effusion was drained. An upper gastrointestinal contrast study did not show any contrast extravasation from the esophageal lumen. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy also did not show any signs of recent perforation or a foreign body in the esophagus. An after adequate chest optimization, he underwent laparoscopic foreign body removal.\nThe procedure was done under general anesthesia in the supine split leg position. After initial access and the creation of a pneumoperitoneum through the left paramedian 12 mm port using an open method, five additional 5 mm ports were placed, including two midclavicular line ports on either side, a left subcostal port for assistance, and an epigastric port for liver retraction.

He initially underwent instrumented thoracic spinal fusion (T1\u20137) due to cord compression from a metastatic T4 lesion from renal cell carcinoma and developed a postoperative deep spinal infection. He underwent multiple washouts and vacuum-assisted closure over a period of twelve weeks, with various antimicrobial regimes, initially receiving seven weeks of vancomycin as well as a shorter duration of ciprofloxacin. He developed a maculopapular morbilliform rash, () initially on the right arm and scalp, before spreading to cover the entire head, trunk, and upper legs () which progressed to become exfoliative and was intensely pruritic and painful (). This was accompanied by a fever and eosinophil count of 9.77 \u00d7 10\u22129/L at the highest, occurring simultaneously with the development of the rash, and which remained elevated over the course of a month of regular blood tests.

Our initial clinical examination found that his left palatine mucosa was significantly swollen compared with his right side. The swelling was diffuse, and its borders were unclear (Fig. ). The swelling was especially pronounced in the left molar region of his palate, and his pain was exacerbated with the application of direct pressure to the lesion. The swelling exhibited increased signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI, Fig. ). All of his left maxillary teeth were healthy, and no specific abnormalities in his left maxilla and maxillary sinus were observed on panoramic X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images. His medical and familial histories were unremarkable, and he was not aware of any history of trauma or inflammation of his head or neck. We administered antibiotics orally (cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride hydrate 100 mg tablet every 8 hours) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (loxoprofen sodium hydrate 60 mg tablet every 8 hours) for 7 days because we suspected that his symptoms were due to inflammation secondary to an infection. However, his symptoms did not improve.\nBased on his clinical and radiographic examinations, our initial diagnosis was a soft tissue tumor. An incisional biopsy was performed and histopathologic examination of the lesion revealed haphazard nodes and inflammatory cells in a fibrous stroma (Fig. ). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significant staining for the neural marker S-100 in the bundles within the node (Fig. ). Factor VIII staining was positive in the fibrous stroma, but not in the bundles (Fig. ). These findings led to the diagnosis of a traumatic neuroma. The patient underwent resection of the tumor with a 5-mm margin using an electric scalpel under general anesthesia. Although the border of the mass was unclear and diffuse, the extent of the tumor could be determined based on the MRI images",

Her pure tone audiometry (PTA) score as measured on her first visit revealed bilateral mixed hearing loss (). An otoscopic examination of her left ear revealed the finding of postoperative tympanic membrane without any evidence of active inflammation and the enlargement of external auditory canal. The right ear was normal in appearance. However, when an otoscope was inserted in her right ear, the patient immediately complained of dizziness.

She was receiving endocrine therapy scheduled for 5 years. Adjuvant RT was omitted because of her old age. The red skin nodules on the left breast were diagnosed as AS by punch biopsy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed solid and hyper-vascularized components with significant enhancement throughout the left breast. No metastasis was observed in other organs. Left mastectomy with extensive skin resection with a margin of 3 cm from the discolored lesion and skin graft surgery was performed. An additional skin resection of 2 cm was performed because several points of the resected stump were diagnosed as positive for tumor cells by intraoperative rapid diagnosis. Pathological findings revealed high grade AS. CD34 and CD31+ spindle tumor cells were detected, and the high-grade tumor cells had a high Ki67 index score of 80% (Fig. ). The high grade tumor cells were locally positive for c-myc although the patient never received RT. Unfortunately, the low grade tumor cells were widely detected in the lateral and deep margins, suggesting that the AS had spread beyond the prediction of the preoperative diagnosis from the MRI. Curative resection was considered impossible, and we decided to follow up without additional resection. Forty days after the surgery, skin nodules and redness appeared on the skin of the contralateral breast and on the skin graft of the chest wall (Fig. ). The skin biopsy diagnosed the recurrence of AS. CT scan revealed recurrent AS extending over the contralateral breast and chest wall (Fig. ).

    "original_text": "An 84-year-old man accidentally fell at home and was admitted to our hospital. The patient was hospitalized with several problems such as multiple metastases of prostate cancer, chronic heart failure, emphysema, impaired renal function, and biliary stent placement due to idiopathic biliary stenosis. While no fracture was identified, the patient complained of lower back pain and was unable to move. As a consequence, he was hospitalized for the purpose of pain management. On the third day of hospitalization, the patient developed a fever of 38.2\u00b0C, and his laboratory data showed high levels of WBC count and CRP. While the source of infection was not identified, a urinary tract infection was suspected because he had purulent urine from previous examination and no symptom of respiratory tract infection. The patient underwent treatment with CMZ 1 g every 12 hrs. Three days after therapy initiation, the fever declined and the laboratory data of the inflammatory response normalized.

    "original_text": "A 74-year-old man under anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy after mitral valve replacement surgery had mild head injury in May 2017. Computed tomography (CT) taken 2 months later revealed the presence of supratentorial CSH on the left. He had been observed without surgical exploration because he had no neurological symptom and there was prolonged coagulation due to the anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. The patient was followed up regularly, and the CSH did not show any change in size. In July 2018, he presented with aggravating headache and nausea which lasted for 3 days. He showed slight consciousness disturbance (Glasgow Coma Scale: 14) at the time of admission, which deteriorated within a few hours thereafter. No other neurological signs and symptoms were present. A CT scan taken on his admission demonstrated an appearance of bilateral CSH in the posterior fossa associated with hydrocephalus (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging showed niveau formation in the CSH and the continuity of the right and left hematomas through the supracerebellar area (Fig. ). As his laboratory examination revealed prolonged coagulation (prothrombin time international normalization ratio: 3.6), vitamin K was administered to reverse the coagulation status. As his consciousness deteriorated rapidly, urgent burr hole irrigation for the posterior fossa CSH was performed under local anesthesia in the supine position (Fig. ).

He was previously admitted to a private hospital, where he was intubated in view of low mentation, and need for respiratory support. On day 3 of admission there, a routine surgical tracheostomy was attempted but failed and the patient was referred to our hospital with a gauze bandage applied over the tracheostomy stoma wound and on ambu bag ventilation via a cuffed size 7, endotracheal tube.\nHe arrived in our emergency room within two hours and was found to be semiconscious, with a GCS of E2M4VT. He had small sized, sluggishly reacting pupils, was diaphoretic, with heart rate of 101 per minute, blood pressure of 160/100 mm of Hg, and a peripheral oxygen saturation of 100% on an FiO2 of 1. He had moderate subcutaneous emphysema extending to the face, neck, and upper arms. The tracheostomy stoma was roughly 2 \u00d7 2 cm wide with a tracheal rent of about 1.5 cm. There was an audible air leak from the site of tracheostomy stoma, despite the cuff of the endotracheal tube being well below the site of the stoma. An urgent chest radiograph was ordered and the patient was shifted to the intensive care unit for further management. By the time the patient had arrived in the ICU, the subcutaneous emphysema was found to have increased substantially and had by now involved the entire chest, abdomen, genetalia, and thighs, extending cranially up to the head and face. The patient was unconscious and unresponsive by then and his airway peak pressures were extremely high resulting in near impossible ventilation.

    "original_text": "A 63-year-old man who had suffered from esophageal achalasia for more than 20 years complained of acute respiratory distress due to stenosis of the trachea resulting from advanced esophageal cancer with tracheal invasion. He was admitted as an emergency to the referral hospital and computed tomography revealed a huge esophageal tumor significantly compressing the trachea (Fig. ). The patient underwent placement of a Dumon Y-shaped tracheobronchial stent (T M Y stent:\u03c6con) to avoid suffocation. He was diagnosed as having esophageal cancer with tracheal invasion, and then underwent chemoradiation therapy (CRT). Following 18 Gy of irradiation and a course of chemotherapy using docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil, a large TEF developed despite significant tumor shrinkage (Fig. a, b). The physician decided to cease the CRT and treat him with the best supportive care. Oral intake was prevented due to aspiration through the TEF, and a gastrostomy was performed under endoscopy.\nThe patient was referred to our hospital as he was unable to eat. At the time of admission, he had a good performance status and no comorbidities. We initially considered the possibility of esophageal stenting to close the TEF. However, as CRT significantly decreased the size of the esophageal tumor, and there had been an esophageal dilatation due to pre-existing achalasia, an esophageal stent seemed unlikely to be able to close the TEF. Therefore, we decided to perform an esophageal bypass using a gastric conduit after obtaining informed consent.\nWe prepared a percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS) system that could be used whenever needed, and both arterial and venous catheter sheaths were inserted from the femoral vessels prior to an endotracheal intubation. We then intubated a 6.0 mm spiral tube under the guidance of both bronchoscopy and X-ray guidance. A cuff of the tracheal tube effectively sealed the space between the stent and tracheal tube and enabled positive pressure ventilation. We were then able to perform esophageal bypass without using PCPS. Esophageal bypass surgery was performed",

The week before the surgery she developed pharyngitis and was treated with azithromycin, which resulted in mucousy diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. She tested negative for C. difficile antigen and toxins at that time.\nA week after surgery, she developed a perirectal abscess that had formed at the site of the sphincterotomy and was prescribed orally administered ciprofloxacin. Despite moderate symptom improvement, in September 2015 she required an abscess incision and drainage procedure and Penrose drain insertion. Prior to the surgery she was given a single dose of clindamycin. An additional 2-week course of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole was then prescribed. In late September 2015 she was admitted to the hospital for two nights due to further complications related to the abscess and was then diagnosed as having a perianal fistula.\nIn November 2015, she was prescribed clindamycin for an episode of group C streptococcal-positive pharyngitis.

A physical examination revealed minimal sensitivity of the left upper quadrant upon deep palpation and an incision scar from the gynaecologic surgery. Nothing else of note was detected. The patient's body mass index was 32.5 kg/m2, and laboratory measurements were within the normal range. Endoscopy and a colonoscopy conducted to determine the cause of pain revealed no pathological findings. An ultrasonic evaluation revealed no evidence of an aneurysm. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted due to the presence of a hyperechoic lesion (53 \u00d7 39 mm in size) in the right lobe of the subcapsular area of the liver. The MRI study revealed a 35 mm diameter hemangioma in the liver segment 8 and a 40 mm aneurysm with a thrombus in the splenic artery of the pancreas tail region (). Tortuosity of the splenic artery, which had a proximal diameter of 1 cm, was detected. In angiographic multislice computed tomography (CT), minimal aneurysmatic dilatation was detected in the celiac truncus in the midsegment of the splenic artery, in addition to saccular aneurysmal dilatation, 50% thrombosed and in the size of 45 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 39 mm adjacent to the pancreas.

The patient defined no relevant family history and had no obvious symptoms. Physical examination findings (including serial blood pressure measurements) were within normal limits. Ultrasound (US) and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed to understand the nature of a recent, blunt, nonspecific upper abdominal pain and revealed 3 small, solid masses in the right kidney measuring between 1 and 4 cm and 5 masses in the left kidney measuring between 1 and 3 cm in size. All were suggestive of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) (). An 8 cm solid mass completely replaced the right adrenal gland, while there were 5 small masses on the left side, all consistent with pheochromocytomas (). The paracaval mass, measuring 4 cm in size, could be not only an enlarged lymph node but also a paraganglioma. The imaging findings of the cystic mass at the uncinate process of pancreas were suggestive of a neuroendocrine tumor (). All other radiologic studies, including spinal and cerebral MRI, were normal. Serum and urine biochemical workup (including cortisol and vanilmandelic acid measurements) revealed normal findings regarding the functional status of the adrenal masses.\nThe patient was diagnosed as VHL disease and a staged surgical approach was recommended based on the radiologic findings. In the first stage, through a subcostal anterior transperitoneal approach, right adrenalectomy, resection of the paracaval mass, and enucleation for the 9 small solid renal masses were performed. Intraoperative frozen section findings were inconclusive about the actual biologic behaviour of the mass located in the uncinate process of the pancreas. Additionally, two other smaller pancreatic masses were palpated during the operation. Given the young age of the patient, we decided to perform a Whipple procedure to remove these pancreatic lesions. Pathologic diagnoses were Fuhrman grade 1, cystic clear-cell",

Three months prior to presentation the patient began noticing an increase in abdominal girth, stating that it, \u2018felt like a large ball in my belly. The patient began to develop occasional abdominal discomfort, which slowly increased in pain and frequency. The patient also developed symptoms of constipation and severe gastroesophageal reflux, for control of which, he began taking laxatives and a proton pump inhibitor. He eventually saw his primary care physician and had a computer tomography (CT) scan done, showing a large spherical cystic mass in the abdomen measuring 32 cm by 25 cm (Figure ). The CT scan findings in short were of a massive uniloculated retroperitoneal cyst seen non- communicating to the pleura, or any other abdominal viscera and occupying nearly the entire abdominal space, displacing his entire bowel to the patient\u2019s left, with the cecum and ascending colon located anterior and left of the midline. The mass spanned from the pelvis inferiorly to the liver hilum superiorly. The liver and stomach were compressed. The patient was referred to a surgeon and the recommendation was made to proceed with surgery after complete evaluation. He has no risk factors related to the mesothelioma (exposure to asbestos or any virus) or any malignancy.

    "original_text": "A 48-year-old Greek female patient was referred to our institution for the management of biliary trauma after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In her medical history, she had had two laparotomies: an ileoanal anastomosis with j pouch for ulcerative colitis 15 years ago, while 5 years ago she was driven to the operating room after a colonoscopy for peritonitis. Due to non-specific upper gastrointestinal symptoms she had had an upper abdominal ultrasound (US) that revealed cholelithiasis (at least two gallstones of diameter 0.8 and 0.7 cm) 2 months before surgery and elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed 18 months before her referral to us.\nThe duration of laparoscopic cholecystectomy was 150 minutes while the procedure was completed laparoscopically and there is no record of intraoperatively identified biliary injury. From the 2nd postoperative day and up to her referral to our institution, recurrent episodes of cholangitis with severe pain, fever with chills and jaundice began. Magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) was performed in order to delineate the biliary anatomy and assess the level of injury. A triple bile duct injury, with right and left hepatic duct ligation and common bile duct cross-section, was revealed (Bismuth type V, Figure ). Attempts at permanent biliary decompression with repeated endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCP), combined with percutaneous transhepatic duct catheterization failed and for 1 year postoperatively bile drained from abdominal drains.

She was diagnosed with Rett syndrome when she was 9 months old and currently suffered from refractory epilepsy and global developmental delay. Because of communication impairment associated with her developmental disability, it was imperative to involve her mother during the entire perioperative course.\nIn her preoperative examination, she appeared drowsy and spasticity was noted in her limbs. Mallampati score evaluation was not possible. She only responded to her parents and exhibited discomfort from the pain she was experiencing from her intraoral abscess. She was maintained on several antiepileptic medications: topiramate 25 mg, clobazam 5 mg, levetiracetam 500 mg, lacosamide 50 mg and oxcarbazepine 300, each of the above given twice a day. Her epilepsy had worsened with increased frequency and was thought to be aggravated by the pain that her intraoral abscess was causing. She exhibited epilepsy during chewing due to pain it elicited. Her laboratory tests including coagulation function and electrolytes were normal.\nAfter obtaining informed consent from her parents, the patient was kept nil by mouth for 6 hours after solid food before surgery and no premedication was administered. The antiepileptic medications were given at 6 am in the morning with sips of water and she was scheduled for the surgery at 8 am. We planned to perform an opioid- and muscle relaxant free-balanced general anaesthesia with nasotracheal intubation.\nIn the operating room, the standard American Society of Anesthesiologists monitors were connected to the patient.

Thus, it was difficult to distinguish them as rather permanent or supplementary. In the lower left quadrant, the first premolar had caries and the second premolar was retained root state, followed by two more teeth (). Due to the destruction of the crown, it was difficult to distinguish which was the permanent or the supplementary tooth. There was no relevant familial history of dental abnormalities.
