The patient states that he noticed the mass for a few months and now it has grown to the point where he can no longer fully extend his neck. He has constant midline neck pain, headaches, and parasthesias in his fingers bilaterally which began approximately one week prior to presentation. The size of the lipoma inhibited the patient's ability to look directly up without turning his head sideward. The patient's pain, decreased range of motion, and parasthesias have gradually worsened to the point where his symptoms are aggravated by any movement of his head or neck. He denies trauma or recent injuries and insists that he had not noticed any other symptoms until he \u201cslept funny\u201d about two months ago. The patient also denies fevers or constitutional symptoms and reports no other neurological deficits other than parasthesias.\nPhysical exam reveals a well-developed (BMI = 27), well-appearing man who looks his stated age. His heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate are within normal limits and he was afebrile. Examination of the head and neck reveals no lymphadenopathy, a clear oropharynx, and no cranial nerve deficits. A large posterior neck mass was noted spanning from the occiput to the level of T2 obscuring the vertebra prominens. The mass was doughy, mobile, and compressible (which elicited pain) and lacked evidence of an infectious process demonstrating no redness, induration, or fluctuance. The patient reports posterior neck tenderness upon palpation with decreased range of motion in the neck\u2014especially to extension. There is no tracheal deviation, no erythema is present, and meningismus was absent. The patient had 5 of 5 strength in his arms and hands but decreased sensation in his hands bilaterally.

    "original_text": "A 72-year-old male patient was referred from other hospital with two PTBD tubes due to perihilar cholangiocarcinoma of Bismuth-Corlette type IV. The patient suffered from concurrent acute pancreatitis. Thus, the surgical procedure was planned at 3 weeks after resolution of obstructive jaundice and pancreatitis. Despite locally advanced tumor, we decided to perform resection.\nDuring laparotomy, we identified that the left portal vein and left hepatic artery were encased as well as the second-order branches of the right hepatic ducts were deeply involved by the tumor. Thus, we abandoned curative resection and decided to perform palliative BDR with cluster HJ.\nThe patient had total destruction of hilar bile duct structures, hence the tumor over the right hepatic artery was removed (). Four intrahepatic bile duct openings (3 from the right liver and 1 from the left liver) were identified and their edges were repaired to prepare them for anastomosis; subsequently, four size-matched silastic stents were temporarily inserted (). The caudate ducts were not markedly dilated, thus small coronary dilators were inserted to identify their course. The anterior wall of the bile duct opening was anchored with multiple 5-0 Prolene sutures ().

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated by EMS upon arrival for pulseless electrical activity, and after eight minutes the patient achieved return of spontaneous circulation. She was subsequently intubated without the need for induction medications and transported to the emergency department (ED). Upon arrival to the ED, an initial physical exam revealed an intubated, unresponsive child with markedly diminished lung sounds bilaterally without wheezing, and an oxygen saturation of 60% on 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Additionally, respiratory therapy reported extreme difficulty with ventilation. Initial bedside chest radiographs (CXR) () were obtained and showed evidence suggestive of bilateral pneumothoraces, which in conjunction with the patient\u2019s clinical picture prompted bilateral chest tube placement. Both returned large volumes of serous fluid, although no blood or air.\nContinuation of the primary survey revealed tachycardia at 132 beats per minute with strong and regular peripheral pulses in all extremities.

She reported of tightness of vagina and introital pain while attempting sex with her husband. She had also become fearful about having sexual intercourse. These symptoms were present for 3 months following marriage. Patient's husband disclosed that few months back when they got engaged, she had expressed apprehensions about having painful sexual intercourse. After the wedding, patient had postponed attempts at penetrative intercourse for 10 days. Whenever penetration was attempted, she would not part her legs and begin to cry. She complained of severe spasmodic introital pain. The couple began to engage only in foreplay. She had initially consulted gynecologists who diagnosed the condition as primary vaginismus. On their advice, the patient underwent hymenectomy under general anesthesia but no improvement was noted. After about 6 weeks, the couple consulted psychiatry services on advice by the gynecologist. The patient reported of sadness, ideas of worthlessness and depressive symptoms over the past 5\u20136 weeks. She was noted to be clinically depressed. She had no contributory past history. Except for hypertension in her mother, family history was negative. She was described to be shy and sensitive by nature. There was no history of sexual abuse or earlier penetrative intercourse. The family of origin was religious; sex was not openly discussed in keeping with local cultural norms. However, the environment was not excessively strict or restrictive. She had normal menstrual history. Physical examination was unremarkable and she did not permit a local examination. She had in the past also not permitted vaginal examination by gynecologists. Her mental status examination revealed depressed affect, ideas of hopelessness and worries about non-consummation of marriage.

Our patient's general condition was poor; he was febrile, with a pulse rate of 124/minute and blood pressure 90 mm/Hg. X-rays of his abdomen showed multiple air fluid levels suggestive of acute intestinal obstruction. With the provisional diagnosis of acute abdomen (acute intestinal obstruction) our patient was resuscitated and sent for an urgent laparotomy. On exploration, our patient had severely dilated small gut loops with the terminal ileal loop twisted around the omental band and adherent to his left pelvic wall. On releasing the omental band, the ileal loop was dissected free from his left pelvic wall. Once the loops had been released, we found a large, white, oval shaped, extra-luminal body in the region of his sigmoid colon (Figure ). The body was soft to firm in consistency (resembling a boiled hen's egg) and attached (parasitized) to the omentum (Figure ). In addition, part of the appendices epiploicae, attached to his sigmoid colon, were calcified with constricted stalks.

Abdominal sonography revealed a cystic lesion in close proximity to the left adrenal gland. Subsequent computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen confirmed the presence of the cystic lesion with no contrast enhancement (Figure\n). The cyst measured 8 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 12.5 cm and had a linear septum. Although the liver, gallbladder, spleen, and right adrenal gland were normal, the cyst seemed to cause a mass effect on the pancreas and the left kidney. However, no lymphadenopathy was noted. Laparoscopic retroperitoneal exploration was performed, and a 10 \u00d7 10 cm cystic lesion was found adhering to the gastric corpus. Unfortunately, attempts to remove the cystic lesion en bloc were not successful, and the lesion ruptured with the fluid contaminating the peritoneal cavity. The cystic lesion was removed grossly, and gross pathological examination showed a ruptured 7 \u00d7 6.5 \u00d7 4 cm irregular cyst with two cavities. Microscopic examination showed typical gastric mucosa with a smooth muscle component in the wall of the resected cyst with no malignancy (Figure \n). Therefore, a gastric duplication cyst was diagnosed based on the images and histology.\nSeven months after the surgery, the patient complained of abdominal distension as well as anorexia and dyspnea on exertion. A repeated abdominal CT scan showed a well-defined roundish low-intensity non-enhancing mass measuring 6.7 \u00d7 4.7 cm in the left adrenal area, along with massive ascites. On examination, the patient was found to be emaciated with positive shifting dullness. Laboratory examination showed normal liver function.

At the age of 4, she underwent a modified Glenn procedure followed by a classical left Blalock-Taussig shunt at the age of 16. Since then, she has had two major cardiac operations. In 1990, at the age of 25, she had a fenestrated modified atrial pulmonary Fontan. Following a very difficult pregnancy 18 years later, she underwent conversion to a total cavopulmonary anastomosis Fontan circulation, modified MAZE procedure and implantation of an epicardial defibrillator with biventricular pacemaker system. Cardiac catheterisation at that time showed a ventricular end diastolic pressure of 16 mmHg and a Fontan chamber pressure of 18 mmHg, giving a transpulmonary gradient of 2 mmHg. Her cardiac medical history was further complicated with arrhythmias requiring ablation in 1998 and episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in 2014.\nThis lady has been under regular follow-up by our team since 2008. Various medications have been trialled over the last 8 years due to her progressive reduction in exercise capacity and exertional dyspnoea. She had initially taken part in a trial to test the safety of bosentan in 2010 [] and at the time had shown good response to the drug with improvement in 6-min walk test. Bosentan was discontinued at the end of the study.\nUnfortunately, over the course of the next few years, she continued to deteriorate with worsening breathlessness (NYHA III), four-pillow orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, ventricular function was preserved. She noticed a significant limitation in everyday activities, requiring social care input and a mobility scooter for outdoor travel. Sildenafil was commenced however this was discontinued shortly after due to symptomatic hypotension.\nCardiac CT scan confirmed non-restrictive Fontan pathway, and normal ventricular function.\nIn early 2016, bosentan was re-commenced with good symptomatic improvement.",

In 2005, a partial left nephrectomy was performed but no pathological signs of malignancy could be evidenced. In 2006, the patient was diagnosed with a prostatic adenocarcinoma, and hence, a radical prostatectomy was performed without any complication. A few months later, multiple suspect left renal lesions were identified and a left radical nephrectomy was recommended by the multidisciplinary urologic board after meeting. Pathological analyses revealed a papillary renal cancer. The patient underwent hemodialysis 3 days a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) after bilateral complete nephrectomy and was closely monitored. Hemodialysis was performed between 2007 and 2010 without any complications. In 2010, a 70 mm local recurrence was diagnosed in the left renal fossa bed. Biopsies were performed, evidencing a recurrence of the papillary renal cancer. Since complete resection was impossible and in agreement with patient\u2019s nephrologists, sunitinib was initiated in August 2010. For the first cycle, the smallest recommended dose of sunitinib was administered (ie, 37.5 mg/day). Sunitinib cycles consisted of 28 days on and 14 days off treatment. All along sunitinib administration, blood pressure was monitored weekly. He was considered to be stable and did not require treatment initiation.\nGrade 3 vomiting occurred during all hemodialysis sessions performed following the first sunitinib initiation. Anticipatory nausea/vomiting was not suspected since the patient was not reported to be anxious and anxiolytic treatments did not decrease the symptoms. However, the 14 days treatment break was associated with a complete resolution of nausea and a related-to-sunitinib side effect was suspected.\nOndansetron was prescribed during the whole second cycle of sunitinib, but grade 1\u20132 vomiting during hemodialysis sessions was still reported.",

The size of the ulcer was 4 \u00d7 3 cm, and the calcaneal cortex was partially exposed (). There was no improvement in the ulceration following curettage and repeated local treatments for three months. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed. T1-weighted sagittal imaging showed diffuse low signal intensity in posterior calcaneus. T2-weighted sagittal imaging showed diffuse high signal intensity in the same region (Figures and ). Based on these findings, osteomyelitis of the calcaneus was diagnosed, and the patient was referred to our department.\nGeneral physical examination on admission showed that the patient was 165 cm in height and 54 kg in weight.

Serum creatinine was 3.2 mg/dl (normal range 0.6\u20131.2 mg/dl), proteinuria was 2.5 g/d. He reported no increased susceptibility to infections, and his chronic renal insufficiency caused only mild clinical symptoms (development of fatigue and tachycardia upon physical strain).\nThe mRNAs encoding the membrane-bound and secreted immunoglobulin heavy chains are produced from identical primary transcripts, which are differently processed at their 3\u2032 ends. Regulation of membrane-bound vs. secreted forms of the immunoglobulin heavy chains depends on the competition of 2 mutual cleavage polyadenylation sites (pAs/pAm) (). In mice targeted deletion of the mu heavy chain cleavage polyadenylation site pAs leads to deficiency of secreted IgM with intact expression of surface IgM and normal secretion of other immunoglobulin isotypes (). Therefore, we sequenced mu heavy chain gene including the polyadenylation sites in both patients with sIgMD and found no alterations (data not shown).

A preoperative abdominal computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed AAA extending proximally up to the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) origin and distally to the aortic bifurcation. The bilateral renal arteries and the inferior mesenteric artery were patent, although the right renal artery had a severe stenosis (). Both internal iliac arteries were also patent without thrombus. After preoperative evaluation, the patient was deemed to be a candidate for an elective open repair.\nUnder general anesthesia, a transperitoneal, mid-line approach was utilized. Mannitol (0.5 g/kg body weight) was administered before clamping of the aorta. Following systemic heparinization, control was obtained of the supra-SMA aorta. Bilateral renal arteries were perfused with 4\u00b0C lactated Ringer solution containing 500 mg solumedrol and 2,000 IU heparin, 240 mL to each kidney initially and then 120 mL every 15-20 minutes. Proximal anastomosis was effected with a 24 mm\u00d730 mm Hemashield knitted polyester graft. Bilateral renal artery bypass grafting was performed using 6-mm knitted polyester grafts originating from the aortic graft. The distal aortic anastomosis was effected just above the aortic bifurcation. Heparin effects were reversed with protamine upon completion of the graft implantation. Supra-SMA aortic clamping time for proximal anastomosis was 30 minutes. Right renal artery and left renal artery anastomosis time was 15 minutes each. Distal anastomosis time was 30 minutes.

The mass had grown slowly over the years, with ulceration associated with foul-smelling discharge noted with time, along with seepage of urine from multiple fistuli in the growing scrotal mass (Figure ). He had been diagnosed with HIV, and ARV therapy had been started two years prior to the development of the scrotal mass. He also had the wasting syndrome, an AIDS-defining diagnosis. He had been unable to walk for three years prior to his visit to our institution. He had been married, but was separated from his wife upon developing the scrotal tumor.\nThe patient's physical examination revealed that he was emaciated. He had a large scrotal mass that extended laterally into both thighs, superiorly into the supra-pubic region and posteriorly to the anal verge. His hips had a fixed flexion and abduction deformity.\nHis hemoglobin was 7.4 g/dL, and his CD4 lymphocyte count was 150 cells/mm3. During surgery, the tumor was found to have extended laterally into the adductor musculature bi-laterally, requiring their inclusion in the excision. The deep margins included the rectus muscle fascia, pubis, pelvic diaphragm, and rectum (Figure ). A small part of the bulbous urethra was excised with the tumor. The excised tumor weighed 1800 g and was reported on the basis of a histological examination to be a giant condyloma acuminatum.\nA pedicled left anterolateral thigh flap was used to create a neo-scrotum as well as to cover the resulting thigh defects (Figure ).

She was first seen at another hospital 18-month ago where contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of abdomen revealed two heterogeneously enhancing exophytic lesions; one in the second part of the duodenum (43 mm \u00d7 36 mm) and the second in the right lumbar region (50 mm \u00d7 34 mm). The radiologic interpretation suggested EGIST (a\u2013c), but the patient elected to not undergo any further workup or treatment.\nThe patient presented to our outpatient clinic because of gradually worsening symptoms. She was alert and oriented with no acute distress and normal vital signs. With the exception of her abdominal examination, no abnormalities were detected. Her abdominal examination was remarkable for abdomen distension with burn scars on the anterior abdominal wall in the epigastric and left hypogastric region. There were no striae, dilated veins, rashes or visible peristalsis and bowel sounds were normal. The abdomen was soft with a large, firm and fixed mass (~15 cm \u00d7 15 cm) palpated in the epigastric/left hypochondriac region. Rectal examination was unremarkable. Laboratory studies included a complete blood count, renal function test, liver function test and a coagulation profile. All were normal.

Gradually, he had lost the ability to walk even with support and was mainly confined to his bed-although he could sit up and crawl.\nThe patient\u2019s intelligence was unaffected by the illness; he had no history of trauma, fever, fits, incontinence, or syncope and did not display vision, speech, or hearing abnormalities. A detailed review of the gastro-intestinal, genitourinary, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems showed no abnormality. The patients\u2019 parents were first cousins, albeit unaffected by the disease themselves. However, out of five siblings, two of the patient\u2019s sisters (12 and 14 years of age) and one brother (five years old) were affected by a similar illness. The patient had had an unremarkable birth history, had reached all the relevant milestones timely and was said to be taking a nutritionally adequate diet. As per the parents, all his vaccinations were complete and the past medical history was clear.\nOn general examination, the patient was well oriented in time, place, and person with his vitals, height, and weight all within the normal ranges. Regarding system-wise examination, the central nervous system examination showed no signs of wasting or abnormal tone in the upper limbs, the power in both the upper limbs was 4/5, and the deep tendon reflexes were normal when elicited.

The patient had ocular pain and redness in his left eye and periodically received topical antibiotics and a steroid for 1 month; however, the symptoms gradually worsened despite treatment, and he was referred to our clinic. The best-corrected visual acuity in the affected eye was 20/2,000 and the intraocular pressure was 10 mm Hg. Slit-lamp examination showed a small abscess with corneal erosion in the peripheral donor cornea that manifested as a suture abscess with corneal infiltrates, mild ciliary injection, and no anterior chamber inflammation (day 0; fig. ). The sensitivity of the left cornea decreased to 20 mm compared with 60 mm in the right eye. The right eye was normal. The suture at the focus was removed and wide corneal scraping was performed for cytopathologic examination and culturing to detect pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria, fungus, or Acanthamoeba. Real-time PCR analysis was performed to detect human herpes viruses (HHVs; HSV type 1 or 2, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and HHV-6, \u22127, and \u22128) [, ]. Only Candida albicans was identified by culturing.\nThe patient was diagnosed with fungal keratitis and treated with topical 0.2% fluconazole hourly and 1.5% topical levofloxacin 3 times/day for 2 weeks.

For recurrent episodes, she also received ECT in 2001, 2003 and 2004. Ten sessions of monthly maintenance ECT (right unilateral) were administered in 2003 and 2004, only leading to subsequent continuous deterioration of cognitive function without having a pronounced antidepressant effect.

The patient had a family history for depression and bipolar disorder.\nIn 2004 she was prescribed tianeptine and pregabalin as a presumed mood stabilizer []. Shortly afterwards, she made a second suicide attempt. She subsequently had venlafaxine (150 mg/d) and lamotrigine (200 mg/d) implemented.

He had been diagnosed with duodenal GIST metastasizing to the liver when he visited the emergency room with hematochezia three years previously. At that time, he underwent a subtotal stomach preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy with liver wedge resection. After surgery, he was given a daily oral dose of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (400 mg) as an adjuvant therapy.\nAt the current admission, a skin examination revealed a 15\u00d715 mm, firm, skin-colored, round-shaped nodule on his chest (). As skin metastases as well as other cystic diseases were suspected, an excisional biopsy was performed. The subsequent histopathologic examination revealed a well-demarcated subcutaneous tumor nodule. The tumor was mainly composed of atypical spindle and epithelioid type cells with various degrees of cytologic atypia. Multiple mitoses were also observed (). Immunohistochemistry revealed positivity for c-kit (CD117), DOG-1 and negativity for smooth muscle actin, S-100, and CD34 (). Additional molecular genetic analysis demonstrated a deletion mutation in exon 11 of the KIT gene. The histopathological features of the nodule were consistent with a GIST.\nFollowing the biopsy, chest computed tomography was performed to look for any remnant soft tissue tumors. However, no abnormal lesion was observed within the excised site. After four weeks later, a brain magnetic resonance imaging of follow work-up revealed multiple metastases at the orbital left superior rectus muscle and occipital scalp. Under the diagnosis of imatinib-resistant GISTs, a second-line therapy with sunitinib was tried. After six weeks later, his chest nodule was completely improved. Further work-up at six month follow-up, computed tomography of head, chest and abdomen revealed decreased mass in left superior rectus muscle and no change of the cutaneous lesion, implicating the stable disease state.",

He received an orthotopic heart transplantation (HTx) in 1994 for idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Unfortunately, we have no records of the patient's transplant operative data given the fact that his procedure was done 23 years ago. He remained asymptomatic during follow-up except for paroxysmal atrial flutter for which he received a single chamber pacemaker in 2008 and later, atrial flutter ablation in 2010. Patient was adherent to his medication regimen and did not show any signs of transplant rejection on several cardiac biopsies. His post-transplant cardiovascular risk factors included systemic hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and stable stage 4 chronic renal dysfunction (eGFR 23 mL/min/1.73 m2). Serial transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) performed in our institution showed progressive degenerative aortic valve disease.\nAt presentation, his TTE showed degenerative bicuspid aortic valve with fusion of the right and left coronary cusps by an incomplete raphe. The appearance of the valve was consistent with severe aortic stenosis which was confirmed by hemodynamic Doppler assessment that revealed a peak gradient of 65 mm Hg, aortic valve area of 0.9 cm2 derived from the continuity equation and a dimensionless velocity index (DVI) of 0.24. Left ventricular function was normal with an ejection fraction (EF) of 59% by Simpson's method. Further evaluation of the aortic valve and aorto-iliac anatomy was pursued by a Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT). It confirmed the morphology of a heavily calcific BAV, the absence of associated aortopathy, and suitability for transfemoral approach. The maximal aortic annulus dimension was measured as 25 mm with an aortic root diameter of 32 mm at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva. Coronary angiography was performed to screen for cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) which did not show any evidence of obstructive coronary disease.\nIn addition, he was noted on admission to be bradycardic with episodes",

His karyotypic analysis was indicative of a 4;11 translocation involving the MLL gene at 11q23. He was induced and underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) from his HLA-identical fraternal twin brother in April 2002. He was in remission with limited skin chronic graft-vs.-host disease until January 2003, when he relapsed and was treated with ICE chemotherapy followed by a donor lymphocyte infusion. He remained in remission until February 2005, when he developed nodular violacious skin lesions which on biopsy revealed T-cells consistent with his original leukemia. Full restaging including bone marrow biopsy and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were negative, indicating an isolated skin recurrence. Re-induction therapy was initiated with cyclophosphamide and gemcitabine but was complicated by significant myelosuppression and renal insufficiency. He received a brief course of systemic retinoid therapy with bexarotene and spot electron beam irradiation for symptomatic improvement of nodular disease on his face with rapid recurrence at the completion of radiation.

Diana reached the Centre with a BMI of 16.06 kg/m2 reporting several disruptions in her eating patterns and several distressful alterations in her body image perception. As reported in the clinical history, Diana\u2019s first eating related crisis was dated back 2 years before her current admission, with a subtle episode when she started a diet to lose some weight after health issues related to her thyroid.

Diana\u2019s weight remained constant in the following months but she developed an obsessive attention to the caloric intake along with intrusive thoughts regarding her weight and regarding specific types of foods. Diana also reported body-related image distortions such as overvaluation of her weight, mirror and body checking, and avoidance of body exposure. Moreover, during the crises, she reported frequent crying spells observing her body in front of a mirror.\nIn the last year, Diana reported a stressful situation at the University that heightened her psychological symptoms. Following these new difficulties, Diana re-enacted the restrictive conducts, reducing the caloric intake with a consequent weight loss of 4 kg in a month.

His symptoms began with fever, and right lower quadrant abdominal pain began the next day. He presented to the emergency department on the third day of illness and was admitted. On hospital day 1, computed tomography of his abdomen revealed a low-lying cecum and peri-rectal inflammation. He was evaluated by general surgery and underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy with pathology confirmatory for acute appendicitis. Post-operatively, he remained persistently febrile. On hospital day 6, he developed hypotension, requiring transfer to pediatric intensive care unit and vasopressors. On hospital day 7, he was transferred to the local tertiary-care children\u2019s hospital pediatric intensive care unit on dopamine and milrinone. Laboratory results were consistent with myocarditis, and an echocardiogram demonstrated diffuse coronary dilatation (Table ). Physical examination on arrival to the tertiary care intensive care unit revealed a grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur over the lower left sternal border, a gallop, and tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant without guarding. He was empirically started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including doxycycline for concern for possible rickettsial disease; all except doxycycline were discontinued with negative blood cultures and a negative test for microbial cell-free DNA in the blood. Doxycycline was continued empirically given prevalence of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in the area. Due to the echocardiographic findings of diffuse coronary dilation, he was discussed with cardiology with concern for atypical Kawasaki disease.

    "original_text": "An 18 year old woman was referred to our outpatient clinic of Endocrinology, University-Hospital of Naples Federico II because of hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Blood samples showed high levels of thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies and normal calcitonin serum levels. The patient was euthyroid with normal serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and free thyroxine (FT4) during replacement therapy with L-T4. At physical examination, a palpable nodule of ~2 cm in size was detected in the isthmus of the thyroid. There were no palpable cervical lymph-nodes. An US evaluation confirmed an isolated lesion located in the isthmus, showing an isoechoic solid nodule with smooth margins; its size was 18 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 6 mm with intra and perilesional vascularity (Figure ). Therefore, a FNA was performed and cytological results revealed a TIR3A lesion. The cytological specimen showed an increased cellularity with some microfollicular structures in the background of scant colloid (Figure ). Thus, we assessed the risk factors associated with the isolated TIR 3A nodule of our patient. According to the ATA guidelines we repeated the FNA which confirmed the same result (TIR3A).

He was diagnosed with psoriasis by a dermatologist elsewhere and was on topical treatment since 15 years. Plaque type psoriatic lesions were present on the scalp, especially in the left temporo-parietal region. Patient's psychopathology was assessed using auditory hallucinations subscale (AHS) of Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS)[] and the score was 35. In view of persistent auditory hallucinations and considering the risk benefit ratio, the option of tDCS as an add-on treatment along with antipsychotics was considered.\nThe patient as well as his primary caregiver was provided with adequate information regarding the procedure, and a video of the tDCS procedure was also shown. tDCS procedures were done using a standard equipment (Neuroconn DC Stimulator Plus, ) as per established guidelines with stringent safety measures.[] The anode was placed with the middle of the electrode over a point midway between F3 and FP1 (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and the cathode located over a point midway between T3 and P3 (left temporo-parietal junction). The stimulation level was set at 2 mA for 20 minutes. The sessions were conducted twice a day (separated by at least 3 hours) on 5 consecutive days.[] At the end of each session, a structured questionnaire was used to assess for any potential adverse effects.[] In addition to this, the skin under the electrodes was examined for any lesion after each session.\nAfter second day, patient started reporting improvement in symptoms.

The patient had received more than 1 year of anti-TB medications with no symptomatic improvement. Patient history and records were reviewed.\nTwo years ago, the patient developed insidious onset right sided pleuritic chest pain associated with a dry cough. It was associated with on and off fever with evening rise of temperature. There was a history of intermittent wheezing without any seasonal worsening and patient had noted 3\u20134 episodes of streaky hemoptysis. There was no history of anorexia or weight loss. The patient was evaluated at a local health care facility wherein based on the findings of a right sided chest radiographic opacity and thoracic ultrasound demonstrating mild right side pleural effusion, a possibility of pleuro-pulmonary TB was considered, and four-drug anti-TB treatment (directly observed treatment regimen) with first-line drugs was initiated. The patient was reassessed after initial regimen, but there was no radiological response. Sputum smear examination for acid-fast bacilli was negative on multiple occasions. Despite 12 months of regular treatment, there was no improvement in symptoms and cough persisted. The patient was initiated on treatment with an intensified anti-TB regimen (Cat II drugs administered on daily basis for 9 months) along with streptomycin and referred to our center.\nGeneral physical examination was normal. On chest examination, crackles were audible in the right infrascapular area, and breath sounds were reduced in the lower right hemithorax. Routine blood investigations were normal.

She then presented to the emergency department with severe and acutely worsening shortness of breath, sudden onset pleuritic chest pain, and sharp radiating pain between both shoulder blades with deep inspiration. At time of presentation, the patient was afebrile with vital signs within the normal limits. Lab work was insignificant with negative leukocyte count and negative cardiac enzymes. A chest X-ray demonstrated an abnormal right cardiomediastinal silhouette with large opacity over the right mediastinum adjacent to the right atrial border.

Her last imaging study was a fluoroscopy study 10 years ago that showed no indications for a mediastinal mass. An echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction (55\u201359%), no wall motion abnormalities, and a cyst near the right atrium. The patient had continued pleuritic chest pain and difficulty breathing and the decision was made to perform video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for pericardial cyst removal. The patient underwent general anesthesia with a 37 French left-sided double-lumen tube. Standard ASA monitors were applied. Two large-bore peripheral IVs and an arterial line were placed for continuous blood pressure monitoring. Intraoperatively, a large cystic lesion was adherent to the pericardium (). There was no solid component and no obvious communication with the pericardium. Part of the cyst wall was left on the phrenic nerve to preserve it. The patient tolerated the procedure well, had no postoperative complications, and was discharged home on postoperative day number two.
