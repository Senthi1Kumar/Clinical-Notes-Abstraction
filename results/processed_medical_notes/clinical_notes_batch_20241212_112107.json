No bone or brain metastases were observed at initial work up; he was classified in the poor risk group according to the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) []. A radical nephrectomy was performed in July 2012. A pathological report indicated a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) of 16 cm with a clear cell component and some degree of a more aggressive cellular component, giving a Fuhrman grade of 4, pT3a pN0 M1 according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) classification. Sunitinib, 50 mg/day, then reduced to 37.5 mg due to side effects, was administered during 6 months. Because of the painful progression of the pleural metastasis in the upper part of his left lung, radiation therapy was delivered to this tumor. Systemic treatment was further modified for the approved second-line treatment everolimus. This latter treatment induced a significant tumor response in most metastatic sites for 15 months before re-progression. In March 2014, our patient complained of persistent headaches and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified a single right frontal metastasis. Stereotactic radiotherapy was performed and a treatment with axitinib, a second-line TKI directed against VEGFrs, was started. Axitinib induced significant tumor shrinkage in the pleural and lung metastases; the brain metastasis was much improved because a brain MRI was considered almost normal.

A CT only detected an enhanced abdominal wall mass near the abdominal scar, which was thought to be desmoid at the time (Fig. a and b). As the hematochezia continued, a further endoscopic workup was performed, and well-differentiated adenocarcinoma was detected at sigmoid colon. The whole body CT scan detected no other distant metastasis. She underwent elective open sigmoidectomy with D3 lymph node dissection for sigmoid colon cancer with mid-line incision in May 2012. Histology of the sigmoid colon showed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma invading to subserosa with 8 out of 20 regional lymph nodes involved. The sigmoid colon cancer was classified as pT3N2b, according to the TNM classification of the Union for International Cancer Control Eights Edition []. Molecular analysis showed KRAS mutation and microsatellite-stable. Postoperative course after sigmoidectomy was uneventful and the patient was treated with 12 cycles of FOLFOX regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy.

Her medical history included postpartum depression and an abnormal cervical cytology treated with loop electrosurgical excision procedure. There was no personal nor family history of immunodeficiency conditions. She was an occasional alcohol drinker and a daily marijuana smoker. She worked as a nursing assistant at a local nursing home. She denied sick contacts, recent travel, and animal or insect exposure.\nShe had six previous admissions within the past two months with left breast abscesses for which she underwent incision and drainage in the operating room (OR), followed by antimicrobial therapy. During this admission, she reported a recurrence of left breast abscesses and development of new abscesses in her buttocks. Her review of systems was otherwise negative.\nPhysical examination showed a woman in distress with a blood pressure of 108/67 mmHg, a pulse of 103 beats per minute, a temperature of 36.6\u00b0C, and a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. The left breast had a visible deformity and asymmetry compared to the right side. Multiple scars and packed wounds were seen (). There was no nipple discharge, retraction, or peau d'orange skin appearance. Induration and fluctuation were palpated; however, discomfort limited a further examination. In the abdominal area, she had keloid-like scars resulting from old skin abscesses (). Her buttocks and thighs had several areas of hyperpigmentation and dimpling (Figures and ).

The lump was gradually increasing in size and it was tender. There was no history of skin changes, nipple discharge, fever, or trauma. Furthermore, there was no family history of similar conditions, no history of traveling abroad, and no contact with a person with tuberculosis. Her medical history revealed history of rheumatic heart disease. She underwent mitral and tricuspid valve repair more than 2 years prior to presentation at our breast clinic. She was a student in primary school living with her parents and siblings.\nOn examination she was hemodynamically stable. She had a normal body build for her age. She was not pale or jaundiced. A breast examination revealed an irregular left breast mass that was palpable at six o\u2019clock position. The mass was approximately 4 cm in maximal diameter; it was hard, tender, and fixed on the posteromedial side. There were no inflammatory skin changes or any nipple changes. Her right breast was unremarkable. There were no palpable bilateral axillary lymph nodes. Abdomen, chest, and neurological examinations were unremarkable. Her blood work, including complete blood count, liver function test, urea and electrolytes, and coagulation profile, was within normal ranges. Ultrasound of her left breast (Fig. ) showed a large, irregular, complex, heterogeneous mass measuring 4.3 \u00d7 2.7 \u00d7 3.5 cm at 6 o\u2019clock position. There were central cystic changes but no significant intrinsic vascular flow. There was significant associated skin and subcutaneous edema and thickening with fluid seen tracking within subcutaneous tissue.

He was diagnosed with smear positive pulmonary TB. He received anti-TB 4-drug combination (HREZ). After 2 months of treatment, the patient sputum was converted to negative smear, but he was suffering from progressive dyspnea on exertion with a Medical Research Council (MRC) Dyspnea Scale grade 5 []. On the physical examination, wheezing was demonstrated on chest auscultation and O2 saturation was 96% in room air. Methylprednisolone sodium succinate 80 mg/day for one week followed by oral prednisolone 40 mg/day was administered for relief of dyspnea, but they were not effective. Chest X-ray demonstrated narrowing of distal trachea and minimal infiltrations in left lower lobe. Chest CT revealed stenosis of distal trachea and left main bronchus; the stenotic part in distal trachea was 5 mm in diameter at the narrowest portion and 30 mm in length. Additionally, the stenosis in left main bronchus was 3 mm in diameter and 33 mm in length (). The pulmonary function test indicated a reduction in the percent predicted FEV1 (49.8%). He was referred to Nagoya Medical Center to perform pulmonary intervention. Under general anesthesia, rigid and flexible bronchoscopies were used to perform balloon dilatation under fluoroscopic guidance for both distal trachea and left main bronchus. Tracheobronchial stenosis was of fibrostenotic type. Through the instrument channel of flexible bronchoscope, a controlled radial expansion balloon (Boston Scientific, Boston, MA, USA) was inserted into distal trachea. The diameters used were calculated from the CT taken before the procedure and modified by the real situation at the site.

A computer tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrated an aortic arch aneurysm, aortic arch coarctation and LICA aneurysm. The CTA also showed a 50 mm sized saccular aneurysm 3 mm distal to the left common carotid artery (LCCA), the left subclavian artery (LSA) arose from the aortic arch aneurysm and the size of aortic arch coarctation was 12 mm (Figure A-C). The patient refused to undergo conventional surgical repairment, however, endovascular therapy alone would not treat all the lesions of this patient. Therefore, we decided to perform a hybrid procedure that consisted of a LICA aneurysm resection and revascularization, carotid to carotid bypass operation and the placement of stent graft in the aortic arch aneurysm to save the LCCA, coils embolization of the aortic arch aneurysm and aortic arch coarctation dilatation. The procedure was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia with full hemodynamic monitoring one week later after admission.

She had refractory anemia as defined by the World Health Organization classification and was categorized in the low-risk group (Int-1) as defined by the International Prognostic Scoring System. A family history of anemia was absent. Our patient is a housewife and a nonsmoker. She is married with one daughter, and lives in an apartment in an urban area. She had a mastectomy of the left breast in 1986 with no recurrence, but no other relevant medical history. However, she developed diabetes in 1991 with resultant renal insufficiency. Her blood sugar control was suddenly aggravated at the time of MDS diagnosis. Hemodialysis had been initiated in January 2015, and she was transfusion-dependent with her hemoglobin concentrations being maintained at 6.5 g/dL by transfusion every 7 to 10 days before dialysis initiation. However, the frequent transfusions resulted in congestive heart failure, and she was hospitalized and diagnosed with transfusion-associated circulatory overload. She was transferred to our clinic for maintenance hemodialysis in February 2015. At this point, her serum erythropoietin level was low (127 mIU/mL), so she began treatment with epoetin \u03b1 at 9000 IU/week plus DPO at 40 \u03bcg/week, which are the usual treatment dosages for renal anemia in our clinic. However, her anemia rapidly progressed while receiving ten transfusions during her dialysis sessions until June 2015; this treatment strategy was based on consultations with a hematologist. She continued to be transfusion-dependent, even while undergoing dialysis and treatment with a mid-range dose of ESAs. In July 2015, we increased the DPO to 240 \u03bcg/week to treat the anemia.

    "original_text": "A 56-year-old male with a history of chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC) was admitted to the hospital for an acute CUC exacerbation. The patient was placed on bowel rest and high-dose steroids. Biologic agents were deemed too high risk given the patient's history of papillary thyroid cancer and cutaneous melanoma. His symptoms failed to improve, so he underwent a laparoscopic subtotal colectomy with an end ileostomy for medically refractory CUC. The patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated and he was discharged on postoperative day (POD) 2.\nOn POD 7, he presented with stomal separation and mild cellulitis. He was treated with local wound care and oral antibiotics. Patient was re-evaluated on POD 14 for worsening pain and erythema. His antibiotic regimen was changed with temporary improvement in both pain and erythema; however, on POD 20 the patient presented with worsening pain, erythema and formation of a parastomal ulcer (Fig. ). The patient was admitted to the hospital for aggressive wound care and intravenous antibiotics. The progression of the ulceration and the jagged undermined border of the ulcer with associated pustulation were suspicious for acute presentation of PPG. Pathologic examination of the wound punch biopsy verified this based on the histologic presence of acute neutrophil infiltration. After multidisciplinary discussion between surgeons, gastroenterologists, infectious disease and dermatology, therapy was expanded to ertapenem, vancomycin, prednisone 60 mg daily and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) 2 g/kg in divided doses over 3 days. IVIG was chosen as adjunct therapy due to the severity of the disease and the patient's history of previous malignancies.

His past medical history is relevant for well-controlled moderate persistent asthma, on daily prednisone (5 mg/day); he had been on this medication for at least several months prior to this event.

    "original_text": "A 4 year old girl was referred to our department as she developed a cachexia syndrome over several months. A brain computed tomography scan demonstrated three brain lesions: one in the suprasellar area, one in the third ventricle area and one in an infratentorial area, together with major hydrocephaly. Pathological examination of surgical biopsies from the posterior fossa and 3rd ventricle demonstrated a PA, with KIAA1549-BRAF fusion but no BRAFV600E mutation.\nComplete surgical resection was not indicated and she underwent chemotherapy according to the BB-SFOP protocol [] from June 2002 to October 2003. After initial stabilization, in 2004, a control MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) demonstrated tumor progression in the 3rd ventricle and the appearance of medullar metastasis. In January 2008, 4 years after completion of treatment, she demonstrated local tumor progression of 3 lesions together with a major infiltration of the brainstem. The three tumors then grew further and turned into a real H/C tumor. She then received 7 cycles of oral temozolomide [] that failed to control the disease. In July 2008, she underwent a partial surgical resection.

    "original_text": "A 71-year-old female came to our institute after falling down from her bed in September 2016. She sustained an injury on her left thigh. She also gave a history of taking bisphosphonates (alendronate, 70 mg weekly) continuously for the past five years. On examination, she was unable to walk or put any weight on her left leg. Her left leg was in complete external rotation, and she was unable to do active straight leg raises (SLR). With the help of an X-ray, a subtrochanteric fracture of the left femur was diagnosed (Figure ). The right thigh X-ray also showed thickening of the lateral cortex, which was indicative of the changes occurring due to the bisphosphonates. The patient was a known case of controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension.\nAfter the necessary preoperative investigations, the patient was taken up for fixation with close proximal femoral interlock nailing of the trochanteric fracture of the left femur (Figure ). As there was no breach in the cortex seen on the right side, no operative intervention was planned. After fixation, the patient was started on partial weight-bearing walking after three weeks. After reaching the required serum calcium, serum Vitamin D, and serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, the patient was started on teriparatide, 8 IU subcutaneous daily injections, along with elemental calcium, 500 mg, and Vitamin D, 60,000 IU weekly, for six months.\nOn the subsequent X-rays, it was seen that the bone was not uniting; after nine months, the fracture was labeled as a nonunion subtrochanteric fracture (Figure ). The patient was taken up for surgery after one year for the same. The fracture site was exposed and after freshening of the fracture ends it was seen that fixation was stable with intramedullary nail.

Subsequently he continued to develop more papules and plaques on the feet and over the following 7 years underwent excision of around 20 skin lesions under local anaesthesia. More recently he developed, simultaneously, a crop of 5 nodules and a large plaque of KS 5.5 cm in diameter on the dorsum of the right foot with extension to the interdigital spaces and toes (fig. , fig. ). He declined radiotherapy due to his difficulty in attending the radiotherapy centre. Chemotherapy with intravenous liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin was not considered because of the significant comorbidities including mild to moderate heart failure. Therefore, in the following order, we tried two courses of photodynamic therapy, imiquimod 5% cream applied once daily for 8 weeks and a cycle of anti-herpes therapy based on valganciclovir. No response was documented. As a result it was decided to administer intralesional vinblastine 1 mg/ml diluted 1:5 with saline solution. However, the patient developed side effects such as general malaise, swelling and erythema of the perioral and periocular areas and tingly tongue after the first injection, in keeping with a possible allergic reaction. At that point, at a bit of a loss for options, we switched to doxorubicin. Following a serial dilution test from 1:20 to undiluted, this medication was used intradermally at the dose of 2 mg/ml diluted 1:1 with saline solution.

Her history included mild hypothyroidism and right upper lobectomy for lung carcinoma 11 years previously. For 2 years, she had complained of shortness of breath when lying in the left lateral decubitus position. She had felt dyspnea after mild exercise for 9 months. Recently, she had a sense of abdominal fullness. Although administration of diuretics was started, her symptoms did not completely improve, and she was referred to our department for surgical treatment. The follow-up chest X-ray showed a gradually protruding right-side shadow of the cardiac silhouette, and the cardiothoracic ratio on the chest X-ray reached 88% (Fig. ). The electrocardiogram showed AF with low fibrillatory wave amplitude. Echocardiography showed an enlarged right ventricular (RV) cavity and mild paradoxical motion of the ventricular septum. The tricuspid valve had no findings of an organic and constructive abnormality, with no severe tethering. The annular size of the tricuspid valve was 50 mm, and the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion was 21 mm (Table ). Repeated preoperative cardiac catheterization showed slightly elevated wedge pressure with mild pulmonary hypertension, although LV function was preserved with a cardiac index of 4.0 (Table ). There was no L-R shunt disease. Computed tomography (CT) findings showed that the maximum size of the RA reached 121 mm (Fig. ). The change in dimension of the RA by CT showed that the size of the RA increased with time (Fig. ). Blood tests showed no liver dysfunction.\nSurgery was performed via median sternotomy. The pericardium was extremely thin on the RA side without any defect. There was no adherence in the pericardial cavity.

In addition, a slightly hypoechogenic polylobed lesion with no well-defined limits was detected in the middle third of the left lobe, 1.15 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion was also classified as TI-RADS 4a. No cervical enlarged lymph nodes were observed. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) diagnoses were follicular neoplasia in the right lobe and follicular lesion of undetermined significance in the left lobe. The analytical study showed that the lesions in both lobes were non-functional.\nAfter two years, the neurological symptoms had not recurred and antiphospholipid antibodies had normalized.

The patient had a medical history of endoscopic submucosal dissection for early gastric cancer 2 years previously, but no other medical or familial history of cancer. Physical examination revealed an approximately 4 \u00d7 3 cm-sized, firm, reddish, tender, indurated mass in the right axilla. No other lesions were found in the breasts or the contralateral axilla. Based on these clinical findings, a preliminary diagnosis of a benign skin tumor was considered, and surgical excision of the lesion was performed to determine the clinical diagnosis. Microscopically, the tumor cells contained enlarged nuclei with prominent nucleoli and PAS-positive granules and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with decapitation secretion (Figure B). Immunohistochemical staining revealed positive expression of GCDFP-15 (Figure B), CD15, CK7, CK20, and EMA (Table ). These findings were consistent with those of carcinoma with apocrine differentiation. An extensive workup including PET-CT, chest CT, abdominal and pelvic CT, colonoscopy, and duodenoscopy did not reveal any other lesions suggestive of primary or secondary tumors, or any clinical evidence of recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer. Apocrine breast cancer was excluded on the basis of breast ultrasonography findings. After excluding the possibility of any other primary origin tumor through a complete clinical evaluation, a diagnosis of PASGC was made. As there was evidence of residual metastatic lymph nodes on the PET-CT and chest CT scans obtained 13 days after the initial excisional biopsy, an additional excision of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, along with axillary lymph node dissection, was performed to obtain microscopically clear margins.

His vitals on presentation were a temperature of 98.4 F, blood pressure (BP) of 159/89 mmHg, pulse rate of 72/minute, respiratory rate of 22/minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. He did not report any significant family history of coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathies. His blood troponin levels were within normal limits and he did not have any new changes on his ECG. He was admitted to the hospital and an echocardiogram was done which showed normal left ventricular function with trace valvular insufficiencies and mildly dilated aortic root (). Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was ruled out and the patient was referred for an outpatient exercise stress echocardiogram, which showed no evidence of ischemia. There were no changes to his medication regimen during this encounter.\nSix months later, he called emergency medical services (EMS) with episodes of stabbing chest pain associated with shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and dizziness. The patient was found to be in VF arrest en-route and was defibrillated by the EMS. On arrival, his mental status returned to baseline and the patient was conversant. His vital signs were within normal limits, and an ECG showed normal sinus rhythm but his blood work revealed elevated troponin levels that peaked at 11.74 ng/ml. An emergency cardiac catheterization was done which did not show any evidence of obstructive lesions, or focal or diffuse vascular spasms except for mild right coronary artery plaque. A computerized tomography (CT) angiogram of his chest did not show aortic aneurysm or dissection.

    "original_text": "A 43 year old female in good general medical condition complained of old resin restorations that had fallen out and increasing teeth sensitivity. She had a dental history of orthodontic treatment and extraction of all of her second premolars. The maxillary right first molar, first premolar, canine, central incisor, left central incisor, lateral incisor, and canine showed NCCLs, and multiple gingival recessions were present simultaneously. These teeth had been previously restored with resin composite on the cervical lesions, but most of those restorations had fallen out (). For the diagnosis and treatment planning, full-mouth radiographs, a periodontal examination, and the fabrication of study casts were performed, and a full-mouth photograph was taken.

An EEG revealed frequent general bursts of rhythmic 2\u20133 Hz activity but no lateralization. His performance at school deteriorated further. He suffered from severe anxiety and became very disruptive in the classroom resulting in social isolation. He was referred to a special school. At the age of 16, he was reviewed by a paediatric neurologist who found him to have pes cavus and bilateral increased tone in lower limbs, intention tremor in both arms and truncal ataxia. No diagnosis was made at that time. His visual disturbance was managed with visual aids until the age of 24 when he had bilateral extra capsular cataract extraction. His epilepsy was well controlled with phenytoin and he managed his day to day activities with support from his carer until the age of 35. There was no family history of any neurological problems.\nExamination revealed nasal speech, severe dysarthria, marked ataxia of limbs and gait and tendon xanthomata in both the Achilles tendons. His carer highlighted the deteriorating cognition resulting in poor memory, concentration and diminished intellectual abilities, all gradually worsening over many years.

The pain was gradual in onset and progressive in nature. Pain was aching in nature with the sensation of heaviness over the right preauricular region. There was no history of diminished or altered sensations over the face. There was also history of intermittent serous discharge from the right ear for the last 4 years. Patient had also noticed diminished hearing in the right ear with the onset of discharge. He denied any history of trauma, seizures, vomiting, fever, or other associated symptoms. In view of these symptoms, patient was diagnosed to have chronic suppurative otitis media and underwent mastoidectomy twice over a period of 4 years at other institute.\nOn examination, higher mental functions were normal. There was conductive hearing loss in the right ear, Rinne's test was negative, and Weber's test was lateralized to the right ear. Facial nerve function was normal.

    "original_text": "A 27-year-old fit and healthy man presented to the plastic surgery unit several hours after finishing a game of football. He complained of pain and burning to both ankles, which had been gradually worsening during and after the match. The patient denied any exposure to thermal or chemical sources, and no similar injuries were sustained by other players. He was wearing his usual boots, long socks, protective shin guards, and shorts, and the pitch was not marked out using lime.\nOn examination, there were areas of necrotic skin and erythema present on both ankles, with the right ankle being significantly worse than the left (Figs and ). The total body surface area involved was approximately 2.5%. There were no burns elsewhere, and the patient was systemically well.\nThe pattern of burn injury was unusual in that it was confined to the distal parts of the lower leg, in the ankle region. This area corresponded exactly to the area covered by the elasticated-cloth part of the patient's shin guards.\nThe patient could not attribute his injuries to any particular cause, and he did not remember anything out of the ordinary happening to him before the game. On more detailed questioning, however, it was discovered that the patient had been at work at a bar just prior to his football match. It transpired that the patient stored his football kit in the bar's basement, near to some cleaning products.\nOne of these cleaning products, containing sodium hydroxide, had leaked onto the kit bag and soaked into the absorbent cloth part of the patient's protective shin pads (Fig ).

His medical history detailed a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome (membranous nephropathy), which had been treated with prednisone for a period of four months. Drug-induced diabetes was subsequently detected one month after the onset of corticosteroid treatment. The patient developed productive cough, pyrexia, and night sweats, and was further diagnosed with pneumonia three weeks before the admission. His medications at the time included prednisone 20 mg daily, insulin and oral cefdinir. He had no history of ocular trauma or surgery.\nAn ophthalmic examination revealed visual acuities of 20/20 in the right eye and counting fingers at 2 ft in the left. Pupils were 3 mm and reactive in each eye without relative afferent pupillary defect. The right eye was normal. Slit lamp examination of the left eye was unremarkable. Fundus examination showed clear media and a creamy-white and raised subretinal lesion located at the posterior pole, with the lesion being five disc diameters in size. Additionally, multiple retinal hemorrhages were seen in the overlying retina (Fig. ). The intraocular pressures were normal in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated a hyperreflective substance located in the subretinal space, between the outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium (Fig. ). Although a further diagnostic workup was requested on the follow day of presentation, the patient was lost to follow-up and presented five days later with reduced vision in the affected eye. On examination, slit lamp examination of the left eye showed mild conjunctival injection and anterior chamber cells of 2+.

Histopathologic examination of the specimen demonstrated a proliferation of single and nested melanocytes involving both the epidermis and dermis.
