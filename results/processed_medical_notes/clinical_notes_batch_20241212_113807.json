The cyst was found 5 years ago during a physical examination, and it was left untreated until recently it became obviously bigger. The patient reported a past history of hypertension for 2 years, whose highest record was 140/90 mmHg. He had taken bisoprolol 2.5 mg qd for treatment. No history of other disorders was reported.\nThe preoperation computed tomography (CT) showed that the middle and low pole of the right kidney had elliptical cystic which had low density with clear border and no enhancement. And there was also an adrenal nodular hyperplasia presented in the left adrenal (). And the patient also had a ++++ leukocyte esterase urinalysis result which equaled \u2265500 WBC/mL. The diagnoses of the patient were 1) acquired renal cyst, 2) benign adrenal tumors, 3) hypertension, 4) urinary tract infection.\nThe patient undertook a selective operation during which surgeons performed a renal cyst incision with flexible ureteroscope. After general anesthesia, Storz ureteroscope was placed through the urethra. According to preoperative CT image localization, laser (1.0 J \u00d7 20 Hz) was used to incise the mucosal wall of the bulging collecting system. There were loose tissues and no clear cyst wall. Ultrasound-guided puncture of right kidney cyst was performed. The incision was about 1.5 cm without bleeding. Double-J tube and catheter were indwelled after the operation.\nAt postoperation day (POD) 2, patient suffered from abdominal distension and pain, with the drop of blood pressure and hemoglobin. Bedside color Doppler ultrasonography showed that a moderate echo mass was in front of psoas major muscle about 5 cm from the lower pole of right kidney. Renal artery embolization was performed successfully under local anesthesia, and renal artery branch hemorrhage was found during the operation ().",

Cardiac and respiratory examinations were normal, and the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was inconspicuous. Two-dimensional echocardiography showed an anomalous left main coronary artery (LMCA) arising from the main pulmonary artery (MPA), moderate left ventricular dysfunction, an ejection fraction of 40%, and mild mitral regurgitation. The coronary angiogram revealed anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA). Multislice computed tomography (CT) coronary angiography revealed an ALCAPA from the posterior wall of the MPA, which bifurcated into the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and the left circumflex artery. The right coronary artery (RCA) was tortuous, dilated, and a rising from the aorta (). The patient was otherwise healthy and had an uneventful life history (from childhood to adulthood), without any evidence of arrhythmic or syncopal attacks.\nThe patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with closure of the LMCA opening from inside the MPA. Surgery was performed with both invasive arterial and pulmonary artery pressure monitoring. After sternotomy and opening of the pericardium, we observed the RCA arising from the aorta, which was hugely dilated, tortuous, and the LMCA was arising from the lateral aspect of the MPA ( ). It was not possible to mobilize the LMCA for reimplantation to the aorta, therefore we planned a CABG with closure of the left main orifice of the LMCA. The left internal mammary artery (LIMA) was harvested and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established with right atrial and aortic cannulation. After aortic cross clamping, cardioplegia was given by two methods: root cardioplegia was given in the aorta for the RCA and followed by left main ostial cardioplegia after opening the MPA ( ). The LIMA was grafted to the LAD and the reversed saphenous vein was grafted",

A bone marrow biopsy done in January of 2012 showed chronic-phase CML. Until then, no mutational analysis had been done to evaluate her drug resistance to TKIs. At this time, she also developed pericardial and pleural infusion, most likely from imatinib, and underwent a pericardial window placement in the same month.\nFollow-up with mutational analysis was negative, and it was decided to retry dasatinib, as she had progressed through imatinib and nilotinib. Dasatinib 50 mg daily was started with close monitoring and plans to use pulse steroids and diuresis if fluid buildup should develop.

He underwent three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and responded well. The neoadjuvant therapy used was according to the modified European Osteosarcoma Intergroup (EOI) Protocol consisting of a two-hour infusion of cisplatin 100 mg/m2 (total of three divided doses) administered on day one to day three and doxorubicin 25 mg/m2 administered over 24 hours via intravenous infusion on day one to day three. Total femur with distal quadriceps resection was performed to achieve a wide and adequate margin given previous surgery contamination.

The largest tumor was 60 mm in diameter and located in the right kidney (A and B). He had no venous tumor thrombus, lymph node metastases, or distant metastases. His serum creatinine level was 0.74 mg/dl. The tumor was too large to perform partial nephrectomy, and axitinib administration was started at a dose of 6 mg/day and increased to 10 mg/day after 1 month. Three months later, the largest tumor had shrunk to 48 mm in diameter, and it exhibited diminished vascularity (C and D). The axitinib dose was increased to 14 mg/day, and treatment was continued for an additional 2 months. After 6 months of axitinib treatment, partial right nephrectomy was performed when the tumor diameter was 44 mm. We resected the largest tumor and two additional tumors simultaneously. The pathological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma, pT1b, Fuhrman grade 1, and negative surgical margins with necrotic tissues indicated the efficacy of axitinib therapy (). The patient's post-operative serum creatinine level was 0.96 mg/dl. He had hematuria in 1 month after the surgery, and transarterial embolization was performed for the pseudoaneurysm.\nTwo months after surgery, several small tumors remained in the left kidney (largest diameter, 10 mm).

She was 7 months post-partum and had no underlying cardiovascular risk factors. On physical examination, the heart rate was 84 bpm with a blood pressure of 115/70 mm Hg. The jugular venous pressure, heart sounds and breath sounds were within normal limits. The initial EKG demonstrated evidence of an acute inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). On coronary angiography, there was evidence of a distal dissection of the left second obtuse marginal (OM2) coronary artery, with no percutaneous options for repair (Figure\nA). During the patient\u2019s admission to CCU, the cardiac enzyme levels including creatine kinase and high sensitivity troponin T peaked at 1340 U/L and 3702 ng/L, respectively. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated mild hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50-55%. As the hematologic and connective tissue disease work-up was negative, the patient was diagnosed with an acute inferior STEMI secondary to spontaneous dissection of the OM2. The patient was appropriately discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy including ASA and Clopidogrel including beta blockade with Metoprolol.\nOne month later, the patient returned with diplopia and numbness of her left arm and face. Computed tomographic angiography demonstrated a focal 8 mm long dissection of the right vertebral artery in its V1 segment with mild associated aneurysmal dilatation (Figure\nB). No other abnormalities were present in the angiogram and repeat TTE was within normal limits.

Corneal topography revealed normal pattern bilaterally. His best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was hand motion in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Anterior segment examination revealed mature cataract in the right eye () and normal findings in the left eye. Funduscopic examination was within normal limits in the left eye. There was no determined retinal detachment but increased choroidal thickness in ocular ultrasonography scan of the right eye.\nAccording to the history obtained from his parents, he was born following uncomplicated vaginal delivery. The parents reported a congenital cutaneous vascular malformation on his face with the color of purple at birth. Family history was negative for KT syndrome and other phakomatoses. During the physical examination, port-wine stains were noted over the right side of his face (), ankle, and toes (). His face was asymmetric and his head was larger on the right side. Leg lengths were symmetrical, although he had skin hypertrophy. The hair and teeth were appearing normal. The remaining of general and neurological examinations was within normal limits. Psychomotor development was apparently normal.

Motor function was retained, capillary and superficial venous return were reduced, the foot was cold, and there were no palpable pedal pulses. The calf remained soft to palpate. There was no history of palpitations or arrythmia, and the patient was in sinus cardiac rhythm both clinically and on electrocardiography. Plain chest radiography and computed tomography angiography (CTA) excluded a proximal arterial source of embolism. Furthermore, there was no previous trauma, (local or systemic) infection or inflammation, collagen, connective tissue or genetic syndromes, or arteritis; nor was there a family history of aneurysmal disease. Positive cardiovascular risk factors included hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension. Baseline haematological and biochemical analyses were normal, as were the renal and liver function. The creatinine kinase was within normal limits. The right foot was well perfused with a palpable PTA pulse.\nCTA demonstrated no significant stenosis in the supragenicular vessels bilaterally. On the symptomatic left side, the tibioperoneal trunk (TPT) and anterior tibial artery (ATA) were patent proximally, with the ATA and peroneal artery occluding in the distal calf. The dorsalis pedis was occluded; however, the plantar arteries reconstituted. Dominant flow to the foot was via the PTA, which occluded in the distal calf (). These findings were considered reflective of embolic disease within the left-sided tibial arteries. The asymptomatic right leg demonstrated dominant flow to the ankle via the PTA. The ATA and peroneal arteries occluded in the midcalf.\nDue to the acute nature of the patient's symptoms, emergent thromboembolectomy of the popliteal and tibial arteries was performed via a medial approach to the distal popliteal artery.

However, due to the increasing size of the mass, the patient underwent a laparotomy 2 years later. This revealed a pancreatic tumor which was inoperable because of the major adhesion surrounding the neoplasm, stomach, greater omentum, mesentery and abdominal wall.

After 18 months, the surgical incision began to produce exudate. On admission to hospital, physical examination revealed a single, deep-seated, painless mass and two incisional sinuses with exudation in the left upper abdomen, without tenderness or muscular tension. Laboratory investigations were unremarkable, and serum levels of carbohydrate antigen 19\u20139 and carcinoembryonic antigen were within normal ranges.

She complained of small nodules in the left parotid region that had developed over the course of 2 years. Her main complaint was of recurring periods of worsened symptoms characterized by the exacerbation and remission of gland volume that was possibly triggered by occasional otolaryngologic infections or unrelated to these infections. These symptoms suggest juvenile recurrent parotitis. Facial panoramic radiography revealed the presence of multiple circular radiopaque masses in the left parotid region (Fig. ). The ultrasound revealed increased volume of the left parotid, with imprecise borders, heterogeneous echotexture with hypoechoic and hyperechoic areas within it. These features were suggestive of an inflammatory process associated with calcifications in the parenchyma of the gland. CT scan revealed a dense mass in the left parotid; it was heterogeneous and included calcifications in its center (Fig. ). Because of the association between the patient\u2019s clinical history, her clinical presentation, and the imaging findings, the possible origin of the calcified materials was questioned. There was evidence of sialoliths or dystrophic calcification associated with recurrent inflammation/infection. Sialoliths are typically symptomatic because of their association with secondary bacterial infections, which are generally treated with systemic antibiotic therapy. Spontaneous remission of bacterial sialadenitis associated with sialoliths is not expected. In addition, sialoliths generally observed as oval-shaped calcified masses or fusiforms on imaging. Because of the pediatric nature of this case, the clinical conduct selected to treat this patient was clinical follow-up and the use of imaging and functional assessments of the gland affected every 6 months or when any signs and/or symptoms appeared. After 48 months, the patient is asymptomatic, without periods of exacerbation of the condition. Recent ultrasound (Fig. ) demonstrates an improvement in the inflammatory aspect of the gland.

Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 114/80 mmHg and pulse of 72 beats/minute. Physical examination confirmed the presence of large tortuous varicosities at the lower abdomen and left groin (). The patient had previously been diagnosed with left common iliac vein thrombosis during her first pregnancy, 10 years earlier, that was only managed with enoxaparin injections. Over the next few years, she developed lower abdominal and left groin varicosities that worsened significantly during her second and third pregnancies without confirmed recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient denied leg swelling prior to the DVT event. She also denied any history of abdominal trauma, other thromboembolic events, or family history of vascular anomalies.

    "original_text": "A 65-year-old Japanese man, with no symptoms and receiving only oral medication for hypertension, underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy for a medical checkup in November 2009. A polypoid lesion, about 10mm in diameter with a deep depression on top, was found on the opposite side of the Vater papilla in the second portion of his duodenum (Figure A). The lesion was covered by normal mucosa except in the depressed portion, which showed tense surface mucosa. The lesion was similar in appearance to a SMT with a central depression. Multiple biopsies were taken from the lesion, but all of the specimens showed normal duodenal mucosa.

Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging showed a solid-cystic mass in the pelvic cavity. Anterior sacrococcygeal cysts that measured approximately 96 \u00d7 114 \u00d7 89 mm were present and reached as high as the first sacrum.

The surgery started from the sacrococcygeal region, with a curved cut of 10 cm in length and 7 cm above the anus. The skin and subcutaneous tissue were cut open to show the cystic wall of the retrosacral mass. The mass was completely dissected along the cystic wall, and a large amount of light yellow, porridge-like secretion was present in the sacrococcygeal mass.

He was referred to our department after magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an enormous mass occupying the nasal and paranasal cavities and extending into the bilateral frontal base [Figure and ]. No neurological deficit other than anosmia was identified. The tumor spread beyond the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, and was therefore classified as stage C based on the modified Kadish clinical staging system [].[] Total removal of the tumor was achieved surgically, using a transnasal approach in combination with a bilateral front basal craniotomy [Figure and ]. The dura along the anterior skull base was opened partially and the cranial base was reconstructed using the pericranial flap. Histological examination of the tumor demonstrated proliferating tumor cells with large, oval nuclei containing prominent nucleoli. Scattered necrotic changes, nuclear fission, and Homer\u2013Wright rosettes were identified. These findings were consistent with Hyams grade III ONB [].[] No neurological deficit other than olfactory analgesia was observed after surgery, however, the patient suffered from meningitis caused by cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea that developed 1 week postoperatively. Because complete eradication of the rhinorrhea and meningitis required 9 weeks of treatment, radiation therapy was started 10 weeks after the surgery. Large-field irradiation of the resected area, from the nasal cavity to the frontal lobe, was administered with a total of 60 Gy in 30 fractions. The patient was discharged 17 weeks after the surgery and was followed-up on an outpatient basis. At the time of discharge, whole-body enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed no apparent distal metastasis or tumor recurrence.\nAt 24 weeks postoperatively, the patient noted numbness in both upper limbs, which gradually worsened.

The patient\u2019s boat went over a wake of a larger boat passing by. He bounced off his seat in a vertical direction and subsequently landed on his tailbone. After the high impact fall, he complained of both immediate lower back and diffuse abdominal pain but did not seek out urgent medical help.\nTwo days after the initial incident, he started to become pale and diaphoretic; additionally, his ICD delivered three shocks over a 30-min period. He presented via ambulance service to a local community hospital in hemorrhagic shock with a blood pressure of 63/22 and heart rate of 118 beats/min. A primary survey was pertinently positive for hemodynamic instability and diffuse abdominal and lower thoracic spine tenderness.\nHe was resuscitated with 1\u202fL of normal saline leading to an improvement of his pressure to 106/88. Initial laboratory investigations included a hemoglobin of 95\u202fg/L, lactate of 6.1\u202fmmol/L, creatinine of 129, and a supratherapeutic INR of 8.8. An initial non-contrast CT abdomen and pelvis showed moderate hemoperitoneum with sentinel clot in the left upper quadrant and pericolic gutter, as well as the area adjacent to the posterior wall of the stomach. An additional finding of a severely comminuted, minimally displaced burst fracture of the T10 vertebral body was noted ().

The patient required crutches when walking, and the maximum distance that he could walk was 50 m. Physical examination showed grade III strength of each muscle in both upper extremities, grade II grip strength, and grade IV strength of each muscle in both lower extremities. Bilateral Hoffman tests were positive, whereas the tendon reflex of both lower extremities was hyperactive. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical vertebra showed that abnormal odontoid in the occipitocervical junction area and severe surrounding hydrops. The atlantoaxial instability resulted in mild AAD, as detected via computed tomography (CT), and the spinal cord was compressed by the posterior atlas arch (Fig. ).\nAfter failure of conservative treatment, we decided to perform surgical treatment on the patient to address the walking disorder. Preoperatively, we performed cervical CT angiography (CTA) to evaluate the relationship between the important blood vessels and bone in the cervical area. At the same time, 3D CT of the cervical region was performed to make a 3D print model of the patient's occipitocervical area (Fig. ). We simulated the depth and angle of cervical screw insertion according to the 3D print model, and finally determined the most suitable cervical screw for the patient. After adequate preoperative preparation, we performed posterior-only occipitocervical fusion combined with intraoperative 3D navigation system.\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a prone position.

Associated symptoms included fatigue, nausea, and decreased appetite. The patient reported no vomiting, abdominal distension, or abdominal pain. She had not recently taken any nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Echocardiography 1 month prior to presentation showed aortic valve area of 1.24 cm2, aortic valve mean gradient of 39 mmHg, and aortic orifice peak velocity of 4.11 m/s, indicative of moderate to severe AS.\nThe patient was initially seen at a regional hospital where her hemoglobin (Hgb) level was as low as 6.0 g/dL. During her stay at the regional hospital, she underwent push enteroscopy, colonoscopy, tagged red blood cell (RBC) scan, and angiography. The RBC scan showed delayed images for tracer accumulation in the right colon/terminal ileum. She was transfused 2 units of packed RBCs on day 4 of hospitalization and 3 units of packed RBCs on day 6. She was transferred to our tertiary care center on day 7 of hospitalization.\nOn arrival at our hospital, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits. She was alert and oriented. Her colostomy bag was located on the right lower quadrant of the abdomen and contained black tarry stool. Erythema was visible around the colostomy site.

Her medical history was significant for arterial hypertension, Hashimoto thyroiditis and hypercholesterolemia. Her surgical history revealed a cesarean section. There were no desmoid tumours in her family.\nThe physical examination revealed a mass on palpation in the mid-abdomen that was easily movable. The physical examination was otherwise normal. Laboratory findings were unremarkable. The level of CEA was within normal limits. A transabdominal ultrasound (US) showed an ovoid well-delineated homogenously hypoechoic mass that was 10.1 \u00d7 6.0 \u00d7 7.2 cm in size. There was a hyperechoic area in the central part of the tumour with posterior acoustic shadowing that corresponded to intraluminal air. The tumour was circumferentially attached to the wall of the small bowel (). An abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 8.2 \u00d7 7.2 \u00d7 7.4 cm mass infiltrating the small bowel. The tumour attenuation was of 33 Hounsfield units and it enhanced poorly and homogenously with an intravenous contrast (). The above preoperative imaging studies suggested a GIST involving the small bowel.\nThe patient underwent an elective laparotomy. Intraoperatively, there was an approximately 10 cm well-circumscribed mass in the mesentery that infiltrated the wall of the small bowel and narrowed its lumen (). On inspection, there were also 2\u20133 small tubercules attached to the serosa of the adjacent bowel that were included within the resection margins. Several similar lesions were found along the distal part of the small bowel and one of them was excised for the pathological evaluation.

Her medical history showed that she had been diagnosed with left breast cancer (cT2N0M0) in December 2004, and she underwent modified radical mastectomy of the left breast in our hospital. An histopathological examination showed invasive ductal carcinoma with nuclear grade 2, and the absence of axillary lymph node metastases. Immunohistochemistry studies showed positive staining for ER and PR and negative staining for HER2 (score 0). She received five cycles of adjuvant CMF chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen (20 mg daily) for 2 years. She then on her own authority stopped taking tamoxifen and ceased regular surveillance.\nWe performed CT scans of the neck and breast, bone scan, and PET/CT. CT scans showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left axillary region and the left lower cervical chain, and PET/CT showed multiple conglomerated enlarged lymph nodes with high FDG uptake (SUVmax, 7.02) in the left axillary, retropectoral, subclavian, internal mammary, and cervical lymph nodes. There were no metastatic sites except the lymph nodes. A core needle biopsy of the left axillary lymph node was performed, and pathological examination revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma, which was positive for ER, negative for PR, and equivocal for HER2 (score 2). She was postmenopausal based on the serum follicle-stimulating hormone level, and she started receiving the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor letrozole in May 2010. She also received radiotherapy to her left chest wall and regional lymphatics including the cervical chain (total dose, 5,040 cGy) between August 18 and September 30, 2010.

Because the ascending aorta was unsuitable for arterial cannulation, the surgeon elected to perform axillary cannulation via the right subclavian artery with side graft anastomosis. The patient arrived to the operating room (OR) with nicardipine and esmolol infusions running through an 18-gauge peripheral intravenous (IV) line in the right antecubital (AC) fossa. Prior to induction of anesthesia, we disconnected the infusions from the right AC and administered medications though an 18-gauge IV in the left forearm. The patient also had a left radial arterial line (AL), and we placed the pulse oximeter and noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) cuff on the RUE. After intubation, we placed a right radial AL, and the surgeons placed a left femoral AL. All arterial pressures correlated closely. Additionally, a 9-French central line was placed in the right internal jugular vein. The patient was cleansed and draped for surgery with her arms tucked to her sides.\nShortly after the procedure began, the right radial AL tracing went flat, and the pulse oximeter waveform was lost. We attributed this to the surgeon partially clamping the right subclavian artery in preparation for arterial cannulation. We switched the pulse oximeter to the left hand and relied on the left radial and femoral AL for pressure readings. Just prior to arterial cannulation, we noted that the right radial pressure returned, although about 20 points lower than the left radial/femoral.

Bloody effusions were aspirated 5 times at a local orthopedic clinic during a 2-week period before the patient was referred to us. He had no previous history related to hemorrhagic factors. On examination, he had slightly limited range of motion, with active forward flexion to 160\u00b0, abduction to 120\u00b0, external rotation to 30\u00b0, and internal rotation to the fifth lumbar spine with the arm at the side. Passive range of motion was the same as active range of motion. Neer's impingement test and Hawkins test were positive. The greater tuberosity was seen irregular on radiography. MRI demonstrated a hematoma in the anterior portion of the subdeltoid bursa and bony erosion of the lateral acromion, similar to case 1 ().\nArthroscopy was performed to determine the cause of the hemorrhage. A hematoma was not observed in the glenohumeral joint. The intra-articular portion of the long head of the biceps tendon had completely disappeared. A bursal-side partial tear of the rotator cuff was noted. The size of the tear was 25 mm in the anteroposterior direction. Crater formation on the undersurface of the acromion and irregularity of the greater tuberosity were observed, which seemed to be kissing lesions (Figures and ). Active bleeding was seen at the exposed bone marrow of the acromion when the pressure of irrigation was lowered. The undersurface of the acromion was coagulated and the greater tuberosity was abraded to avoid impingement (). Acromioplasty was not performed in this case.

Past history consisted of repeated failed excisions and intralesional steroid injections. The patient suffered from local itching and pain, as well as progressive enlargement of the keloid. What was worse was that due to the giant keloid pulling the breasts on both sides of the chest skin, the patient could not walk upright. She felt pain and itching from the keloid and her breathing was also affected, resulting in poor sleep. On physical examination, a large 17 cm (L) \u00d7 8 cm (W) \u00d7 2 cm (T) epidermal mass was seen on the midline of the chest in the middle of both breasts, with an ulceration and small amount of exudation (Fig. ). The patient had a history of hypertension.\nWe considered that the patient had not been treated with adjuvant therapy (e.g., radiation or injection therapy) after the initial surgery, and that the irregular follow-ups after surgery was one of the reasons for the increase in her keloid size. In addition, the hyperplasia of keloids destroys the hair follicles and sebaceous gland structure of the local skin, which results in the sebum being blocked. As well, the itching caused by keloid hyperplasia prompts the patient to scratch her skin, resulting in repeated infection and ulceration of the local keloid tissue. The new wound of skin stimulates the growth of the keloid, which aggravates the disease. Taking the patient's age and the risk of hypertension into account, we did not choose a one-time resection of the keloid, but instead a treatment of multistage surgery combined with radiotherapy. Histological analysis revealed typical keloid features (Fig. ).\nBefore each operation, the resection area was evaluated. After the single resection, the resection area was directly sutured and the keloid was removed",

    "original_text": "A 43-year-old male patient is followed in our MS clinic since 1994 with the diagnosis of clinical definite relapsing-remitting MS. The clinical presentation was a grade 4 paraparesis with no other symptoms; the initial MRI showed typical lesions for MS and cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed positive oligoclonal bands. Interferon beta 1-b was started as treatment in 2003 with clinical efficacy and the patient had a full recovery of the paraparesis. In 2003 a routine brain MRI revealed a new extensive subcortical and deeper white matter lesion localized in the left frontal lobe, which is noncontrast-enhancing, suggesting a tumefactive demyelinating lesion (). There were no clinical changes and imagiological characteristics of this lesion remained unchanged in consecutive MRIs. In 2006, despite the absence of new symptoms or relapses, a poor therapeutic adherence was documented and switch to glatiramer acetate (GA) was performed. In 2008, the patient presented with partial complex and generalized seizures in association with progressive right hemiparesis. A new cerebral MRI () revealed again the large left frontal lesion, but now with space-occupying characteristics, subtle contrast-enhancement, and mass effect, suggesting an infiltrative lesion of glial series. On this basis, a presumptive diagnosis of low grade glioma was made and a cerebral biopsy was performed. Histological examination () revealed cells with clear cytoplasm, round nuclei, and granular chromatin; glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunopositivity evidenced neoplastic cells expression; proliferation index was less than 5%.

He had no smoking history. Medical history included partial gastric resection due to gastric and duodenal ulcers with concomitant cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis at 44, surgical removal of a renal stone at 74, diagnosis of benign prostatic hypertrophy at 76.\nA CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed the presence of a large mass occupying the epigastrium and the left upper region of the abdomen (longest diameter: 9 cm), and multiple diffuse abdominal nodules along the peritoneal surface and below the anterior abdominal wall (longest diameter: 5 cm); imaging confirmed the presence of bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. A small amount of ascites was present; liver, spleen and kidneys were spared. Chest CT was negative, with no evidence of pleural or pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities. An excisional biopsy of the left inguinal lymphadenopathy was performed. Histological analysis showed malignant neoplasm with a micropapillary, microcystic, and solid growth pattern infiltrating the adjacent soft tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive staining of tumour cells for cytokeratins 5 and 7, vimentin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), epithelial specific antigen (ESA), calretinin; no reactivity was observed for carcinoembryonic antigen or Tag/B72.3.
