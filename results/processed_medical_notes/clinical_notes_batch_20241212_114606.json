    "original_text": "A 21-year-old female, who has underwent renal transplantation 1 week ago, was referred to the department of nuclear medicine for renal transplant scintigraphy. She had end stage renal disease as a consequence of nephritic syndrome for the past 4 years, and was maintained on regular hemodialysis. Both her previous right and left brachial-cephalic arterio-venous fistulas had become dysfunctional, and she had been on a renal transplant waiting list since then. A catheter had been implanted in her right internal jugular vein (IJV), and she underwent hemodialysis via this route for 10 months. The catheter has been removed a few days after transplantation. Dynamic renal scintigraphy was obtained in an anterior view after bolus injection of 7 mCi 99mTechnetium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) through an 18-gauge venous cannula in the right antecubital vein intravenously. The images were obtained with a single-head gamma camera (Siemens ecam) fitted with a low energy high-resolution collimator. In the angiographic phase, sequential 1-second images revealed an unusual vascular filling pattern along with patent iliac arteries and transplanted kidney (). In order to gather further information on the abnormal finding, an additional angioscintigraphy of the chest in the anterior view was performed following bolus injection of 5 mCi 99mTc-DTPA through the same venous cannula 4 hours later (). Sequential 1-second images demonstrated rapid filling of the right basilic and cephalic veins followed by the axillary and subclavian veins (). Unexpectedly, two parallel channels appeared and the right heart, left heart and aorta became visible in turn. Regurgitation into the lateral thoracic and IJVs was also noted (). All findings were suggestive of SVC obstruction, which was attributed to the prolonged IJV catheterization, accompanied by blood flow through the azygos system (). The patient did not have any symptoms or signs, except some dilated collateral veins over the chest and abdominal wall that were retrospectively detected on physical examination",

Thoracic and abdominal CT showed no metastases. Liver magnetic resonance imaging was normal. According to the guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, the tumor was considered resectable[]. Abdominal CT without contrast showed multiple calcifications in the aorta and visceral arteries, as well as calcifications in the pancreaticoduodenal arcade (Figure ). In addition to the calcifications, the arterial phase of the CT showed: (1) a focal narrowing in the proximal celiac trunk with a \u201chooked\u201d appearance characteristic of a MAL; and (2) arterial supply from the SMA to the common hepatic artery via the GDA, as well as a dorsal pancreatic artery (Figure and B).\nExploratory laparotomy showed no contraindication to resection. Para-aortic lymph node biopsy showed no metastasis. Peroperative ultrasound showed a large pancreaticoduodenal arcade and a large dorsal pancreatic artery. However, the preoperative CT scan had underestimated the local extension because evidence of tumor abutment on the mesenteric vein existed. We performed a MAL division using a lateral approach allowing for a progressive division of the right diaphragmatic crus on the right side of the abdominal aorta, and the right side and the upper edge of the CA was progressively freed of all dense fibrous tissue. An additional GDA clamping test with Doppler ultrasound monitoring showed unsatisfactory restoration of the liver blood flow through the CA. Thus, considering the tumor as \u201cborderline\u201d resectable, revascularization of the hepatic artery and PD were both postponed. The postoperative course was uneventful. The in-hospital stay was 7 d.\nThe patient received 4 cycles of neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX before imaging reassessment and endovascular management.

A computed tomography of the abdomen (CT abdomen) and pelvis () showed a possible tubo-ovarian abscess secondary to an ovarian cyst or endometrioma 111 \u00d7 118 \u00d7 95 mm in size. Her liver and renal function was normal. Endocervical swabs for chlamydia and gonorrhea polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were negative, and a high vaginal swab was sent for microbiology showed normal flora. Of note, a stool PCR was positive for Salmonella species; the significance of this was uncertain. The initial diagnosis was pelvic inflammatory disease, and she was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and azithromycin as per local guidelines. After three days of antibiotics, she was well and discharged with oral azithromycin to complete treatment for possible mild Salmonella enteritis. Follow-up in the gynecology clinic was planned to discuss the ongoing management of endometriosis.\nHowever, four days later, she presented with an acute surgical abdomen and septic shock requiring inotropic support.

The patient had a history of multiple TMJ surgeries for reduction of condyle fracture of both sides and arthroplasty/coronoidectomy due to trismus. Clinically, the patient exhibited the maximum mouth opening of 8 mm and relapse of severe trismus (Fig. ). After CT scan was taken, type IV TMJ ankylosis on both sides was confirmed (Fig. ). Since the glenoid fossa and condyle of both sides were completely fused, the anatomic structures were indistinguishable. Gap arthroplasty or interpositional arthroplasty could not be applied to this patient because bony TMJ ankylosis in both sides was complete and recurrent. Therefore, we decided to use the 3D virtual surgical planning, CAD/CAM-fabricated surgical guide, and stock TMJ prosthesis system (Biomet, Jacksonville, FL, USA) for total joint reconstruction.\nThe 3D virtual surgery was performed with a specific navigation surgery software (FACEGIDE, MegaGen implant, Daegu, South Korea).

No asphyxia or other perinatal events were noted. He was able to control his head at 5 months, sat independently at 8 months, and walked at 14 months of age. When he was infected with influenza at 1 year and 5 months of age, generalized hypotonia and flaccid paralysis rapidly developed within a few hours on the second day of illness. When he was taken by ambulance to the hospital, his respiratory conditions and heart rate were unaltered, but all of his voluntary movements of the eyes, mouth, limbs, and trunk had disappeared. Both eyes remained open, but no verbal or non-verbal responses were made to external stimuli. Bouncing and rapid oculogyric movements in random directions were also prominent signs on admission. Muscle hypotonia was remarkable, while deep tendon reflexes were absent.

Because neurologic symptoms resulted from the spine fracture, the patient had to undergo an emergency spine operation. Massive irrigation and wide debridement of the right leg were performed at the same time. For the length and stability of the right leg, which was shortened by a large segmental bone defect, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) in the fibula were performed using a 1/3 tubular plate.

In so doing, we maintained the length and stability of the leg.\nTo manage the large segmental bone defect, we decided to use a fibular strut allograft because massive iliac bone graft or autogenic fibular bone graft was impossible due to multiple fractures. Because the allograft is very vulnerable to infection, we delayed the operation after complete wound healing and normalized laboratory findings, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level. Minor debridement was performed under local anesthesia due to mild serous discharge from open wound site. The wound was completely healed after 4 weeks.

Physical examination and questioning revealed that the patient had chest pain lasting >1 hour which radiated to the neck, coupled with chest tightness, excessive sweating, and nausea. Emergency electrocardiography showed sinus bradycardia and ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. This was followed by an immediate coronary angiography that showed coronary artery dilatation lesion with diffuse angiectasia, with significantly dilated vessel diameter at the dilatation site. The maximum diameter of the proximal right coronary artery (RCA) dilatation was up to 8 mm, and all 3 vessels including the left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCX), and RCA were involved. In addition, the patient's RCA showed coexisting tumor-like expansion, stenosis, and occlusion. The dilated coronary artery showed slow blood flow, and no thrombosis was found in the dilated lumen during the operation. Based on the patient's medical history, physical examination, and related auxiliary examinations, he was hospitalized for coronary heart disease, inferior wall AMI, CAE, arrhythmia, sinus bradycardia, and level I heart function (Killip classification). As the guidewire could not passthrough owing to the severe coronary artery occlusion, it was impossible to perform coronary stent implantation. The patient was hence admitted to the intracardiac intensive care unit for further monitoring and treatment. With conservative drug treatment, regular postoperative cryptogram sulfate, atorvastatin, isopropanol fumarate, the patient's condition was adequately controlled. The patient had no history of hypertension or diabetes. He had undergone left varicocele surgery 8 years ago, had a 10-year history of smoking, and consumed alcohol occasionally.

Biochemical and radiological assessment showed features of acute pancreatitis in terms of elevated pancreatic enzyme level, and CT abdomen finding showed edematous pancreas with normal ductal system. It was attributed to hormonal replacement therapy after thorough investigation. Although the patient had stopped the implicated medications, she still had recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis.\nSince there was no obvious cause found for her recurrent episodes of pancreatitis, autoimmune pancreatitis was suspected.\nThen, she underwent endoscopic ultrasound in 2015 which revealed mass swelling at the duodenal ampulla, and biopsy was taken. The biopsy showed ampullary adenoma with high-grade dysplasia (Figures and ).\nThen, the patient decided to go abroad for further assessment where she underwent Whipple's procedure and histopathology confirmed the presence of ampullary adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.\nUnfortunately, she continued to have recurrent episodes of pancreatitis despite the removal of the ampullary adenoma.\nIn 2016, while she was admitted under care of a surgical team for another episode of pancreatitis, she was reviewed by the rheumatology team to rule out autoimmune condition. Therefore, IgG4 level was tested (1.49 g/L (149 mg/dl)). The biopsy was reassessed and found to have increased IgG4-positive plasma cells around 30\u201340 per high-power field with the background of adenoma with high-grade dysplasia. Accordingly, she was diagnosed to have both IgG4-related disease and ampullary adenoma.\nShe was started on oral prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg and rituximab therapy with significant improvement over 1 year of follow-up as the pancreatitis attacks have reduced from around once in every month to around once in every 3 to 4 months after 3 months of rituximab therapy, and currently she remained attack free for around one year.",

He received an orthotopic heart transplantation (HTx) in 1994 for idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Unfortunately, we have no records of the patient's transplant operative data given the fact that his procedure was done 23 years ago. He remained asymptomatic during follow-up except for paroxysmal atrial flutter for which he received a single chamber pacemaker in 2008 and later, atrial flutter ablation in 2010. Patient was adherent to his medication regimen and did not show any signs of transplant rejection on several cardiac biopsies. His post-transplant cardiovascular risk factors included systemic hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and stable stage 4 chronic renal dysfunction (eGFR 23 mL/min/1.73 m2). Serial transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) performed in our institution showed progressive degenerative aortic valve disease.\nAt presentation, his TTE showed degenerative bicuspid aortic valve with fusion of the right and left coronary cusps by an incomplete raphe. The appearance of the valve was consistent with severe aortic stenosis which was confirmed by hemodynamic Doppler assessment that revealed a peak gradient of 65 mm Hg, aortic valve area of 0.9 cm2 derived from the continuity equation and a dimensionless velocity index (DVI) of 0.24. Left ventricular function was normal with an ejection fraction (EF) of 59% by Simpson's method. Further evaluation of the aortic valve and aorto-iliac anatomy was pursued by a Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT). It confirmed the morphology of a heavily calcific BAV, the absence of associated aortopathy, and suitability for transfemoral approach.

    "original_text": "A 40-year-old Hispanic man with a past medical history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was brought to the emergency department complaining of right upper extremity (RUE) weakness and numbness for four days with associated bitemporal headache and generalized fatigue. The patient reported first time use of intranasal cocaine and heroin, after which he lost consciousness and woke up approximately four hours later with new onset RUE and headache. His cluster of differentiation 4 (CD-4) count was reported above 500 cells/mm3 and viral load (VL) was undetectable. The patient did not have any known CNS complications in the past.\nOn physical examination, his blood pressure was 151/97 mm Hg and pulse was 82 and regular. He was alert and cooperative. His cranial nerves were intact. His motor exam, however, was abnormal in the RUE with 3/5 arm strength and wrist drop; the strength and tone of the other extremities were normal throughout. Deep tendon reflexes were normal bilaterally, but his gait could not be evaluated. His sensory function decreased to pin sensation at the RUE and normal sensation was noted in the rest of the extremities and face. Laboratory testing was normal except for an elevated creatinine of 6.9 mg/dl, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) of 7855 IU/l, alanine transaminase (ALT) of 139 IU/l, and aspartate transaminase (AST) of 109 IU/l.

Removing the drain led to immediate severe headache, and we decided to implant a new subduroperitoneal shunt with a PS medical medium valve.

The latter valve resulted in an acceptable clinical condition (Fig. ) with symptoms of occasional mild headaches during the following years. At the age of 14, he developed a different kind of headaches, characterized by short attacks of headaches relieved by vomiting. An MRI scan showed an acquired Chiari I malformation due to thickening of the cranial vault with a subsequent decrease of intracranial volume especially within the posterior fossa, without signs of syringomyelia or spinal CSF leakage (Fig. ). We decided to augment the volume of the posterior fossa in combination with decompression of the Chiari without creating a risk of a descending cerebellum.

The swelling started as a small reddish raised lesion on his right upper eye lid which was later followed by vesicle formation and dark ulcerative wound with progressive swelling involving the upper lid, lower lid and cheek on the same side. He slaughtered an ill ox in his village a week before the start of his illness and he also ate the uncooked meat. There was no history of trauma or surgery. He was given oral antibiotics from the local pharmacy which he took for a week prior to presentation to the Eye Clinic.\nOn examination, the patient had diffuse non-pitting edema of both the upper lid and lower lid with ulcerated central dark tissue. It was not tender to touch and there was no abscess (Figure ). The patient was unable to open the affected lids and it was thus difficult to record visual acuity at presentation but the cornea looked normal. Vital signs were normal and his body temperature was 36.1\u00b0C; and the white blood cell (WBC) count was 7, 800 \u00d7 103.\nWith the clinical diagnosis of severe preseptal cellulitis/periocular cutaneous anthrax/, the patient was admitted to the Eye Ward and started on intravenous ceftriaxone 1gm BID and cloxacilline 500 mg IV QID for 2 weeks and then he was put on oral doxycycline 100 mg BID for 6 weeks. After 3 weeks the lesion resolved and visual acuity was 6/6. There was persistent cicatricial ectropion of the right eyelids (Figure ) for which full thickness skin graft was done at 2 months of follow up. On further follow up at one year, there was lid disfigurement on the nasal part of both lids which warranted surgical correction.",

One month following the mastectomy, a pericardial effusion was identified during an out-patient thoracentesis for radiation-induced pleural effusions. The patient was admitted to a hospital where she was treated with pericardial window drainage of the effusion. She was discharged home on intravenous antibiotics (vancomycin, fluconazole) and analgesia. At home, she continued to use unspecified naturopathic therapies that she had been taking since the mastectomy and of which further details are unknown. Ten days post-discharge, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest at home and was admitted to hospital where mechanical ventilation was initiated and bilateral chest drains inserted. Eleven days later, a tracheostomy was performed. Two tracheal aspirate samples taken on ventilation days 24 and 26 grew C. indologenes. The isolate was susceptible to co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. The patient received a diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia and was treated with levofloxacin.

Associated symptoms included nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, osmophobia, and lightheadedness. She denied having any cranial autonomic symptoms with her headaches. There was a possible positional component to the headache being somewhat better while lying supine and in the morning hours but never any pain freedom.

Examination showed that he could follow and fixate well with both eyes. He had prominent proptosis of the left eye and no palpable lymph node enlargement was noted. The rest of his ophthalmic examination was unremarkable. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the orbits done at that time revealed a left retro-orbital soft tissue mass with minimal contrast enhancement. His white blood count was elevated (15.9 \u00d7 109/L).\nHe was diagnosed with orbital cellulitis and treated with a course of intravenous ciprofloxacin with little improvement. He was also non-responsive to a trial of oral dexamethasone. An orbital biopsy was performed via a lower lid approach. Histopathology showed tissue infiltrated by lymphocytes, plasma cells, hemosiderin-laden macrophages and histiocytes with mild stromal fibrosis. Immunohistochemical staining showed a mixture of B and T lymphocytes. A presumptive diagnosis of fibrosing orbital inflammatory disease was made and he prescribed oral prednisone (30 mg/day) 1 mg per kilogram with some improvement.

Within seconds, she felt burning pain ascending along that limb, and there was heavy bleeding from the site of bite. Within a couple of minutes, she felt dizziness, nausea, and numbness of the whole body, had profuse sweating and frothy salivation, and was screaming in pain from the site of bite. On the way to the nearby hospital, she started to clench her jaw tightly and limbs became rigid; she was frothing and was not responding for about 5 minutes, indicating a generalized seizure. She arrived at the hospital within 30 minutes. The doctor at the outpatient department decided to administer ASV and directed the patient to an internal medicine ward for that. Physical examination findings at the ward were a pulse rate of 100/minute and blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg, and lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with an arterial oxygen saturation of 95% whilst breathing air with no neurological deficit. By this time, the killed snake was brought in and doctors identified it as a HNV; thus, antisnake venom (ASV) was not administered. Even though there was bleeding at the site of the bite even on admission to the hospital, her 20-minute whole blood clotting time, platelet count, prothrombin time and international normalized ratio, and activated partial thromboplastin time and liver function tests were all normal. Urine sample obtained via the catheter showed 50\u201355 red cells per high-power field, arterial blood gases indicated a compensated metabolic acidosis, and serum sodium and potassium levels were normal.

Therefore, she was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy that included adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and herceptin; however, after the first course of chemotherapy via the left brachial vein, she experienced peripheral phlebitis of the left brachium and severe nausea. She underwent CVPC implantation surgery at the right subclavian vein using a percutaneous needle puncture approach based on anatomical landmarks without ultrasound guidance. Chemotherapy administration via CVPC was started two months after the implantation. However, infusion resistance and skin swelling on administration of the anticancer drugs via the CVPC appeared nine months after CVPC implantation.\nShe was asymptomatic; however, chest radiography revealed that the catheter had dislodged, and computed tomography confirmed that the catheter was stuck to the right pulmonary artery and indicated that it was straddling the right main pulmonary artery (). She was referred to our cardiovascular department for removal of the dislodged catheter percutaneously. She agreed to our percutaneous strategy and signed an informed consent form.\nWe initially inserted an 8-Fr sheath via the right femoral vein. We then administered 5,000 U of heparin after sheath insertion and maintained the activated clotting time between 200 and 300 s. As we performed the procedure immediately after the diagnosis, pre- and postadministration were not performed.

The patient had been complaining of increasing dyspnea during exercise since one year and symptoms of chronic bronchitis for several weeks, which was resistant to therapy. No family history of cancer was reported and the patient had no history of smoking. Clinical examination was without any pathological findings except for dullness and reduced breath sounds over the right lung. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a 3.0 \u00d7 5.0 cm intrathoracic tumor, which was surrounded by pneumatocele ( and ). This seemed most consistent by morphological criteria with an extrapulmonary, mediastinal benign solitary fibrous tumor. No metastases where found in lymph nodes or distant organs.\nBronchoscopic examination revealed a constriction of the left upper lobe but no endobronchial tumor. CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy was performed and histological H&E examination at the Institute of Pathology Medical University Innsbruck showed a monomorphic cell rich spindle cell proliferation with mild nuclear atypia.

    "original_text": "A 58-year-old man (fair skinned with a history of sun exposure) presented in 2016 for evaluation of newly appearing scaly red plaques on his left shoulder and left clavicle. His past medical history was significant for not only multiple primary cutaneous basal cell carcinomas, but also metastatic basal cell carcinoma with involvement of the brain, bone, liver, and lungs. The new skin lesions had appeared in the setting of near complete remission of his metastatic disease on continued nivolumab treatment; the successful management of his metastatic disease\u2014prior to the onset of his recently developed cutaneous tumors\u2014has previously been described []. This study was performed and consents obtained in accordance with UCSD IRB guidelines (NCT02478931).\nThe history of the present illness reveals that, in 2012, he developed a basal cell carcinoma on his left posterior shoulder. The tumor was excised and recurred. The subsequent postoperative wound margins were positive for carcinoma, and the site was treated with radiotherapy. Two years later, in 2014, an evaluation of back pain revealed metastatic basal cell carcinoma not only to his axial skeleton, but also to his liver and lungs.

She had a past medical history of endometriosis, autoimmune hepatitis, cirrhosis, and denied any pertinent mental/psychological history or trauma. Her initial symptoms included urgency, voiding up to 5 times an hour, and nocturia up to five times per night. She had no previous vaginal surgeries. Baseline sexual function evaluation was completed at intake with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire where the arousal domain equaled 0.9 (range 0-6, with 6 indicating maximal arousal) (). Pelvic examination was significant for vaginal atrophy but no notable clitoral or labial abnormalities were visualized. There were no signs of prolapse or pelvic floor musculature hypertonicity. She was asked to keep a voiding diary and then advised to attempt timed voiding upon its completion. She was also started on vaginal estrogen and a generic anticholinergic agent (oxybutynin 10 XL daily). After 4 weeks of treatment, she experienced significant worsening of anticholinergic side-effects and stopped the medication on her own. She was then started on a beta sympathomimetic (mirabegron 25mg daily). After 6 weeks of this therapy, she did not have any subjective improvement in her symptoms.

Eight months prior to her current presentation, she underwent radiation treatment to metastatic lesions in the left pubic symphysis and spleen. The patient initiated therapy with cabozantinib, a tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor used to treat renal cell carcinoma, three months prior to her current presentation.\nOn physical examination, she was wheezing in all lung fields and hypoxemic requiring supplemental oxygen. She had prior 12-pack-year smoking history but no formal diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A chest x-ray revealed a small left pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis. Laboratory workup, including complete blood count, renal and hepatic panels, and troponin, was unremarkable. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus tachycardia without signs of ischemia. CT was not repeated due to her negative CT angiogram one-week prior.

He had end-stage renal failure due to oxalosis which had been demonstrated on pre-transplant renal biopsy. He received induction immunosuppression with pre-operative basiliximab 20 mg, with a second dose given on post-operative day 4. Early maintenance immunosuppression consisted of intravenous methylprednisolone, MMF 1000 mg BID, and tacrolimus titrated to a trough level of 10-12 ng/mL.\nProtocol endoscopy and biopsy of the SIT and native colon, accessed via a chimney ileostomy, were performed on day 13 post-transplant. As per our institutional protocol, the biopsies were interpreted independently by two experienced transplant pathologists. The donor ileum and native colon appeared macroscopically normal. Donor ileal biopsy showed a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with activated lymphocytes, eosinophils and plasma cells and evidence of crypt epithelial injury associated with > 6 apoptotic bodies per 10 consecutive crypts (Figure ). Native colonic biopsies were unremarkable at this time (Figure ). A diagnosis of mild ACR was made. This was treated with pulsed methylprednisolone, as per our hospital\u2019s protocol. A subsequent biopsy performed 3 d later demonstrated resolution of the ACR, again with normal colonic biopsies.\nFurther protocol endoscopy and biopsy of the SIT and native colon was performed on day 23. The donor ileum had macroscopically flattened villi and the native colon appeared normal. Biopsy of the donor ileum, from both the chimney and the graft proximal to the colonic anastomosis, demonstrated focal villous blunting and flattening, with multifocal erosion, superficial ulceration with neutrophil clusters and inflamed granulation tissue.

She had complaints of pain over her left elbow joint and wrist joint. On physical examination, her left elbow was grossly deformed, and there was swelling over her left wrist. Tenderness was present over both her left elbow and wrist joints. The range of motion of her left wrist and left elbow joint were painfully restricted. No distal neurovascular deficit was noted.\nHer plain x-rays revealed an anterior elbow dislocation and distal radius fracture with intra-articular extension. There was an associated displaced fracture of the lateral epicondyle (Figure ).\nThe elbow joint was reduced under general anesthesia. A distal traction was given at the forearm. Since there was a fracture at the distal end of the radius as well, the traction could not be applied at the wrist. The traction was thus applied to the proximal forearm, and a posteriorly directed force was applied while the elbow was hyperflexed. Care was taken not to hyperextend the elbow joint as it could have put the anterior neurovascular bundle at a stretch. The elbow joint was unstable post reduction and, hence, was fixed with two ulnohumeral pins.\nThe displaced lateral epicondyle fracture was accessed through the lateral approach to the elbow and fixed with a partially threaded cannulated cancellous screw with a washer (Figure ).\nThe distal radius fracture was then reduced and pinned using five percutaneous K-wires. Two 1.5 mm K-wires were inserted from distal to proximal, and another pin was passed through the radial styloid. Two K-wires were added from the ulnar side to the radial side for prevention of supination and pronation (Figure ).\nAn above-elbow cast was applied for two weeks.
