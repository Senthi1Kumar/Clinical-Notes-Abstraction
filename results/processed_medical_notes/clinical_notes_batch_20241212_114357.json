    "original_text": "A 10-year-old male castrated domestic shorthair cat presented to the author's hospital for progressive wheezing, increased respiratory effort, and dyspnea of 3 month's duration. On the day of presentation, the owners noted the cat occasionally had open mouth breathing and was breathing harder after walking up/down the stairs. The cat was taken to the primary care veterinarian 2 months prior, where radiographs revealed a soft tissue opacity in the trachea at the thoracic inlet. Tracheal collapse was suspected, and the cat was prescribed doxycycline (5 mg/kg PO q12h) and theophylline (100 mg PO q24h) which had no immediate effect on the clinical signs. The cat had an adverse reaction to the medications, causing hypersalivation, vocalization, and hyperactivity causing the owners to discontinue the medications. Following this, the primary care veterinarian recommended a surgical consultation.\nOn initial presentation, the cat was bright, alert, and responsive with pink and moist mucous membranes and a body condition score of 4/9. There was increased inspiratory and expiratory effort throughout the full respiratory cycle with wet sounding respiratory noises consistent with a partial tracheal obstruction.

The primary care veterinarian's radiographs were reviewed and were found to be most consistent with a soft tissue partial obstruction of the trachea at the thoracic inlet. Unfortunately, the thoracic limbs were positioned over the area of interest, making the radiographs difficult to fully assess.\nRecommendations included a computed tomography of the cervical and thoracic region for surgical planning as well as tracheoscopy to obtain a small cup biopsy for histopathologic diagnosis with the possibility for debulking under the same anesthesia.

Five days prior to admission, the patient underwent colonoscopy with biopsies, which showed acute inflammation but no evidence of malignancy.

Based on the interval increase in size of the liver lesions and the colonoscopy findings, an infectious etiology was favored and four drains were placed for presumed abscesses (confirmed with drainage of purulent fluid) and empiric treatment with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole was initiated. The patient was also started on heparin for his portal vein thrombosis 3 days after admission (transitioned to Lovenox twice daily 6 days after admission). On day four, the causative organism for the patient's abscesses remained unidentified and a liver biopsy was performed to re-evaluate for the possibility of neoplasia or an unusual organism.\nThe liver biopsy showed neutrophil-rich debris (fig. ), consistent with abscess, and liver parenchyma embedded in fibrous tissue and scattered mixed inflammation consistent with abscess wall; no peliosis or viropathic changes were appreciated.

Due to the expansive growth there was deviation of the roots of right maxillary lateralis, first and second premolar (), and of the roots of right mandibular canine and first premolar (). The clinical impression was benign odontogenic tumor. Based on these features, we considered a differential diagnosis of odontogenic cysts and tumors.\nWe took a preventive approach to preserve the developing canine. Therefore, we planned marsupialization of the lesion through the extracted socket of deciduous canine to create a window allowing continuous drainage of the tumor content. We treated the patient by marsupialization under local anesthesia, extracting the deciduous canine affected by the tumor. We made a pouch-like opening within the tumor. We then enlarged the extraction socket to form a bony window. Care was taken to avoid disturbing the developing tooth buds. During the marsupialization procedure, we took a biopsy sample to confirm the histopathologic diagnosis. Finally, we inserted a vaseline gauze into the cyst cavity to keep it open and to achieve hemostasis.\nAntibiotics were administered for seven days to prevent postoperative infection. After one week, we inserted an obturator using prosthetic putty. The putty was replaced every week. A space maintainer was used to maintain the spacing from the adjacent teeth.

The child had blunt abdominal trauma due to road traffic accident 1 month earlier for which he was operated at an outside hospital for hemoperitoneum and at laparatomy a large laceration of right lobe of liver was seen. Hemostasis was achieved by packing, which was confirmed on re-look laparotomy on the 2nd day, and a drain was kept in the perihepatic space; no attempt for primary repair of liver laceration was done. The child stabilized hemodynamically and was discharged 10 days after surgery; his parents were advised to monitor the color and volume of the drained fluid. After surgery, although asymptomatic, he continued to drain some 100\u2013200 mL of blood containing fluid from the drain daily and then developed GI bleeding.\nOn examination at presentation with GI bleed, the child was pale but afebrile; scleral conjunctiva showed icterus. His pulse was 108 beats/min and blood pressure on admission was 90/50 mmHg. Liver and spleen were not palpable. Hemoglobin was 6 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase was 400 IU/L, gamma-glutamyltransferase was 180 IU/L, serum bilirubin was 4 mg/dL, and aminotransferases were slightly elevated. Platelet count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and amylase were all normal.\nThe child continued with vomiting of blood and passage of black tarry stools. Upper GI endoscopy was performed after blood transfusion and showed bulky clots in the stomach and fresh blood in the duodenum; no varices or mass lesion were seen in the esophagus or stomach.

He was found to have a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the transverse colon with multiple peritoneal implants. It was consistent with a pT4 pN2 (4/28) pM1 adenocarcinoma, K-RAS wild type. From January to July 2012, he received 12 cycles of FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab at another institution and had complete clinical response. Therefore, it was decided to stop his chemotherapy completely. In September 2013, he again developed abdominal pain. A PET-CT scan revealed FDG-uptaking lesions in the peritoneum as well as in the colonic anastomosis. From June 2014 to June 2015, he received 24 cycles of FOLFIRI and cetuximab with initial response followed by stable disease. In September 2015, he was first seen at our institution, and during a multidisciplinary meeting, it was decided to pursue CRS with HIPEC (oxali-platin 300 mg/m2), which occurred on October 5, 2015. He stayed at the ICU for only 72 h, and had the first bowel movement 6 days after surgery. On the 7th postoperative day, he developed fever with no identified origin, and was started on piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin. At this time, the patient was also complaining of left scrotal pain and swelling. An ultrasound of the testis was performed on October 17th and showed normal testicles and increased volume of the left epididymis with heterogeneous echogenicity. In addition, analysis of the epididymal waveform revealed a low-resistance pattern suggestive of acute epididymitis (fig. ). Although all cultures remained negative, it was decided to switch antibiotics to amikacin for 10 days and doxycycline for 14 days and treat as infectious epididymitis. The patient was discharged home on October 22, 2015, to complete antibiotics at the outpatient unit. As of November 23, the patient was still facing left scrotal discomfort, although less in intensity.",

A complete oral examination followed by a detailed medical and dental history was done and recorded. The oral hygiene status of the individual was fair [Oral hygiene index (OHI) score=1.5]. Medical history revealed that the patient was a known diabetic under medication Glipizide once daily (OD). He presented with a history of occasional grinding of teeth.\nIntraoral examination revealed, congenitally missing teeth in relation to 31, 41. All the remaining teeth showed signs of attrition, without any specific symptoms. Most of the posterior teeth showed class V fillings, which suggests that the lesions could be due to stress caused by the parafunctional habits like bruxism and clenching. Lower anterior teeth in relation to 32, 33, 42 and 43 were severely attrited with inadequate clinical crown length. Teeth numbers 11, 12, 21 and 22 were slightly palatally tilted, and the palatal aspects of these teeth also showed gross attrition, due to deep bite. Teeth numbers 21, 22, 32 and 33 were already endodontically treated as he had a history of pain and recurrent infections in relation to these teeth [Figures and ].\nEvaluation of vertical dimension of occlusion did not reveal any signs of loss of vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO).

She was found to have increased respiratory rate, diminished breath sounds, and abdominal ascites with shifting dullness. The patient had hypoxia, which was attributed to hepatopulmonary syndrome and compressive atelectasis from hepatic hydrothorax. Common causes of hypoxia, including pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary embolism, were excluded during work-up.\nThe patient underwent diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis as well as thoracentesis. Both ascitic and pleural fluid chemistries revealed elevated triglyceride levels (268 mg/dL in the ascitic fluid); therefore, a diagnosis of CA was made. Microbiological work-up, including gram stain and cultures, were negative. No malignant or suspicious cells were seen in the cytological analysis. She was started on albumin and diuretic therapy with furosemide and spironolactone for portal hypertension. The patient underwent multiple paracentesis procedures with removal of about 2-3 liters of chylous fluid every 72-96 hours. Due to the recurrence of effusion and need for frequent paracentesis, with poor prognosis, goals of care discussion were planned, and a temporary peritoneal drainage catheter was placed for symptom relief with a plan to discharge the patient on hospice care.\nDespite the above measures, accumulation of ascitic fluid was very challenging to control. She was started on treatment with octreotide 100 micrograms scheduled three times per day. She received it for five days. There was a remarkable improvement in the collection of ascitic fluid during octreotide therapy. The patient\u2019s ascitic fluid collection improved from about 600 mL per day to 25 mL per day, as shown in Figure .

Echocardiography and coronary angiogram were performed to evaluate the structural heart disease. An echocardiography revealed inferior wall akinesia and an ejection fraction of 42%. A coronary angiography demonstrated a chronic total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery and patent left coronary artery without stenosis. Percutaneous coronary intervention with stent was performed in the right coronary artery without complications.

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed a 10 cm left frontal tumor, which was confirmed as an atypical meningioma following craniotomy and resection (Figure ).\nPostoperatively, he took 400 mg of phenytoin PO once a day. He had no seizures postoperatively or afterward. The patient uneventfully received 60 Gy of adjuvant radiation therapy to the postoperative bed in 30 fractions. Three months after the resection of the tumor, the patient began a trial of phenytoin but nine days later, he developed symptoms consistent with a generalized seizure.

Laboratory studies, including liver function tests, and tumor markers were also within the normal limits. Serological markers for hepatitis B or C viral infection were undetectable. Abdominal US revealed a well demarcated, heterogeneously low-echoic mass 170 mm in diameter in right lobe of the liver. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) during hepatic arteriography (CTHA) revealed early ring enhancement in the peripheral area in the arterial phase and slight internal heterogeneous enhancement in the delayed phase (Figures and ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the tumor had low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and some foci of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Gadolinium ethoxybenzyl (Gd-EOB) MRI revealed no uptake in the corresponding area (Figures , , and ).

He had experienced recurrent oral aphthous ulcers and papulopustular skin lesions for almost 10 years. He also had a history of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. We found that the best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in the patient\u2019s right eye and 20/40 in the left. A slit-lamp examination revealed trace cells in the anterior chamber and vitreous of the right eye, and in the left eye, tender scleral nodules with a purplish hue () and grade 2+ cells in the anterior chamber and vitreous.\nThere was posterior synechia at 1 o\u2019clock in the right eye and at 2 o\u2019clock in the left eye. The intraocular pressure was within the normal limits bilaterally. While the right fundus was normal, there was grade 3 vitreous haze, according to the University of Miami Scale for Photographic Grading of Vitreous Haza (), and occlusive vasculitis with intraretinal hemorrhages in the lower temporal quadrant of the left eye (). A fluorescein angiogram showed mild macular edema with findings related to occlusive vasculitis in the left eye (). The fluorescein angiogram of the right eye was normal. Optical coherence tomography indicated that both eyes had normal macular architecture.\nThe patient underwent a detailed assessment by an experienced rheumatologist, which involved a systemic examination and a laboratory work-up. Varicose veins were observed on his lower extremities. The patient was diagnosed with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease associated with nodular scleritis and occlusive vasculitis in the left eye.

In order to retrieve the IVC filter, the patient was referred to our department. He had a history of testicular cancer with para-aorta lymph node metastasis.

Three years previously, he had undergone left orchiectomy, retro-mediastinal lymph node dissection, and RPLND at the previous hospital. The left common iliac vein was intraoperatively damaged during RPLND. Because the previous surgeon was worried about the high incidence of postoperative DVT and PTE, anticoagulant therapy was continued after RPLND. However, because DVT developed in the left common iliac vein after the initial surgery, a retrievable IVC filter (ALN, France) was placed in the IVC caudal to the renal vein to prevent PTE, and the patient had been receiving anticoagulant therapy. Because follow-up CT after IVC filter placement showed that DVT persisted at the left common iliac vein despite anticoagulant therapy, the IVC filter could not be retrieved at the previous hospital.\nEnhanced CT also revealed that DVT remained in the left common iliac vein. Because ultrasound examination showed organized DVT, an IVC filter was considered unnecessary. An endovascular approach was considered unfeasible for retrieval because two of the filter struts had penetrated the duodenal wall. An extensive discussion with an internal medicine specialist was performed. Because DVT remained with no remarkable changes in CT images for 3 years and the incidence of PTE caused by DVT in the left common iliac vein would be low, we chose surgical treatment for this patient in order to prevent bleeding at the duodenum.\nThe IVC filter was retrieved",

The most notable findings of the physical examination conducted in the emergency room were subdued vesicular murmur in the left hemithorax, heart rate of 125 bpm, mean blood pressure (MBP) of 70-75 mmHg, and multiple wounds to the anterior and posterior chest ().\nAfter administration of packed red blood cells and prophylactic antibiotics, angio-CT of the thorax was conducted (\n), showing contrast leakage from the thoracic aorta and left sided hemothorax. Left pleural drainage and arteriography of the thoracic aorta were performed.\nThe decision was taken to proceed directly to definitive endovascular treatment. Intraoperative aortography () was performed, confirming the damage to the thoracic aorta (at the level of T8) with adjacent tamponade, and a 20/20/82 mm straight thoracic endograft was deployed in the descending thoracic aorta.

The neck and brain imagings showed the disk herniation of the C1-C2, C3-C4, and some lacunar infarction in the bilateral basal ganglion, respectively. The local community hospital gave her routine anti-platelet and antihyperlipidemic medications for the lacunar infarction.\nAfter 4 weeks of treatment, the dizziness symptom did not improve, and the patient was then referred to the department of neurology of the Shanghai Sixth people's hospital for further neurological consultation. She complained the dizziness worsened over the last 2 months and weakness of her right lower limb. An additional brain MRI enhancement scan and brain CT angiography scan were performed. The MRI scan indicated that there was an increased signal intensity of the bilateral frontal-temporal-parietal cortex on the diffusion-weighted imaging(DWI) sequence and brain atrophy (Figure ). In contrast, there was a decreased signal intensity of the counterpart cortex on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequence. Brain CT angiography showed normal.

She was admitted to the ICU and diagnosed with metastasized choriocarcinoma (lungs, liver, and kidney). Curative chemotherapy was started. She developed ARDS, further complicated by multiple organ failure, critical illness polyneuropathy, and bowel perforations, necessitating mechanical ventilation, alternating prone, and supine positions for several months for a better ventilation of the lungs. After 3 months, she was discharged and rehabilitation was initiated.\nOn examination, there was a global atrophy of shoulder musculature, with a fixed position of both shoulders at 20\u00b0 of abduction and 45\u00b0 of internal rotation. Shoulder movement was exclusively scapulothoracic. Active abduction was 60\u00b0 bilaterally, and anteflexion was 45\u00b0 in the right shoulder and 90\u00b0 in the left shoulder (). No neurovascular deficits were present.\nX-rays of both shoulder joints showed an identical osseous mass between the humerus and scapula (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) () and three-dimensional reconstruction computed tomography images () showed complete bony bridges, located in the teres minor muscles. Also, isolated ossifications in the subscapularis muscles and avascular necrosis (AVN) of both humeral heads were demonstrated. The AVN of the humeral heads was thought to be a consequence of the corticosteroid therapy at the ICU or, less likely, changes in vascularization due to compression or traction by the bony bridges.\nSurgical resections of the osseous bridges via posterior approaches in 2 separate sessions were planned, starting with the left, nondominant side ().

    "original_text": "A 57-year-old Japanese woman (gravida 4 para 4) presented with a 6-month history of light but intermittent postmenopausal vaginal bleeding without abdominal pain. Pelvic examination revealed a 12-mm hypertrophic endometrium via transvaginal ultrasound, and endometrial cytology revealed a few suspicious atypical endometrial cells; however, these findings did not confirm the diagnosis of EC (Fig. ). An outpatient endometrial biopsy performed with a curette followed by endometrial cytology also suggested that there was not sufficient pathological evidence to diagnose the presence of EC. However, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis showed the disruption of the junctional zone in the posterior wall of the uterus and suggested myometrial invasion of the EC. FIGO stage IB EC was suspected (Fig. ). The discordance between the findings of the endometrial biopsy and MRI warranted a second endometrial biopsy to obtain histological evidence of EC. The second endometrial biopsy was performed with the aid of an outpatient diagnostic hysteroscopical vision using a 3-mm flexible hysteroscope (Olympus Corporation), but no obviously elevated mass was detected. We observed only irregular gradual eminence on the posterior wall (Fig. ).

His past medical history included benign prostate hyperplasia. He was a current smoker for 42 pack-years. Physical examination revealed nothing significant except for tenderness in the upper and central part of the abdomen.\nAbdominal computed tomography (CT), upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and complete colonoscopy revealed no abnormality. However, chest X-ray revealed a massive shadow in the right upper lung field (Fig. ), which was confirmed by chest CT showing a 65-mm mass in the right upper lobe with chest wall invasion (Fig. ). 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-CT showed abnormal accumulation of FDG in the lung tumor, as well as in a portion of the jejunum. Intestinal fluoroscopy revealed stenosis without obstruction in the distal part of the jejunum (Fig. ). There was no evidence of lymph node involvement and distant metastases other than the jejunum. The clinical diagnosis was right lung cancer with metastasis to the jejunum. Transbronchial lung biopsy revealed no evidence of malignancy. The laboratory data revealed slight elevation in gamma GTP (80 IU/L) and C-reactive protein (0.78 mg/dL). The levels of tumor markers like carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin-19 fragments, and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide were not elevated. Because the metastatic tumor in the jejunum was symptomatic and was localized in a single organ, surgery was planned for both the primary and metastatic sites. Partial resection of the jejunum was performed initially, followed by right upper lobectomy with chest wall resection within a month.

Her first period lasted only 3 days with less bleeding, while the second episode of menstrual bleeding started 8 weeks after menarche and required 10 tampons per day. The bleeding continued for 10 days, and the patient had symptoms of dizziness, weakness and mild abdominal pain.

She had no family history of bleeding disorders, and her parents have a non-consanguineous marriage. A physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Gynecological examination by speculum showed moderate bleeding. Laboratory examination revealed a normal platelet count; PT and PTT; while an abnormal platelet aggregation and altered hemoglobin level of 6.4 g/dL was observed. We recommended the LNG-IUS for this girl, but as her parents refused, oral contraception was prescribed to control her bleeding symptoms.

The patient\u2019s mother stated that the pain was at times throbbing in nature, and child is not able to chew on this side.\nClinical examination showed a badly decayed, lower second primary molar with related localized intraoral abscess, where the lower first primary molar was intact. The patient had poor oral hygiene; he had not received any professional dental care, and was very apprehensive.\nRadiographic examination revealed root resorption and bone rarefaction related to lower second primary molar. The interesting finding was a considerable amount of root resorption of the distal root of the adjacent lower first primary molar (\n).\nThe case was managed by performing pulpectomy\n to the lower second primary molar, with root canals filled with calcium hydroxide paste with iodoform (Metapex, Meta Biomed, Republic of Korea). The tooth was then restored with high viscosity glass ionomer (GC Fuji IX GP capsule, GC corporation, Tokyo, Japan) (\n). The lower first primary molar was not touched and instead monitored.

Following this first transplant, the patient was diagnosed with donor-derived metastatic melanoma. Immediate discontinuation of immunosuppression was followed by a donor nephrectomy that same year. The patient was disease-free without evidence of metastasis for the following 11 years.

After the patient\u2019s symptoms began, her family was worried about with the possibility that she had a psychiatric or neurological illness; following a consult with her general practitioner the patient was given treatment with sertraline.
