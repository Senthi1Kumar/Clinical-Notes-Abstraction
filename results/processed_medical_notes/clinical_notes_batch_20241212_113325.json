She had no history of congenital cardiac disease. Notes in the medical record indicated that she had baseline oxygen deprivation attributed to a historical diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. In the ED, she was tachypneic, tachycardic, and had persistent oxygen saturations around 88% on room air mandating the need for oxygen via nasal cannula at 2 l/min. Upon physical exam, she was in moderate respiratory distress and diaphoretic. Cardiovascular examination revealed a harsh, blowing holosystolic grade IV/VI murmur noted at the left upper sternal border. The rest of her physical exam was unremarkable. A complete metabolic panel (CMP) showed no abnormalities and a complete blood count (CBC) showed only mild anemia. No arterial blood gases were tested. An electrocardiogram (EKG) demonstrated a right bundle branch block, but no other marked abnormalities. Due to suspicion for pulmonary embolism, a CT scan of the chest was performed. The CT scan was negative for pulmonary embolism, but did reveal an anomalous vein connecting the left brachiocephalic vein to the left superior pulmonary vein [Figures and and ]. The CT study demonstrated intravenously administered contrast passing from the left brachiocephalic vein through the anomalous vessel into the left superior pulmonary vein to the left atrium, indicating a right-to-left shunt via the anomalous vein. The anomalous vein measured 9 mm in maximum diameter. Subsequently, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography was performed.

At the time of presentation, he exhibited AF with a rapid ventricular response. Symptoms included shortness of breath and chest discomfort during episodes of AF, which lasted 15 to 120 minutes. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed a lesion in the left anterior descending coronary artery, but subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Notably, mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the pericardial region and mediastinum were observed on the CT angiogram. Three years prior, his left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 55% on cardiac catheterization. Two weeks prior to referral, transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an LVEF of 40%, and the newly depressed LVEF was suspected to be due to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy related with AF. The patient was initially started on rivaroxaban and propafenone by the referring physician. He continued to have episodes of AF and was switched to amiodarone. He was referred to our center for AF ablation.\nHis past medical history also included hypertension and hyperlipidemia. At the time of presentation to our center, his medications included metoprolol, rivaroxaban, and amiodarone. Due to a suspected amiodarone-induced cough and the patient\u2019s young age, amiodarone was discontinued and changed to dofetilide.\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) in our clinic showed sinus rhythm with RBBB with a QRS duration of 160 ms and fragmented QRS (.

Because the extensive zone of injury involved the proximal instep area, an ipsilateral instep island flap was not possible.

He also reported chronic deformities in his fingers, toes, and nails which were present since his teenage, became worse as he grew up, and later stabilized. He denied any pain related to them until this presentation. He also denied any morning stiffness, hand joints pain, recent diarrhea, fever, or chills. He reported drinking alcohol since the age of 12, and he currently drinks 2-3 cans of beer per day. He had no history of smoking or illicit drug use. Family history was significant for similar hand/nail changes in his mother though he does not remember the age at which it started.\nUpon physical examination, the patient looked well-nourished; his vital signs were within normal limits. He was found to have severe bilateral clubbing of the fingernails and toenails along with osteoarthropathic changes in the hand joints (as illustrated in ). He had severe tenderness at the distal end of his legs, tenderness at the knee joints bilaterally, and mild left knee effusion. He had an antalgic gait secondary to the pain. Heart, lung, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. There was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. His skin examination was unremarkable.

The kidney was successfully transplanted to the recipient and normal serum creatinine levels were observed after 7 days. On the fourth day after transplantation, the patient was treated with teicoplanin, cefoperazone, sulbactam and etimicin due to the development of multiple drug resistance Acinetobacter baumannii in both organ preservation solution and drainage fluid. Tigecycline was administered intravenously at 100 mg for the first dose and was given at 50 mg every 12 h from the eighth day after the operation because of persistent abdominal infection. She felt pain at the transplant kidney area and then the blood pressure dropped to 88/61 mmHg on the twentieth day after transplantation. Emergency ultrasound showed two huge hematoma around the graft. Graft pain relieved after emergency treatment including transplanted kidney exploration, renal hematoma removal, renal vascular reconstruction and ureteral re-implantation. The treatment with tigecycline was continued based on the results of the peritoneal drainage, blood and urine culture. The symptoms did not worsen until approximately 15 days after being initially administered. The patient presented with fever, nausea, vomiting and moderate abdominal pain.

It was also noted that the patient was transsexual; he had breast implants. The patient\u2019s past medical history was unknown. Standard operating procedure in such a case is to perform a CT scan without a consultation at the ED. During the second visit approximately 12 h later, the patient presented with psychomotor agitation, mydriasis and tachycardia. His heart rate was 116 bpm, blood pressure was 116/68 mmHg, respiratory rate was 40/min, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 99% on ambient air and auricular temperature was 38.0\u00b0 Celsius. Communication with the patient was impossible because of his altered mental status and because he spoke a foreign language. The physical examination of heart, lungs and abdomen revealed no pathologies. Neurological examination showed symmetrical spontaneous movement of all extremities and symmetrical gaze to both sides prompted by speech or touch. Glasgow coma scale was 11. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia without signs of ischemia. Due to our knowledge of the ingested body packets, we first suspected cocaine intoxication because of package rupture.

His medical history was unremarkable, and no drug intake was reported. His parents reported a palpable non-blanching purpuric rash over his lower extremities that had been present for 2 days. The rash extended to the upper extremities, and the patient complained of abdominal pain on the day before admission. Laboratory data obtained on admission showed a hemoglobin level of 12.5 g/dL, a white blood cell count of 11,020/mm3 with a normal differential count, and slightly elevated IgA (211 mg/dL).

On physical examination she had a palpable mass filling the left upper quadrant and epigastrium. On laboratory examination she had normal levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, carbohydrate antigen 19\u20139 (Ca19-9), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). She also had negative serology for hepatitis B and C viruses.

She had a 39 \u00b0C fever and headache progression for 24 h. She presented with psychomotor agitation, followed by generalized tonic-clonic seizures. She was taken to Axochiapan Morelos Hospital for assessment. On admission, she exhibited neurological deterioration requiring orotracheal intubation and was sent to Children\u2019s Hospital of Morelos, where cranial computerized axial tomography (CAT) revealed severe cerebral edema and uncal herniation (Fig. ). Her laboratory blood tests are presented in Table . She was transferred to the intensive care unit where hemodynamic and antiedema care was provided. On beginning intensive care, clinical data indicated brain death, which was confirmed by three isoelectric EEGs. The patient died in the hospital five days after admission. Serology positive for dengue NS1 by ELISA was reported, and PCR was performed to detect enterovirus in the CSF, with negative results.\nBoth patients underwent anti-doping and immunoglobulin testing on admission (Table ). At the time of interview, family members responsible for both patients were asked about any background that might indicate probable toxic poisoning of the patients, but no positive indications were obtained.

Continued dissection outlined notable anatomic variations in the arterial, venous, and ureteric patterns. No urologic or cardiovascular issues were reported by the donor or family at the time of enrolment in the Deeded Body Program. For this type of study, Institutional Review Board approval is not required for research conducted with cadaveric specimens.\nBoth kidneys were retroperitoneal and similar in size with measurements of 12.3 cm (l) and 12.7 cm (r) in the craniocaudal direction. Despite the fact that the lengths were similar, there were marked differences in the relative positioning of the superior and inferior poles. The superior pole of the right kidney was situated more superiorly. The inferior pole of the left kidney was positioned near the superior border of the left common iliac artery. Although each kidney occupied an extended volume, neither kidney had a pelvic component. Hilar structures entered/exited the organs anteriorly, not with the typical medially projected hilum ().\nA total of five major arteries (3l and 2r) emerged from the aortic and common iliac axes (Figures and ). The superior left renal artery originated from the abdominal aorta and supplied the superior pole. This artery (5.2 mm diameter) branched into two vessels of similar caliber to supply the upper third of the organ. Supply to the left gonad originated from the more inferior of these two branches (Figures and ).

(2) in the pigmented region (fig. ), the sweat glands and adipose tissue had been excluded by increased collagen fibers. under high magnification, many infiltrating inflammatory cells were noted around sweat glands, vessels, and adipose tissue in the deep dermis. on fontana-masson staining, melanin deposits were noted throughout the epidermal layer in the pigmented region.\nbased on clinical and histopathological findings, the patient was diagnosed with localized scleroderma. oral treatment with etretinate 20 mg/day was initiated. the reasons for etretinate selection were that she did not want more children and that acitretin or isotretinoin are not approved in japan. the",

Obstetric history was significant for being a late registrant from a different country, advanced maternal age, and marginal cord insertion. On speculum examination, a 6 x 3 cm nonfriable polyp in the endocervical canal with a small amount of blood was noted in the vaginal vault. She was discharged after complete evaluation for rupture of membranes and other causes for antepartum hemorrhage. A dedicated sonogram was scheduled to evaluate the origin of the polyp. She presented to the ultrasound unit at 37 2/7 weeks actively bleeding with 50 mL of bright red blood in the vagina and was experiencing intermittent bleeding twice weekly since 35 weeks of gestation. On sonogram, a 3,105 g fetus in cephalic presentation with a posterior fundal placenta and a polyp measuring 6.63 x 1.32 x 1.68 cm, with a stalk in the cervical canal, was noted (Figure , ).\nShe was transferred to labor and delivery and was counseled by maternal-fetal medicine about options to proceed with either an elective cesarean section followed by polypectomy or polypectomy and expectant management of spontaneous labor. The patient opted for the latter option. Polypectomy was performed in the operating room as described below under spinal anesthesia. Two grams of cefoxitin was given as surgical prophylaxis in anticipation of proceeding with cesarean delivery in case of prolonged bleeding after polypectomy. The polyp was friable and removed in two pieces. She was discharged home the next day. The estimated blood loss was 20 mL.

A clinical examination revealed spontaneous pain of his left low back and the paresthesia of left S1, 2 lesion. Plain radiograph of the pelvic bone showed osteolytic changes of the left iliac bone (). CT and MRI demonstrated that a 7.2 \u00d7 9.5 \u00d7 3.0 cm tumor arising from the left iliac bone extended into the left side of sacral bone (Figures and ). The large mass showed low intensity on T1-weighted images and high intensity on T2-weighted images and was enhanced by contrast agent (). A contrast-enhanced CT suggested the existence of the tumor thrombus of IVC (). Open biopsy of the tumor was performed. Histopathologically, the tumor cells were small and round shaped and have abundant glycogen (). Immunostaining analysis showed MIC2 positive and NSE positive. The histopathological diagnosis was Ewing sarcoma. Before treatment, insertion of permanent IVC filter was performed to prevent fatal pulmonary embolism []. We performed irradiation (total 31.2 Gy) and total 4 cycles of chemotherapy (combination of VCR, Act-D, IFM, and ADR) because it was considered to be difficult to resect the mass surgically. After irradiation and a 1 cycle of chemotherapy, the tumor volume was reduced successfully and radiologically evaluated as partial response (PR) by both CT and MRI (Figures and ). Moreover, the tumor thrombus of IVC has completely vanished (). In addition, we performed 3 cycles of chemotherapy. 4 years after the treatment, coin lesion of the left upper lung appeared (). Suspected of lung metastasis, segmental excision of the left upper lung was performed. The histopathological diagnosis was equally Ewing sarcoma. 14 years after the surgery, the patient has been remained free of any evidence of recurrence and tumor thrombus (Figures \u2013).",

The patient stated that he did not use any medication.

In the evaluation of the oral and mucosal structures, there were no findings other than erythema and swelling on the lips. Initially, laboratory tests were requested to investigate infective causes and the patient was referred for ultrasonography.

At admission her height was measured to be 139.8 cm and her weight was measured to be 46.5 kg. Her past medical history included NF, congenital pseudarthrosis, and combined deformities of the tibia and fibula that resulted in the shortening of the right lower limb. At presentation, her examination revealed a limited active range of motion at the right knee joint (from 0 to 90\u00b0), a valgus deformity of 14\u00b0 using the femoro-tibial angle measurement, severe pain, and a progressively worsening antalgic gait due to the preexisting limb shortening. These deformities, including pseudoarthrosis, are consistent with skeletal deformities previously described in patients diagnosed with NF. She was diagnosed with Grade 4 OA as per the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classification based on the results of radiographic imaging and the physical examination (). Her walking distance was limited due to pain. Passive range of motion studies revealed significant hyperextension (\u221210\u00b0) consistent with an increased risk for dislocation. The physical exam also revealed peroneal nerve palsy and caf\u00e9 au-lait spots across her entire body, the latter finding indicative of advanced NF. She had previously undergone a bone transplant at the fibula with a graft taken from the tibia approximately 50 years prior; as such, there was only a limited amount of viable bone remaining to support the successful implantation of a prosthesis. As there was not sufficient viable bone stock available to support the ready-made intramedullary stem used in total knee arthroplasty (TKA; ), our initial plan was to perform a bicompartmental knee arthroplasty (BKA). Furthermore, as part of the preoperative procedure at our hospital, we conducted a bone density test. This evaluation revealed a femoral bone density of 0.525 g/cm3, which affirmed our decision to avoid a TKA, as the quality of the available bone stock would unlikely be sufficient",

He spent his first three months in neonatal intensive care unit, where he has gone through some interventions, such as Blalock-Taussig procedure for complex cyanotic heart disease, tracheostomy for congenital tracheal stenosis, and gastrostomy to lower bronchoaspiration risk. Since his birth, he required ventilator support and, despite many attempts, he was never weaned. He underwent chest tomography and bronchoscopy, which also diagnosed the left main bronchus stenosis. Besides the heart and airways double lesion, he has other malformations: grade V unilateral vesicoureteral reflux and anal imperforation. He is on antimicrobial prophylaxis and he has a colostomy.\nDaily procedures such as tracheostomy aspirations cause much suffering, which is manifested by intense sweating, severe cyanosis, and sometimes the need for urgent cannula replacement. Several arterial punctures were performed for blood analysis and vein punctures for peripheral or central venous accesses. In addition, he had to be treated twice for bronchial hyperreactivity with intravenous beta-2 agonist and ventilation under muscle paralysis. Another life-threatening event was a hypovolemic shock secondary to severe bleeding following an airway dilatation procedure. There were two more episodes of dilation by bronchoscopy and a cardiac catheterization, totalizing six anesthetic procedures.\nMeanwhile, his ability to interact socially leaves the health care team amazed. Despite an expected developmental delay due to prolonged hospitalization, he is achieving milestones: clapping hands and sending kisses.\nWe do not know how much discussion was held regarding the limits of treatment before the performance of each procedure, such as tracheostomy and the first cardiac surgery. Currently, the problematic issue is whether to submit him to definitive cardiac procedure or initiate palliative care. The heart surgery involves technical difficulties for total correction, and it probably will not make ventilator weaning easier. On the other hand, palliative care holds many possibilities and they have never been discussed.",

The form of dysplasia of the left hip was type B2-low dislocation according to Hartofilakidis classification or type III according to Crowe classification [\u2013].

Examination of the lymph nodes did not reveal any palpable cervical or axillary adenopathy. The thoracic and abdominal examination did not find any palpable mass or inflammatory skin signs on the surface.\nFacial Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an expansive process with a polylobed contour centred on the left maxillary sinus in T1 isosignal and T2 hypersignal, heterogeneously enhancing after injection of contrast, measuring 32\u00d720\u00d738 mm with extension towards the corresponding jugal soft tissues, the left nasal cavity and the left orbital cavity reaching the contact of the inferior right muscle [].\nA biopsy of the mass was performed under local anesthesia via the left superior vestibular approach and the anatomopathological result came back in favour of a monophasic synovial sarcoma with positivity of the Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) on immunohistochemistry [].\nA thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan was performed to evaluate the extent of the disease, which revealed a tissue mass in the right anterior chest wall measuring 58\u00d743\u00d735 mm with extension to the adjacent lung [].
