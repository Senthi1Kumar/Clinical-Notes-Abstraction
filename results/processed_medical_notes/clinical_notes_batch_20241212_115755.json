On 25 July 2016, he was treated with radical resection of esophageal cancer via right thoracotomy and median laparotomy. The whole procedure was successfully performed. However, from the 3rd day, the patient suffered from fever and the volume of thoracic tube drainage increased from 500 mL up to 1500 mL per day. The drainage fluid gradually turned from clear to filthy with gas and saliva. On the 10th day, an endoscopic examination showed large gastric wall necrosis of approximately 4 \u00d7 4 cm2 around the anastomosis. The patient suffered from increasing sepsis and multiple organ failure. On 5 August 2016, emergency re-operative explorative surgery was performed. We discovered that an anastomosis was located above the aortic arch in the apex of the right cavity. There was full-thickness gastric wall necrosis near the anastomotic gastric conduit tip. The necrosis bandwidth was approximately 4 cm, with a serious pleural and mediastinal abscess. Therefore, we debrided the abscess, resected the nonviable gastric necrosis, flushed the thoracic cavity, and placed several drainage and flushing tubes. We considered that repair or redo of esophagogastric anastomosis was a high risk. Therefore, we resected the gastric necrotic wall using a linear cutter stapler and returned the viable remnant gastric conduit to the abdominal cavity through the transhiatal approach. A feeding jejunostomy was placed by laparotomy and the proximal esophagus was exteriorized by the cervical subcutaneous route. Postoperative ventilator-assisted breathing, continued blood purification, broad-spectrum antibiotics, chest flushing and drainage, and parenteral and enteral nutrition were provided to the patient, who had a fever and coma for up to 48 hours.

This painless mass was firm to palpation and measured 3 cm in greatest dimension on initial presentation. Computed tomography (CT) of the orbits revealed a lytic osseous-based mass arising within the right zygoma (Figures and ). The lesion exhibited a nonossified component within the orbit and exerted mass effect on the globe without evidence of scleral invasion. Based on these imaging characteristics, the primary differential diagnosis was Ewing's sarcoma but metastasis was also considered. Further systemic workup with CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis as well as a technetium bone scan failed to demonstrate other lesions or evidence of a primary malignancy. Fine-needle biopsy of the mass was inconclusive, showing only compact and woven bone, and the patient was referred for incisional biopsy. Approximately two months following symptom onset, the lesion had continued to enlarge and measured 5 cm in the largest dimension. An incisional biopsy was performed of just the soft tissue component and was again nondiagnostic and without malignant cells.\nBased on these results, the patient was referred to our oculoplastic service for further management.

At that time, due to the presence of HP infection, he received amoxicillin omeprazole and clarithromycin as eradication treatment. Two months later, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGE) with multiple gastric biopsies revealed a complete clinical and pathological response.\nIn February 2002, the patient experienced a local relapse without evidence of HP and was therefore treated with three cycles of standard cyclophosphamide, oncovin, doxorubicin, prednisone chemotherapy, achieving a minimal response with disappearance of all symptoms. Three additional cycles were performed but final evaluation revealed the persistence of microscopic disease. CT scans excluded distant disease. The patient was asymptomatic and declined further treatment for 14 months but, in May 2003, an additional course of antibiotics was suggested because of the onset of local symptoms. No clinical and pathological benefit was attained, and the patient was therefore considered for a total gastrectomy, which he declined.\nIn July 2003, he received the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab in a four-week schedule as a part of a phase II study for patients affected by resistant or relapsing gastric MALT NHL. After two months, a UGE revealed microscopic persistence of lymphoma again with the disappearance of related symptoms. A maintenance treatment with four additional monthly doses of rituximab was delivered until December 2003, but the presence of MALT lymphoma was confirmed by multiple gastric biopsies. Due to asymptomatic disease, we decided to observe the patient with close follow-up.\nIn May 2004, the patient became newly symptomatic and the UGE documented a disease progression ().\nPathological evaluation showed gastric mucosa heavily infiltrated by a dense population of small and medium-sized lymphocytes immunoreactive for CD20, which formed lympho-epithelial lesions within the gastric glands ().

    "original_text": "A 12-year-old boy with anorexia nervosa presented with subacute multifocal digital swelling. He had been diagnosed with an eating disorder about 4 months prior to symptom onset, requiring admission to the Adolescent Medicine service for malnutrition, orthostasis and bradycardia, which resolved with monitored feeding. Despite ongoing behavioral therapy following discharge, however, adequate intake with continued weight gain remained a challenge. Over the course of 6 weeks, he developed additive and persistent swelling of the right hand first and fourth digits, followed by the left fifth digit (Fig. ). The swelling was painful and unresponsive to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, there was no fever, and he identified no preceding trauma or illness. Physical exam was notable for fusiform swelling limited to the phalanges, as the joints themselves did not exhibit any discrete effusions. Furthermore, the overlying skin was normal in appearance and texture, without petechiae or ecchymoses, and no other mucocutaneous changes were present elsewhere. Complete musculoskeletal exam was otherwise normal, without other areas of swelling or pain. The patient appeared generally cachectic and review of the growth curve revealed significant weight loss with concomitant stunted vertical growth over the previous 2 years, with a sustained body mass index below the first percentile for age. He had previously exhibited a normal fecal calprotectin and at the time of this presentation did not report any gastrointestinal abnormalities concerning for enterocolonic inflammation or malabsorption. He denied practicing restrictive eating behaviors, but his diet included few fruits and vegetables.

The patient was started on albendazole and ventriculoperitoneal shunting was done to alleviate hydrocephalus for symptomatic relief of the headache. There was immediate relief of the symptoms with recurrence of severe headache on the left side within few days.

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt in situ was noted in right lateral ventricle, which was not dilated. The patient was referred to neurosurgery for endoscopic retrieval of the cyst.

In July 2009, he was diagnosed with UC, initially treated with infliximab, a chimeric TNF-\u03b1 monoclonal antibody for 6 weeks and then transitioned to a purine analogue, azathioprine. In May of 2012, he presented with a second primary melanoma involving his left jaw. After a whole body PET revealed no evidence of metastatic disease he underwent a radical neck dissection with pathology revealing invasive malignant melanoma characterized by an ulcerated Clark Level 5 lesion with a Breslow thickness of 5.5 mm and 15 mitotic figures/mm2. In August of 2012, PET CT re-staging showed FDG-avid cervical lymph nodes concerning for recurrent disease and a left parotidectomy revealed a 1.8 cm lymph node deposit of malignant melanoma. Surveillance PET imaging in December 2012 demonstrated evidence of further recurrence in bilateral cervical lymph nodes. A right modified neck dissection was positive for 1 of 6 lymph nodes notable for a melanoma deposit up to a diameter of 2 cm. Further surveillance PET CT imaging in May 2013 showed an interval increase in metabolic activity within the lesions in his neck, with additional metastasis to his chest, manubrium, and T5 vertebra (Figure A-1). Brain MRI was negative. Given his limited treatment options at the time and after a thorough discussion regarding the potential toxicities in the setting of known UC, it was decided to pursue ipilimumab immunotherapy. Cycle 1 was initiated in June of 2013. Six weeks later he was eventually hospitalized for steroid-refractory colitis characterized by colonoscopy as a moderate colitis with diffuse erosions, ulcerations, and pseudopolyps which resolved with a single dose of infliximab therapy. Further ipilimumab was held and the patient was followed for an additional two months before he was re-admitted for colitis and re-started on azathioprine and IV methylprednisolone followed by a slow prednisone taper",

Endoscopic mucosal resection was chosen due to tumor size, stage and comorbidities of the patient. The tumor was fully resected without complications. At the end of the procedure the anesthesiologist had difficulty with ventilation and abdominal distention was observed (). He had a 128/91 mmHg blood pressure and 70 bpm heart rate. An endoscopic revision was done before finishing the procedure, without identification of any macroscopic perforation. A nasogastric tube was placed and therapeutic strategies to improve abdominal-wall compliance were instituted (changes in ventilation parameters, nasogastric suction, change to a supine position and removal of any strap over the abdomen). A plain abdominal radiography in the operating room showed a massive pneumoperitoneum (). Decision of a nonsurgical management was conducted and the patient was taken to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring. The IAP measured by a trans-bladder catheter was 33 mmHg. Six hours after ending the procedure the patient developed dyspnea and anuria. The diagnosis of an abdominal compartment syndrome was established. Given the worsening status, interventional radiology evaluated the patient. A CT scan confirmed the massive pneumoperitoneum without intraperitoneal extravasation of contrast (a & b). A percutaneous decompression guided by CT scan was performed with a pigtail catheter G14 (c & d). Air was immediately released under pressure.

The patient had a history of blunt abdominal trauma one week prior to his referral to the emergency department of our center. On his initial abdominal trauma, a complete physical examination and focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) was done. The investigations were normal and the patient was discharged from the emergency department. The patient has had vague abdominal pain after his discharge.\nOn the referral of the patient to our center, we planned an abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan with oral and IV contrast. The scan illustrated an IVC saccular aneurysm originating from right side of the IVC below the renal veins (). We assumed two possible etiologies. The aneurysm could incidentally and in another hand it could be related to the patient\u2019s recent history of abdominal trauma. Magnetic resonance venography was also conducted and it also confirmed the diagnosis of a saccular type III IVC aneurysm ().\nWe planned open resection and repair of the aneurysm. A midline laparotomy was done. After thorough exploration of the abdominal and pelvic cavities, a right medial visceral rotation was conducted by mobilization of the right colon and a Kocher maneuver (The Cattel-Braasch Maneuver). The right kidney was left in situ. The entire sub-hepatic IVC was exposed. A saccular aneurysm with dimensions of 4*5 cm was found on exploration (). The aneurysm was located below the renal veins and the neck of the aneurysm was at the right side. The aneurysm was confined to the infrarenal IVC and there was not any associated venous anomaly. Thus, it was a type III saccular IVC aneurysm.

The general physical examination was normal; she had tenderness over C4 and C5 vertebra with sensory and motor deficit (power 3/5) in right upper limb. A right upper quadrant abdominal lump was also discovered during the examination. The patient was put on a hard cervical collar and analgesics were advised. Orthopedicians planned a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of cervico-dorsal spine and a bone scan. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen was also done to evaluate the incidentally found abdominal lump.\nThe MRI scan showed altered marrow signal intensity in right half of C4 vertebra and posterior neural arch with paravertebral soft tissue thickening plugging the right C3/C4 neural foramen and encasing vertebral artery []. The bone scan showed an osteolytic lesion in right side of C4 vertebra with increased uptake over mid cervical vertebra. In addition, there was increased focal uptake on the left side of manubrium sterni. Ultrasound scan of the abdomen revealed a large ill-defined heterogeneous mass lesion in the area of gall bladder, which was infiltrating into adjacent liver; the gall bladder was not separately visible. A diagnosis of metastatic lesion in the sternum and C4 vertebra causing cord compression was made and a general surgeon's opinion was sought for the ultrasound findings.\nThe history was reviewed; she complained primarily of neck pain with weakness in her right upper limb of 3 months duration which was increasing progressively from 2 months.

Her mother, younger sister and daughter also each had a history of breast cancer. At 60 years of age, the patient underwent sigmoidectomy and right colectomy with D3 lymph node dissection for both sigmoid colon cancer (fig. ) and transverse colon cancer. During that operation, lavage of the remnant colon was performed before anastomosis, and automatic anastomotic devices were used. The pathological diagnoses revealed both sigmoid colon cancer and transverse colon cancer of T3N0M0, stage IIA. Both the oral and anal margins of the resected colon had a sufficient length: the transverse margin measured 135 mm (oral wedge) and 50 mm (anal wedge), while the sigmoid margin measured 40 mm (oral wedge) and 50 mm (anal wedge) (fig. ). At 3-year follow-up, colonoscopy and computed tomography revealed no signs of recurrence (fig. ). At 5-year follow-up, colonoscopy demonstrated surrounding flaring and swelling in the anastomotic area of the sigmoid colon (fig. ). A biopsy revealed an adenocarcinoma. The levels of the tumor markers CEA and CA19-9 were both within the normal limits at that time. There were no signs of recurrence in other locations, such as the liver and lungs, or other areas of the remnant colon. Therefore, under a diagnosis of anastomotic recurrence over 5 years after surgery, we performed lower anterior resection. The tumor measured 45 \u00d7 35 mm and was located at the previous anastomotic site (fig. ).

The injury was treated with wound debridement and cast application for 6 weeks. Distal humerus progressed to atrophic non-union, with severe deformity and stiffness of the elbow. He also had partial involvement of radial and ulnar nerves with stiffness and deformities of the fingers of the left hand. He presented to us for correction of the elbow deformity and to gain reasonable elbow and hand function.\nOn local examination, there were multiple scars present medially, laterally and posteriorly around his left elbow suggestive of healed wounds by secondary intention after compound injury. There was fixed flexion deformity of the elbow of 900 with further flexion up to 120 degree was possible (, ). There was partial sensory loss in the little and ring fingers and the muscle power (as per MRC grading) of the finger flexors was 3/5; wrist and those of elbow flexors was 2/5.

She had a past history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, left upper lobe cavitary lung lesion, and microcytic anemia. The patient was on daily oral steroids for the last several years due to poorly controlled COPD and had recently been released from the hospital two weeks before for a left lower lobe pneumonia. At the time of her prior admission, she was started on vancomycin and aztreonam for her pneumonia and was ultimately discharged on levofloxacin for ten days.\nDuring her emergency department course, her chest radiograph revealed a worsening left lower lobe infiltrate which was later confirmed on computed tomography of the chest. The patient had worsening hypoxia during her course and was eventually placed on BIPAP therapy, and she was started on intravenous vancomycin, levofloxacin, and fluconazole for a presumed hospital-acquired or fungal pneumonia given her recent hospital admission and cavitary lung lesion. Prior to admission, she had no physical exam findings to suggest a fungal infection. She was admitted to the hospitalist service for further evaluation and management.\nWhile hospitalized, the patient continued antibiotic and antifungal therapy, and on day two, aztreonam was added due to a worsening clinical picture. The following day, the patient underwent consultations from infectious disease, pulmonology, and cardiothoracic surgery due to her worsening clinical status and pneumonia with associated cavitary lung lesion. Following consultations, the patient underwent a fiberoptic flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage which showed a large mucous plug obstructing the left main bronchus but no associated lesions.

Based on clinical presentation and medical history, intracranial hypertension was suspected. CT scan demonstrated bilateral fluid-filled spaces in the middle cranial fossa (the larger being situated on the left side), with hypotrophy of the adjacent cerebral structures.

She presented with history of persistent vomiting for the last two months, which was bilious and increased in the severity over last few days. This vomiting was aggravated by oral intake and associated with abdominal pain. There is no distention nether change in the bowel habits. She does not have a significant past medical or surgical history.\nOn examination, she looked conscious, oriented, and vitally stable. Abdomen was soft, lax and not tender with normal bowel sounds. The initial blood work shows elevated white blood cells, low hemoglobin, and high platelets. Liver function test showed that alkaline phosphatase was 243 IU/L, Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was 296 IU/L, and amylase was 32 IU/L. Other lab analyses were within normal range.\nThe patient underwent upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy which showed an ulcer in the gastric area and the duodenal area. Multiple biopsies taken from duodenum showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) scan was carried out and showed mild wall thickening of the duodenum with narrow lumen about middle long segment of the 2nd part.

In such a severe case, a specific strategy tailored to the patient was essential, particularly given the lack of success with prior regimens, which seemed to indicate that a more potent treatment regimen was needed in this patient to combat the inflammation upfront. Isotretinoin was initially considered; however, because the patient was not taking hormonal contraception at the time of her visit to our department, this therapy was contraindicated. The patient was offered a gynecology appointment to start hormonal contraception, so that isotretinoin could be an option in the future.

Contrast-enhanced CT revealed that omentum, small bowel and colon were in the bilateral hernia sacs (). After evaluation of clinic signs and radiological findings, we decided to prepare the patient with PPP, after obtaining informed consent for the procedure. A peritoneal dialysis catheter was inserted into the abdominal cavity with a 3-cm lower midline incision under local anesthesia.

Daily insufflated gas volume, intraabdominal pressure and expansion of waist circumference at the level of umbilicus was recorded (). Insufflations went on for 18 days except day 11 because of a technical problem (). We determined that abdominal expansion did not increase any more after day 13 despite increased intraabdominal pressure. Waist circumference at the level of the umbilicus expanded and stayed at 11 cm at that time.

Exploratory laparotomy and resection of the sigmoid colon, left ovary, and fallopian tube with a colostomy was performed. Postoperative deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis in the form of enoxaparin, 30 mg every 12 hours, was given and then changed to heparin, 5,000 units subcutaneously every eight hours, due to worsening renal function. The patient did well until postoperative day 4 when she complained of increased abdominal pain out of proportion to the clinical findings. Her symptoms worsened the following day. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained, the results of which were consistent with postoperative ileus and raising concerns for right colon ischemia.\nThe patient was managed conservatively, and bedside drainage of the superficial wound infection was done on postoperative day 6 with improvement in abdominal pain. On the following day, a repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis raised more concerns for bowel ischemia; however, the patient refused reexploration (Figure ).\nA computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest was obtained for worsening pulmonary symptoms on postoperative day 8 and was consistent with lower lobe pneumonia.\nFeculent drainage around the stoma was noticed on postoperative day 9, and an exploratory laparotomy was performed with resection of multiple small bowel ischemic loops, cholecystectomy, and right hemicolectomy. The rest of the small bowel appeared dusky and friable. After multiple visits to the operating room, she was left with only a few inches of the proximal jejunum.

An intermittent calf compression device was used for mechanical thromboprophylaxis intraoperatively. The operation was performed through an anterior deltopectoral approach. The patient had no intraoperative complications. The patient recovered satisfactorily from general anesthesia and was monitored in a high dependency care unit for postoperative optimization. The operated shoulder was supported in an arm sling support for comfort. The patient was prescribed postoperative opioid analgesics and antibiotic prophylaxis with three doses of cefuroxime. No chemical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis were used postoperatively.\nThe patient was already feeling well on the next postoperative day and her blood parameters were satisfactory. Her pain was well controlled and her arm continued to be immobilized by the sling. There was no excessive oozing from the surgical wound and there were no distal neurovascular deficits. The patient's calves were soft and nontender and she was ambulating well postoperatively. A systemic examination of the patient was unremarkable. However, while being monitored she suddenly became breathless, hypoxic and hypotensive and experienced intense sweating. She did not complain of chest pain and an ECG was negative for cardiac ischemic changes. Her PaO2 was 84% on room air. She was resuscitated with oxygen by mask and initiated on low molecular weight heparin in a therapeutic dose. Despite all resuscitative measures",

The patient revealed that she had got her left upper molars extracted 2 months prior to her presentation to us. The swelling was initially small and had gradually increased to the present size. No neurological deficit was evident on subjective and objective examination. On extraoral examination, an ill-defined diffuse swelling of 6 \u00d7 5 cm size over the left cheek region was seen extending superiorly to the infraorbital region, and inferiorly 1 cm lateral to the angle of the mouth. The swelling extended medially till the ala of the nose and laterally to the preauricular region. It was firm to palpation and was not fixed to the underlying structures. There was no associated lymph node enlargement.\nOn intraoral examination, a diffuse swelling of 6 \u00d7 5 cm in size was noted on the left buccal mucosa, which extended superiorly until the maxillary tuberosity with obliteration of the buccal sulcus in relation to left maxillary molars. The lesion was firm in consistency with a smooth surface, and the overlying mucosa was normal. The lesion was evaluated with a panoramic radiograph and subsequently with a computed tomography (CT) scan. The panoramic radiograph showed destruction of the alveolar bone corresponding to the extracted molar region. The CT scan showed a hypodense lesion involving the infratemporal fossa [\u2013]. It was interpreted as a benign mesenchymal tumor.\nAn incisional biopsy was performed and submitted for histopathological evaluation. The report revealed interlacing fascicles of spindle cells with dark staining wavy nuclei with less prominent amorphous eosinophilic zones representing verocay bodies and perivascular hyalinization. The cellular proliferations were intermixed with large foamy histiocytes along with areas of hemorrhage and cystic degeneration [\u2013].

Subsequently, exploratory surgery was carried out with tissue sampling of the mucosa in the floor of the sinus. The tumor was histologically classified as an adenoid cystic carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for coloring with CD117 (C-kit). This supports the classification as an adenoid cystic carcinoma. Special coloring with Alcian also showed positive and strong coloring in the stroma between the cell layers. This further supports the diagnosis adenoid cystic carcinoma. The tumor did not show perineural invasion. A microscopical image of the tumor is presented in Figure . The patient was treated with radiation therapy intended to cure.\nHer medical history included hypercholesterolemia, macular degeneration, psoriasis and a long history of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome.

These consequences after her stroke made it difficult for her to remain in a management position, which is why another person took this role. Elisabeth enjoyed being back at the workplace again and was looking forward to her return to work. She was supported by one of her colleagues and they had a close cooperation with the OT who came to the workplace regularly.\nThe WRI scores at baseline showed that some items concerning motivation for work were interfering with the return to work, i.e., expectation of job success, commitment to work and work-related goals, and they did not improve during the work trial. The logbooks revealed that Elisabeth was unsure about her possibilities to return to work. Her concerns about how to manage work tasks were discussed several times. Strategies on how to deal with the consequences of her stroke were suggested by the OT. The other work potential factors were mostly supportive or became supportive during the work trial. The AWP showed that Elisabeth had positive changes on all motor items between baseline and follow-up and reached competent performance on all except physical energy. However, on the process items, there was no change in three of the five items, i.e., knowledge, temporal organization and adaptation, and competent performances were not achieved.\nDifferent strategies and aids were proposed and discussed during the work trial and were also successively implemented and used by Elisabeth.
