An X-ray examination and upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examination revealed a type 2 tumor on the anterior wall of the lower body of the stomach. The pathological diagnosis based on a biopsy specimen from the tumor lesion was anaplastic carcinoma. The patient was referred to the Center of Gastroenterology, Kurume University Hospital, for further examination and treatment for gastric cancer on 7 December 2005. The liver, spleen, and tumor were not palpable on physical examination. The serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, and cancer antigen 72-4 were within the reference range. An X-ray examination showed an irregular round ulcerative lesion surrounding a well-demarcated, smooth protrusion on the anterior wall of the lower body of the stomach. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examination showed an irregular central ulceration with clearly demarcated and raised margins, type 2, on the anterior wall of the lower body of the stomach (Fig. ). The pathological diagnosis based on a biopsy specimen was a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed no metastatic lesions in the liver and no lymph node metastases. The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection and Roux-en-Y reconstruction on 25 January 2006.\nThe primary tumor was palpable on the anterior wall of the lower body, and no exposed tumor was seen on the serosa.

His past history involved a high anterior resection of the rectum in our hospital due to intussusception caused by Peutz-Jeghers polyposis (Fig. ). He was hospitalized for 1 month after the procedure. Unfortunately, details of the surgical procedure that had been performed and the reason for his extended postoperative hospitalization were unknown, because clinical records from his previous admission were not available. He was followed up for 3 years after the procedure, during which he had no abdominal symptoms. He remained symptom-free until the month prior to readmission when he began to suffer from hematochezia. On this admission, hematochezia was his only symptom and there were no abnormal abdominal findings on physical examination. Blood test results, including levels of tumor markers, were all within normal limits. Colonoscopy revealed a hemorrhagic tumor with a smooth surface protruding from the anastomosis of the previous high anterior resection, at a distance of 10 cm from the anal verge; a second examination 4 days later revealed that the tumor had disappeared (Fig. ). The biopsied tumor and other small polyps were histologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma and hamartomatous polyps, respectively (data not shown).

The patient\u00b4s medical history was without previous infections, surgeries or other diseases. The mass in the arm presented solid and relocatable. The examination showed full strength in all upper extremity muscles, especially in the forearm flexors, in M. pronator, M. abductor pollicis brevis, M. flexor pollcis brevis, M. opponens pollcis and Mm. lumbricales I and II. No sensory loss in the upper arm, the forearm, the palm and dorsum of the hand and the fingers could be found.\nMRI of the upper arm showed a spindle-shaped homogeneously contrast enhancing mass. It was located some centimeters above the crook of the arm within the medial sulcus bicipitalis. In the imaging it showed a relationship to the median nerve main branch of the forearm or seemed to originate from part of its fibres, respectively. Its diameter was about 11 \u00d7 4 centimeters (). The primary diagnosis from the radiologist was schwannoma.\nSurgical extirpation was indicated and performed. In its middle part the exposed tumour had a smooth capsule which was opened (). In its equator the surface had a good boundary to the surrounding tissue (). It did not extend to the muscles or tendons. In its distal and especially in its proximal ending the tumour showed a more infiltrative growth ().

The etiology of the avascular necrosis was unknown. Approximately one year prior, he had undergone placement of bilateral Osteonecrosis Intervention Implant (Trabecular Metal; Zimmer Trabecular Metal Technology, Allendale, NJ, USA). The patient reported a brief period of symptomatic improvement following this procedure, but his hip pain ultimately progressed resulting in marked functional impairment. His past medical history included type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The preoperative physical examination was significant for an antalgic gait as well as pain with passive internal and external hip rotation bilaterally. Radiographs at the initial visit showed Ficat stage III bilateral hip avascular necrosis with femoral head collapse and the presence of porous tantalum implants within each femoral neck and head (). Serology was unremarkable and no hip aspiration was performed. A staged treatment plan was proposed consisting of Osteonecrosis Intervention Implant removal, intraoperative culture and sensitivity studies, and subsequent total hip arthroplasty once infection had been excluded.\nThe patient was taken to the operating room; the left Osteonecrosis Intervention Implant was carefully overreamed by 0.5 mm using a hand trephine. Once the tip of the Osteonecrosis Intervention Implant was reached, the implant was manually backed out of the femoral head and neck using the manufacturer's extraction device. Specimens of surrounding tissue and bone were sent for culture. A similar approach was used for removing the contralateral rod.

She had a history of multiple myeloma treated with chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplant two years prior to referral. The referring hematology team were concerned with a secondary malignancy.\nComplete head and neck examination revealed a palpable level 2 lymph node but was otherwise normal. A computer tomography of the neck was performed and showed an isolated two centimeter cervical lymph node correlating to clinical examination with no other significant findings. An ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration was performed on the node. Unfortunately, the cytology was reported as non-diagnostic and the patient was scheduled for open biopsy.\nPre operative platelet infusion was required as the patient had chronic thrombocytopenia. The anaesthetic team commenced general anaesthetic induction after the post infusion platelet count was confirmed to be 45 x 103/mL. Although higher platelet levels would have been preferred, this was not possible even with repeated platelet infusions. The ENT team anticipated a possible concern with hemostasis, but opted to proceed with the procedure due to the potential malignant underlying pathology. The expected duration of the procedure was confirmed to be thirty minutes by the operating ENT team.\nA two-centimeter incision was made followed by a deeper dissection. The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) was retracted and a compressible mass was palpable medial to the muscle. Fascia over the palpable mass was skeletonized off to reveal a thin-walled air filled mass that was initially thought to be a possible laryngocoele. No other abnormal lymph nodes were palpable.

Her last menstrual period was 17 weeks and 2 days ago. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a clear gestational sac (GS), fetus with heartbeat and placenta previa. Abdominal ultrasound also showed the GS at a distance from the cavity, with a compressed myometrium between the two of them (). The patient received a MRI examination, showing an enlarged uterus of 13.0 cm \u00d711.7 cm \u00d7 7.9 cm, because of pieces of evidence. The MRI demonstrated a foetus with clear organs (), and compressed the lower uterine segment (). The GS was not connected with the uterine cavity and endometrium, but embedded into the myometrium in the right posterior wall of the uterine. A linear hypointensity of the junction zone was observed between the GS and the uterine cavity on T2weighted image ().\nThis result is likely to be placenta implantation as the myometrium cannot be separated from the placenta. The patient was at risk of the uterine rupture and life- threatening haemorrhage. Emergent management should be performed. Performing uterine artery embolization (UAE) and interventional therapy is inadvisable because of the obstructing myometrium between the cervix and placenta. Employing a surgical exploration of the abdomen was decided that was undertaken under temporary balloon occlusion of the abdominal aorta to reduce the loss of blood. The balloon was placed in the abdominal aorta between the opening of renal artery and iliac artery just before the operation. If the area of the focal damage was heavy, the subtotal hysterectomy or hysterectomy was needed. Otherwise, clinicians can perform excision by laparotomy and hysteroplasty. Given the age of patient, clinicians did their best to perform hysteroplasty instead of hysterectomy.

Clinical evaluation revealed arterial hypertension and renal failure. A kidney biopsy was not diagnostic. In February 1989, she was started on chronic haemodialysis three times weekly. In 1991, she received a kidney transplant from a cadaveric donor. In 1997, she developed a non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Chemotherapy for one year lead to a complete remission of the lymphoma. In March 1999, she developed aseptic necrosis of the femoral head which was treated surgically. In June 1999, as she developed progressive deterioration of the transplanted kidney function, haemodialysis three times weekly was restarted. In October 1999, the transplanted kidney was removed and during surgery, she developed thrombosis of the left central retinal vein. Laboratory investigations in December 2000 revealed elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 282 pg/mL (normal range 14\u201372 pg/mL). At the same time, she noted a swelling in the right side of the maxilla.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 23-year-old woman who visited a dentoalveolar trauma clinic six months after a fall. The patient remembered being referred to a hospital and receiving initial care after the accident. An intraoral examination revealed the presence of rigid splint involving the maxillary incisors and canines. The left maxillary lateral incisor had a temporary crown\nmade of composite resin without an intra-canal retainer; the other three maxillary incisors had crowns that were otherwise healthy. Radiographic examination revealed complete root formation in the involved teeth, a root fracture in the cervical third of the right maxillary lateral incisor (), and a fracture in the middle third of the maxillary central incisors (). All teeth had positive response to pulp sensitivity tests.\nDuring a second visit, the patient underwent endodontic treatment in the right maxillary lateral incisor to allow for the installation of a root canal seal and for prosthetic rehabilitation of the crown. During the first six months, monthly radiographic and clinical controls of all the involved teeth were performed. Dental splint was maintained for 12 months because of the right maxillary lateral incisor fracture.\nAt the time of splint removal, the teeth did not show increased mobility. The maxillary central incisors and right maxillary lateral incisor showed positive responses to pulp sensitivity tests. Annual controls were performed until 2009.

She also had ipsilateral selective neck dissection of levels I to IV, as well as a tracheostomy. Pathology revealed poorly differentiated malignant melanoma of the maxillary gingiva and hard palate, measuring 2 cm in largest dimension, with an invasion of the maxillary bone at the last molar, as well as satellitosis (more than five atypical mitoses were observed at high power field; mutation for BRAF was negative). The resection margins were clear; the closest margin was to the anterior tonsillar pillar at 10 mm. Out of the 25 lymph nodes dissected, one harbored a focus of melanoma measuring 1 mm, without extra-nodal extension. The pathological staging was thus pT4a pN1.\nShe was then seen by radiation oncology and underwent a course of adjuvant therapy of 50 Gy in 20 fractions between October to November 2015.

On weaning, he fed mainly on cow\u2019s milk and hardly took any solid feeds from the family diet.\nAt approximately 1 year of age, he developed progressive abdominal distension despite low intake of feeds. There was no swelling in any other part of his body, no yellow discoloration of mucus membranes, and no seizures. He was HIV seronegative; there was no history of other chronic illnesses, and he was fully immunized.

He is the seventh born child in a family of eight children. There is history of the death of two siblings. The first born was a boy delivered preterm who died at the age of 2 years 7 months with poor development and weight gain, and he had seizures at the time of death. The sixth born, a boy, with normal birth weight (3.2 kg) died at 1 year with a weight of 5 kg and he also had seizures. The other five siblings are alive and growing well.\nA physical examination of this boy at 11 months revealed that he was small for age with a doll-like face; weight was 4.7 kg (weight for age Z-score \u2212 5.41 SD); length was 62.5 cm (length for age Z-score \u2212 4.47 SD",

The pre-eclampsia was treated with intravenously administered magnesium sulfate (at admission) and methyldopa 750 mg 3 times daily and she received corticosteroids for accelerating fetal lung maturation. An ultrasound showed an intrauterine growth-restricted child in head position with an estimated fetal weight of 1047 gr and oligohydramnios.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 69-year-old Caucasian man without a history of mental illness or any previous psychiatric treatment. He was initially transferred to a medical emergency department with marked dyspnoeic symptoms and tachycardia, where an acute coronary syndrome was diagnosed. After laboratory testing and an electrocardiogram a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) was diagnosed. The following coronary angiography (an intervention that was endured by the patient with enormous dread), revealed severe three-vessel disease.\nThe patient was informed of the urgent indication of a bypass operation, which was planned as an emergency intervention on the same day. At the end of the angiographic intervention, this information caused a severe panic reaction with hyperventilation, tachycardia and the feeling of loss of control, which was successfully treated with benzodiazepines. He described an intensely irrational and unavoidable fear of putting himself in the hands of others -surgeons and anaesthetists in this case. Moreover, the fear of losing control of his body through loss of consciousness or compromise of physical integrity during an operation or surgical intervention was reported.

The patient was diagnosed with pilon fracture (type AO-43-C2) and lateral malleolus fracture of the right limb according to the X-ray and CT scans (Fig. A, B), after which calcaneal traction was applied. Five days after injury, physical examination revealed mild swelling of the right ankle and no tension blisters. The anterior and posterior tibial arteries could be palpable without hemodynamic disorders and paresthesia. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the fracture under general anesthesia (Fig. C). It required approximately 5 hours for the surgical procedure because of the difficulty of reduction. The incision could not be closed completely after surgery; thus, vacuum sealing drainage (VSD), a type of negative pressure wound therapy, was used for wound closure.

He was suffering from severe epigastric pain and nausea for two days. Because the laboratory findings were suspicious for pancreatitis, the patient underwent computed tomography (CT) (Fig. ). The examination showed an edematous pancreas tail and fluid in the anterior prerenal space and in the anterior, posterior and lateroconal fascia. There were no signs of chronic pancreatitis or vascular complications. In the following months the patient had two similar episodes of acute tail pancreatitis.\nIn September 2009 he presented with vague epigastric pain of several weeks duration. Serum amylase and lipase levels were normal, however the cholestatic parameters were mildly elevated. Therefore, a magnetic resonance (MR) study was performed. The examination demonstrated moderate chronic pancreatitis of the tail with atrophy and irregular bording of the Wirsung\u2019s duct. There were no other abnormalities. Further examinations also revealed a Helicobacter pylori gastritis.\nIn February 2012 the patient presented again to the gastroenterologist with epigastric and left upper quadrant pain. Laboratory findings were not suspect for acute pancreatitis. However, contrast-enhanced CT scan was performed in order to evaluate the known chronic pancreatitis and other causes of pain (Fig. ). This study surprisingly revealed a hypervascular lesion in the pancreatic tail consisting of a conglomeration of small hypervascular spots and blood vessels.

He was initially noted to have a lung nodule on a surveillance computed tomography (CT) scan for abdominal aortic aneurysm. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan was done, which demonstrated a metabolically active right lower lobe lesion measuring 9.1 x 3.9 centimeter with an extension to the hilum. Enlarged right paratracheal lymph nodes were also noted be metabolically active. He underwent endobronchial ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration of the mass and mediastinal lymph nodes. Results were consistent with squamous cell carcinoma with metastases in the lymph nodes. The pathological diagnosis was T3N2M0 stage IIIa squamous cell lung carcinoma. PET scan at the time did not demonstrate any evidence of extra thoracic metastatic disease and therefore he was advised to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by restaging of mediastinum for consideration of curative surgical resection. The patient was deemed to be of good functional status and started on paclitaxel, carboplatin. After a single course of chemotherapy, he was hospitalized with near fatal sepsis. He was treated with intravenous (IV) vancomycin and Zosyn, followed by levofloxacin to complete a fourteen- day course.

The patient had no family history of any colorectal or genitourinary cancer.

A subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis showed T3N1 rectal cancer, with intact muscularis mucosa, and an enlarged presacral lymph node. A suspicious peripheral prostatic enlargement with a left iliac crest sclerotic bone lesion was incidentally found.\nGiven the incidental finding of prostatic enlargement and possible sclerotic bone lesion of the left iliac crest appearing quite suspicious, an FDG-PET scan was done and confirmed the primary rectal tumor with a presacral lymph node, but did not reveal any increased uptake in the prostate or iliac crest (). Prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test was subsequently done that was elevated at 37 ng/mL. Due to high suspicion of a new concurrent primary prostate cancer, a biopsy was taken that revealed prostatic adenocarcinoma. PSMA-PET was then performed to identify any potential metastases from this primary site. PSMA-PET revealed increased uptake in the prostate, which was not previously detected by FDG-PET ().

A computed tomography (CT) scan of his chest was performed and showed lymphadenopathy in his whole body, including axillar, hilar, mediastinal, and retroperitoneal regions (). The patient was suspected of having malignant lymphoma and underwent excisional biopsy in his right groin. One week after the biopsy, he suddenly presented with a complaint of acute abdominal pain. An emergency contrast enhanced CT scan was performed and revealed a massive retroperitoneal hematoma. Consequently, he was transferred to our hospital for the suspicion of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nUpon arrival, he was drowsy, pale, and complained of progressively worsening abdominal pain. His blood pressure was 90/50 mmHg, the pulse rate was 110 beats/min, the hemoglobin was 10.0 g/dL, and the oxygen saturation was 99%. He had no past history of hypertension. A contrast enhanced CT scan was performed repeatedly and revealed a massive retroperitoneal hematoma with active extravasation arising from the infrarenal abdominal aorta coexisting with an extensive retroperitoneal mass surrounding the aorta (). The aorta appeared to be almost of normal caliber, with slight expansion. Radiologic interpretations by a specialist pointed out the density difference between the hematoma and the periaortic soft tissue in the retroperitoneal lesion. As a result, we suspected abdominal aortic rupture caused by invasion by the malignant lymphoma and decided to perform an emergency operation. Considering the risk of tight adhesion between the aorta and the lymphoid tissues, conventional open repair could have been technically difficult.

He sought emergency care at a hospital in response to a sudden increase in the intensity of the pain combined with swelling at the site of pain. He had a history of smoking equating to approximately 37 pack years. He did not have any other comorbidities. On physical examination he was slightly pale, with tachycardia (120 bpm) and blood pressure at 100 x 70 mmHg. Physical examination by segments was unremarkable for the head and neck, thorax, and abdomen. Vascular examination of the right lower limb found normal auscultation and visual inspection results, with all pulses present and normal. The left lower limb was well-perfused, but there was ecchymosis and a pulsatile swelling between the mid and distal thirds of the thigh, in the anteromedial region ( a). Inspection of the left foot also revealed signs of distal microembolization ( b) and popliteal and distal pulses were absent.\nUltrasonography of the left thigh showed an aneurysmal dilatation of the SFA measuring 5.8 x 5.3 cm and with associated mural thrombi and perivascular accumulations compatible with a ruptured aneurysm ( ). Since angiotomography was not available at the service providing care, the decision was taken to perform emergency surgical treatment.\nDuring the procedure, extensive hematoma was observed involving subcutaneous and muscle tissues in the anteromedial region of the thigh. Once this had been removed, the ruptured SFA aneurysm could be seen ( 3b). There were no obvious signs of active infection. Proximal and distal ligatures were performed and then the aneurysm was resected and samples collected for anatomopathological and microbiological analyses.

Intraoperatively, the vascular pedicle comprising of portal vein, hepatic artery and the common bile duct got injured. It was repaired with the help of a vascular team. The portal vein was sutured with eight zero prolene. The hepatic artery was stented with 1 mm coronary stent and sutured with interrupted eight zero prolene A choledochoduodenostomy was done. The warm ischemic time was 45 min. The child needed massive transfusion and nearly 350 ml of blood was transfused during the procedure.\nThe child was electively ventilated for 3 days. The liver enzymes were elevated in the immediate postoperative period. Liver protective agent N acetyl cystine at the dose of 100 mg daily was infused for 6 days with supportive measures. The child recovered completely and the liver enzymes decreased and the alpha fetoprotein level dropped to 40 units. The child was discharged on the 12th postoperative day with Ursodeoxycholic acid.

Vascular examination of the right lower limb found normal auscultation and visual inspection results, with all pulses present and normal. The left lower limb was well-perfused, but there was ecchymosis and a pulsatile swelling between the mid and distal thirds of the thigh, in the anteromedial region ( a). Inspection of the left foot also revealed signs of distal microembolization ( b) and popliteal and distal pulses were absent.\nUltrasonography of the left thigh showed an aneurysmal dilatation of the SFA measuring 5.8 x 5.3 cm and with associated mural thrombi and perivascular accumulations compatible with a ruptured aneurysm ( ). Since angiotomography was not available at the service providing care, the decision was taken to perform emergency surgical treatment.\nDuring the procedure, extensive hematoma was observed involving subcutaneous and muscle tissues in the anteromedial region of the thigh.

His past medical history included multiple comorbidities: diabetes, chronic renal failure, alcoholic cirrhosis Child A, complete heart blockade and thrombocytopenia of unknown etiology. An upper endoscopy and biopsy revealed a well-differentiated intestinal type adenocarcinoma in the antrum. Endoscopic ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic, 3.2 cm neoplasm, without muscularis externa infiltration and reactive ganglia (). Endoscopic mucosal resection was chosen due to tumor size, stage and comorbidities of the patient. The tumor was fully resected without complications. At the end of the procedure the anesthesiologist had difficulty with ventilation and abdominal distention was observed (). He had a 128/91 mmHg blood pressure and 70 bpm heart rate. An endoscopic revision was done before finishing the procedure, without identification of any macroscopic perforation. A nasogastric tube was placed and therapeutic strategies to improve abdominal-wall compliance were instituted (changes in ventilation parameters, nasogastric suction, change to a supine position and removal of any strap over the abdomen). A plain abdominal radiography in the operating room showed a massive pneumoperitoneum ().

About 10 days earlier, she suffered a superficial burn to her back and was admitted into the local hospital because of acute renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis. On neurologic examination, the patient was alert but mildly disoriented. Examination of the motor system revealed intact muscle strength in the upper extremity and flaccid paraplegia with areflexia. An examination of the sensory system revealed that all sensory modalities had decreased below the T10 dermatome level. An abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated a suspicious pyogenic spondylitis of multiple lumbar spines with multiple perivertebral abscess formation and fluid collections around the pyriform muscles and parasacral area. A drainage catheter was inserted by a radiologist and the patient was admitted into the infectious diseases ward for antibiotic therapy. Empirical antibiotic therapy with ampicillin and sulbactam was started. On culture of aspirated fluid, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was identified. Thus, the antibiotic was changed to nafcillin. Drug fever developed after nafcillin was given, so the antibiotic was changed to cefazolin. This antibiotic was maintained until the culture of the draining catheter was identified. On culture of the draining catheter, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified. Therefore, the antibiotic was changed to a combined vancomycin and ciprofloxacin regimen. After 14 days on that regimen, the antibiotic was changed to teicoplanin because the patient developed a skin rash. Despite conservative therapy using the appropriate antibiotics for 3 months and surgical drainage being performed twice, the spondylitis of her lumbar spine was not controlled.

She had been diagnosed with right breast cancer (T1N0M0, stage I) 9 years previously and had received breast-conserving surgery, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy for the residual whole right breast at a previous hospital. She then developed pigmented skin on her right breast 6 years after surgery, and this lesion was diagnosed as an angiosarcoma. The patient underwent a breast mastectomy to treat for RAAS. Following this, however, the angiosarcoma on her chest wall recurred three times within 2 years. The angiosarcoma was resected each time, and she received radiation therapy to her chest wall after the third operation. Four years after the first occurrence of RAAS, we observed light pigmentation and a dark red tumor (gross diameter of 5 mm) on her right chest wall (Fig. ). Clinically, recurrence of RAAS was suspected, and recurrence of angiosarcoma was diagnosed by biopsy. We considered that it was necessary to remove the irradiated skin as much as possible in order to cure the RAAS. After extensive resection of the irradiated skin and tumor, new skin collected from her right thigh was grafted to the site (Fig. ). Pathologically, the tumor size was 6 mm and the surgical margin was negative. Histologically, there were many spindle cells and dilated vascular channels. Immunostaining showed that the tumor was CD31-positive and mildly positive for CD34 (Fig. ). Ki-67 index was also high. It was revealed that there is no inconsistency as recurrence of RAAS is pathological. After the operation, the patient was hospitalized for 30 days and did not experience any complications. Although some reports suggest chemotherapy can be used to treat RAAS, we considered that this option would offer little benefit in this case, because the patient was elderly and had a history of cerebral infarction.
