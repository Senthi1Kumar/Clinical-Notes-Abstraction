She had undergone an infibulation between the ages of 7 and 8 years. It was encouraged by her parents who felt that to marry off a daughter who had not had an infibulation would bring disgrace to the family. Her obstetrical history includes two uneventful spontaneous vaginal deliveries at term in her country of origin in 2003 and 2005. The patient did not recollect any significant lacerations, bleeding, blood transfusions, or infections but did mention that her introitus was cut open during labor.\nUpon initial assessment, she complained of a 5-year history of pelvic burning. It was described as painful burning that involved the lower half of the abdomen and anterior half of the vulva radiating out to the thighs. The left side had worse pain than the right and quantified as 8 out of 10 in severity. There were no aggravating or ameliorating factors. The pain was so significant that it made daily function and sexual intercourse impossible. There were no other neurological deficits or back pain upon further questioning. She reports regular menstrual cycles every 26\u201329 days, accompanied with dysmenorrhea. She first had intercourse at age 18. Repair of the infibulations was performed three years before, when she immigrated to North America, which required three surgical procedures and a skin graft for which we were unable to obtain an operative record.\nAs part of her physical exam, the vulva was examined and it was quite tender to touch in the anterior areas. She stated this tenderness had improved after her surgeries to correct the infibulation but persisted. No erythema was noted or any vestibular tenderness even after the Q-tip test. No abdominal or pelvic masses were present. No",

    "original_text": "The patient was a 29-year-old multiparous woman in her seventh pregnancy, who had underwent two times of cesarean delivery, and the last cesarean delivery was performed 3 years ago. She was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of genital bleeding that had started 20 days ago. Routine ultrasound examination revealed a 2.1 cm \u00d71.1 cm \u00d71.5 cm gestational sac containing a secondary yolk sac inside the lower anterior wall of the uterus, and the myometrial thickness between the gestational sac and bladder wall was 3 mm. The gestational sac was surrounded by rich blood flow signal, and the fetal cardiac activity was 120 bpm (shown in ). Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-HCG) level was 29,560 IU/L. For the existence of the heart beat and considering the possibility of uterine rupture, the patient was informed of the severity of the situation. Given the advanced presentation and location, local therapy was first chosen before systemic treatment or a potentially difficult surgical approach was performed. So, MTX was administrated by intragluteal injection with the dosage of 20 mg/d for 5 days, and also the mifepristone was orally administered. The serum \u03b2-HCG was monitored every 3 days. On the seventh day after the administration of MTX and mifepristone, transvaginal ultrasonography was taken, which showed the blood flow around the gestational sac was significantly decreased and the \u03b2-HCG has dropped to 11,100 IU/L. Because the patient wanted to preserve her reproductive capacity and want to be discharged from the hospital, we decided to perform curettage and aspiration guided by laparoscopy for the reduced blood flow around the gestational sac and the decreased \u03b2-HCG value.

The patient did not complain of any pain or hypersensitivity and was asymptomatic.\nHis medical history revealed that the patient was diagnosed with hypoglycaemia when she was two years old. This rare condition, which was not related to diabetes, had caused her blood sugar to become low. She was on a daily carbohydrate supplement (Maxijul) and consumed HypoStop (concentrated glucose gel) whenever she had a hypoglycaemic attack. In addition, she had severe asthma that was managed with two puffs of salbutamol and steroid inhaler, twice daily, with a history of hospitalisation. The patient also had a migraine attack every other day, usually followed by vomiting and nausea since she was eight years old. She was under the treatment of a consultant paediatric neurologist and was managed with sumatriptan and Migraleve for her migraine and domperidone to prevent vomiting. She was also known to have an allergy to peanuts. She was a regular dental attendee and had experienced dental treatment and tooth extraction under local analgesia.\nHer dietary history showed that the patient consumed excessive quantities of acidic beverages: Coca-Cola, Irn-Bru and diluted fruit juice. The diluted juice was mixed with Maxijul and was taken to bed at night, and the mixed juice was sipped throughout the night.\nClinical examination revealed generalised dental erosion that had severely affected the palatal surfaces of all the maxillary incisors and caused a fracture of the mesial surface of both the maxillary central incisors (). Several restorations were present on the posterior teeth.\nThe patient was very anxious during the first visit to the clinic.

An electrocardiogram revealed a complete left bundle branch block and sinus tachycardia. Doppler echocardiography showed a severely dilated left ventricle (LV; 61 and 71 mm in systole and diastole, respectively), and a mildly dilated left atrium (40 mm). The LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was 30%. Cardiac catheterization revealed dilatation of the LV, and the coronary arteries appeared normal. Chagas disease serology was negative. Carvedilol, losartan and furosemide were then prescribed, with clinical improvement.\nThe patient had no previous history of smoking or alcohol abuse. Her past surgical history included a cholecystectomy due to symptomatic biliary lithiasis complicated with pancreatitis. She had hypothyroidism and used levothyroxin 125 \u00b5g per day.

General condition was unremarkable. There was no pedal edema. Examination of abdomen revealed a 6 \u00d7 5 cm nodular retroperitoneal swelling in the right hypochondrium. Radiological imaging with ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography revealed a retroperitoneal mass arising probably from the IVC, encasing the right renal vein and infiltrating the right kidney with ?tumor in the IVC []. Multiple large collateral vessels were also demonstrated []. The infra-renal IVC was completely blocked by the tumor [Figures and ].\nShe underwent exploratory laparotomy under general anesthesia on 5 July 2006. The tumor was found to be arising from the suprarenal IVC (around 2 cm below the hepatic veins) with dense adherence to right kidney and extension of tumor down to right renal vein and both common iliac veins (whitish discoloration and thickening) []. Left renal vein was free and IVC was patent at its entry. The collaterals were large and well-developed.

The intravitreal dexamethasone implant injection was performed inferotemporally, 3.5 mm from the limbus. The implant was properly positioned in the vitreous chamber after the injection. One month after the intravitreal dexamethasone implantation, a decrease in the ME and an improvement of the BCVA to 20/40 was observed on left eye examination. Three months after the intravitreal dexamethasone implantation, recurrence of the ME and deterioration of the BCVA to 20/200 was observed on left eye examination. Therefore, we performed the second intravitreal dexamethasone implantation in the left eye in the same manner. One month after the second intravitreal dexamethasone implantation, the ME improved and the BCVA was 20/60 in the left eye. The ME recurred and the BCVA was 20/200 about four months after the second intravitreal injection. Therefore, we performed the third intravitreal dexamethasone implantation in the left eye in the same manner. Every intravitreal injections and the consequent follow-up examinations were performed by an experienced, single vitreoretinal specialist. On every follow-up examinations performed a day after the three dexamethasone implantations, the implant was positioned properly in the vitreous chamber, away from the crystalline lens.

It seemed to originate from the pericardium and had an unclear border with a normal right ventricular myocardium; no obvious blood flow signal was detected in the mass. Re-transthoracic echocardiography in our institution identified the size of the mass as 4.0 \u00d7 3.0 cm (Fig. A), which was similar to the result from the local hospital.

He has had ongoing respiratory and abdominal symptoms which had been attributed to his smoking and drinking history. Starting in his early twenties, he began to have multiple episodes of mild upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis on a yearly basis. He also experienced mild abdominal discomfort and nausea which would come and go sporadically. High-resolution computed tomography of the chest confirmed emphysematous changes of the lung as shown in Figures - below.\nHis liver enzymes had been slowly trending up throughout the years. Over the span of a few months, his aspartate transaminase (AST) level increased from 52 units per liter (U/L) to 58 U/L. His alanine transaminase (ALT) level increased from 81 U/L to 86 U/L.

Other markers of liver damage, including serum prothrombin concentrations and serum albumin, were not affected.\nHis primary care physician instructed him to quit smoking and drinking, eat healthily, and exercise regularly. He was successful in making these lifestyle changes, but over the next few years, his liver enzymes remained elevated and his lungs continued to show persistent emphysema. There was little to no improvement in his overall symptoms. Due to these abnormal findings, he was tested for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and was found to be homozygous for the Z allele (PI*ZZ).

At the time he felt nauseated but did not vomit, and he was treated conservatively with ultrasound and massage. The weakness began acutely after he had turned his head to one side and rapidly progressed from his left leg to his left arm. He was immediately unable to walk and subsequently began to experience tingling sensations in his right arm and leg.\nThere was no history of head trauma or neck manipulation, no past medical or surgical history, and no previous use of medications or previous infectious symptoms. The patient was a non-smoker, did not have diabetes and was normotensive. There was no family history of thrombophilia or venous throboembolism. Both his father and uncle had suffered from ischemic strokes in their late forties. He was born in the Philippines and had lived in Canada since early childhood.\nOn examination, level of consciousness, cognition and speech were normal. His blood pressure was 144/96 mmHg. The cranial nerve examination was normal. There was Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 4 out of 5 weakness affecting the left arm and left leg, with active movement possible against gravity and minimal resistance. Pinprick and temperature sensation were diminished on the right side from the second cervical vertebra (C2). Vibration and joint position were diminished on the left side below C2.

He was doing fine for 6 months after the index surgery; thereafter, he noticed a swelling in his lateral aspect of the right forearm for which he consulted his index surgeon, was advised course of oral antibiotics with regular follow-up. However, his swelling did not subside and was slowly increasing in size which made him to visit his index surgeon again where he was advised removal of implant.\nOne month following removal of implant, he again noticed swelling now on his inner aspect of the right forearm which was also slowly increasing in size; he was advised ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Sonographic findings were non-specific, but FNAC report suggested soft-tissue sarcoma and was finally referred to our tertiary care hospital for further management.\nClinically, the patient was afebrile with no history of weight loss. Non-tender, ill-defined, and firm swelling was located on inner aspect of his right forearm; overlying skin was free with normal texture and normal temperature.

    "original_text": "A right-handed 9-year-old boy fell on an outstretched hand two weeks before admitted to the hospital. The patient presented with a right wrist-drop and right elbow flexion stiffness. On the physical examination, the patient cannot extend his right wrist and thumb. There was also sensory deficit, anaesthesia sensation over the radial nerve distribution and hypoesthesia sensation on the ulnar nerve distribution. The median and ulnar nerve examinations were standard. The distal pulsation is solid and regular. The right elbow joint was stiff with a limited flexion-extension range of motion (60\u201390\u00b0). Radiographs showed a displaced SCF classified as Gartland type III. The parents first sought treatment from a traditional bonesetter before came to the hospital (, , ).\nSurgical management is preferred for this case, and we decided to explore the nerve while simultaneously reduce and stabilize the fracture. First, we explored the ulnar nerve with a medial approach and found the ulnar nerve was entrapped in fibrous tissue and carefully released it. Then the lateral approach is utilized to explore the radial nerve. We found the radial nerve has lost its continuity and interposed by fibrotic tissue. The scar and fibrous tissue were carefully resected, leaving a 2 cm gap in the nerve.

Fecal occult blood study was positive.\nA colonoscopy was performed under IV sedation with 25 mg of meperidine and 2 mg of midazolam. Colonoscopy revealed a large number of diverticula in the sigmoid and descending colon. The scope was negotiated up to the splenic flexure at which point the lumen was no longer visualized. The patient was turned supine and to the right lateral decubitus position. Despite these maneuvers the colonoscope could not be advanced past the splenic flexure.

Her grown-up daughter was seriously ill from tuberculosis and required demanding daily care and medicine. Haiba was not alone in her care-giving role. Other females in the households assisted her, but being the mother of the ill daughter, Haiba had the primary care-giving responsibility for her daughter[] and since more than one person within the household was sick, it entailed choosing whom to help. Haiba chose her daughter's health to her own. This meant that she occasionally went without insulin in order to ensure that there was enough money within the household to buy her daughter's medicine.\nHaiba's story illustrates how the needs of other relatives also had to be met which often compromised the needs of the person with diabetes. It further illustrates how the double burden of disease puts tremendous pressure on the remaining relatives[] and how prioritising was a continuous process that severely jeopardised the sustainability of the long-term treatment schemes necessary for survival.\nIn terms of financial support, our findings also show that there were limits to the obligations of kin. People were seeking out other ways of getting support as the mobilisation of resources had been extended to wider social networks. Many of the informants drew on support within their social network by approaching friends, colleagues or people within their local communities.

At presentation, her visual acuity was 1/60 in the right eye and 6/18 in the left eye. Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) was present in the right eye. Both eyes anterior segment examination findings were normal. Grade 1 vitritis was noted in the right eye. Funduscopic examination of the right eye revealed a pale optic disc and pigmented scar over the macula with salt and pepper appearance. Intense retinitis with focal areas of haemorrhage was present nasally (). There was mild pallor of the left optic disc with macula and peripheral granular retinitis ().\nSystematically, she was diagnosed with combined T and B cell deficiencies by the immunologist at the age of 11. At that time, she presented with high fever, recurrent episodes of diarrhoea, oral thrush, and failure to thrive, with the weight of only 12kg. PIDD screening showed low T cell, very low B cell counts, and low immunoglobulin levels (). Her systemic therapy consisted of 3 weekly intravenous immunoglobulin, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim prophylaxis as well as empirical therapy for fungal infection which include syrup fluconazole 6mg/kg/day and syrup nystatin 1ml QID. She was also treated for CMV colitis as HPE of the colon showed CMV inclusion bodies. She completed 6 weeks of intravenous ganciclovir 3 months prior to presentation of her ophthalmic symptoms.\nWe diagnosed the child of having bilateral eye CMV retinitis based on typical fundus features and history of treated CMV colitis. She was planned for right eye intravitreal ganciclovir injection in view of poor visual function with posterior pole involvement. However, she was deemed unfit to undergo general anaesthesia due to concomitant hospital acquired pneumonia. IV ganciclovir 75mg (6mg/kg) 12 hourly was started and good response was noted after 2 weeks of therapy (). The treatment was continued for 8",

The pathological classification was pT4a (esophagus), pN1a, M0, stage IVA. In September 2006, local recurrence to the neck (left of paratracheal sites) and distant metastasis to the femur were observed by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). The patient rejected our proposed treatment regimen of resection at the local site recurrence and internal radiation therapy against the distant metastasis and was thus required to start specific substance of Maruyama (SSA). Thus, only external radiation therapy to both regions was administered as a palliative therapy. A trial of suppressive therapy with levothyroxine was also initiated. Follow-up CT in May 2007 still indicated the existence of metastatic tumor at left side of trachea without changing its size. Until December 2010, there was no evidence of growth of the neck tumor or new recurrence site observed by CT scan. In July 2012, the patient (68 years old) developed persistent abdominal pain accompanied by a fever of 38 \u00b0C. At the time of admission to our hospital, an emergent CT scan revealed an intra-abdominal mass that partially involved the adjacent small bowel (Fig. ) and the abdominal symptoms worsened; therefore, we decided to perform emergent exploratory laparotomy. Intraoperatively, we identified an intra-abdominal abscess with a 5 cm diameter adjacent to the mesenteric vessels with partial involvement of the small intestine. The mass was completely excised together with partial resection of the small intestine. Macroscopically, the tumor was mainly composed of infectious tissue and an abscess caused by perforation of a small intestinal tumor, which extended through the muscularis propria of the small intestine and connected to the abscess cavity (Fig. ). Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as undifferentiated carcinoma. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 12.",

Four years ago, he had undergone radical resection of the common bile duct and hepatico-jejunostomy due to Bismuth type I perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. During follow up after laparotomy, he had been diagnosed with stricture of hepaticojejunostomy without jaundice. Three metastatic lesions in the liver were found in the segments 5, 6, and 8 (each 2.9 cm, 1.6 cm, and 3.3 cm in size). Preferentially, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was performed under ultrasonographic guidance in lesions of the segments 5 and 6.\nAfter the first RFA, he complained of severe pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. The pain gradually improved over five days with the administration of analgesics. He refused additional RFA procedure of the remained metastatic lesion of the segment 8. So, combined chemotherapy of gemcitabine and cisplatin as a therapeutic strategy for the remained lesion proceeded over the following 18 weeks.\nA follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan obtained after end of the chemotherapy showed partial response of metastatic cholangiocarcinoma in the segment 8 without recurrence of previous RFA site (segment 5 and 6). However, the patient's renal function was worsened by the chemotherapy and the patient refused further chemotherapy because of deteriorated general condition. So, RFA of the remained metastatic lesion of segment 8 was performed. A follow-up CT scan performed immediately after RFA showed complete ablation of the metastatic cholangiocarcinoma without direct evidence of diaphragmatic injury except for a small amount of reactive pleural effusion in right lung.\nThe patient developed a lower grade fever of less than 38.0 \u2103 during the 3 days after RFA. One week later, he revisited the hospital with intermittent fever and chill. A follow-up CT scan showed a liver abscess in the previous RFA site.

Despite a positive family history of angioedema attacks, a long history of recurrent peripheral and abdominal attacks, and more than 100 laryngeal attacks, the patient was only diagnosed with HAE at age 50 (). Typical symptoms included mild peripheral edema of the limbs typically lasting 3 days. Over time skin swelling extended to the abdominal and thoracic walls and head. Some of face edema was followed by aphonia and suffocation. Hours before the onset of an HAE attack, she was always progressively adynamic and these symptoms resolved gradually when the edema became evident. Initially, painful abdominal attacks were rare; however, the patient began to experience weekly abdominal attacks preceded or followed by peripheral edema. The patient repeatedly received hydrocortisone, antihistamines, and epinephrine for the treatment of attacks, all of which were ineffective. Specific treatment with C1-INH concentrate, icatibant, or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was never received in the ED. Following some of these attacks, the gallbladder, appendix, and left ovarium were surgically removed.\nThe fatal attack, occurring at age 52, started with dysphagia, quickly followed by dysphonia and dyspnea. The patient was admitted to a small regional hospital and 6 hours after symptom onset underwent respiratory arrest whilst waiting to receive FFP. Resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful and the autopsy revealed laryngeal edema.\nEvaluation of the case reveals several failings in the patient's treatment: firstly the severity and type of angioedema attack were not correctly recognized or assessed by the emergency physician. Secondly, the ED did not contact the HAE reference center upon admission of the patient to gather details of any previous history of attacks. Finally, the airway was not secured and emergency measures, such as cricothyrotomy, were not prepared in advance nor performed. As a consequence, life-saving measures and effective drug therapy were not provided early enough to prevent the patient's death.",

He engaged in hard manual labor for the past five years, which involved loading/unloading of about 500 parcels of 10 kg weight every day. Physical examinations showed hyperesthesia and pain in the median nerve area. On active flexion of the index and middle fingers, a convex shape was observed at the carpal area with snapping, which exaggerated the symptoms. Evident thenar muscle atrophy was not observed. Tinel's sign, Phalen's test, and fist test results were positive. Plain radiographs of the wrist showed no abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed edematous lumbrical muscle with synovial proliferation around the flexor tendons (). The median nerve was compressed between the transverse carpal ligament and the edematous muscle and synovial tissue (). Motor nerve conduction studies of the median nerve revealed evident prolonged distal latency. Sensory nerve conduction studies showed prolonged latency and delayed conduction velocity. Needle EMG (electromyography) showed no denervation potentials at rest. On voluntary contraction, there was no positive sharp wave but a few polyphasic motor units were detected.

    "original_text": "A 49-day old male baby presented to the emergency department with fever, poor feeding, and abdominal distension which started 1 day ago. Initial lab findings showed CRP elevation, leukocytosis, and bowel distension on plain x-ray, suggesting possible congenital megacolon (Fig. ). He was admitted for treatment of enteritis and evaluation for megacolon including colon study. He had a previous history of neonatal intensive care unit admission after birth due to neonatal pneumonia and had received ventilator care. Congenital pharynx deformity was observed for which resection of pharyngeal polyp was done and also congenital ptosis of the right eye and mild sacral deformity was suspected. During neonatal intensive care unit care, the infant showed signs of repeated colon distension and colon study was done. However, other than mildly decreased bowel motility of the transverse megacolon, no specific findings were apparent and eventually normal defecation was observed. Oral feeding was gradually increased and 27 days after admission, the patient was discharged.\nHowever, few days after discharge, the amount of oral feeding decreased to less than half, and the infant had extreme difficulty in defecating. Although rectal tube insertion was immediately done, decompression was ineffective and abdominal distension aggravated with worsening signs of shock. Patient was admitted to PICU where resuscitation with hydration, inotropics, mechanical ventilation, and combined antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, meropenem, and metronidazole was initiated. Emergency ultrasonography findings showed clear signs of toxic megacolon with marked distension of rectum and distal colon, diffuse bowel wall thickening and turbid fluid collection (Fig. A). During ultrasonography, foley catheter was inserted through the anus to enable simultaneous rectal decompression.

We received the patient's consent form about all photographic materials. She had undergone a total hip replacement surgery 8 months ago because of osteoarthritis of the left hip joint. Three months later, she had a fall and received a reattachment surgery because of muscle detachment at the surgical site. Again, a month later, she underwent revision total hip arthroplasty due to cup loosening in the left hip which was confirmed by X-ray findings. She was discharged after the operation; however, because she experienced continuous pain around the surgical area, she was re-admitted to the orthopedic surgery department and referred to our department for her skin lesions. We performed a skin biopsy on a purpuric papule around the incision site.\nOn histological examination, an irregular slit-like space was observed in the dermis and inflammatory cells were observed around blood vessels (). However, cellular atypia could not be identified (). Clinically, angiosarcoma or other sarcomas were suspected; however, the specimen tested negative for both CD31 () and CD34 (). She was diagnosed with chronic dermatitis based on pathological findings. She was treated with systemic antibiotics; however, the skin lesion became worsened and was accompanied by hemorrhage.\nAfter two months, skin symptoms aggravated rapidly and she was again referred to our department. At the time of referral, skin lesion had increased in size; brown nodules, masses, superficial ulcers, and severe hemorrhage were observed on the reddish patch ().

He had a high fever, anorexia, tachycardia, and tachypnea. He had no comorbidities or surgical history. The white blood cell count, liver enzymes, and C-reactive protein level were elevated. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic lesion with a maximum diameter of 40 mm in the left lobe of the liver (Fig. ). Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a lesion with coexisting low- and high-density areas in segment III of the liver. The lesion was adjacent to the stomach antrum and had a maximum diameter of 55 mm, with enhancement at the edge. The lesion contained air and a high-density linear object measuring about 24 mm (Fig. a, b). We suspected a liver abscess secondary to gastric perforation caused by a foreign body. The patient underwent abscess drainage and removal of the foreign body using five-port laparoscopic surgery. Adhesions had formed between the liver and reticulum due to inflammation (Fig. a). We confirmed pus leakage, performed lysis of adhesions, and found a fish bone inside the reticulum (Fig. b\u2013d). The fish bone was removed laparoscopically. We lavaged the abscess cavity with saline. The operation was completed with the insertion of a drain inferior to the left lobe of the liver. There was no bile leakage from the abscess cavity. The total operative time was 62 min, and the total intraoperative blood loss was 20 ml. The pus culture showed the presence of Streptococcus anginosus, which matched the result of the blood culture. We used meropenem until postoperative day 10. The clinical course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 11. When the patient was discharged, we changed the antibiotic treatment from meropenem to a combination of potassium clavulanate and amoxicillin hydrate according to the indications",

Her medical records showed she had been diagnosed with progressive systemic sclerosis but had not been taking any medications. She complained of occasional dry mouth and inflamed gums, which is a typical oral manifestation of this disease (). An X-ray of the jaw (digital panoramic image) revealed that teeth 14, 24, and 27 needed to be extracted or undergo root canal treatment (). Horizontally positioned impacted upper canines were also observed, which were asymptomatic and free from any pathology. Almost all teeth had large, inadequate fillings. After thorough dental examination, an endorestorative treatment was proposed, followed by final rehabilitation of the lower jaw with full ceramic crowns. For the upper jaw, given that the impacted canines would interfere with the traditional implant-supported rehabilitation (fixed ceramic bridges), a combined prosthodontic solution was proposed (fixed ceramic crowns in the frontal region and a removable prosthesis in the back) following all necessary extractions and restorative preparations. The patient was informed that this solution for the upper jaw bares some long-term risks due to her primary diagnosis and chronically dry oral mucosa. The patient refused the removable prosthodontic solution for the upper jaw and asked for a fixed one. Two alternative options were proposed: (1) initial extraction of the impacted canines after bone augmentation, followed by later insertion of the implants, or (2) a novel, experimental approach called transdental implant insertion. The patient was informed that the second procedure was relatively new, had not been fully validated by evidence-based contemporary dentistry, and was based on several published case reports and follow-ups.\nBoth the benefits (avoidance of aggressive, invasive surgery including bone grafting; reduced financial cost; and increased speed of the final rehabilitation) and risks (prolonged postoperative pain due to canine pulpal tissue damage, followed by removal of the implant and the canine",
