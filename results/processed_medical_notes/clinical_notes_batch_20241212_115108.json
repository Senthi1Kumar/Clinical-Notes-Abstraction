    "original_text": "A 16-year-old male patient was diagnosed with MPS II in infancy. Five years prior to presentation, when he was 11 years old, tracheostomy was performed to treat an airway obstruction caused by laryngeal stenosis secondary to his primary mucopolysaccharide storage disease. His tracheostomy hole gradually narrowed along with his physical growth, and granulation tissue developed around the tracheostomy hole. One week prior to presentation, at the age of 16 years, he was admitted to another hospital on an emergency basis for major dyspnea. He was diagnosed with tracheostenosis due to granulation at the tracheostomy site and treated with ventilation upon admission. Slight deviation of the position of the tracheal tube obstructed his airway. His previous doctor determined that it was difficult to continue treatment at their institute because no chest surgeon was available. Therefore, the patient presented to our institute by ambulance while undergoing ventilation therapy. We performed a computed tomography scan, which showed obstruction of the airway. The distance from the tip of the tracheal tube to the carina was about 2 cm because the tracheal tube was kept on the distal side of the granulation. Moreover, the patient had pneumonia of the right upper lobe due to the airway obstruction. We performed a bronchoscopic examination through the nasal cavity in the operating room under general anesthesia with the tracheal tube in place because of the risk of suffocation (). However, obtaining a peripheral view of the airway was difficult because of macroglossia, swelling of the tonsils, and MPS II-induced tracheomalacia. An image of the patient's airway is shown in . We also considered stent placement and laser treatment for airway management but selected the construction of a mediastinal tracheostoma. The mediastinal tracheostoma was created with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. First, we created a U-shaped flap.

On clinical examination, there was deviation of remaining mandible towards the resected site and also downward rotation of mandible. It was noted that intermaxillary fixation was not done at the time of surgery. The mandibular defect was classified as Cantor and Curtis type III[].

His clinical symptoms comprised of an approximately 10-day history of pain in the right iliac fossa without alteration of his bowel habits, rectal bleeding or substantial involuntary weight loss. On admission, clinical examination revealed the presence of localized tenderness in the right iliac fossa, with absence of diffuse peritonism. In addition, a discrete mass was focally palpable in the right iliac fossa, with rectal examination being unremarkable. Baseline blood tests on admission revealed normal white cell and hemoglobin values and essentially normal biochemistry apart from a mild elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) (40 mg/dL; reference level 0 - 11 mg/dL). The patient underwent a CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis for further diagnostic assessment. The latter detected the presence of a 17 cm fluid collection in the right iliac fossa, with another 5 cm collection located in the pelvis (, ).

At the time of wounding he had been treated conservatively.\nThe patient complained of exertional dyspnea and considerable edema and pain in the right arm. He had brought the results of a chest tomography conducted some weeks before which showed considerable dilatation of the right subclavian vein and the cervical veins of the right upper limb.\nPhysical examination revealed significant edema of the right upper limb, with pain on palpation and holosystolic murmur in the topography of the right pulmonary apex. Right radial, ulnar, and brachial pulses were all reduced in comparison with those of the contralateral limb.\nTwo weeks after this consultation, the patient presented at an emergency room with exacerbation of the dyspnea, symptomatic ventricular tachycardia, and frequent premature ventricular contractions and was admitted to the hospital.\nSupplementary cardiac tests were then conducted. The echocardiogram showed dilatation of the left cardiac chambers and an ejection fraction of 63%. Myocardial scintigraphy showed signs of dilated cardiomyopathy.\nAfter clinical and cardiac stabilization, the patient underwent arteriography of the right upper limb, which showed a large arteriovenous fistula between the right subclavian vessels and a pseudoaneurysm of the subclavian artery ( ).\nThe treatment chosen was endovascular repair under local anesthesia with sedation. The technique employed was via puncture of the right common femoral artery with a 7F introducer and puncture of the right brachial artery with a 5F introducer. The subclavian artery was catheterized via the brachial access and the guidewire was snared and a through-and-through system constructed via the femoral access, due to difficulty in advancing the guidewire via the subclavian artery.

He first experienced pain on the medial side two years prior that was noted after sports activities although no clear injury was identified. The knee was intermittently painful and with time these symptoms progressively worsened despite several attempts at non-operative management to include anti-inflammatories and physical therapy. The symptoms limited the ability of the patient to participate in sports. Physical examination revealed no effusion, complete range of motion, and no signs of meniscal pathology. There was no tenderness to palpation of the medial or lateral joint line, a negative McMurray, and a normal ligamentous examination. There was no pain with hyperextension, and the only positive examination finding was mild pain on hyperflexion. Radiographs were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), was performed in another facility and, showed normal medial and lateral menisci except for the absence of a medial posterior root insertion both on coronal and on sagittal images. There was no evidence of meniscal extrusion or a meniscal ghost sign (Fig. ). On sagittal magnetic resonance images, the presence of thin low-signal band was identified just anterior to the ACL (Fig. ). Diagnostic arthroscopy was performed secondary to failure of nonoperative management and revealed a white rounded band that was noted to extend from the anterior horn of the medial meniscus to the intercondylar notch adjacent to the femoral insertion of the ACL (Fig. A). This band was clearly a distinct structure from the ACL with probing. Next careful examination of medial compartment revealed that the meniscus did not have evidence of tearing or degenerative changes and appeared to be floating into the medial compartment without the typical anterior bony attachment.

    "original_text": "A 43-year-old woman, with a history of splenectomy after traumatic rupture at the age of 7, was referred to our surgical department for plastic reconstruction of a postoperational scar at the left abdominal wall. Preoperative laboratory values were within normal limits. At surgery, we accidentally discovered two subcutaneous nodules that appeared to be immobile and firmly embedded in the subcutaneous fat tissue, whereas the underlying abdominal fascia and muscles appeared intact. The two dark red lesions measured 2.7 cm and 1.7 cm, respectively, and had a hard consistency, resembling with splenic tissue. Biopsy specimens were acquired from both lesions and the histological examination confirmed the presence of splenic tissue with white and red pulp, and no evidence of malignancy (). The connective tissue also appeared to contain blood vessels adjacent to splenic red pulp (). The red pulp consisted of a complex network of venous sinuses and cords of Billroth, which contain most of the splenic macrophages. The sinuses were lined by a particular type of endothelial cells (known as littoral cells) and had a discontinuous wall, which allows traffic of blood cells between cords and sinuses (). The above histological assay reveals that the splenic tissue performed normal splenic function, with absence of Howell-Jolly and Heinz bodies, siderocytes or other abnormal red blood cells. The architecture of the splenic tissue was well developed with nodules of splenic tissue separated by the connective tissue of the capsule (). The location of the ectopic splenic tissue strongly favored of the diagnosis of splenosis rather than accessory spleen, a significant clinical dilemma.\nIt is known that the diagnostic method of choice, before surgery and histological confirmation, is nuclear scintigraphy, a heat-damaged red blood cell scan [].

He also presented with abdominal contusion and stable fracture of the right pubic ramus without urinary disorder.\nThe hemodynamic status was stable. Thoracoabdominal CT scan then laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis of 12 cm diaphragmatic rupture at the left side admitting a stomacal hernia. A section of the mesenteric root and an injury of the spleen capsule without active bleeding were observed. The diaphragmatic injury was sutured after fixation of the mesenteric lesion and stomacal reposition. A 32 Fr chest tube was placed through the left 5th intercostal space for drainage. Postoperative period was eventless in this conscious patient. After 48 hours in the Intensive Care Unit, the chest tube was removed, but 3 days later X-ray showed a recurrence of the hemothorax. A new tube drainage was decided. A 32 Fr chest tube was placed through the 3rd intercostal space in the anterior axillary line.

She had no other relevant medical history. Body weight was 45.8 kg, height 158 cm, and body mass index 18.3 kg/m2. Weight and height were approximately the same as when the primary surgery was performed. After the initial procedure, she had been followed up every 3 months for 16 years and follow-up plain radiographs were regularly checked once a year.

His blood sugar control was not satisfactory because of poor compliance and the HbA1C was 10.65% checked one month ago. He sustained left lower leg swelling with ulcers and repeated cellulitis for 1-2 years. During this period he was treated at the outpatient department with both oral antibiotics and wound care. In recent months the number of ulcers increased markedly with more serum-like drainage. On physical examination, his left leg had multiple ulcerative, hyperkeratotic lesions with thick, fibrotic, hyperpigmented skin discoloration ().\nThese lesions were unilateral occurance and the involved area was about 600 cm2 from the pretibial region to the posterior aspect of leg. Significant greater circumferential distance of left lower leg was also noted with 6 cm and 10 cm longer than right lower leg in the calf and ankle level respectively. We arranged operation for the patient under the impression of unilateral lymphedema, left lower limb and diabetic foot ulcers with repeated cellulitis. Skin malignancy was suspected due to the rapid progression of these lesions. First, multiple skin biopsy was done to rule out skin malignancy and fortunately the pathology was ulcer with acute necrotizing inflammation. Second, the peripheral arterial disease was excluded by computed tomography angiography. Then, half of affected skin and subcutaneous tissue was excised deep to fascia level and covered with split-thickness skin graft ().\nThe same procedure toward the other half lesions was completed a week later. There was no immediate post-operative complication such as blood loss requiring transfusion, failure taking of skin graft or wound infection. Combination therapy with antibiotics use and hyperbaric oxygen was also prescribed. The patient was discharged seven days after operation and compression garment was applied continuously after wound healing.

The needle was reported to have accidentally pierced the external genitalia at the penoscrotal junction when the penis was erect. There was no history of hematuria. Upon physical examination, the patient was anxious and his vital signs were normal. The caudal end of the needle was just palpable at the penoscrotal junction on local examination.\nThe results of urinalysis and complete blood examination reports were normal. An X-ray of the pelvis () showed the needle within the pelvis. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen including the genitalia showed a 6-cm needle piercing the prostate from the root of the penis up to the bladder neck. Because the needle was palpable at the penoscrotal junction and the caudal end of the needle was below the urogenital diaphragm (), an urgent surgical exploration with incision over the palpable end of the needle under fluoroscopic guidance was done. This exploration showed the tip of the caudal end of the needle to be inside the corpus cavernosum at the root of the penis (). The needle was manipulated by holding the caudal end at the penoscrotal junction, which showed that the tip of the needle was in and around the bladder neck by piercing the prostate gland. Endoscopic manipulation was not done in this case. The needle was removed intact through exploration of the bulbous cavernosa (). A pressure dressing was applied to the penis and the patients post operative voiding was normal. When the patient was queried about the possibility of self-insertion because accidental injury would be unlikely to push the needle completely through the external genitalia, the patient was too ashamed to admit the cause and was discharged after 2 days. Later, the patient admitted the motive behind the insertion of the needle as sexual gratification. The surgical wound healed well and mild penile edema was noted in the immediate postoperative period.",

The doctor carried out an X-ray of the kidney, ureter, and bladder and made a diagnosis of a staghorn calculus in the left kidney (). The patient was referred to our office for further examination and treatment. His previous medical history was a urinary tract stone 20 years ago. We performed no contrast-enhanced CT of the abdominal and pelvis, which revealed an 8 cm renal stone in the left renal pelvis (). Urine tests showed hematuria and pyuria, but no bacteriuria, while the results of blood tests were unremarkable with a serum creatinine concentration of 0.95 mg/dL. We diagnosed a staghorn calculus in the functioning left kidney and attempted to perform an ECIRS, first establishing hydronephrosis using an occlusion catheter to puncture in order to make a percutaneous trocar nephrostomy easy. However, we were unable to insert the trocar, despite the left kidney being punctured three times. A lithotripsy was only performed. Part of the left renal stone still existed, especially in the inferior calyx of the kidney (). Analysis showed the stone consisted of calcium phosphate. ECIRS was performed one month later, and we were able to insert the trocar at this time and carry out the procedure as planned (). Analysis of the stone showed it consisted of calcium oxalate (90%) and calcium phosphate (10%). At this time, we realized that the white fuzzy tissue was different from normal renal pelvic mucosa and therefore carried out urine cytology and a single targeted biopsy of the renal pelvic mucosa. Urine cytology identified squamous cells classified as class III. Histopathological examination showed a keratinized lesion and stratified squamous epithelium with atypical cells, although we were unable to determine whether these were malignant changes.

After injecting the contrast material, the anterolateral portion of the mass was intensely enhanced without enhancement of the surrounding region (). The lesion was encasing the right bronchus intermedius and the right lower lobar bronchus, resulting in decreased caliber. The right inferior pulmonary vein was also narrowed by the encasing mass ().

Her medical history was negative for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and other conditions. She had undergone bilateral salpingectomy due to ectopic pregnancies. She denied history of any congenital anomalies or chronic conditions. The couple was healthy and had no history of exposure to any medications or other teratogens. She had no remarkable family history. Ultrasound taken during the first trimester showed 2 different gestational sacs, indicating dichorionic twins. The IVF-derived gestational ages matched those determined by ultrasound measurements in the first trimester. The twins showed normal nuchal translucency during screening in the first trimester. At 19 + 1 weeks of gestation, amniocentesis was conducted on the dual amniotic sacs because of advanced age, which revealed normal karyotypes for each twin. Prenatal sonography showed absence of the nasal bone (Fig. ) in twin B at 21 + 2-weeks of gestation and no other structural anomalies. Subsequently, extensive prenatal genetic counseling and discussions with the laryngologist about potential neonatal clinical issues were conducted. In light of this uncertainty, the couple made the difficult decision to continue the pregnancy. The couple refused to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a serial follow-up scan was selected as the alternative management strategy. Sonography at 25 + 4 weeks confirmed the absence of the nasal bone in twin B. An ultrasound performed 5 weeks later also did not show the nasal bone in twin B.

During the implantation procedure, it was difficult to determine the location of the left axillary vein as although the left subclavian vein was punctured and a guide wire could be inserted, we could not insert a peel-away introducer across the costoclavicular junction and handle the inserted right ventricular lead due to mechanical resistance at the costoclavicular junction. To avoid the risk of difficult lead handling and future subclavian crush syndrome, a second puncture was performed at a more lateral site approximately two fingers away from the initial puncture point.

This was previously managed with endoscopic fulguration of the tumor periodically as he was inconsistent in his followup. He then presented in June 2012 with acute renal failure due to ureteral obstruction from the tumor. A percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) was placed emergently by interventional radiology. He underwent an endoscopic procedure in September 2012, but due to large tumor volume he was unable to be completely treated at that last visit. His PCN was kept in place to attempt percutaneous management of his tumor at his next visit.\nThe patient was taken back to the operating room in November 2012 for the planned percutaneous fulguration. The case was started from a retrograde ureteroscopic approach to ablate the portions of the kidney that we felt would be easier managed ureteroscopically. We had fulgurated portions of the mid and lower pole when anesthesia staff noted that the patient was tachycardic and hypotensive (60s/40s), and the case was stopped to resuscitate the patient. During the evaluation, his PCN was pulled out and was found on the operating room floor. After the patient became more stable, we used a flexible cystoscope to place a right ureteral stent under fluoroscopic guidance. We were never able to commence the percutaneous portion of the procedure, and the patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit. He recovered from his urosepsis without sequelae and was able to be discharged home. Histopathologic evaluation of the upper pole lesion revealed a high grade urothelial carcinoma involving the collecting ducts.\nAt his follow-up visit a few weeks later, the patient was noted to have a soft tissue mass at the previous percutaneous nephrostomy tract site (). He also underwent a computed tomography (CT)",

She presented intellectual disability (IQ=68) and the main behavioral problems reported by her parents were: not being very active, feeling tired without reason, being too dependent, having poor motor coordination, skin picking, not following rules, being stubborn, and screaming a lot. She lived with her father, stepmother, and two older siblings; she was enrolled in the fourth grade of a mainstream elementary school. She had poor reading and writing skills. Her parents reported that despite their frequent requests for the school to control her food intake no action had been taken and after 5 months she had gained 10 kg.\nDuring the pre-intervention assessment, her parents reported that she was not very active and spent most of the time sitting, watching TV or playing with her dolls. She walked with difficulty when she had to cover longer distances and often stopped to rest.\nDuring the initial assessment, she remained quiet, listening attentively to the orientations for the tasks and demonstrated interest and willingness to start the PAP. Her parents received orientation from a nutritionist trained in PWS who offered menu recommendations adapted to the disorder. They also attended workshops held by a psychologist who gave advice about phenotypic behavioral characteristics and the behavioral management of PWS.\nAfter considering her availability, it was decided to carry out the PAP at our university twice a week and at her house once a week. She accepted positively all the PAP routines, and most of the time the inclusion of new exercises. In the face of new challenges, she understood that they should be overcome. A higher number of repetitions or changing to a heavier medicine ball was also almost always well accepted.

He had minor health problems, such as rhinitis and sinusitis, and other health problems that require special care such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, fatty liver disease, and sleep apnea syndrome. He used a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) apparatus to facilitate air flow through his upper airway. From the first moment, he demonstrated interest in taking part in the PAP. Such interest was observed in his effort to take the initial assessment tests. He also demonstrated good physical condition and willingness, so that by the third week he was able to perform the complete set of tasks. From the fourth week, three repetitions of 5\u00d740 meters run were added, as well as 5-meter anteroposterior and lateral exercises in a sand box. Whenever he demonstrated being tired or irritable, these exercises were reduced to one repetition. On Saturdays, training sessions took place on a street near his house. It is noteworthy that the street has a 30\u00b0 angle incline and that the running practice happened in the ascending direction. He sometimes complained during the interval between repetitions; however, he accomplished all tasks after being encouraged. In order to provide new challenges, from the fifth week, a bonus activity was implemented.

This mass was first noted on ultrasound imaging as part of his investigations for symptoms of bloating and constipation. A computed tomography scan with intravenous contrast was then performed to further characterise this lesion, which showed a low density but mildly enhancing lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to exclude angiomyolipoma. It revealed a 26 \u00d7 21 mm left renal lower pole exophytic mass with a low T2 signal suggesting the possibility of a renal cell carcinoma (see ). The patient then underwent an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the mass to aid with diagnosis and assist in management options. The lesion was first accessed using a 17-gauge needle with a coaxial sheath and 2 fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies were performed. This was followed by core biopsies using an 18-gauge core biopsy needle also done with the coaxial sheath in place. Two passes were made to obtain 6 cores, all embedded in 2 blocks. The core sizes were 6 mm, 5 mm, 4 mm, 4 mm, 4 mm, and 3 mm in length. Pathological assessment of the FNA and core biopsy specimens confirmed the presence of a low-grade neoplasm consisting of closely packed cells with small rounded nuclei forming clusters and some mucin filled tubules. Given this finding, the patient underwent a subsequent open left partial nephrectomy 8 weeks later. The procedure involved a lower pole partial nephrectomy, with frozen section confirming clear parenchymal margins.

She visited an orthopaedic clinic and was treated conservatively with analgesics. Her low back pain worsened sharply 7 months after delivery, so she went to another orthopaedic clinic. She had no episodes of trauma. A spinal X-ray and MRI were taken to rule out spinal lesions. Multiple compression fractures were observed at Th11, L1 and L5 (Fig. ). She was referred to our hospital to investigate the cause.\nThe patient was 162 cm tall, weighed 69 kg, and had a body mass index of 26 when she visited our hospital. The pain was localized to the mid-lumbar region above the sacrum and was accompanied by tenderness. She had difficulty walking due to back pain and used a wheelchair at the time of her visit. The pain was exacerbated by flexion and activity and was partially relieved by rest. Analgesics had limited effect. No sensory or movement impairment was observed in her lower limbs. She continued to breastfeed. Both breasts were rather firm, which was thought to be attributable to the breastfeeding period. No difference between the left and right",

She had her first child when she was 35 years old and had an amniocentesis at 18 weeks to test for Down syndrome. The amniocentesis was negative. She is currently 8 weeks pregnant and would like to know as soon as possible of any abnormalities. An ultrasound can be done in the first trimester for diagnosing Down syndrome, but it is unknown if the results are as reliable as the conventional test of amniocentesis.\nThis scenario represents the domain of diagnostic accuracy. The question can be formulated as follows: Among pregnant women over the age of 35 (patient/problem), what is the accuracy of ultrasound (intervention/experimental test) compared to amniocentesis (control/conventional test) in detecting Down syndrome in fetus (outcome)? Again, the RCT can be eliminated because, in order to determine diagnostic accuracy in an unbiased manner, both tests need to be administered to the same subset of the population. In the case-control study, subjects with the outcome of interest are selected and then matched with healthy controls. Since we do not know whether or not the outcome of Down syndrome is present, a case-control study cannot be used. The cohort study group's subjects are selected based on exposure status followed over time and the incidence of the outcome is calculated. In this clinical scenario, no exposure is described and we are not interested in calculating the incidence of Down syndrome. Accordingly, the characteristics of the cross-sectional study make it the best choice to answer this clinical research question. A cross-sectional study would allow two observations from the same group to be determined. In this case, a sample of pregnant women over the age of 35 would be given both an ultrasound and amniocentesis. The results of the tests would be recorded and the number of true positives and negatives versus the false positives and negatives would be calculated along with positive and negative predictive values.",

The pain was not responsive to conservative medical management including oral opioid therapy. The patient underwent a successful intrathecal opioid trial followed by Intrathecal drug delivery system (IDDS) implantation (Medtronic Synchromed II 40 ml pump) in August 2007. The patient had a history of PDPH following the intrathecal opioid trial before permanent placement and was treated with epidural blood patch to control the headache after failed conservative management. He was followed by his pain physician for intrathecal pump refills and management without problems with good pain control. In December 2013, the elective replacement indicator (ERI) showed 4 months remaining, and non-critical alarm (single tone) started in January 2014. The patient was scheduled for removal of native pump and replacement with new intrathecal pump. In February 2014, the old intrathecal pump was surgically replaced with a new one and it was placed in the same place over the left side of his abdominal wall. Strict aseptic precautions were followed throughout the procedure. He was discharged home the following day without any immediate postoperative complications. The patient followed up with his pain physician weekly during the subsequent 2 weeks. The wound healing was uneventful, and the pump analyses were normal during the follow-up visits. Despite his pain physician\u2019s request, the patient did not follow up with his pain physician for the subsequent four weeks because of bad weather and lack of symptoms.\nSix weeks following the IDDS replacement, the patient woke up in the morning complaining of headache, photophobia, and nausea.

    "cleaned_text": "a 48-year-old male patient presented with chronic neck pain with cervical post laminectomy syndrome following two cervical spine surgeries with no significant medical problems. the pain was not responsive to conservative medical management including oral opioid therapy. the patient underwent a successful intrathecal opioid trial followed by intrathecal drug delivery system (idds) implantation (medtronic synchromed ii 40 ml pump) in august 2007. the patient had a history of pdph following the intrathecal opioid trial before permanent placement and was treated with epidural blood patch to control the headache after failed conservative management. he was followed by his pain physician for intrathecal pump refills and management without problems with good pain control. in december 2013, the elective replacement indicator (eri) showed 4 months remaining, and non-critical alarm (single tone) started in january 2014. the patient was scheduled for removal of native pump and replacement with new intrathecal pump. in february 2014, the old intrathecal pump was surgically replaced with a new one and it was placed in the same place over the left side of his abdominal wall. strict aseptic precautions were followed throughout the procedure. he was discharged home the following day without any immediate postoperative complications. the patient followed up with his pain physician weekly during the subsequent 2 weeks. the wound healing was uneventful, and the pump analyses were normal during the follow-up visits. despite his pain physician's request, the patient did not follow up with his pain physician for the subsequent four weeks because of bad weather and lack of symptoms.\nsix weeks following the idds replacement, the patient woke up in the morning complaining of headache, photophobia, and nausea. he also observed redness and warmth over the left lower abdominal incision site. he denied any drainage or fever. the patient presented to the pain clinic later that day. on examination, patient had localized erythema over the left abdominal wall over the surgical area. there were no signs of tracking of redness over flank or paraspinal area (",

    "original_text": "During dissection of about 60-year-old male cadaver, we observed anomalous positions and branching pattern of the renal vessels causing a congested renal hilum. The variation was bilateral (). The hilar region was dissected carefully and the structures and their relations were clearly defined. The normal architecture of bean shaped kidney was totally distorted bilaterally. Formation of renal pelvis was normal on both kidneys but the variation is as reported below.\nRenal artery (RA) with its normal origin and course from abdominal aorta divided immediately into 2 branches (). The superior branch pierced the upper pole of the kidney without passing through the hilum. It represented the aberrant artery (AA). It gave a thin branch which descended down to the hilum. The inferior branch coursed forward to the hilum and just before entering the substance of the kidney it gave six divisions. The upper 4 branches reached the hilum passing anterior to the renal vein, whereas the lower 2 branches passed posterior to it. The 2 tributaries of renal vein (RV) after emerging from the hilum united to form a single trunk as right renal vein outside the hilum and it drained into the inferior vena cava.\nThe hilum was wide and situated on the anterior surface instead of its normal anatomical situation in the medial border ().\nLeft renal artery arose from abdominal aorta, before entering the hilum branched into 2 divisions. Anterior division presented an arched course superficial to the tributaries of renal veins and gave 6 branches. The upper 2 branches of it represented the aberrant arteries and entered the upper pole of the kidney. One of the aberrant arteries before piercing the substance of the kidney gave the right inferior suprarenal artery. The posterior division ran behind the renal pelvis and posterior division of renal vein and gave 3 branches. So altogether, 8 branches pierced the renal hilum and 2 branches pierced the upper pole of the kidney.\nAnterior and posterior tributaries of renal vein after emerging separately",
