There was no family history of albinism or hypopigmentation, immunological or hematological alterations, or of deaths at an early age.\nDuring her evaluation, pancytopenia and oculocutaneous albinism were identified whilst chest x-rays (CXR) did not show significant alterations. Infectious diseases were ruled out by serological screening and direct observation in blood smears. Analysis for respiratory viruses was positive for adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). She showed normal psychomotor development and her vaccination schedule was up to date. Morphological studies were performed both on peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) samples. Results for PB cells were consistent with CHS alterations. Hypercellular BM with increased levels of the granulocytic series and lower erythroid and lymphocytes series was also observed. In PB as in BM, purple inclusions were detected in both lymphocytes and all stages of the granulocytic series. Intense vacuolization, sometimes with a purple inclusion, was also seen in all cell types (). BM\u2019s flow cytometry showed a normal immunophenotype, with an increase of immature myeloid cells (). NK cells showed defective granule exocytosis with low expression of CD107a on stimulated NK cells () and a slightly reduced cytotoxic capacity () evaluated by degranulation assay.\nDifferential diagnosis by cytogenetic analysis, including conventional karyotype by C-banding and FISH revealed a normal female karyotype (46,XX).

The content of the cyst was anechoic and there was no dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts. A hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan on day 26 of life showed no biliary drainage up to 28 h. A PTTC on day 35 of life showed there was prompt opacification of the known extrahepatic cyst, followed by visualization of a small gallbladder. There was no passage of contrast into bile ducts or the duodenum. Aiming to demonstrate that there was no communication of this cyst with the biliary system as well as to mechanically remove any source of obstruction, the contrast injection was sustained until there was an extraperitoneal perforation of the cyst () (radiation dose: 1.1 mGy). The rationale to sustain the injection was to demonstrate a connection of the cyst with the biliary tree and our experience that there may be a benefit of mechanical lavage of the biliary tract in cases of obstruction by secretions or sludge, which has been reported by our institution in neonates with parenteral nutrition-related cholestasis. An uncomplicated ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed. Intravenous antibiotics were started owing to perforation of the cyst and the patient recovered well from the procedures. The biopsy result was consistent with extrahepatic biliary obstruction.\nAt the time of surgery, a cystic structure, distinct from the gallbladder, was encountered, which was located in the common bile duct.

Pure tone audiometry examination showed the right conductive hearing loss. Impedance test showed that the right was C type and the left was A type. In order to distinguish CSF otorrhea, her middle ear fluid was aspirated, and its glucose level noted 88 mg/dL. Computed tomogram (CT) of temporal bone demonstrated a bony defect adjacent to the soft tissue lesion of posterior wall of the temporal bone with an effusion showing high attenuation in the right mastoid cavity (). Thus, we presumed that CSF otorrhea might be caused by arachnoid granulation. She underwent mastoidectomy under general anesthesia. During a procedure for canal wall-up mastoidectomy, in accordance with the findings of the CT scan, the tissue which was suspected to be arachnoid granulation was observed with the bony defect of the posterior wall. The surrounding bone was removed by a diamond drill. The granulation tissue was placed at the defect of meninx (). The tissue was obtained for a biopsy. The remained granulation tissue was shrunk by bipolar cauterization. The bony defect was reconstructed by the auricular cartilage and perichondrium complex graft. Subsequently, fibrin glue was placed over the graft. The biopsy demonstrated a fibrillary tissue (). Moreover, glial fibrillary acidic protein stain indicated a positive reaction, and we confirmed arachnoid granulation which contained a portion of parenchyma of the cerebrum (). The patient has not had any symptoms of the disorder. In addition, 1 year and 3 months after the surgery, she's been continuing follow up in the outpatient clinics without any complications or recurrence.",

He was a farmer who was admitted to a different hospital for the same reason without any significant improvement in his symptoms. Thus, the patient sought a referral to our hospital. On presentation at the ED, he was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 144/80 mmHg and pulse rate of 88 beats per minute. The abdominal pain was characterized as cramping and was generalized. Associated symptoms included poor appetite, nausea, abdominal distention, cold sweating, and general weakness. The pain was nonradiating and not accompanied by fever, diarrhea, or other symptoms. The abdominal examination showed hepatosplenomegaly and diffuse tenderness to deep palpation of the whole abdomen, without rebound tenderness and guarding. Systemic examinations revealed no abnormalities. The blood test conducted in our ED revealed hypochromic microcytic anemia with basophilic stippling of the erythrocytes, decreased hemoglobin concentration of 9.4 g/dL, and hematocrit level of 27.9%. Liver function test results were mildly abnormal. The white blood cell count and levels of creatinine, glucose, total bilirubin, lipase, and electrolytes were all within their normal limits. Abdominal radiographs and abdominal CT scan revealed no abnormalities. Liver echo, tumor marker, and viral hepatitis screening test results were negative. The patient was admitted to the internal medicine ward with a diagnosis of NSAP. The diagnosis of NSAP was made based on the clinical features and negative examination results. After admission, we performed a urine porphyrin test based on his acute porphyria-like symptoms. Acute intermittent porphyria was diagnosed based on a positive urine porphyrin test result, and hemin therapy was started. However, in spite of the hemin therapy, the pain did not improve, indicating a misdiagnosis. We performed a detailed medical history taking again. The patient reported visiting a local Chinese medicine clinic because of difficulty urinating and six herbal pills",

An MRI of the head and neck showed features that were typical of carotid body tumor. The routine laboratory investigations were within normal limits. The urinary vanilyl mandelic acid (VMA) level was 4.5 mg/day. The high vascularity of the tumor, along with features of arteriovenous shunting, was evident on the angiography (). The tumor was supplied by feeders from the ipsilateral external carotid artery (ECA), internal carotid artery (ICA) and vertebral artery (VA). Preoperative embolization was performed under local anesthesia. Bilateral common femoral punctures were performed and 7 Fr vascular sheaths (Avanti+, Cordis, Miami Lakes, FL) were placed. One femoral access was used for balloon occlusion of the right carotid while the second access was used for performing controlled angiography. Since transarterial embolization through the right ascending pharyngeal artery failed to decrease the tumor's vascularity and the feeders were small in size and multiple in number, a decision was made to inject glue percutaneously into the tumor. Since there was a direct feeder from the right cervical ICA (), a 6 Fr Berman angiographic balloon catheter (Arrow International, PA) was used to occlude the ICA across the origin of the feeder () with injection of glue. 50% glue was carefully injected under fluoroscopy. Care was taken to avoid any glue migration into the arterial or venous side. Glue was injected at three separate sites and more than 90% of the tumor was finally devascularized (). The intracranial circulation was intact, the same as was seen on the preprocedure angiogram (). Neurologically, the patient was intact at the end of the procedure.

Medical history revealed absence of any medical problems; family history revealed that neither parents nor siblings had the same problem and the parents were not of consanguineous marriage.\nExamination of the palms of the hand revealed normal skin, while the soles of the feet revealed very slight hyperkeratosis (\n). Intraoral examination revealed severe gingival recession; inflammation especially in anterior region; aggressive periodontitis; mobility of maxillary left central incisor and canine, with swelling related to the maxillary right missed canine region extending toward occlusal surface. The swelling appeared as a solitary rounded lesion, with onset gradual for 2 months.

He had a history of heavy alcohol intake and used to consume 10 units of alcohol per day and smoked 20 cigarettes/day. The patient had undergone partial gastrectomy and gastroenterostomy for benign gastric ulcer 28 years ago.\nGeneral examination revealed anaemia with no jaundice, clubbing or lymphadenopathy. The pulse rate was 108 beats per minute and blood pressure was 80/50 mm Hg. His laboratory tests revealed Hb 8.9 g/dL and MCV 80.2. Chest and abdominal x-rays were normal. He was transfused four units of packed red blood cells. An urgent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed large amount of fresh blood and clots in the fundus of stomach. A possible bleeding vessel was identified on the anterior wall lesser curve high in the fundus. The lesion was injected with adrenaline 1 in 100,000. In spite of the intervention he continued to have haemetemesis with significant haemodynamic impairment. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy which revealed an oedematous ridge on the posterior wall with a bleeding point on the posterior gastric wall.\nThis was overrun with a Vicryl 2/0 stitch which controlled the bleeding.

She had been biking downhill when she pumped the brakes too hard, causing her to fall forward off her bike and hit her left abdomen on the handle bars. Although the fall was routine for outdoor activity and seemingly minor, she immediately developed severe lower quadrant abdominal pain, which prompted her to seek the nearest emergency department. Upon questioning, she reported an uncomplicated birth history as well as regular pediatric care. She denied history of gross hematuria, urinary tract infections, and abdominal or flank pain before this admission.\nPhysical examination revealed vital signs within the normal range and a well appearing woman in no apparent distress. Her abdomen was tender in the left upper quadrant, but soft, nondistended, and without rash or ecchymosis. Her flanks were nontender and without ecchymosis. Her skin was intact with no evidence of trauma, including laceration, abrasion, or contusion. Her pelvis was stable to anteroposterior and lateral compression. External genital examination revealed normal urethral meatus and vaginal introitus without erythema, edema, or blood. A foley was placed and returned clear light yellow urine.\nLaboratory studies were remarkable only for leukocytosis of 16,000. There was no microscopic hematuria on urinalysis.\nAbdominal CT with intravenous contrast revealed pronounced dilation of the left renal collecting system with a large collection of retroperitoneal fluid. The delayed phase showed contrast opacification of the fluid collection and a \u223c13 mm defect in the anterior left renal pelvis (). No contrast was appreciated within the left ureter, preventing its assessment.

On admission, vital signs showed heart rate of 88 bpm, BP of 115/83 mmhg, oxygen saturation of 95% on room air, and respiratory rate of 18 cpm. Physical examination was within normal limits including no neurological deficits. Computed tomography of the brain showed normal findings with no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage.

A subsequent cardiac 64 multislice CT scan confirmed the absence of the LCX and showed an RCA with a large posterolateral artery that supplied the entire lateral wall. The LAD was normal ().

    "original_text": "A 53-year-old woman with a known history of metastatic breast cancer managed with docetaxel/bevacizumab and Zometa presented with three weeks of upper cervical pain. She also had complaints of right-sided numbness to her face and neck and decreased range of motion. Her upper neck pain was so severe that she could not sit up for more than one minute before she needed to lay down for pain relief. Due to the severe pain, she was admitted to the hospital for workup and management. Her neurological examination was normal. CT and an MRI of the cervical spine revealed diffuse osseous metastatic disease of the cervical spine as well as a pathological fracture of axis with collapse and retropulsion causing significant atlantoaxial subluxation and deformity at the craniovertebral junction. There was also evidence for bony disease involving the skull base at the level of the foramen magnum as well as the subaxial spine (Figures , ).\nCase management\nA multidisciplinary meeting that involved medical and radiation oncology and neurological surgery was conducted. The patient\u2019s estimated survival was at least one year, and her Karnofsky score was 100. Given that the pathological fracture was causing atlantoaxial instability, the treatment algorithm included surgical stabilization.\nUse of Crown Halo Traction\nDue to evidence of instability of the craniovertebral junction requiring surgical stabilization, the patient was initially transferred to the neurosurgical ICU for crown halo traction to reduce the chronic subluxation. After being placed in a 24-hour crown halo traction of 15 pounds, both her upper cervical pain and C1/C2 alignment on lateral x-ray improved.

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a well-demarcated inhomogeneously enhanced solid mass in the posterior wall of the stomach (Fig. ). CT also showed a slightly enhanced lesion on the right side of the uterus (Fig. a). T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mass around the uterus (Fig. b).

His medical history included no systemic disease other than hypertension that had been present for 5 years and was controlled with medical treatment. In ophthalmologic examination, his corrected visual acuity was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.2 in the left eye. He had no history of previous ocular surgery, and anterior segment examination was normal. Fundus examination revealed no pathology in the right eye but BRVO was detected in the superotemporal region of the left eye (). Intraocular pressure was 15 mmHg in the right and 14 mmHg in the left eye. Fundus fluorescein angiography of the left eye showed late filling, dilation, and increased tortuosity of the superotemporal retina vein and areas of capillary nonperfusion consistent with BRVO (). Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated retinal thickening (710 \u00b5m) and cystoid macular edema (). The patient was diagnosed with macular edema associated with BRVO and Ozurdex was injected. The injection was done in aseptic conditions from the superotemporal quadrant 4 mm from the limbus using the recommended standard procedure. During implantation, slight deflation of the globe and momentary hypotony were observed immediately after inserting the sharp tip of the implant through the sclera and before pulling the trigger, despite the absence of vitreous leakage. Vitreous leakage or hypotony were not observed after injection and no complications were noted in routine follow-up examination the next day.\nAt 1-month follow-up, the patient\u2019s visual acuity had increased to 0.5.

There was no associated dysuria or any past history of urological problems. Physical examination, vitals, and basic laboratory workup were unremarkable.\nUrine cytology revealed the presence of hematuria, pyuria, and cells with atypical morphology and the cytology was reported as suspicious for malignancy. Cystoscopy was performed which showed the presence of a 5 cm \u00d74 cm \u00d7 3 cm, solid looking tumor in the posterolateral surface of the bladder along with multiple small cauliflower like papillary tumor in the dome and the posterior wall. Computerized tomography (CT) of the lower abdomen revealed the growth [] along with the presence of multiple enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. No evidence of distant metastasis was observed. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) was done using 1.5% glycine irrigation and monopolar cautery and the sample obtained was sent for histopathological examination, with a clinical working diagnosis of lymphoma, owing to the unusual solid appearance of the tumor and presence of the regional lymph node enlargement. On histopathological examination, the tumor was predominantly composed of the lymphoepithelioma-like component which comprised more than 90% of the tumor [].

However, his symptoms persisted and he was referred to our department.\nOn examination, the child was afebrile, having a body mass index of 17. His system examination was normal, except for occasional crackles in the left infra scapular region. Chest X-ray showed a dense consolidation in the paracardiac region [], which had cleared significantly after initiation of anti-tubercular treatment [].

Her past medical history was significant for a 19-year history of recurrent pulmonary lobar collapse from mucus plugs with cultures positive for Aspergillus and thus bore a diagnosis of CPA. She had no documented history of wheezing, peripheral eosinophilia or obvious clinical response to oral steroids, and thus was deemed unlikely to have allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (). Although she had previously been treated intermittently with itraconazole, the patient had not been on any antifungal therapy for 6 weeks prior to presentation due to difficulty in maintaining therapeutic levels of itraconazole to treat pulmonary aspergillosis (). The patient\u2019s radiographic abnormalities and clinical symptoms resolved after a mucus plug was removed by bronchoscopy, and subsequent cultures from mucus material grew Aspergillus fumigatus. To reduce the risk of recurrent bronchial collapse due to CPA, the patient was started on oral voriconazole 200 mg twice daily.

Transvaginal ultrasonography showed an enlarged uterus with endometrial thickening with an echogenic pattern (Fig. ). As endometrial cancer was suspected first, an endometrial biopsy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. The endometrial biopsy revealed decidual tissues, and the MRI revealed invasion of a uterine corpus tumor into the myometrium (Fig. ).

Second endometrial biopsy was done and serum \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level was also measured owing to suspicion of a hydatidiform mole. The serum hCG level was over 225 000 mIU/mL, and the endometrial biopsy revealed a complete hydatidiform mole. Because the patient's hemoglobin level was 7.0 g/dL, owing to the continuation of uterine bleeding, we transfused 800 mL of red cell concentrate and discharged the patient. A lung metastasis, 1 cm in diameter, was observed on a contrast computer tomography scan (Fig. ), and an invasive mole with lung metastasis was diagnosed.

    "original_text": "The patient is a 55-year-old male employed as a professor in the USA. At Age 42, he consulted his general practitioner for major depressive disorder and was prescribed fluoxetine, eventually titrated to 40 mg. Pharmacotherapy combined with psychotherapy generally relieved the worst episodes of depressive disorder, but occasional relapses occurred for the next 10 years or more. On at least three occasions, the patient discontinued the fluoxetine when the depression was in remission, but symptoms returned within a few months each time and he resumed taking the medication. When he was 46, his general practitioner suggested adding fish oil supplements to his regimen, particularly those that are enriched in EPA, at a dose of 2\u20133 g/day total lipids. He began taking with morning meals two 1-g softgels per day of fish oil that contained 6 : 1 EPA : DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 500 mg EPA per softgel). The patient reported that the supplements seemed to noticeably relieve his depressive symptoms. He continued taking the same brand of high-EPA fish oil daily for 8 years (Metagenics \u2018EPA 500 Concentrate\u2019, formerly named \u2018EPA : DHA 6 : 1\u2019) and while the depressive episodes did not completely abate for several more years, they became shorter in duration and more manageable. At Age 54, he had not experienced a significant relapse for over a year so he once again tapered off the fluoxetine. Of note, until this time he had not reported any significant anxiety symptoms. The patient exercises regularly and is in excellent health. Other significant history includes asthma that is well controlled and a cerebral aneurysm successfully treated with endovascular coiling at Age 52.

The patient was referred 2 years post trauma to a wound centre as the wound had failed to heal after 6 months of treatment by his General Practitioner.\nAt the wound centre the patient received treatment for a non-healing ulcer by means of various ointments, honey and dressings, with a view to referral for skin transplantation if the wound did not heal satisfactorily. It is noted that the patient was not diabetic and did not have any cardiovascular risk factors but was undergoing follow-up for aortastenosis and polycythemia vera. There was initially improvement in the wound over an approximately six-month period, but due to the return of hypergranulation tissue, increasing size of the wound and a request from the patient, a punch biopsy of the wound was taken which confirmed basal cell carcinoma. The patient was referred to The Department of Plastic Surgery and Breast Surgery, Roskilde Hospital for excision of the carcinoma. The ulcer, approximately 4 cm in diameter (), was surgically excised with a 5 mm margin, without the use of frozen sections, and covered with a split thickness skin transplant. The histology showed an ulcerated basal cell carcinoma of nodular type, with growth deep into the dermis, but not involving the subcutaneous tissue. Histology also showed that the BCC was radically removed. Post-operative control included follow up in the Plastic Surgery clinic for approximately one month. After the skin transplant healed the patient was discharged from follow up in our clinic to yearly control at his Dermatologist. There has been no local recurrence of the BCC. The patient was subsequently diagnosed, with diabetes mellitus type two (DMT2) and started treatment with dietary changes and exercise.",

Management of her symptoms consisted of empirical intravenous antibiotics, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, and clinical observation.\nHer condition did not improve and her white blood count (WBC) increased significantly (24 000/\u03bcL). She was consequently transferred to a referral centre where she was brought to the operating room for an exploration of the surgical site.

No pneumatosis was noted. An exploratory laparoscopy was thus performed to rule out rectal necrosis, and revealed an important amount of serous ascites. The patient was suffering after the surgical procedure from a severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and required several days of intensive care. Due to clinical deterioration and persistent leukocytosis (25 000/\u03bcL), she was transferred to our tertiary care centre with a suspicion of ischaemic colitis.\nUpon arrival, her hemodynamic and respiratory status deteriorated rapidly and ventilator support was necessary for an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Four years earlier, he underwent a resection for prostate carcinoma.\nA clinical examination revealed no abnormalities other than a firm mass on the right side of his lower lip (Fig. ), without palpable cervical lymphadenopathy. Because squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip was suspected, he was scheduled for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his head and neck area. The MRI showed next to a tumorous contrast-affine process of approximately 1.2 cm in diameter on his right lower lip, a 3\u00d72 cm2 polycyclic arranged mucosal thickening with cystic and solid contrast affine shares at the antral laterocaudal area of his right maxillary sinus, extending from his right lateral nasal wall to maxillary sinus floor. There was no evidence of bony erosion or other cervicofacial lesions. Under general anesthesia, he received the following procedures: an excisional biopsy at the lip lesion with 5 mm safety margins and bilateral sentinel lymph node biopsy, and antral polypectomy with medial maxillectomy via a unilateral LeFort I osteotomy approach with preservation of his pterygoid plate. Histological examination of the hematoxylin-eosin specimens demonstrated well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lip (not shown). The antral lesion was a tumor composed of hyperplastic squamous epithelium protruding into the stroma (surface epithelial cells grew downward into the underlying supportive tissue), thus producing a grossly convoluted cerebriform appearance.\nHe was hospitalized for 2 weeks (12 days) after the surgery and did well postoperatively. Two weeks later, he regained a well-formed maxilla without any restrictions.

Chest CT demonstrated a well-circumscribed mass in the right thoracic cavity measuring 28 cm \u00d7 9 cm \u00d7 10 cm that was compressing the right lower lobe (Fig. a). The mass comprised mostly fatty tissue, and any other organs such as intestinal tract were not included in the mass (Fig. b). The results of blood chemistry studies, including tumor markers, were within normal ranges. Thus, the following differential diagnosis were considered: lipoma, liposarcoma, and diaphragmatic hernia. Surgery was performed for diagnosis and treatment via a small lateral thoracotomy via the seventh intercostal space with thoracoscopic assistance. A retroperitoneal fat pad of 28 cm in size was slid into the thoracic cavity from the right lumbocostal triangle, as the hernia orifice (Fig. a, b). The size of orifice was about 8 \u00d7 5 cm. We transected the neck of the fat pad above the orifice, because the hernia content in the thoracic cavity was larger than the orifice and difficult to reduce. Several feeding arteries contained in the stem were dissected by a vessel-sealing device. The orifice was closed by suturing the surrounding diaphragmatic muscle and the chest wall. The collapsed lung could be re-expanded by positive pressure ventilation without developing acute lung edema. The operation time was 112 min and the total blood loss 220 g.

On routine chest x-ray performed before orthopaedic surgery, the suspicion arose of a mediastinal mass. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a cystic mass in the posterior mediastinum between the aortic arch and the vertebral bodies (Figure ). The cyst extended from the 3rd thoracic vertebral body to the tracheal carina plane, with a length of 4 cm and a transversal diameter of 2.5 cm. The lesion appeared cystic with a well defined capsule and lacking enhancement after intravenous contrast injection. Surgical treatment was decided upon. Preoperative bronchoscopy excluded any communication between the cyst and the tracheobronchial tree. After double lumen intubation, the patient was placed in a right lateral position on the operating table. Three trocars were used: one on the fifth intercostal space along the anterior axillary line; one on the fifth intercostal space along the posterior axillary line; and the last one on the 7th intercostal space along the midaxillary line. The cyst was visualized by thoracoscopy, appearing with a major adhesion on the distal portion of the aortic arch (Figure ). To facilitate surgical dissection of the cystic lesion from the aorta, fluid aspiration was performed (Figure ). Once the cyst was empty, complete resection from the adherent aorta was easily completed (Figure ). However, despite total lesion excision, we completed the surgical procedure by passing the electrocautery on the pleural area where the cyst was adherent (Figure ). The procedure was completed with insertion of a chest tube. Histology examination confirmed the diagnosis of benign bronchogenic cyst with the typical feature of a ciliated columnar epithelial lining. The postoperative (PO) course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home on the 5th PO day. At 12 months follow-up the patient remains well with no recurrence on control CT scan.",

The patient complained of dysphagia, food intolerance, and headaches. The patient was febrile and stated that the abscess is draining and painful. His medical history was negative for illicit drug use, sexually transmitted disease, or trauma. His blood pressure was 120/65 mmHg, respiratory rate was 17 breaths/min, heart rate was 116 beats/min, the temperature was 100.5\u00b0F, and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Physical examination showed a large neck abscess extending from the right mastoid to the anterior neck with tenderness and some scalp drainage (Figures , ).\nA CT scan of the neck with IV contrast revealed fluid collection with a thick, peripherally enhancing rim in the soft tissues of the right posterior neck (Figure ). The abscess extended from the superficial soft tissues of the right occipital region and traveled inferiorly and anteriorly to the approximate level of the thyroid. Soft tissue edema was noted up to the level of the sternoclavicular joint (Figure ). Nodular thickening was also observed in the right and left posterior scalp soft tissues along with persistent cervical lymphadenopathy.

Chest-enhanced CT after admission revealed a space-occupying lesion in the right chest. The pathological diagnosis according to percutaneous lung biopsy was a solitary fibrous tumor. Preoperative three-dimensional reconstruction showed that the blood supply to the tumor originated from the arteries and veins of the right lower lobe (Fig. ). After complete preoperative preparation, the patient underwent resection of the tumor with single-operation-incision thoracoscopy. Incision selection is one cm for the endoscope port (at the midaxillary line of the seventh intercostal space) and two cm for the operation port (at the preaxillary line of the fifth intercostal space). Intraoperative exploration revealed that the tumor had two tumor pedicles (Fig. ), and both were located in the right lower lobe. The tumor pedicles were intraoperatively separated using a linear stapling device. Because the specimen was large and the surface was smooth, bagging the specimen by the traditional method was difficult; therefore, the specimen was bagged by adjusting the operating table. The detailed procedure was as follows: First, the operating table was arranged with the head at a lower position, and the specimen bag was inserted into the thoracic cavity.
