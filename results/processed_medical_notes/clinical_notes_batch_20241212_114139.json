In January 2018, a routine gastrointestinal endoscopy found an ulcerative lesion of approximately 10 mm diameter in the greater curvature of the gastric body (Fig. ). An endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) of this lesion showed the first three sonographic layers were blurred, which suggested submucosal invasion.

After temporary relief, his symptoms recurred and the sputum showed presence of acid fast bacilli. The child was restarted on antitubercular treatment, which was administered for 2 years. Radiological investigations revealed the presence of a left intrathoracic mass. The child underwent thoracotomy and biopsy elsewhere. The biopsy was suggestive of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor of the lung. The child was started on prednisolone but remained symptomatic. Subsequently, the child was referred to our institution for definitive treatment. His general condition was good and there was no evidence of respiratory distress. On examination, the movements of the chest wall were diminished on the left side. The left hemithorax was dull on percussion and the air entry was absent. The right side was normal. Chest radiograph showed the presence of a homogenous opacity in the left hemithorax with large areas of calcification in the hilar region. A contrast enhanced CT scan of the chest revealed a large soft tissue mass in the left lung with dense calcification and collapse of the lung. The child underwent thoracotomy; there was a soft tissue mass arising from the left lung and densely adherent to the pericardium, aorta, and thymus. Large mediastinal lymph nodes were present and the left pulmonary vein and artery were encased by the mass. Complete excision of the mass along with the involved pericardium and left pneumonectomy was performed. The child suffered a cardiac arrest during surgery but was revived immediately. Postoperatively, the child required ventilator support for 7 days. The child was subsequently discharged in a stable condition with no neurological deficit.

She had associated intermittent fever, nausea, and loss of appetite. She did not have any urinary symptoms, bowel irregularities, or gynecological complaints. Abdominal examination was performed by two senior surgeons at two different occasions; the same day had findings of guarding and rebound tenderness at RIF. Hematological tests showed polymorphonuclear leukocytosis with left shift. Biochemical tests and urinalysis were normal. Urinary pregnancy test was negative. Abdominal radiographs were unremarkable. USG could not visualize appendix and was inconclusive except for probe tenderness in RIF. CT scan of the abdomen could not be done due to unavailability.

Her past medical history included chronic obstructive airways disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. The patient is a current smoker, with a history of 20 pack-years. Preoperative chest radiography, electrocardiogram, full blood count, and serum biochemistry were within the normal range. After being diagnosed with SCC as a result of incisional biopsy, the patient underwent the resection of SCC on the right buccal mucosa of the mandible, modified radical neck dissection, and primary reconstruction with a fibula-free flap. Tourniquet pressure was 300 mm/Hg, and its application time was 60 min. Total on-table time was approximately 7 h. Upon admission to the SICU after the 7-h operation, hypothermia and hypotension were noted. On the first postoperative day, the patient exhibited oliguria and proteinuria and elevation of CK, AST, ALT, and LDH. Together with the nephrology and neurology staff, we tried to figure out our patient\u2019s symptoms and clinical findings. We thought that her clinical picture was based on an impression in which acute renal failure was diagnosed as secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Thus, she was managed with high-dose loop diuretic therapy. Additionally, we gave her hepatotonic to recover her liver function. The patient was supplemented with 150 to 250 mL/h of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution and 0.9% NaCl. When the volume was full, urine output of above 100 mL/h was maintained by 20 mg intravenous injection with furosemide.\nHer urine output for the first hour is at 20 mL/hour, but after the medication, her urine output began to improve on day 4 with a corresponding reversal in the serum creatinine. After postoperative day 4, the muscular enzyme showed a downward trend. We treated the patient with medication and hydration, and then the result became favorable. In the end, she was able to recover fully from the symptoms. Figures",

Prominent caf\u00e9-au-lait skin lesions were observed on the patient's neck and midchest [Figure -]. His father and brother had similar dermatologic signs, the latter having died at the age of 6 years due to T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. He also had an older brother who died owing to congenital heart disease []. MRI of the brain showed an isolated lesion in the left mesial-temporal lobe []. Microsurgical total removal of the lesion was performed. Histological diagnosis confirmed a typical cavernous hemangioma.

It was associated with left periorbital swelling and eye redness. He had a fever with a left leg abscess for four days prior to eye symptoms. He was treated with an oral antibiotic for the leg abscess.\nOn examination, he was not toxic-looking and afebrile. His vital sign was stable with a blood pressure of 120/84 mmHg and the pulse rate was 84 beat per minute. Visual acuity of the right eye was 6/9 and the left eye was hand movement. There was a positive relative afferent pupillary defect on the left eye.\nLeft eye examination showed periorbital swelling with generalized redness (Figure ). The conjunctiva was injected with chemosis at the lateral part and mild corneal haziness centrally. There was a presence of whitish fibrin covering the pupil and the height of the hypopyon was 1.5 mm with cells 4+ in the anterior chamber (Figure ). The pupil was round, 3 mm in size, and reactive to light. Intraocular pressure was 17 mmHg. There was a mild restriction of eye movement in all directions.

His past medical history indicated the successful balloon angioplasty and stenting for coarctation of the aorta (COA) at the age of 15, which left an arterial hypertension and no significant residual COA, and in the follow-up periods. His clinical evaluation based on the chest X-ray findings showed cardiomegaly, particularly, in the right ventricle and pulmonary congestion (). Laboratory data showed that he had a mild increase in the serum creatinine (Cr), bilirubin (BIL), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Furthermore, transthoracic echocardiographic examination (TTE) indicated that the patient had a large VSD and prolapse of the noncoronary cusp of the aorta into the VSD due to severe aortic regurgitation. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) index was about 40%, left ventricle end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) was 75 mm, and left ventricle end systolic diameter (LVESD) was 55 mm. The catheterization prior to surgery indicated that Qp/Qs was 2.2. Also his pulmonary artery pressure was estimated to be 60 mm Hg and the pulmonary artery pressure to aortic pressure ratio was 0.7.\nAfter his complete evaluation, surgery was recommended. After initiating the cardiopulmonary bypass machine and arresting the heart function, a significant aortic valve insufficiency with perforation of the right and left aortic cusps in the base segment was observed. In addition, prolapse of the noncoronary aortic cusp into the large subarterial VSD was seen.

This non-inflamed, non-draining, painless, 1\u20132 cm cyst had been present for close to 10 years without change in size or fluctuance. The cyst was initially drained by the PCP, but, when it recurred 6 months later, the PCP excised the cyst and sent the specimen for routine pathology. The initial read of the tissue sample was high-grade invasive carcinoma with squamous features and arising in association with a PTT. Based on the pathology, the PCP referred the patient to a plastic surgeon for a more definitive excision of the lesion and repair of the defect. The lesion was excised with negative margins and pathology read as invasive high-grade squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Eight months post resection, the lesion recurred locally along with a palpable right posterior cervical lymph node (LN). A positron emission tomography (PET) scan at that time demonstrated hypermetabolic activity in the posterior occiput and in a posterior neck LN. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of both the primary scalp lesion and LN were completed, and pathology was reported as SCC, similar to the primary lesion.\nWith a working diagnosis of locally advanced SCC, the patient\u2019s care was referred to a tertiary care center. There, a dermatopathologist re-evaluated the previous biopsy specimens and altered the diagnosis from SCC to MPTT (Fig. ). Subsequently, the patient was referred to a head and neck surgeon for modified radical posterior neck and lymph node dissection.

The patient was not a candidate for fibrinolytic therapy due to unknown duration of symptoms and she was transferred to our facility for thrombectomy which was successfully performed. She was transferred to the intensive care unit in stable condition. Shortly after this, she complained of nausea and chest discomfort. 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrated acute anterior STEMI (Figure ). Bedside echocardiogram showed hypokinesia of the entire apex (Video ).\nEmergent CT of the head was performed prior to possible PCI and revealed hemorrhagic conversion in the basal ganglia (Figure ). Because of the new hemorrhagic conversion, we decided not to intervene with close monitoring in the intensive care unit.\nForty-five minutes later, the patient developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and electrical cardioversion. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved and amiodarone was initiated. Given these findings the decision was made to proceed with emergent coronary angiogram with plans for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) without the use of antithrombotic or antiplatelet therapy. Coronary angiography via femoral approach revealed thrombotic occlusion of the mid left anterior descending (LAD) artery (Figure ), 80% stenosis in a large obtuse marginal branch (Figure ) and chronic total occlusion of right coronary artery (RCA) (Figure ).\nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) was rapidly performed using 2.0 x 15 mm compliant balloon with resultant TIMI III flow (Figure ).\nTwo days later the patient was started on aspirin 81 mg daily.

Her history goes back to 1 year prior to presentation when she started to experience rare brief focal aware clonic seizures semiologically characterized by twitching of the left side of the face. On a combination of lamotrigine and levetiracetam, her opercular seizures were relatively well controlled with a breakthrough seizure every 1 to 2 months. Her workup included an epilepsy protocol MRI that was normal and a 3 h video/EEG recording, which revealed a normal posterior background and fragments of generalized spike-wave discharges (GSWDs) with a right sided amplitude predominance, thought to represent an inherited EEG trait (). A post-acquisition morphometric analysis of the brain MRI revealed a suspicious lesion in the right insula based on a high z score on the junction map (). Moreover, a volumetric brain analysis revealed no volume difference between the right and left gray matter structures and did not show any global atrophy or asymmetry between the two hemispheres.\nOn the day of her admission, the patient presented to the emergency department (ED) in focal aware motor status epilepticus of 2 days duration with seizures characterized by left gaze deviation associated with left facial twitches and left upper extremity clonic jerking. Her vital signs were stable and her physical and neurological examinations were otherwise unrevealing. The patient was monitored with continuous video/EEG that revealed near continuous seizures originating from the right fronto-central area.

She had no complains of bleeding or discharge from vagina and her bowel habits were normal. Her general physical examination was normal. On detailed gynecologic examination, it was found that there was a fleshy smooth surfaced mass measuring 5 \u00d7 4 cm occupying the vaginal cavity. Per speculum examination could not be done owing to lack of space, and on digital palpation a firm mass was felt at the cervicovaginal region on the right side. The overlying vaginal mucosa was smooth. Per rectal examination was normal. A pelvic ultrasonography (USG) revealed a mass in the pelvic region. Chest X-ray, upper abdominal USG, cystoscopy, and proctoscopy yielded normal findings. The overall clinical impression was of a cervicovaginal mass with the provisional diagnosis of a cervical fibroid. Subsequently, she was taken up for surgery. Intraoperative findings revealed a pelvic tumor in the paravaginal region, which was adherent to the surrounding region, and hence was taken out piecemeal. Ultimately, she underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo oophorectomy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection owing to the suspicion of a malignant growth. Postoperative histopathology reported that cervix, vagina, endometrium, tubes, and ovaries were normal. The histology of the tumor was consistent with malignant round cell tumor []. Immunostaining with desmin and cytokeratin was negative but for CD99 it was positive, ultimately favoring the diagnosis of Primitive Neuroectodermal tumor []. The patient underwent adjuvant chemotherapy with three cycles of Ifosfamide and Etoposide alternating with Vincristine, Doxorubicin, and Cyclophosphamide (VAC/IE). After three cycles, she was treated with pelvic radiotherapy to a total dose of 50 Gy in 25 # over 5 weeks. Post radiotherapy she again received three cycles",

She was non-compliant with her medication citing lack of symptoms as her reason for non-compliance. She presented with complaints of generalized weakness and fatigue for the past 6 days, along with weightloss of an uncertain number over the previous months.

Additionally, she reported early satiety; only being able to tolerate approximately two spoonfuls of food before she felt full. This was also associated with increased abdominal girth which was noted during the previous months. There was no reported yellowing of the eyes, dark urine or pale stool. Menarche was reported to be at age 12, with regular periods that lasted approximately for 5 days, requiring 3\u20134 changes of partially soiled pads per day. There was no history of sexual contact, intravenous drug use, or blood transfusions. She also reported having significant exercise intolerance; only being able to walk about 20.0 m before she became tired.

However, two days prior to the surgery she had a positive pregnancy test and the surgery was cancelled. The elective surgery was rebooked for a later date to avoid the risk of miscarriage, as this was a wanted pregnancy. Serial first trimester follow up sonograms were subsequently performed.\nAt 12 weeks gestation, the patient presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain. Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound demonstrated enlargement in diameter of the left ovarian cyst to 12 cm with diffuse low-level internal echoes and a mural nodule with solid, lobulated appearance as well as marked increased vascularity on color Doppler ().

No significant point was detected in her thorough physical examination. She had no history of infertility or any significant medical disease or surgery before pregnancy. Her first trimester of pregnancy had normal course with no pathologic finding in sonography or lab data. When she was at 26 weeks of gestational age, she developed with acute abdomen and vomiting and was transferred to the operation room by an obstetrician in her local area. Her operation notes revealed a 4.5 cm degenerated posterior wall uterine myoma with active bleeding and about 3 liters of intra-abdominal blood loss. Patient hemostasis by suturing and blood transfusion was performed.\nAt gestational age of 36 weeks and 4 days, she was referred to our high-risk perinatology clinic affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences which is a referral center of perinatology in the south of Iran due to suspicion to cervical malignancy in a local sonography. In perinatology ward sonography, there was a single living fetus with breech presentation. The biometry revealed a biparietal diameter of 97th centile, abdominal circumference of 23rd centile, and estimated fetal weight of 2851, which is the 41st centile for 36 weeks and 4 days of gestational age. Reassuring pattern of color Doppler and normal amniotic fluid index (14 cm) were reported. There were multiple hypo-echoic areas in the placenta as well as a heterogeneous mass measuring 77*88*66 mm in the lower part of the uterus.

She denied nausea, vomiting, or photo- or phonophobia. Fifteen days after the pain onset, she noticed double vision and medial deviation of the right eye, which forced her to wear an eyepiece to perform her activities and drive. She went to several centers and used various medications such as paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, and triptans without improvement. Three months earlier, she started using dexamethasone 4 mg daily with partial pain control but maintenance of diplopia.\nAt the examination, the patient had cushingoid face, violaceous striae, and right VI cranial nerve palsy with no other neurological changes. Blood tests were normal (). A contrast-enhanced MRI scan of the brain did not show any remarkable features (). A spinal tap released crystalline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with an opening pressure of 14 cm of water. Biochemical, microbiological, and cytological analyses of the CSF were normal (). CT scan of thorax did not show any evidence of lymphoma or sarcoidosis.\nPrednisone 1mg / kg was then started. With one week of treatment, complete reversal of ocular paralysis and remission of pain were observed. However, when the corticoid was gradually withdrawn, the patient returned to pain and returned to paralysis of the VI right pair. The prednisone was increased again to 1 mg / kg this time with reversion of ocular paralysis but without pain control.
