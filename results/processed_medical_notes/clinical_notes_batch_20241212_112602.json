    "original_text": "A 70-year-old man with a T3V1N0M0 rectal tumor underwent laparoscopic APR followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and calcium folinate. At 1 year control, radiological work-up and colonoscopy showed no signs of recurrence or distant metastases. Thirteen months after the APR, the patient developed a perineal hernia and had a reconstruction of the pelvic floor with a biological mesh (Permacol\u2122) via a transperineal approach. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the initial follow-up with a pelvic\u2013abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan 4 months after the surgery showed no signs of locoregional recurrence or reherniation. Nine months after the perineal hernia operation, the patient experienced weight loss. A thoracic\u2013abdominal CT scan was performed and showed multiple metastases to the liver and lungs. The patient was treated with chemotherapy: bevacizumab, irinotecan, calcium folinate, and fluorouracil. Twelve months after the perineal hernia operation, but only 6 weeks into chemotherapy, the patient developed signs of sepsis with a high temperature, tachycardia, and hypotension and complained of pain in the right buttock. Physical examination showed signs of infection at the area. Possible differential diagnoses could have been local recurrence of the rectal cancer, intraabdominal abscess, or pelvis sepsis. We could have chosen to examine the patient with a positron emission tomography scan or, for example, an ultrasound (US)-guided biopsy, but we chose an acute US examination. This revealed an abscess, and drainage was established by a US-guided procedure. The patient was moved to an intensive unit and started treatment with intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The following CT scan with contrast given through the drain showed a subcutaneous abscess cavity located in the perineum, with communication to the small bowel (). The patient underwent a laparotomy, and operative findings confirmed a perineal fistula from the distal ileum (). A resection of the small bowel with primary anastomosis was performed. The postoperative course was complicated by severe fluid and electrolyte",

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a polypoid ulcerated tumor with purple pigmentation and vascular appearance protruding into the esophageal lumen, located 27\u201335 cm from the incisors (fig. ). Due to its vascular appearance, endoscopic biopsy was not initially performed; however, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) demonstrated an iso-hypoechoic, heterogeneous solid tumor mass, including cystic-anechoic areas 5 cm in diameter, in the esophageal wall. Doppler ultrasonography showed that the lesion was not a vascular mass but contained a few intratumoral vascular flows towards the periphery of the lesion. EUS demonstrated that the tumor had not penetrated the adventitia of the esophageal wall. Although the tumor was adjacent to large vessels and the left atrium, tumor features were not found in the vessel, and the interface echo was preserved between the tumor and the vessels (fig. ).

    "original_text": "A 41-year-old Caucasian female presented with a two-month progressive history of left-sided anterior knee pain, associated with an inability to fully flex the knee. She attributed her symptoms to an initial minor twisting injury whilst standing up from a kneeling position. Interestingly she admitted to spend considerable time kneeling down on the floor both at work as a teacher as well as recreationally. Paracetamol and Ibuprofen provided only temporary pain relief, whilst physiotherapy had exacerbated her pain and stiffness. There was no significant past medical history nor any previous knee symptoms. She eventually presented to the senior author (DB) 8 weeks following the onset of her symptoms.\nClinical examination revealed her left knee to be held in an extension posture. No joint effusion was noted, but a firm tender swelling was palpable along the anterolateral knee joint line. Mild tenderness was also noted at the lateral patellofemoral joint. Range of both active as well as passive flexion was limited to 40 degrees, whereas she could extend normally to 5 degree hyperextension. No ligamentous instability was noted, and McMurray's test for meniscal pathology was too painful to perform. We describe this clinical presentation as \u201creverse locking,\u201d implying a mechanical block to knee flexion.\nInitial anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs were reported as normal, but retrospectively a cystic swelling in the infrapatellar region could be suspected on the lateral view (Figures and ). Subsequent T2/STIR sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed a large high signal intensity lesion arising from the tibial footprint of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), though the ligament itself returned a normal signal.

His diabetes had been diagnosed 10 years before. Metabolic control during this time was very poor because of alchoholism. One month before being admitted to the emergency room, he experienced sudden onset of increasing localized pain in the left thigh while resting. He had no fever or chills. Relatives said he did not experience trauma, skin lesions and insect bites. Analgesics only mildly soothed the pain. In the following weeks, he was unable to walk. Common oral analgesics no longer delivered relief from moderate to severe pain. He remained at rest until three days before admission when the encephalopathy worsened. During physical examination, he had no fever. His blood pressure was at 110/70 mmHg, his pulse rate was at 112. His respiratory rate was 24 per minute. He was conscious and oriented with grade II encephalopathy. Upon examining the left thigh, a 10 \u00d7 10 cm mass was located in the anterior and external part of the middle portion of the thigh. This lesion was not well-defined. It was tender and associated with tense skin with erythema, ecchymoses and an increase in temperature. He The patient experienced increased pain in the thigh when moving the limb. There was no peripheral edema. Ollow's sign and Homman's sign were absent. On neurological examination, vibratory and pain perception were bilaterally decreased.\nBlood testing (see table ) showed a macrocytic, normochromic anemia with neutrophilic leucocytosis, thrombocytopenia and prolongation of coagulation times.

Echocardiogram showed akinesis of the anteroseptal wall and a 40 \u00d7 27-mm pseudoaneurysm around the apex of the heart, moving in synchrony with the heartbeat, and a 17% LV ejection fraction (Figure , , Video S2). The connection was confirmed between the pseudoaneurysm and the left ventricle with a spontaneous echo contrast. An underlying infection could have contributed to the formation of the pseudoaneurysm. We theorize that as the pseudoaneurysm progressed, the tissue along its path of progression was mechanically damaged.

Her medical history included primary carnitine deficiency, a rare inherited metabolic disorder that causes cardiomyopathy, which was diagnosed as asymptomatic during her infancy following the death of her infant brother from cardiomyopathy related to the condition. Her diagnosis was established by impaired cultured fibroblast carnitine uptake. Her genotype is unknown. She was prescribed oral carnitine replacement, 400 mg TDS, but had been not compliant with this therapy for the preceding three months. She reported no history suggestive of cardiac failure or arrhythmia. Cardiovascular and respiratory examination was normal. Chest X-ray revealed an increased cardiothoracic ratio. Electrocardiogram demonstrated enlarged peaked T waves and a short QT interval (). Her serum total carnitine level was 4 \u03bcmol/l (21\u201370).

    "original_text": "An 82-year-old male presented with a right preauricular mass for an 18-month duration. The mass was nontender and had grown rapidly in the previous 6 months. His past medical history is notable for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) diagnosed in 2004 which was not treated. Additionally, he has a history of right-sided RCC status post partial nephrectomy in 1990 as well as a tumor which developed in the left adrenal gland in 2007 for which he underwent total adrenalectomy and nephrectomy. Pathology from this excision was consistent with RCC, though it is unclear if this represented a metastatic lesion from his original site or a second primary tumor.\nCT scan of the neck revealed a 4 by 3.5 cm enhancing lesion in the right parotid gland involving the superficial and deep aspects of the gland (). In order to differentiate between an intraparotid lymphoma and other etiologies of parotid tumors, fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed. The specimen contained blood with increased amount of monotonous small-sized lymphocytes. A portion of the specimen was sent for flow cytometry analysis and result was consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Given the patient's medical history and the sanguineous nature of the needle aspirate, a broad differential diagnosis, including RCC, was still being considered.\nThe patient underwent total parotidectomy. Once the lesion was encountered, frozen section analysis revealed metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The tumor encased the main trunk of the facial nerve and had a robust angiogenic response.

She was having intermittent pain for past six months, which had aggravated since the past four days. Intraoral examination revealed that the right maxillary first molar was carious and tender on percussion. Thermal and electrical pulp testing elicited a negative response in maxillary left first molar. The preoperative radiograph shows widening of periodontal ligament space with right maxillary first molar. The radiograph also revealed an unusual anatomy of involved tooth with single root and single canal. Based on the clinical and radiographic evaluation, diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis with acute apical periodontitis of right maxillary first molar was made, and endodontic treatment was planned.\nTo ascertain the unusual morphology, multiple X-rays in variable horizontal angulations were taken. These X-rays revealed a broader single canal bucco-lingually. In order to confirm the apparent finding of the IOPA radiographs, the patient was referred for CBCT imaging of tooth 16 with 3D reconstruction. CBCT was performed for maxilla using dental software Dentascan. 3D image of the maxilla was obtained, the tooth in question was focused and its morphology was obtained in longitudinal and trans-verse cross section of 0.5 mm thickness. The results of the CBCT showed the presence of a single root with the Vertucci\u2019s type I canal configuration. Thereafter, the root canal treatment was initiated.\nAccess opening was done in right maxillary first molar. On examination, clinical presence of single wide orifice was found in the center of the pulpal floor. Further inspection of the pulpal floor was done for search of other orifices that were absent.

Her medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glaucoma, and multiple previous episodes of chest pain similar to her current episode that necessitated three separate coronary angiograms which showed no stenotic or occluding lesions in the coronary arteries. The patient described her chest pain as a sensation of burning that started suddenly at 11 pm in the night while she was resting comfortably at home after having dinner. The pain was mild in intensity, nonradiating, and lasted for a few minutes before resolving spontaneously. She denied having any dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, or loss of consciousness during this episode. She had no history of smoking or illicit drug use. Her home medications included felodipine extended release 5 mg once daily, isosorbide mononitrate extended release 30 mg once daily, atorvastatin 80 mg once daily, losartan 100 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, and metoprolol succinate extended release 100 mg once daily. The patient activated emergency medical services immediately after onset of her symptoms, who brought the patient to the emergency room. On arrival in the emergency room, the patient was asymptomatic. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 168/46 mmHg (right arm, supine position), heart rate of 66/min, respiratory rate of 19/min, and an oral temperature of 97.9 F. An electrocardiogram was obtained which showed a normal sinus cardiac rhythm with a left bundle branch block, possible left ventricular hypertrophy, and T wave inversions in the lateral leads.

Surgical pathology showed the tumor to be CD56, synaptophysin, and pancytokeratin positive by immunohistochemistry, with involvement of a single right inguinal lymph node. Due to close surgical margins and inguinal nodal involvement, the patient received adjuvant intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to the right thigh and right pelvic and inguinal nodal region to a dose of 50 Gy delivered in 25 fractions (), as well as consolidative carboplatin and etoposide post-operatively. The patient then developed a radiation in-field recurrence involving the right external iliac and inguinal nodal region in 2015. Salvage right pelvic nodal dissection was performed where 15 nodes were removed with four harboring metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma.\nShortly after locoregional recurrence in the right pelvic nodal region, the patient developed metastatic disease involving bilateral pelvic nodes and the retroperitoneum on PET-scan (). Biopsy of the SUV-avid retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy confirmed metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. The patient was treated initially with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide and due to progressive disease was transitioned to single-agent pembrolizumab (200 mg IV every 3 weeks). After 5 months of therapy (7 cycles of pembrolizumab) the patient had a complete metabolic response with only sub-centimeter lymph nodes visible on CT. After 10 months of pembrolizumab (15 cycles), the patient had an isolated left inguinal and external iliac nodal progression ().

    "original_text": "The patient is a 52-year-old African American male with an unwanted diverting loop ileostomy who was scheduled for an elective stoma reversal. Originally, the loop ileostomy was created for fecal diversion after a large perineal defect was made for the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum. A high splenic flexure, foreshortened colonic mesentery, and morbid obesity precluded performing a diverting colostomy at that time. Of note, the patient had no family history of HO or abdominal surgical history prior to the ileostomy creation.\nDuring the reversal of the loop ileostomy, a circumferential incision was made at the mucocutaneous junction. Dissection was carried towards the serosal surface of the small bowel with electrocautery. There were significant adhesions between the small bowel and surrounding soft tissue which was much denser than expected. At that time, the base of the ostomy was reached and a dense structure was identified by palpation. It was circumferential in both limbs of the loop ileostomy. It was hard and fixed with a bone-like consistency. We encountered difficulty in freeing the small bowel from this circumferential dense structure, and this, combined with the patient's body habitus, rendered it difficult to take the stoma down safely through the peristomal incision. As a result, we converted the operation to an open procedure using a lower midline incision to reverse the ileostomy. After significant lysis of adhesions, the ileostomy was reached from the midline incision, and the hard structure was excised circumferentially using a combination of sharp dissection with Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery. Upon gross inspection, it was observed that the structure was seated at the level of the rectus abdominis muscle and formed a complete circle around the ileostomy.

    "original_text": "A 51-year-old female patient presented to our orthopedic outpatient department with a rapidly enlarging ulcerated right upper arm swelling which was growing gradually over the past six months. She recalled that it had been a pea-sized lesion and had remained the same size over the past 30 years. No history of preceding episodes of trauma or local irritation was found. The initially asymptomatic lesion had recently become painful and pruritic with slight bleeding. On examination, a large nodulo-ulcerative plaque was noted on the right upper arm, measuring approximately 12 cm \u00d7 6 cm in size (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a mass measuring 12 cm \u00d7 6 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm, invading the deltoid and triceps brachii muscles (). Examination of the needle biopsy specimen demonstrated the proliferation of spindle cells in a storiform arrangement in the dermis. Results of tests for CD34 and factor VIII were negative, suggesting the possibility of a benign tumor. However, the clinical findings, which included muscle invasion, large tumor size, and rapid enlargement, suggested the possibility of malignancy, prompting the need for wide resection and myocutaneous flap-plasty. Intraoperatively, the tumor was found to have invaded the deltoid and triceps brachii muscles, as well as the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. Wide resection was achieved with a 3 cm margin. A latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap was needed to close the skin defect. The postoperative period was uneventful. Histopathological examination following hematoxylin and eosin stain revealed spindle cell proliferation with a vague storiform growth pattern and basal cell hyperplasia in the overlying epidermal cells ().

Anesthetic pre assessment was unremarkable with a good ventricular function on echocardiogram. During the attempted removal of the AICD generator box, the cardiologist noted a break in the insulation of the AICD lead component. Because the patient was not consented for leads removal, the generator box was removed, and leads were left in situ with a plan for laser extraction at a later date. Two days later, laser extraction of leads was attempted under GA. Monitoring included standard and invasive arterial pressures. The lead extraction was complicated with pericardial tamponade due to a linear tear in the free wall of the the right ventricle, which was managed successfully by emergency surgery, and the patient was extubated later that day in the ICU. Intraoperatively, central venous pressure was noted to be around 18\u201322 cm of water.

The initial proper management of open fracture and joint dislocation was performed by orthopaedic and traumatology surgeons in the emergency department. The patient had no history of additional diseases. The preoperative airway examination revealed a class 3 Mallampati airway and, in light of the difficulty of intubation, an intrathecal block with a 150 mm needle was planned. After the written consent was obtained, 2 mg IV midazolam and 50 \u03bcg fentanyl were administered for sedation. The vertebral anatomical structures were barely distinguishable despite ultrasound guidance. After two unsuccessful attempts, we decided not to use spinal anesthesia and planned to perform a combined sciatic and femoral nerve block. As a tourniquet was not required above the knee, the blockade of these two nerves would be adequate for surgical anesthesia.\nBefore the femoral nerve block, the pannus was taped cephalad as the fatty tissue hanging from the abdomen made it difficult to access the inguinal region. The femoral nerve was identified at a depth of 5 cm with a linear US probe (Esaote, 10\u201318 MHz, Florence, Italy). Fifteen mL (8 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 7 mL of 2% lidocaine) of local anesthetic mixture was administered around the femoral nerve using the in-plane approach. Due to the difficulties in situating the patient in the prone position, the distal extremities of the patient were elevated with folded blankets in the supine position ().

She had severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a 50 pack-year history of smoking, ending 12 years ago. The patient lived alone.\nFour years earlier, she had been diagnosed with a well differentiated adenocarcinoma of left lower lobe lung with a bronchioloalveolar appearance. Full-body positive emission tomography/computerized tomography (PET/CT) scan did not suggest any spread to the brain, bones, liver or adrenal glands.\nThe patient had such severe lung disease that she required home oxygen at 2 L/minute at rest to maintain saturations over 90%. The risk of perioperative death or incapacitation if she were to have a left lower lobectomy was very significant, so she received only therapy with pemetrexed and bevacizumab, which continued over the next four years. CT a month ago showed unchanged residual treated tumor in the left lower lobe with no evidence of thoracic metastases.\nThe patient was brought to the emergency department, 14 days after her last chemotherapy, for weakness, fatigue, and intermittent nausea and vomiting for the past 10 days and diarrhea for the past 2 days. Her oral intake had been decreased.

The patient's serum AFP level was 10.96 ng/mL. For the abovementioned reasons, the patient was not immediately qualified for causal treatment of HCV infection (such patients are included in the antiviral treatment scheme at the moment). The contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan performed 3 months later showed a heterogeneous abnormal focus sized 42 \u00d7 27 mm, localized within the 6th segment, which compressed the right portal vein branch. Two new lesions sized 8 mm each were additionally revealed within the 8th segment. Moreover, signs of portal hypertension were shown. As the findings were ambiguous, in order to distinguish cancerous lesion from the intrahepatic arterioportal venous malformation abdominal angio-CT scan was performed, as recommended by the radiologist. However, the findings were still inconclusive, so the diagnosis could not be made. At that time the patient did not give her consent to invasive diagnostic procedures. The patient was hospitalized for the second time in March 2011. This time her Child-Pugh score was 6 and the AFP level remained stable at 11.5 ng/mL. The contrast-enhanced MRI revealed a focal lesion of poorly defined polycystic margins within the 6th segment, sized 4.5 \u00d7 2.7 \u00d7 3.5 cm, and hepatic angioma and focal hepatic steatosis",

    "original_text": "A 28-year-old female, gravida 2, para 1, discovered a massive mass in the abdominal cavity during the 8th month of pregnancy. Three years ago, this patient was admitted to our hospital in the Hematology and Oncology Department due to \"repeated dizziness, fatigue and shortness of breath after activity\". She was admitted at 60 g/L hemoglobin and was transfused with 3.0U of the same type of red blood cell suspension. The microscopic examination of colon revealed extensive polyp-like lesions in the entire colon. On-duty doctor in responsible for this case suspected \"familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)\" and suggested transfer of this patient to our surgical department for further evaluation and treatment. After completing the preoperative examination and investigation, a laparoscopic total colectomy was performed. Postoperative pathological examination showed tubular adenomas (low-grade) and more than 1000 polyps, most of which were broad-based and fit the family adenomatous polyposis. One year later, fibroid adenoma was found in the upper right pubic symphysis. Taking the intestinal lesions into consideration, this case was diagnosed as \"Gardner syndrome\". In August 2019, the patient presented for the third time to our hospital due to upper abdominal pain at 32 weeks of pregnancy. A CT examination showed that the left side of the uterus in the abdominal cavity was occupied by a huge mass about 21 \u00d7 12 cm in size, with mild hydronephrosis in both kidneys (Fig. ).
