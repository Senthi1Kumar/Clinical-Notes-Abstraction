Initially, he had developed a swelling in the skin of the right iliac fossa over the scar of an appendectomy done 14 years back. The swelling had ruptured after 7-8 days, to discharge fecal matter mixed with pus. Within a week, the opening healed, but the swelling reappeared 7-8 days later, only to rupture again after a few days. This cycle of swelling followed by rupture was associated with evening rise of temperature. The fever was of moderate degree and was associated with the swelling stage only. His appetite was adequate and he was passing stools and urine normally.\nOn examination, the patient was moderately nourished and there were no features of anemia, hypoproteinemia, dehydration, or electrolyte disturbances. A 0.5 cm \u00d7 0.5 cm fistulous opening with fecal soiling was seen over the scar of a previous surgery in the right iliac fossa []. No mass could be palpated in the abdomen. The patient had no history of any other surgery or hospitalization. There was no history suggestive of any chronic disease such as TB, diabetes mellitus, or ischemic heart disease. Biopsy of the inflamed appendix and of an enlarged lymph node, taken at the time of the surgery done 14 years back, had not shown caseating granuloma but only nonspecific inflammatory reaction.\nWe took X-rays of the chest and abdomen, both of which were normal.

A central venous line was placed and an intra-arterial catheter was positioned for continuous monitoring of the blood pressure and gas analysis. The patient was placed in supine position with parted legs in 20\u00b0 Trendelenburg position. Pneumoperitoneum was achieved. A port was placed for the robotic camera and three additional ports were introduced. Cholecystectomy was first performed leading to a better optimal exposure of the hepatic hilum.

    "original_text": "The patient reported is a 32-year-old man with a past medical history of seizure disorder and a known psychiatric history of bipolar disorder with multiple inpatient hospitalizations for manic episodes during which he exhibited agitated and violent behavior. The patient has a comorbid use of synthetic cannabinoids. He was admitted to the acute inpatient service for a recurrent episode of agitation and threatening behavior in the community in the context of medication nonadherence and continuous use of synthetic cannabinoids. In the course of index hospitalization, the patient self-reported his coprophagic behavior during his initial psychiatric assessment. The patient stated that he believed that the consumption of feces was preventing him from going to jail and facing the death penalty for a murder that he claimed he committed in the past. He was unable to describe any specifics for his murder but felt that he deserved unusually cruel and harsh punishment from law enforcement that could only be prevented by consuming feces. This feeling of guilt and continued belief that he was deserving of cruel and harsh punishment induced his coprophagic behavior. He did not report any associated command auditory hallucinations but expressed depressed mood as he discussed his reasons for feeling guilty. His affect was however incongruent with his stated depressed mood. He was oriented to person, place, and time.

She was diagnosed with stage IIB pT1aN1 left lung adenocarcinoma at 51 years of age and underwent left upper lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Six months after her initial diagnosis, she was found to have brain metastases and underwent four Gamma Knife radiosurgeries to a total of 17 lesions over the course of 12 months. She did well over the next five years but then had progression of a right posterior temporal mass that was in the immediate area of a small lesion previously treated with Gamma Knife. She underwent a right-sided craniotomy and tumor resection, followed by adjuvant stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with 30 Gy in five fractions to the resection cavity. Two years later, she developed seizures and headaches, and she was found to have a growing focus of enhancement seen using MRI at the site of her previous surgery consistent with disease recurrence. Four months after this finding, she was taken back to the operating room for a redo right craniotomy for tumor resection.\nThe patient unfortunately once again developed local recurrence at the surgical site seen on fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and gadolinium-enhanced T1 weighted MRI four months post operation. She was initially considered for laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) but was thought to have a tumor configuration and morphology that is not amenable for treatment using this modality. After multi-disciplinary tumor board discussion, she was ultimately recommended repeat resection and GT.

    "original_text": "A 64-year-old man underwent repair of partial right-sided anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (PAPVD) with intact interatrial septum. At this operation, the atrial septum was excised to create a pericardial baffle for the pulmonary veins to drain into the left atrium. The anomalous pulmonary veins entered the superior vena cava high above the level of the right pulmonary artery; therefore, the superior vena cava transection and relocation approach had been chosen to correct the defect. Over time, the atrial septum had grown back, therefore causing pulmonary venous stenosis. As a consequence, the patient presented with NYHA class III dyspnea, right ventricular failure, and pulmonary hypertension.\nThe preoperative echocardiogram showed a severely dilated right heart with a tricuspid annulus of 58 mm, severe pulmonary hypertension suggested by a tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity of 4 m/s, and normal left ventricular function. A preoperative computed tomography scan was performed, and it demonstrated a severely dilated right ventricle (end-diastolic diameter of 68 mm) and a severe stenosis at the distal end of the baffle (Figure A). Mild coronary artery disease was also present, and it was confirmed by the preoperative coronary angiogram.\nThe patient had several comorbidities, including type II diabetes mellitus and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on Warfarin; furthermore, he had undergone a left pneumonectomy at the age of 4 due to rubella, and he had subsequently experienced recurrent low respiratory tract infections on his right lung.\nHaving considered the comorbidities and the high risk for complications on the right lung that a conventional open heart reoperation would have carried, it was decided to address the pericardial baffle stenosis through an interventional hybrid approach.

It started suddenly and was continuous and diffuse; however, it was mainly in the right lower quadrant and was increasing in severity. He had never experienced similar pain in the past. The pain was associated with nausea, vomiting, hiccoughs, anorexia and bloating sensation. He had passed his last stool and flatus in the morning on the same day of admission.\nOn admission, he was alert and his vital signs, chest and cardiovascular examination were normal. The abdomen was distended, free of scars, and tender all over mainly in the right iliac fossa with guarding and a palpable mass with absence of bowel sounds. The hernia orifices were intact. The rectum was empty on digital rectal examination. His complete blood count and basic biochemical parameters were also normal. Contrast enhanced abdominal computed tomography scan showed an intra-abdominal mass associated with small bowel obstruction and a small amount of intra-peritoneal free fluid. Following a brief period of resuscitation, the patient was taken to the operating room for exploration. Upon examination, a 4 \u00d7 4 cm mass was detected in the small bowel mesentery with multiple small bowel loops adherent to it, together with their mesentery. There was no evidence of liver or peritoneal metastasis.

It was discovered that the left brachiocephalic vein (BCV) along the left margin of mediastinum walking down the line directly into the coronary sinus (). A venous flow was detected in the anterolateral descending aorta with dilatation of the coronary sinus (diameter of 21 mm) without other heart abnormalities by transthoracic echocardiography. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of PLSVC was made. There were no detectable metastases in other organs through brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), upper abdomen CT scan and bone nuclear scan.\nThe right posterolateral thoracotomy was performed on October 31, 2006. As expected, the tumor invaded the wall of SVC and no left brachial cephalic vein bifurcation was observed. The SVC was separated, clamped and resected following intravenous injection of 5, 000 IU of sodium heparin.

The neonate was born by caesarean section after an uncomplicated pregnancy and weighed 3200 gram having a normal Apgar score. There was no family history of congenital defects and his parents were also in good health. On examination there was a midline vertical mucosal surface in the anterior neck extending from below the mental process of mandible to suprasternal area with no skin covering. The defect was 3 cm in vertical length and 0.5 cm in width.

Furthermore, the thrombus showed enhancement after administration of contrast material, which was indicative of tumor thrombus or benign metastasizing leiomyomatosis. On pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an irregular tumor was identified in the right posterior wall of the uterus, which exhibited heterogeneous high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI using gadolinium with diethylenetriaminepentaacetate revealed the enhancement of the tumor in IVC (). Because the lesion was located in the right atrium and ventricle, cardiovascular surgery consultation was recommended. A transthoracic echocardiogram was duly performed and revealed the tip of the tumor extended into the right atrium and also into the right ventricle. The multidisciplinary evaluation of the patient indicated that this was a case of cardiac-extending intravenous (IV) leiomyomatosis through the right ovarian and uterine veins arising from the uterine tumor.\nThe operation was performed under general anesthesia (). The heart and IVC were exposed by the right lateral thoracotomy and the midline incision of the abdomen. In case of the tumor adhesion to the hepatic and diaphragmatic IVC, visualization of these IVC enables removing the IV mass and repairing the veins safely. That is why the right thoracotomy approach was chosen. Cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated from the superior vena cava and the right femoral vein/IVC. Inflow was instituted from bilateral femoral arteries to the ascending aorta. A right atriotomy was performed, and a large elastic tumor was found occupying",

He had severe and debilitating abdominal pain that was not relieved with medication management including acetaminophen, NSAIDs, gabapentin, and high-dose opioids. The patient consistently reported a pain level of 10/10 intensity on a numerical rating scale (NRS). Since the patient failed conservative therapy with medication management, he was referred to interventional pain management for a celiac plexus block to better manage his pain.\nAfter reviewing the patient\u2019s medical chart, it was noted that this patient was coagulopathic as his international normalized ratio (INR) had risen from 1.1 to 1.6 over an eight-day period. Since the celiac plexus lies anterior and laterally around the aorta, needles are often placed through the aorta to perform a traditional celiac plexus block. Given the patient\u2019s elevated INR, we decided to target the splanchnic nerves bilaterally instead. Additionally, given that this patient\u2019s INR was continuing to rise, there was concern that he may not be a candidate for future interventions if he continued to become more coagulopathic. For this reason, we decided to perform both radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and alcohol neurolysis of the splanchnic nerves to ensure full effect. The patient was counseled regarding the risks and benefits of these injections and he consented to undergo the procedure.\nThe patient was then taken to a procedure room and placed in the prone position. The thoracolumbar spine was visualized. The skin was anesthetized with 2% lidocaine before introducing the needles used for RFA. The needles were advanced towards the anterolateral aspect of the T11 vertebral body (Figure ). Once the needles were confirmed to be in proper positioning, sensory testing was performed and caused abdominal stimulation in the same region of his abdominal pain. The nerves were then anesthetized with 2 mL of 2% lidocaine before RFA was performed. RFA was performed at 80 degrees C",

One was at the age of 10 months and three were all after 3 years. He was diagnosed as asthma because of a history of recurrent wheezing episodes and airway hyperresponsiveness suggested by lung function test. But his skin prick test and serum dosage of IgE did not support this diagnosis. However, the patient did not do regular follow-up. During the age of 10 months to 3 years, there was no wheezing. His wheezing could partially be improved by bronchodilator and systemic corticosteroid. Each episode of wheezing had lasted more than 20 days when the patient was treated in outpatient department.

He had a past medical history of cirrhosis due to alcoholism and portal hypertension with esophageal varices managed with prior transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. He had a history of hepatic encephalopathy, hypertension, and type II diabetes. He had a recent admission to another institution for septic shock secondary to recurrent cholecystitis and had recently had an LC fifty-eight days prior. The patient was admitted to the outside hospital fifty-nine days prior to admission to our institution for subacute cholecystitis, which had initially required a cholecystostomy drain on prior admissions, and then ultimately an LC at that hospital. The gallbladder was not noted to be perforated, but the procedure was complicated by dropped gallstones, some of which were retrieved as stated in the operative report. On the current admission, the patient was hypotensive requiring vasopressors and was anemic and thrombocytopenic, requiring blood and platelet transfusions.\nA CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was performed on admission demonstrating residual gallstones in the gallbladder fossa and/or cystic duct remnant and multiple small fluid collections and/or forming granulomatous masses surrounding additional retained/dropped gallstones in the surgical tracts and vicinity. A fistula with gallstones was also seen extending through the posterior and inferior wall of the second portion of the duodenum, to the anterior and superior aspect of a right renal cyst, which measured 3.4 cm x 3.0 cm and which contained gas in its superior aspect (Figures and ).

In spite of HCV infection, the results of her liver function test were normal and she did not hope to receive antiviral therapy because of socioeconomic reasons. At the age of 68, she developed two CRLMs located in segments 4 and 6. She received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, including oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil, and subsequently underwent surgery composed of microwave tissue coagulator (MCT) ablation for segment 4 tumor and segmentectomy 6. The segment 4 tumor was considerably small with a diameter of 1 cm and it was exposed to the liver surface; thus, we performed MCT ablation. A histological examination of the resected S6 tumor revealed adenocarcinoma and was confirmed to be CRLM but not intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with negative cytokeratin 7 and positive cytokeratin 20 in immunohistochemistry. Although she was diagnosed histologically as having a cirrhotic liver, by a microscopic examination for background non-tumoral liver, antiviral treatment was again not conducted due to socioeconomic reasons at that time. At the age of 71, abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor that was adjacent to the previously ablated lesion in segment 4 of her liver (Fig. ). The tumor was irregularly shaped and in contact with her middle hepatic vein (MHV). Based on a three-phase CT study, the tumor showed neither early enhancement nor washout and was less enhanced compared to non-tumoral background liver through all phases. Furthermore, no other tumor was detected in any phases of the three-phase study. Based on these findings and her previous history of rectal cancer liver metastases, we considered the segment 4 tumor to be a recurrent liver metastasis originating from rectal cancer.

The fracture extends to the mandibular angle bilaterally causing severely deranged occlusion. She also sustained a medially displaced left condylar head fracture and an undisplaced left Le Fort II fracture.\nAn open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) was planned for her comminuted mandible fracture by using a prebent reconstruction plate through the existing wound. ORIF for both left Le Fort II and condylar fracture was also planned. The aim was first to establish the proper vertical dimension and posterior mandibular height prior to the fixation of the comminuted mandible. However, adding to the difficulties in the execution of the surgical plan, our patient refused for both ORIF of the maxilla and condylar fracture, as it requires additional transcutaneous surgical access. She previously experienced complicated emergency procedure for open fracture of the left supracondylar femur and requested fixation only for her mandible fracture. We therefore have to revise the protocol required for her surgery and decided to use the CPD as a measure to avoid rotational movements of proximal segments of the mandible, as these were the only surgical reference left.\nTo begin with, we applied an additive manufacturing (AM) concept to produce an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) three-dimensional (3D) life-size surgical model by using her DICOM computed tomography (CT) data ().

Respiratory papilloma was diagnosed after pathologic analysis. After the procedure, the symptom of hoarseness actually worsened and the patient also gradually developed a foreign body sensation. He then presented to our hospital in May 2010.

The cords were mobile, and no cervical lymphadenopathy was appreciated on palpation. In addition, there was no recent history of fever or weight loss, and laboratory findings were normal. The tumor was resected by using direct microlaryngoscopy with a CO2 laser, and histological examination was performed (see below).\nSix months after the second operation, the patient was referred again for hoarseness in addition to shortness of breath.

The clinicoradiological evaluation suggested a two-part proximal humerus fracture. The patient had no other injuries, and systemic examination was normal. The patient was a known epileptic and was treated with regular anti-seizure medications. The fracture was managed operatively with an open reduction and internal fixation using a titanium proximal humerus locking plate (Figures , ). The standard deltopectoral approach was used for fracture exposure. The bone was osteoporotic and the screw purchase is an obvious issue in such fractures. We used specially designed locking head cancellous screws for the humeral head fragment fixation. These screws combine the advantage of cancellous screws, which offer better bone purchase, and the locking head helps in angular stable construct for the patients with such osteoporotic bone. The perioperative period was uneventful. Osteoporotic management in form of calcium and vitamin D supplementation was started right from the admission and was maintained throughout the follow-up. Postoperatively, the patient was kept on a guarded mobilization program because of the poor bone quality intraoperatively.

He had undergone 45 procedures to address these complications. He was initially managed conservatively for intestinal obstruction secondary to a rectal stricture. Rectal dilation was performed. Subsequently, he developed MSSA (methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) bacteremia and an abscess was noted in his left thigh (adductor region). The abscess was drained under ultrasound guidance by the interventional radiology team, and the drain was removed after a week. A month later, he presented to the ED with fluid draining from the former site of the IR drain. The fluid was found to be urine, with creatinine of 30.9 mg/dL. A Foley catheter was placed, and retrograde urethrogram (RUG) showed a urethrocutaneous fistula from the bulbar urethra to the left thigh (). Cystoscopy and subsequent biopsy of the fistula revealed no malignancy. Given the need of serial rectal dilations for his chronically dilated large bowel, the patient was formally recommended a permanent colostomy, but he declined. He was discharged with catheter in place and the fistula site dry.\nAs definitive treatment for the fistula, an ileal conduit urinary diversion with partial cystectomy was done.

    "original_text": "A twenty eight year old female delivered a baby 5 months before presentation. She started experiencing repeated episodes of blackouts in front of her eyes, since two weeks. These consisted of brief spells of diminishing of vision and inability to comprehend the surroundings lasting for a few seconds and passed off completely. She did not have falls or accidents due to these episodes. Along with these episodes, she developed a dull headache, lasting few hours every day, bilateral, frontal and was not associated with nausea or vomiting. She was able to continue her daily activities in spite of the headaches. The problem increased further when her relative noticed her to have a generalized tonic clonic convulsion, frothing at mouth and loss of consciousness lasting for 8-10 minutes. She remained confused for the next few hours and returned to normal. Her behavior gradually changed and she spoke only few words, low in volume without associated emotions.

The patient presented with a complicated scar on her middle abdominal wall that measured approximately 5\u00d712 cm, as well as other depressive scars resulting from drain insertions (). Computed tomography (CT) images demonstrated that part of her intestine was located immediately under an extremely thin postoperative skin layer, with suspected adhesion. In addition, a partial defect of the rectus abdominis muscle was detected ().\nTo perform a safe and effective operation, we positioned the skin incision to avoid intestinal trauma while considering the cosmetic elements related to postoperative scarring. In addition, we conducted a detailed investigation of the range across which retention sutures could be placed while maintaining the structure of the fascia. Using 3-mm-slice CT images as references, the range of the intestine located immediately below the thin postoperative skin, the range of stable fascia structure and intended retention sutures, and the range of the rectus abdominis fascia muscle intended for preservation were measured and drawn on graph paper (). The resulting shapes were cut from the paper, traced onto the patient\u2019s body, and used to determine the skin incisional line (). The midline was designated from the xiphoid process to the umbilicus.

A huge abdominal mass was palpated, and she was referred to the gynecology department to search for a tumor of uterine origin. She was premenopausal and had no significant past medical history. Physical findings revealed a large elastic hard mass extending from the xiphoid to the pubic bone. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed a huge tumor on the uterine corpus, and a number of dilated vessels were observed between the tumor and the myometrium. Therefore, the tumor was suspected to derive from the uterus. The tumor showed an uneven signal on T2-weighted sagittal section (), and the enhanced MRI study showed that the tumor edge but not the center was enhanced (). As such, necrosis was suspected to have occurred in the center of the tumor. Uterine sarcoma was primarily suspected due to the large size, degeneration, and necrosis on MRI imaging. Computed tomography (CT) examination showed no lymph node swelling or distant metastasis. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed anemia (hemoglobin level, 5.6g/dl).

However, in less than 24 hours, he had extensive right facial swelling extending all the way to the submandibular region. On presentation, apparently, he had extension across to the left periorbital region and the premaxillary region as well. He did not note any leukocytosis; however, had bandemia.

The patient was never smoker, without family history of cancer and without comorbidity. The cytological diagnosis was made using a CT-guided fine needle aspiration of the primary tumor and revealed an adenocarcinoma of the lung (TTF1+, CK7+) with the EGFR ex19del mutation. A PET-CT demonstrated the presence of liver and bone metastases and a nodule in the right breast, confirmed as a metastasis by fine needle aspiration. The patient received zoledronic acid 4 mg every 28 days and gefitinib 250 mg daily since November 2012 obtaining a partial response (PR). In August 2013, a disease progression (PD) was documented, with an increase in size of the primary tumor and size and number of liver metastases. A brain MRI revealed the presence of two cortical nodules, which were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy. The patient was enrolled in the IMPRESS trial and received 6 cycles of cisplatin and pemetrexed plus gefitinib obtaining again a PR that lasted until June 2014. Thereafter, a new lung metastasis appeared in the superior lobe of the left lung and the mammary nodule increased in dimensions. From June 2014 to December 2014 the patient received erlotinib 150 mg daily obtaining an initial stabilization of the disease (SD); however, within 6 months, she experienced again a PD with the increase of the mammary nodule and the appearance of a new bone metastasis in the sacrum. In December 2014, EGFR ex19del and T790M mutations were detectable in a new needle biopsy of the primary tumor; only at this time a digital PCR-based method was available for the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Briefly, the method was optimized in order to recover a suitable amount of ctDNA for molecular analysis from 3 ml of plasma using the QIAmp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit",

After 2 months, in May 2012, during the rehabilitation period, he suffered from the displacement of the fracture because of the loosening of the distal screws. He underwent a new operation by the same surgeon to reduce the displaced fracture and replace the distal screws. Six months after the last surgery, the fracture was still unconsolidated and he underwent pulsed electromagnetic fields and extracorporeal shockwaves therapy without success.\nOn February 2013, he referred to our department for persistent thigh pain and lameness that forced him to walk with a cane. The radiographic examination showed a hypertrophic nonunion of the distal femur (), refractory to the conservative treatment, which has been given an indication for surgical treatment. No limitation of the knee and hip range of movement was recorded. The limb was shortened to 3 cm.\nOur first surgical choice was the revision of the nail and the bone reconstruction with a corticoperiosteal pedicled flap from the medial femoral condyle.\nBefore the surgery, a CT angiography is performed to study the vascularization of the distal femur. The antibiotic preoperative profilaxis with gentamicin 160 mg (1 hour before the surgery) and cefazolin 2 g (just before the surgery) is administered.\nThe patient was placed in supine position with the hip and knee slightly flexed and externally rotated.

    "original_text": "A 59-year-old woman presented in July 2017 with extensive bleeding from her ileostomy site. Her history included locally advanced bladder cancer for which she had undergone pelvic exenteration and ileal conduit formation in November 2015. At that time, she had a known primary lung adenocarcinoma as well, but had no known liver metastases or other liver disease. Intravenous contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed in January 2016 raised the possibility of cirrhosis; however this was not biopsy-proven. In April 2016, she began to notice intermittent bleeding from her stoma which was initially thought to be mechanical tissue breakdown from the stomal flange. Concern for hepatic encephalopathy was raised when she had her first episode of confusion in December 2016. At that time CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated strong radiographic suspicion for cirrhosis together with prominent vessels surrounding the urinary diversion site suspicious for portal hypertension. Despite not having a tissue biopsy, she was diagnosed clinically with cryptogenic cirrhosis in May 2017 during a hospitalization for fatigue, anasarca, and altered mental status. An upper endoscopy performed in June 2017 demonstrated portal hypertensive gastropathy but no esophageal varices.\nUpon presentation to the Emergency Department in July 2017 she had significant hemorrhage from her stoma resulting in hemodynamic instability. She was anemic with a hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL that improved to 9.4 g/dL after blood transfusion, but gradually fell to 8.2 g/dL by the time of the procedure. Her MELD score was retrospectively calculated to be 19 at presentation, with an INR of 1.5 and total bilirubin of 4.3 mg/dl. She was emergently taken to the interventional suite for embolization with or without portal venous decompression via portosystemic shunt formation. A review of intravenous contrast-enhanced CT imaging showed extensive venous varices around the stoma involving the abdominal wall with a large draining varix arising from the portal system, likely the inferior mesenteric vein []. Also visualized was a variceal connection to the right common femoral vein",

    "original_text": "A 67-year-old Japanese man gave a history of being diagnosed with a cystic lesion in the right third molar region of the mandible by X-rays 11 years earlier. Subsequently, a tooth extraction had been performed. However, cyst enucleation and histopathological examination had not been carried out at that time. Eight years after the tooth extraction, he noticed a gingival swelling which lasted for three years. The medical history was only prostatic hypertrophy. On examination, a slight swelling was palpable in the gingiva of the right third molar region of the mandible. There was no fistula but a part of the bone had a defect. A panoramic radiograph revealed a radiolucent cystic lesion, measuring 10 \u00d7 12 mm in the same area (Fig. a, yellow arrows). A computed tomography (CT) showed an unilocular radiolucent lesion along with cortical bone resorption of the mandible on the lingual side (Fig. b). On the basis of clinical and radiological findings, a presumptive diagnosis of an odontogenic cyst was made and a biopsy was performed (Fig. c). The incisional biopsy resulted in a diagnosis of central MEC arising from a GOC as described below. Chest and abdominal CT findings were within normal limits. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a contrast defect in the same area (Fig. d). Cervical lymph node metastasis was absent on MRI. Due to the malignant nature of the tumor, as well as a history of previous surgeries, a partial mandibulectomy was performed to remove the lesion with a sufficient surgical margin and the tumor was surgically excised under general anesthesia. Following a final diagnosis of central MEC, the patient made an uneventful recovery and demonstrated no clinical evidence of recurrence in the two years following the surgery.\nMicroscopic examination of the biopsy material showed an enlarged unilocular cyst (Fig. a). The cystic lumen was lined by epithelial cells and was surrounded by thick fibrous connective tissue. Additionally, a solid polycystic lesion was also seen on one side",
