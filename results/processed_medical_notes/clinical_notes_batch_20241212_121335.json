Physical evaluation revealed a swollen and painful left leg with reduced range of motion of the left hip and bumps palpated on the right tibia proximal metaphysis. No signs of arthritis, possible intestinal inflammation or skin changes were seen during physical evaluation. The patient\u2019s blood pressure and urinary output were normal. After the emergency ultrasound exam revealed a diagnosis of femoral and pelvic deep vein thrombosis, she was admitted to the hospital.

There were no autoimmune or auto-inflammatory disorders in the patient\u2019s family history.\nInitial investigations revealed high levels of inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR), and a severe microcytic anaemia as well as thrombocytosis, hypoalbuminemia and elevated fibrinogen concentration and D-dimer values (Table ). Suspecting an infectious cause, a urinalysis was performed, and haematuria and proteinuria were detected. Both blood and urine cultures were sterile. X-rays of the legs were done (Fig. ), showing sites of hyperostosis and sclerosis in the metaphysis of the right tibia along with a periosteal reaction, suggesting a possible osteomyelitis or oncological processes in the bones.

Therefore, we performed a staging workup for suspected lung cancer. Positron emission tomography showed increased uptake only in the RUL and RLL (Fig b). Bronchoscopy showed no endobronchial involvement. As the pulmonary function test indicated no contraindication, we recommended surgery because of the possibility of malignancy in each nodule. Thoracoscopic wedge resection was performed with a frozen section for each nodule.

A brain computed tomography (CT) scan showed a number of small diffusely marked lesions (, row 1) suggesting cerebral infarctions of relatively recent date, but not recent enough to correspond to the present symptoms. Intravenous thrombolysis (alteplase) was administered and a marked regression of symptoms followed.

Electrocardiogram (ECG), however, was normal and the patient had no current or history of chest pain or effort dyspnea. Cardiac telemetry during the first 24 hours showed a very short episode of possible paroxysmal atrial fibrillation as a potential cardiac source of cerebral embolism.

Ultrasound of the carotid arteries and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) were normal.\nThe patient was dismissed from the hospital on day 3 with the diagnosis of minor ischemic stroke. He was put on medication with clopidogrel, simvastatin, metoprolol, and enalapril and was scheduled for a follow-up at the stroke department.

Subsequently, his leg tremor became more pronounced, spreading to involve the left leg. This tremor was associated with involuntary inversion of the feet and right thumb flexion, head posturing, and paresthesia in the right foot. Dystonia and tremor were absent when supine, and there was a diurnal component occurring only several hours after awakening. There was no relevant past medical history or family history.\nOn presentation, the patient had a weight of 73 kg and a height of 170 cm. He was alert and reported no issues with work and daily activities, scoring 28/30 on the MMSE with two points lost for short-term memory. Cranial nerve examination was normal apart from subtle rotatory nystagmus looking up and out bilaterally. There was no resting tremor in the upper limbs, but bilateral dystonic inversion of the feet was noted ( in the online-only Data Supplement). Repetitive finger taps and finger movements were mildly bradykinetic bilaterally. Repetitive heel and foot taps were moderately slowed bilaterally, and this feature was more evident on the left. Tone and power were both preserved throughout the upper and lower limbs. There were no appendicular cerebellar signs. Sensory examination revealed bilateral reduced vibration to the level of the ankles distally and impairment of joint proprioception in the great toes. Reflexes were absent with reinforcement in both the upper and lower limbs, and plantar responses were flexor. In the upright position, occasional high amplitude rhythmic tremor was noted in the right leg. His gait was broad-based. After 20 meters, the dystonic foot inversion was accentuated",

Pain medication was not sufficient, and the effect of multiple corticosteroid injections in both her left scapular region and trochanteric region only lasted for a few weeks. Because previous treatment, including surgical removal of the osteochondroma, local injection therapy with corticosteroids, and analgesics, only had minimal effect for a limited period, we decided to treat her with autologous fat grafting.\nThe adipose tissue was collected from the abdomen and inner thigh after infiltration with sodium chloride 0.9% mixed with 2% lidocaine (2 mg/mL) and 1-milliliter epinephrine (1 mg/mL). It was then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The central layer, consisting of usable fat, was then separated from the upper layer (oil) and lower layer (blood and liquid infiltrations) and injected into the body. During the first operation, 70 cc autologous fat was harvested from the abdomen and injected into the painful region of her left scapula. The patient was very satisfied with the result and she experienced relief of her pain for 1 year. Subsequently, surgery was repeated 1 year later and 51 mL autologous fat from the abdomen and flanks was injected into her left scapula as well as 2 mL into the 5th digit of the left foot. This procedure was repeated again 1 year later with harvested fat from the abdomen and an injection of 60 mL into the left scapula, 3 mL into the left foot, and 12",

She had one more episode of seizure 10 days before reaching neurosurgery department of our hospital. At the time of admission, she was conscious, obeying simple commands but was disoriented. Her pupils were bilaterally symmetrical and reacting to light. She had right hemiplegia. Her abdominal examination revealed a gravid uterus of 30 weeks size, relaxed with fetus, presenting as cephalic having regular fetal heart rate of 142 bpm. A CT angiography was done which demonstrated a left supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm. She was posted for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) (with precaution for fetal exposure of radiation). DSA showed a giant supraclinoidal ICA segment aneurysm []. During the procedure, she had neurological deterioration and also developed per vaginal discharge. She went into spontaneous labor at 32 weeks and delivered a male child with birth weight of 1.1 kg.

There was no history of head injury and no associated headache or vomiting. Despite a history of significant alcohol consumption for over 15 years there was no history of jaundice or prior liver disease. He was free of upper and lower gastrointestinal symptoms, his appetite was good and there was no weight loss. He was a diabetic for nine years on oral hypoglycaemic therapy. Examination revealed a non-tender, hemispherical, subcutaneous lump over the occipital region (Fig. a and b) approximately 10 cm in diameter. The lump was soft to firm in consistency, non-pulsatile and with no demonstrable cough impulse. His general and systemic examination including the abdomen was otherwise unremarkable with no stigmata of chronic liver disease and no focal neurological signs. His routine blood biochemistry including liver function tests was normal. His skull x-ray showed a lytic lesion of the occipital bone. The contrast CT scan of the brain showed a scalp mass with destruction of the adjacent skull vault and intracranial extension but (Fig. ) no penetration of the meninges. Core biopsy of the lesion revealed a metastatic deposit from a hepatocellular carcinoma. This was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis demonstrating positivity for alpha fetoproteins and hepar 1. Subsequent triple phase CT scan of the abdomen (Fig. ) showed a 3.5 cm diameter lesion in segment VI of the liver with characteristic features of HCC but no radiological evidence of cirrhosis.

    "original_text": "In May 2010, a 40-year-old Caucasian man with adulthood-onset epilepsy came to our clinic for worsening memory and poor concentration for 1 year. He had progressive cognitive impairment, specifically short-term memory loss, word-finding difficulties, slower processing speed, and difficulties in organizing and multitasking. There was no reported change in his mood with no signs of depression or anxiety. He was a university graduate without family history of dementia or past history of addiction. Being an avid MMA fan, he had been practicing the sport for over 10 years. He was previously in the US Marines before working as an MMA school manager and instructor for 5 years. Recurrent minor head concussions and transient asphyxiation episodes were common in his course of martial arts training and work. On physical examination, he had hand tremors with fine motor incoordination and lower limb ataxia. Laboratory investigations, lumbar puncture, and electroencephalography revealed normal results. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, however, showed mild asymmetry in the parahippocampus structures with the left hippocampus appearing slightly smaller and dilatation of the left temporal horn. A neuropsychological assessment conducted in 2010 showed above-average performances on most cognitive domains except timed working memory tasks (see ).\nSince September 2010, he had worked as an English teacher, teaching his native language. Two years later, he could no longer stay in the job due to worsening memory and planning difficulties. He was also noted to be more irritable, with increased fatigability and distractibility.

He was scared and ran to his home; he felt his house, even his mother also, was changed, These feelings continued and he often became fearful and restless, as he could not distinguish between the real and the unreal. He continued his job although he had decreased interest in sociocultural activities. While he went to the market or any other crowded place, he felt as if he was roaming in some different world or in a dream. He often pinched himself and felt the pain. He realized that these feelings were his own, wanted to get rid of these but could not. Gradually his sleep became disturbed; he would go to bed late at night and awaken late in the morning with complaint of feeling heaviness in his head. He had psychiatric consultation and was on medication for four months prior to his admission to our department. Improvement was negligible. The patient reported that he had the same experience once, when he took bhang for the first time one month prior to this illness, which lasted for a few hours and subsided spontaneously.

He was generally well before the flight suffering from moderate ataxic gait and lower cranial nerve involvement. About 40 minutes into the flight, he had developed severe headache and retractable vomiting leading to rapid onset loss of consciousness. He had been shunted for hydrocephalus four weeks earlier and was subsequently referred to our center for further treatment. Brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed before referral, which had demonstrated satisfactory decompression of the hydrocephalus without hemorrhage signal inside the tumor bed (Figure ).\nOn admission, he was unconscious, unable to follow commands, but able to localize painful stimuli. He had apneustic breathing but bilateral reactive pupils were retained. Over the next few hours, he developed severe hypoxia that necessitated mechanical ventilation. A brain ultrasound confirmed normal-sized ventricles but without any new information about the posterior fossa mass. Given the fact that cerebrospinal fluid shunting had been carried out several weeks earlier, upward herniation was assumed an unlikely event. He was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and revealed that he was given high-dose dexamethasone and supportive therapy with the initial diagnosis of brain stem compression due to the tumor mass. Three days after admission, his condition had not changed and he underwent resection of the tumor through a midline sub-occipital approach.\nDuring the operation, the posterior fossa was very tense through the exposed field. There was blood-tinged cerebellum in the midline with a small subdural clot.

Immunohistochemical studies showed the large atypical cells to be positive for CD20 (). The histological diagnosis of the tumor was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and EBV was detected in the tumor cells by immunohistochemistry for latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) ().

A modified midesophageal long axis view was achieved with increasing the multiplane angle from 90 to 130 degrees and the TEE probe was slowly turned to the left of the patient to follow the course of the circumflex artery. In this view, the stenosis of the circumflex artery was observed near the anterolateral commissure (), which was not seen on the echocardiographic examination after induction of anesthesia and prior to CPB. Blood flow through the circumflex artery could not be demonstrated by color flow Doppler with decreasing the Nyquist limit to 40 cm/sec. Based on these findings, it was suggested that the first few sutures used for annuloplasty near the P1 region of the posterior annulus were responsible for narrowing of the vessel. Since the patient was hemodynamically unstable, an emergency coronary angiography could not be considered. An urgent CPB was re-instituted and the MV was re-explored. First two sutures near the P1 region were removed and translocated more superficially away from the annulus",

The patient refused to receive transbronchial lung or CT-guided transcutaneous biopsy of the nodule to avoid biopsy-induced complications such as massive hemorrhage and pneumothorax. CT at 28 months after the initial operation, i.e., 16 months before the detection of the pulmonary nodule, showed no masses at the left hilum. Under the diagnosis of a presumed solitary lung metastasis of breast cancer, we initially planned to treat the patient with taxane chemotherapy because of the prior exposure to adjuvant anthracycline chemotherapy. However, due to the patient's preference to avoid alopecia, the patient decided to receive capecitabine chemotherapy, resulting in tumor regression for 7 months followed by regrowth of the tumor. The patient again preferred to receive oral cyclophosphamide (CPA) therapy (100 mg/day), leading to a marked regression of the lung nodule (Fig. ) without tumor regrowth and any new cancer foci for 10 months.

In the previous week, she had been using a nasal steroid spray and antihistamines without complete relief. Examination revealed asymmetry of the left eye and painful swelling of the upper left orbit was identified.\nThese signs and symptoms were initially mistaken to be caused by sinusitis and an antibiotic was prescribed to treat that condition, as well as a non-steroid anti-inflammatory. However, because of the previously unidentified asymmetry of the left eye, an X-ray of the facial bones was requested. The X-ray revealed an opacity of the left frontal sinus and a right shift of the nasal septum, suggesting that more reliable assessment could be achieved with a computed tomography (CT) scan. The patient showed no signs of reduction in facial swelling despite improvement in other symptoms, and the CT scan revealed expansion of the anterior portion of the left frontal bone, with involvement of the orbital surface and the ethmoid bone, suggesting PFD.\nWith a probable diagnosis of PFD, the family physician referred the patient to both the neurosurgery and otorhinolaryngology departments of a central hospital.\nAfter the initial assessment conducted by a neurosurgeon, magnetic resonance imaging and scintigraphy were performed.

No microbiological work-up was initiated in India to try to detect an underlying infectious process. The period from December 2010 until February 2011 in Iraq was characterized by recurrent chest pain, fever, chills, sweating, cough, and greenish sputum production.

Repeated CT of the chest showed multiple cystic masses impinging on the right ventricle and left atrium described as metastasis in concordance with his history of malignant thymoma (). At a local hospital, he received blood transfusion, fluconazole, and cefotaxime both at unknown frequency and dosage without improvement.

Despite her advanced age, the patient insisted on aggressive management.\nThe patient underwent a laparotomy, abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She had approximately 150 cc of clear, straw colored ascites. There was a 20 cm intact, largely solid lower abdominal pelvic mass adherent to the mid and distal sigmoid colon mesenteric serosa, which extended down into the cul-de-sac and left pelvic sidewall peritoneal regions. The patient had a preoperative right ureteral obstruction that also appeared to result from extrinsic pressure related to the 20 cm abdominal pelvic mass. Further examination revealed approximately 6 to 7 cm bilateral solid, whitish ovarian tumors involving the serosa of the mid and upper sigmoid colon mesentery. There were no intra- or post-operative complications and estimated blood loss was 500 cc. The patient is currently doing well clinically ten months postoperatively and adjuvant therapy was not indicated.\nFrozen section of the 20 cm abdominal pelvic mass was consistent with a benign fibroma. Pathology further reported that the ovary was white and enlarged, with a smooth and glistening surface. Cross section revealed a unilocular cyst containing yellow translucent fluid. The remainder of the tumor was solid except for small areas of yellow cystic degeneration. There was no identified necrosis.

Flexible bronchoscopy was normal and fine needle aspiration cytology revealed a squamous cell carcinoma. Physical examination and routine laboratory data were unremarkable. Echocardiography was normal and FVC and FEV1 were 2.84 L and 2.45 L respectively. Chest CT scanning revealed no mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Additionally, brain and upper abdominal CTs scanning, as well as Technetium Tc 99 m bone scintigraphy, were all normal. The patient underwent a left lower lobectomy through a lateral thoracotomy and a rather peripheral tumour measuring 4 \u00d7 3 cm was found. No nodal involvement was observed macroscopically and this was confirmed with frozen sections of nodal sampling obtained from sites 5, 9, 10 and 11. Biopsy of the tumour proved to be a pT2N0, well differentiated, squamous cell carcinoma. Double lumen endotracheal tube and high thoracic epidural analgesia catheter for pain management were routinely used. No blood or blood products were transfused. The patient was extubated immediately postoperatively and the routine chest X-ray at the recovery room was reported normal with good expansion of the upper lobe with no residual pneumothorax (Fig. ). Early postoperative course was uneventful. However, 8 hours later SpO2 pulse oximetry was noted to decline gradually, without any remarkable respiratory deterioration. Repeated chest radiography showed a left upper lobe consolidation (Fig. ). Urgent bronchoscopy revealed occlusion of the lower left main bronchus; neither the left lower bronchial stump could be seen, nor the left upper bronchus could be entered. With a high index of suspicion of lobar torsion, the patient underwent urgent reoperation. Once the thoracic cavity was entered, the upper lobe was found to be ischemic and atelectatic with its diaphragmatic surface facing in an anterosuperior orientation. Just before clamping the hilum, the lobe was unfortunately re-orientated taking its proper position and immediately regained its physiological colour. The hilum was quickly clamped en-block.",

She had a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and essential hypertension. She denied any history of thyroid disease and neck irradiation. She had no family history of any cancer. She was a housewife and had no history of tobacco smoking or consuming alcohol. A physical examination at the time of presentation was not significant except for right costovertebral angle tenderness. Her heart rate was 96 beats per minute and blood pressure was 155/90 mmHg. The findings of laboratory tests, which were complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, and urine analysis, were within normal range and they did not help us find the etiology of her right flank pain. Abdominal screening with computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass on her right kidney, which was considered a primary renal cell carcinoma and she underwent a right nephrectomy. Unexpectedly, PTC metastasis was diagnosed from demonstrative histopathological findings, such as positive immunoperoxidase staining for thyroglobulin (Tg). After further examinations of her thyroid and neck with ultrasonography (USG), a total thyroidectomy was performed. Pathological examination of thyroid tissue revealed a 5 cm tumor with capsular invasion and a strong positive immunoperoxidase staining of cytokeratin-19, HBME-1, and galectin-3. She was diagnosed as having metastatic PTC. Orally administered levothyroxine 75 mcg daily was initiated in addition to the metformin 1000 mg twice daily and amlodipine 10 mg daily treatments she received prior to PTC diagnosis. Postoperative serum Tg was above 300 ng/ml and anti-Tg was negative. Afterward, she was screened with unenhanced thoracic CT and skeletal scintigraphy. They revealed bilateral multiple nodules in her lungs and bone metastasis on T10 vertebra and right sacroiliac joint. Initially, 30 Gy radiotherapy was implemented to her T9\u201310 vertebrae for 12 days. We also started treating her with L-thyroxine to keep her thyrotropin (TSH) level below 0.1 mIU/L",

A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the lower extremities revealed a well-defined multicystic mass arising from the distal metaphyseal region of the left fibula (Figure ).\nThe mass was subjected to a core needle biopsy and subsequent histological evaluation of the biopsy specimen revealed a collection of hypercellular, spindle polygonal cells with an abundance of osteoclastic giant cells; which provided the tissue diagnosis of an osteosarcoma.

There was no special mention in his medical history; there was no alcohol drinking or tobacco smoking history. On physical examination, his body temperature was 36.7 \u00b0C, his blood pressure was 122/78 mmHg, his pulse was 56 beats per minute, and his respiratory rate was 12 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation was 98% in room air. Lung and bronchial sounds were normal. Head, eyes, and nose examinations were unremarkable. His neck had no lymphadenopathy. An examination of his heart, abdomen, and extremities showed no abnormalities. Blood test findings revealed elevation of tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC). On day 4 after admission, bronchoscopy was performed. The histology at bronchoscopy for the middle lobe of his left lung is shown in Fig. . Adenocarcinoma cells exhibiting a papillary pattern were found, and he was diagnosed as having papillary adenocarcinoma of the left lung according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, 4th edition. His adenocarcinoma was positive for ALK according to immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method (Fig. ). Based on this observation, he was diagnosed as having ALK-positive lung cancer with cerebral metastases, and administration of alectinib 600 mg/day was started from day 23 after admission. Adverse events such as allergic reactions, interstitial pneumonia, and gastrointestinal symptoms were not observed.",

    "original_text": "A 63-year-old Chinese male with end-stage renal failure secondary to reflux nephropathy had been undergoing continuous ambulatory PD for the past two years. He had an episode of PD catheter exit-site infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Corynebacterium species a year ago that was treated with antibiotics. He first presented to the PD centre with a two-day history of cloudy peritoneal effluent and mild intermittent colicky right-sided abdominal pain. He was afebrile and did not report any vomiting or diarrhoea. He frequently performs gardening but did not recall any episode of sterile technique breach while performing the peritoneal dialysis exchanges.\nOn physical examination, the PD catheter exit-site was clean without any discharge expressed. There was also no tunnel tract tenderness and overlying erythema. The white cell count of the peritoneal effluent was 1.6 \u00d7 109/L with 63% neutrophils. Gram stain showed polymorphonuclear leukocytes 2+ but no organisms. Peritoneal effluent culture yielded Weeksella virosa that was sensitive to amikacin. The patient was managed as an outpatient with intraperitoneal (IP) vancomycin and amikacin initially as per the institution protocol which was subsequently adjusted to complete a two-week course of IP amikacin. In the institution, peritonitis caused by single Gram-negative organism which improves with antibiotics are treated for two weeks as recent studies using registry data reported that the cure rate of peritonitis did not differ between patients who were treated for \u2264two weeks and those who were treated for >two weeks [, ]. The peritoneal effluent white cell count normalized within four days of treatment.\nTen days after stopping amikacin, however, the patient presented to the PD centre again with cloudy peritoneal effluent and abdominal pain. The PD catheter exit-site was clean. Peritoneal effluent white cell count had risen to 6.9 \u00d7 109/L with 74% neutrophils. Gram stain of the peritoneal effluent again showed polymorphonuclear leukocytes 3+ but no organisms, whereas culture yielded Brevundimonas species that was sensitive to amikacin.",
