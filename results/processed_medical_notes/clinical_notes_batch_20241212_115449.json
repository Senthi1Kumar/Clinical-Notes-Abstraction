The presence of an atrophy of filiform papillae with circinate erythematous ulcer-like lesions of the dorsum and the lateral border of the tongue was observed.\nDuring the anamnesis, neither the patient nor her parents reported any history of systemic disease or, in particular, any gastrointestinal symptoms.

The patient, as highlighted by the anamnesis, did not show any other symptoms or signs related to pathologies typically linked to an AG, apart from her short stature []. She was only 145 cm tall but this condition had previously gone unnoticed because her parents were also short.

Given that Sardinia is an area with a high frequency of CD, gluten enteropathy became the first suspect as a possible cause for the eventual vitamin B12 deficiency.\nAs a first step, a blood sample was requested to determine the vitamin deficiency and to perform AGA and tTG antibody tests and the EmA test.

The patient's rhythm was normal sinus rhythm, and there were no factors predictive of atrial fibrillation. Extensive laboratory investigation as regards thrombophilic disorders revealed no pathologic values.\nAfter providing an informed consent, the patient was transferred to the operating room and placed on the operating room table in supine position.

The dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the sternum was scored and divided. With an oscillating saw, a small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured for the patch closure of the segment of the ASD during the procedure. Purse strings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right and the atrial appendage. After systemic heparinization, central aortobicaval cannulation was done for CPB. Both caval veins were encircled with surgical tapes. After mild hypothermic CPB and cross-clamping of the aorta, intermittent cold cardioplegic infusion was administrated in an antegrade fashion into the aortic root.

There was a history of evening rise in temperature and weakness over the last 3 months. The patient also had a loss of appetite over the last 4 months and a weight loss of about 4.5 kg during the last 8 months. There were no systemic problems, no cough with expectoration and no history of dental trauma or surgery in the affected area. Extraoral examination revealed no cervical lymphadenopathy. Intraoral examination revealed diffuse enlargement of the upper and lower gingiva on the labial surface of anterior maxillary and mandibular teeth []. On palpation, the swelling was slightly tender and firm. The rest of the OC was normal except for the few deep carious teeth. Differential diagnoses were enlargement due to drugs, infection and hematologic malignancy. The possibility of drug-induced enlargement was ruled out based on medical history. The biochemical tests were within normal limits, except for a marginal rise in leukocyte count (13 \u00d7 10 9/L) and an elevated ESR of 56 mm/h (Westergren method), which ruled out leukemia-associated enlargement and raised the possibility of one of the common causes of high ESR, TB. An incisional biopsy was carried out under LA in relation to the gingiva of the mandibular right central incisor, in collaboration with the department of periodontics and implantology. Histopathological examination was carried out that revealed clusters of epithelioid cells surrounded by a chronic inflammatory type of infiltrate. There was no evidence of caseating necrosis, but numerous Langhans giant cells were visible in the clusters of epithelioid cells suggestive of a \u201chard tubercle\u201d [Figure and ]. To eliminate the possibility of localized granulomatous changes superimposed on an area of gingival enlargement, incisional biopsy was repeated in the remaining three quadrants. Histopathology showed similar granulomatous changes in all tissue specimens examined",

The combination of proteinuria with hypertension on admission made the diagnosis of severe preeclampsia overt, so she was started with intravenous labetolol with gradual escalation of doses.

Even with these measures, her blood pressure continued to be at a higher level so we added calcium channel blocker to her treatment.

However, despite having a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, he continued to have episodes of pancreatitis yearly for the next 3 years. Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a pancreatic duct dilated throughout its course to a maximum size of 8 mm without a discrete pancreatic mass in the head of the pancreas. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography confirmed a dilated pancreatic duct with a suspected filling defect of the common bile duct, after which the patient underwent sphincterotomy and stent placement.\nHe then presented to our institution for consultation. Further workup with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was performed, which also confirmed the dilated pancreatic duct, but noted irregular contour of the duct. In addition, free mucin was seen exiting the main papilla, and there was a papillary growth noted in the pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas, all of which was consistent with a main duct IPMN (). Preoperative laboratory values, including CA19-9, were within normal limits. Of note, it was unclear if the dilatation of the pancreatic duct was secondary to obstruction from the mass in the pancreatic head or due to main duct IPMN involving the entirety of the duct.\nHe was scheduled for surgical resection after the stated workup. He was planned for a Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) with possible total pancreatectomy if intraoperatively the main duct was found to be involved by IPMN with high-grade dysplasia. Transection of the pancreatic neck identified cells of high-grade dysplasia free floating near the margin (although exclusive of the margin).

The tumor mass border was unclear with smooth surface, and the tumor moved up and down with swallowing. The left lobe of the thyroid gland had no palpable mass and the neck had no palpable swollen lymph nodes. Accessory examination of neck color Doppler ultrasound at our hospital showed increase in size of the right lobe of the thyroid gland, which had abnormal shape. The upper right pole of the thyroid gland had an approximately 5.6 \u00d7 6.0 \u00d7 4.2 cm sized mass, with unclear margin, and multiple cystic nodules in the thyroid. The CT of thyroid showed increase in size of the right lobe of the thyroid gland, and an approximately 5.6 \u00d7 6.0 \u00d7 4.2 cm sized mass, the trachea was compressed and deflected to the left, the thyroid cartilage was compressed, deformed and reached the right subglottic region. The right thyroid lump had multiple calcifications, indicative of a tumor (Fig. ). Electronic laryngoscope examination showed ventricular bands thickening, the right ventricular bands compartment showed a rice-like projection, arytenoid region movement was poor (Fig. ). Thyroid function test was 5.07 mIU/L. The patient underwent subtotal thyroidectomy and excisional biopsy of neck mass under general anesthesia.

The evening before arrival at the emergency department, he noticed swelling around his chest and neck. It was worse the next morning, precipitating his presentation to hospital. On initial assessment, the patient had a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, and vital signs were BP 125/66, HR 92, and SpO2 95% on oxygen at 5 litres per minute via nasal cannulas. At the time of presentation, the patient displayed moderate subcutaneous emphysema on physical examination and subcutaneous emphysema on chest X-ray ().\nComputed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a left-sided pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema (Figures and ). Significant laryngeal swelling was also noted (). The patient was found to have multiple rib fractures, a lacerated scalp, and a Grade 1 liver laceration. A chest tube was not inserted at this time, after consultation with a thoracic surgeon at the nearby Level 1 trauma hospital. Upon reviewing the CT, it was suggested that the relatively small amount of pneumothorax for the degree of subcutaneous emphysema indicated potential pleural adhesions. The view of the thoracic surgery service and trauma was that an incorrectly placed chest tube at the regional centre may have risked entering the lung parenchyma. The patient was transferred to a Level 1 trauma centre 4 and 1/2 hours after presentation arriving 30 min later.\nThe extent of the subcutaneous emphysema was such that the patient could not be placed in a cervical spine collar for transport to the referral facility. His cervical spine was instead immobilized with towel rolls. Vital signs remained stable in transit, and the patient arrived at the trauma centre awake, alert, and breathing spontaneously on supplemental oxygen.

He presented with sinus tachycardia up to 123 beats per minute, a Glasgow Coma Score of 15, and had an obvious deformity of the right lower extremity. His tachycardia improved with 2 L of crystalloid fluid bolus. He was stabilized in a cervical collar and a Sager traction splint on his right lower extremity and taken for CT scans of his head, cervical spine, chest, abdomen and pelvis as well as plain films of his extremities. According to our institutional protocol, he underwent CT angiogram of his neck given his skull base fracture. He was found to have a right kidney laceration with active extravasation, two large hepatic lacerations without active extravasation, a right midshaft femur fracture, bilateral distal radius fractures, a left occipital condyle fracture, a dissection of the left internal carotid artery, and pooling of IV contrast near the bifurcation of his inferior vena cava (IVC). This was concerning for a vena cava or iliac vein injury (Fig. ). Given his hemodynamic stability, we consulted the vascular and interventional radiology teams regarding management. We decided to proceed with visceral arteriogram to control bleeding from the right kidney as well as a venogram to further delineate the suspected venous injury (Fig. ).\nThe visceral arteriogram demonstrated extravasation from the right adrenal artery and superior pole of the kidney, both of which were embolized with microcoils. Post-embolization angiography demonstrated no further evidence of active extravasation. There was no injury to the aortic bifurcation. A venogram was then performed, which demonstrated a 2.8 cm pseudoaneurysm arising from the proximal portion of the left common iliac vein with involvement of the base of the IVC without active extravasation.

She had undergone hemi-arthroplasty at another hospital using a porous coated anatomical stem (Stryker, MI) for a femoral neck fracture. The patient had poor posture due to compression fracture but was still able to walk until 4 months before presentation at our hospital. The patient had difficulty walking without experiencing trauma and was diagnosed with an anterior dislocation due to reduction of lumbar lordosis and severe posterior pelvic tilt. Because the dislocation could not be reduced at the other hospital, the patient was admitted to our hospital for treatment.\nPhysical findings at the time of her first visit to our hospital included height of 148 cm, weight of 38 kg, and body mass index of 17.4 kg/m2. There was no tenderness at the femoral triangle, her left leg was shortened in external rotation, she had limited range of motion (ROM; 70 \u00b0 of flexion, \u2212 10 \u00b0 of extension and 10 \u00b0 of abduction) in her left hip joint, and she was unable to keep standing. An X-ray image of her hip in the supine position showed anterior dislocation of the hemi-arthroplasty with severe posterior pelvic tilt (Fig. ). An X-ray image of her lumbar spine showed a wedge-shaped compression fracture of the fifth lumbar vertebra due to osteoporosis and reduction of lumbar lordosis. The small bone fragment in the anterior part of the acetabulum indicated the occurrence of a dislocation fracture due to stress concentration on the anterior wall of the acetabulum.\nThe anterior pelvic plane (APP), defined as a plane through the bilateral anterior superior iliac spines to the pubic symphysis, was regarded as the anatomic plane of the pelvis in this patient. The angle between the APP and the coronal plane passing through the bilateral anterior superior iliac spines (ASIS) was defined as the sagittal pelvic tilt angle (APP tilting angle) in the supine or standing position",

This was treated conservatively by the referring hospital []. The patient was uninhibited in daily activities, but complained of ongoing pain at the fracture site and was concerned about his cosmetic appearance. His past medical history consisted of a congenital atrial septal defect with partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, which was surgically corrected at the age of 18 months. On examination, there was a nonpulsatile dilation in the right anterior triangle of his neck overlying the clavicle which was tender on palpation. There was no other visible deformity and he had full range of motion of the ipsilateral shoulder.\nAn ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan were arranged, which revealed a hypertrophic angulated nonunion of the clavicle fracture. The surrounding callus formation was shown to be compressing the EJV, impeding its drainage, and causing the striking distension measuring 2 cm in diameter. The anatomy of the carotid and subclavian arteries appeared normal.\nFollowing multidisciplinary discussion, a decision was made to operatively reduce and fix the clavicle nonunion. Intraoperatively, gross callus formation was found at the fracture site. However, an arteriovenous fistula was also discovered in a vascular cavity in the callus between a branch of the subclavian artery and the EJV. The fistula was excised and adjacent veins ligated and closed by vascular surgeon before the clavicle fracture was reduced and fixed with a six-hole contoured plate without the use of bone graft.\nRadiographs taken 1 week postoperatively confirmed satisfactory position of the clavicle fixation. At 1-month follow-up, the EJV was less prominent and there was no residual pain around the shoulder. At 6-months follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic with full range of movement of the ipsilateral shoulder. Radiographs and CT scans showed union of the fracture",

As he stated, he had been suffering from pain without radiation for the past 30 minutes, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis. He claimed that he had had a previous similar episode the day before his admission, but the pain had resolved spontaneously after about one hour. He had a history of cigarette smoking, hypertension, and respiratory disease, for which he had received no appropriate and regular medical care. He had used Atenolol for the last three months in an irregular manner. No abnormal findings were detected on his physical examination (blood pressure = 140/80 mmHg, heart rate = 60 bpm, and normal breathing and heart sounds). His initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a left-axis deviation and left anterior hemiblock with ischemic changes (inverted T wave) on its pericardial leads. He had elevated cardiac troponin, and no other significant abnormalities were detected in his blood tests. He underwent medical management for acute coronary syndrome, and his pain was reduced within his first hour of admission. Echocardiography was performed for the patient and revealed a moderate left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with an LV ejection fraction of 40% and anterior and lateral wall hypokinesia. Mild LV hypertrophy was also detected. The patient was scheduled for coronary angiography on the following day. No chest pain or other symptoms were reported during the first night.

His past medical history was significant for an ileocolic resection when he was 14 years old and a proctocolectomy with end ileostomy when he was 22 years old for severe colonic disease resistant to medical therapy. At the age of 28, he developed peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum and seronegative polyarthritis for which therapy with azathioprine 1.5 mg/kg daily and infliximab 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks was initiated. For the previous 6 years, these doses remained the same and controlled his symptoms. He was otherwise well and took no additional medications. Born and raised in Canada, he worked as a structural engineer and was married without any children. He denied any smoking or alcohol or illicit drug use and had no family history of inflammatory bowel disease, liver disease, or malignancy. He had regular visits at his general practitioner and gastroenterologist. His last abdominal ultrasound was performed three years prior to presentation and was entirely normal. More recently, three months prior to presentation, he had routine blood work including liver enzymes as well as a gastroscopy and ileoscopy that were entirely normal. Unfortunately, over the ensuing months he developed progressive epigastric pain, nausea, fatigue, and 20 kg weight loss. Blood work revealed marked elevations in his transaminases and an abdominal ultrasound revealed a large liver mass. The patient was referred to our tertiary care academic institution to confirm the diagnosis and assist with management.\nOn presentation to hospital, the patient appeared well without any evidence of jaundice or stigmata of chronic liver disease.

    "original_text": "A 35-year-old left-handed man who works as a mechanic and firefighter presented to our institution with hand pain and cold intolerance for 3 months. He was referred by a local vascular surgeon who had made the diagnosis of hypothenar hammer syndrome (HHS) following an angiogram of the right upper extremity showing complete occlusion of the ulnar artery (). On initial examination, Doppler signals of the ulnar artery, superficial palmar arch, and ring/small digital arteries were absent in the right hand. Subsequently, the patient developed an ulcer on his right long fingertip after minor trauma that had not healed over a 4-week period. He suffered ischemic hand pain and severe cold intolerance. After conservative management failed, the decision was made for operative intervention. We proposed using an arterial graft versus a venous graft in order to improve long-term patency. Our plan was to utilize the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery (DLCFA) as an arterial graft.\nIntraoperatively, Doppler ultrasound revealed a segmental thrombotic defect extending from the superficial palmar arch, across the Guyon canal, extending 10 cm proximally in the forearm. The ulnar artery was resected back to healthy bleeding pulsatile flow, resulting in a segmental defect of 12 cm. Final pathology of the submitted ulnar artery segment revealed organizing thromboembolus in the lumen, which at the time of resection was adherent to the lumen.\nThe DLCFA was harvested, with care taken to prevent injury to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. A 12-cm segment of the artery was circumferentially dissected, as well as approximately 2 cm of 2 branching vessels at the distal end of the segment that would be used to reconstruct the superficial palmar arch and common digital arteries with one graft.

The cytological diagnosis was made using a CT-guided fine needle aspiration of the primary tumor and revealed an adenocarcinoma of the lung (TTF1+, CK7+) with the EGFR ex19del mutation. A PET-CT demonstrated the presence of liver and bone metastases and a nodule in the right breast, confirmed as a metastasis by fine needle aspiration.

The mass had been noted by the patient 8 years ago and had progressively grown in size. A computed tomography (CT) of the neck was obtained, which demonstrated a 3.5 \u00d7 2.3 \u00d7 4.6 cm lesion deep to the left sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle in addition to a smaller 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1.8 cm left posterior neck-enhancing mass. A fine needle aspiration (FNA) had been performed 2 years prior at an outside hospital with pathology indicating a low-grade spindle cell proliferation. She was thus referred to our institution for further evaluation. At the time of initial presentation to our group, the patient had noted dysphagia, left ear ache and tinnitus, and neck pain localized to the two masses. A positron emission tomography (PET) CT was performed, which demonstrated increased fluoro-2-deoxy-\nd\n-glucose uptake in the high cervical mass and, to a lesser degree, in the mass located within the posterior triangle of the neck (\n). The outside tissue blocks were reviewed at our institution and felt to be consistent with a peripheral nerve sheath tumor compatible with schwannoma from both lesions. Because of the patient's ongoing symptoms and because malignancy could not be completely excluded based on the results of the prior FNA, the decision was made to proceed with surgical excision of both lesions. Prior to proceeding, a magnetic resonance neurogram was obtained (\n). Tractography demonstrated that the two lesions appeared to originate from the spinal accessory nerve and that apparent diffusion coefficient values were elevated in both masses, supporting the diagnosis of a less aggressive tumor (\n).\nThe patient was taken to the operating room for surgical resection.

He reported the mass and expansion of his jaw occurred 1 year ago without any symptom, but diffused pain occurred 3 months ago. His medical history was significant for deafness and blood hypertension for which he was under treatment with a beta-blocker (atenolol).\nIn clinical examination, a mild diffused, painful and tender, bony hard swelling in the right side of the mandible that extended from the middle part of the mandible to the angle of mandible was observed. The surface color is normal and no sign of lymphadenopathy observed.\nIn intraoral evaluation, a tender swelling exhibited smooth surface and indistinct border soft mass extended at the right mandibular side from the first premolar to the second molar, caused displacement and mobility of first and second molars. Pus formation around the first molar occurred. Palpation of mass clarified expansion and thinning of buccal and lingual cortexes []. Multiple decayed teeth, calculus and stain were observed on this side. A small amount of blood was obtained in aspiration from the anterior border of the lesion, but in aspiration from the posterior part of the lesion, nothing was found.\nA plain panoramic radiography revealed an approximately 7 cm \u00d7 3.5 cm, ill-defined, multinodular radiolucent lesion extending from the apical and distal root of the third molar to the mesial side of the apex of the canine tooth in the right lingual side, with mild root resorption.

She presented to the emergency department with nausea, severe vomiting, and acute pain in the lower abdomen. She reported having experienced asthenia and weight loss for one month. On clinical examination, abdominal distension and tenderness were discovered. Blood tests revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and a contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 4 cm hyperenhanced mass in the cecum that caused complete bowel obstruction (). Also, a 5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 cm right adnexal mass that compromised the ovary with intimate contact with the uterus was found (). Furthermore, the CT showed dilated loops in the small bowel (>4 cm), some of which had an enlarged wall thickness and presence of intraluminal fluid stasis ().\nWith these findings, particularly the observation of a mass through the CT scan, and due to the evident weight loss that the patient had undergone, neoplasia could not be ruled out. Surgery was decided, and at laparotomy, a volume of 200 ml of inflammatory fluid was found in the cavity. Most of the loops of the distal ileum were dilated, and a 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 3 cm cecum mass was discovered, which compromised the ileocecal valve and caused complete bowel obstruction. Surgical decision was straightforward, the cecum mass was completely resected, and a right hemicolectomy was executed. An ileocolic anastomosis was also performed during the procedure. Furthermore, the right adnexal mass that was previously identified through the CT scan (measuring 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 cm) was observed to be firmly attached to the ovary and the fimbriae and displayed a pale external capsule surrounded by a cystic component.

Further evaluation with abdominal Magnetic Resonance Imaging revealed a mass in the upper pole of the left kidney with radiologic characteristics of renal cell carcinoma (). Left radical nephrectomy was performed sparing the left adrenal gland. The pathology specimen analysis showed a cystic mass 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 cm with yellowish friable tissue. Sections showed malignant epithelial cells, arranged in sheets. The picture was consistent with renal cell carcinoma, Grade II Fuhrman nuclear characteristics, confined to the capsule, neither pelvicalyceal nor vascular invasion was found (pT1bN0M0). Postoperatively she did not receive immunotherapy or chemotherapy. Apart from her hypertension which was well controlled with amlodipine and valsartan, subsequent clinical and radiological follow up showed no local or metastatic recurrence till 5 years after the operation then she stopped her visits. On October 2016 an incidental mass was found in the right adrenal gland during a checkup visit for the status of her right solitary kidney. Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan was done, revealing a well-defined mass with a smooth outline in the right adrenal gland measuring 54 \u00d7 48 \u00d7 39 mm with a central necrosis. The density of the solid component was 38 HU. In dynamic study the solid component showed significant enhancement after intravenous contrast administration (). Thorough hematological, biochemical and hormonal investigations were performed; all were within normal range. The results of laboratory examination showed the adrenal mass to be nonfunctional. The condition was well clarified for the patient and consent was taken to do right adrenalectomy. Under general anesthesia, in left lateral position through right transcostal incision, right adrenalectomy was done ().

Her past medical history revealed that she had undergone cesarean section under general anesthesia 10 years ago and her other past medical history was unremarkable. The patient was hospitalized for progressive bitemporal hemianopsia at 23 weeks of gestation. She was diagnosed with pituitary tumor extending into the suprasellar region and the tumor size was 26 \u00d7 21 \u00d7 21 mm. At that time, because of mild neurologic symptoms, low fetal weight, fetal lung immaturity and the possibility of premature birth, the initial decision was to delay the surgery of the pituitary tumor until after delivery at full term. At 30 weeks of gestation, however, she complained of rapidly deteriorating vision and bitemporal hemianopsia in both eyes and the ensuing radiological examination revealed increased tumor size (28 \u00d7 22 \u00d7 22 mm), displaced tumor location and compressed optic chiasm. Hence, she was scheduled for cesarean section and pituitary tumor resection due to the risk of irreversible blindness. Hormone tests revealed that prolactin, estrogen and progesterone levels were elevated, but these levels were within their normal ranges since she was pregnant. Other blood and biochemical tests were within their normal ranges. And the results of the chest radiography and electrocardiography were also within normal limits. Surgery was scheduled at 31 weeks and 3 days of gestation and neonatal intensive care unit was prepared to render specialized care to the newborn infant.\nThe patient was premedicated with ranitidine 50 mg and metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously. A left lateral tilt of about 15\u00b0 was accomplished to prevent aortocaval compression when the patient arrived in the operating room. 100% oxygen was administered via a face mask and monitoring of noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and pulse oxymetry was started.

The patient had a chief complaint of a headache in both the occipital and temporal areas and tightness in the posterior neck which were aggravated by standing, coughing and shaking of the head. On the other hand the symptoms were relieved by lying down. Simple analgesics and muscle relaxants were prescribed, but they did not ease the headache. On the sixth day since the onset of headache, the patient experienced blurred and double vision and this led him to the hospital again. On neurologic examination, he had horizontal diplopia which became worse when gazing to the right side (). Ophthalmologic consultation confirmed right sixth cranial nerve palsy, and the consulting neurologist recommended performing brain and orbit MRI. The brain MRI showed diffuse pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement (). The patient was admitted on the supposition that intracranial hypotension might have caused the headache and sixth nerve palsy. Spinal tap was performed and revealed an opening pressure of 11 cmH2O in the right decubitus position.

He had returned suddenly from Germany the previous day, as he was convinced that his life was under threat from his work colleagues. When asked why he was being targeted, he said that he had developed a software tool at work recently, which because of its effectiveness was able to do the job of several people; consequently, some of his colleagues were angry with him as they were at risk of losing their jobs.

He felt he was being used as a \u201chuman sample.\u201d He was convinced that his mobile phone calls were hacked, his internet activity was being monitored, and that he was being followed. He had written to his company management about his perceived persecution, and he had even lodged a complaint with the local German police who visited him at home to reassure him that he was safe. Even though he felt safer in Chennai than in Germany, he was concerned about potential harm to himself and his family from his German colleagues. He was adamant that he would never return to Germany.\nHe denied any hallucinations. He reported disturbed sleep over the previous few nights. He denied any suicidal ideas or ideas of wanting to harm others.

The patient presented with mostly negative symptoms of schizophrenia. He initially stated that his neighbors called the police because \u201cthe weather is wet\u201d and his allergies were out of control. He was found at home with his deceased mother who had shown signs of decomposing. When he was initially assessed, he only complained of feeling short of breath due to a foul smell of tuna fish coming from around his mother. When asked about his deceased mother he stated she was watching television and that she still had a pulse. According to the patient he had been giving his mother tea and medication for the past couple of days and had recently given her aspirin for her headaches before police arrival. It was determined that he needed psychiatric evaluation and he was brought into the ED by emergency medical services. He was determined to be acutely psychotic with poor reality testing and insight likely due to poor medication compliance. He continued to remain unaware of his mother's death during evaluation. He was admitted to inpatient psychiatry service for stabilization. On initial evaluation in inpatient psychiatry, the patient continued to maintain that he could communicate with his mother and spoke to her with a red phone next to his hospital bed. He was withdrawn, disheveled, malodorous, blunted in affect, internally preoccupied, and intermittently responding to internal stimuli (Table ). PANSS score was 32 on the positive scale and 39 on the negative scale.\nMontreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) test revealed a score of 26/30. The patient showed no significant cognitive impairment but had cognitive distortions in understanding the definitions and irreversibility of death. Collateral information provided by his stepbrother revealed that the patient was valedictorian in college before his first psychotic episode. Since then",
