CT scan performed at that time also showed complete absence of sternum. Echocardiogram showed situs solitus with an insignificant ventricular septal defect. The sternal defect was bridged surgically using a dacron patch. Operating notes also revealed a pericardial defect found during surgery in the same country. The infection started shortly after surgery, and was treated with mupirocin treatment locally.\nOn physical examination, there was an infected wound on the lower part of the hypertrophied scar. Further examination revealed a high-arched palate, micrognathia and two small hemangiomas measuring one centimeter in diameter on her left cheek. From the wound a multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured, only sensitive to meropenem and colistin. Considering the resistance of the bacteria, the mupirocin was substituted for 1% acetic acid as local treatment. The infection resolved and the wound closed within two months. However, when the acetic acid treatment was discontinued the wound started ulcerating and the same bacteria were cultured again. A thoracic ultrasound showed a fluid collection under the dacron patch, therefore the patch was considered to be colonized with Pseudomonas and a reason for recurrent infections.\nPre-operative CT-scan showed bulging of the heart and lung parenchyma into the defect, but no signs of mediastinal infection. The entire surgical scar with the ulcerative defect was excised (Fig. 1). The dacron patch was completely removed, revealing a layer of fibrous scar tissue underneath the dacron patch. This tissue layer was considered to provide sufficient protection to the intra-thoracic organs, and the skin was closed in two layers over this layer of tissue. The patient was kept in the pediatric intensive care unit for one day. Patient developed fever after one day of operation which was managed with meropenem.

An electrocardiogram was performed and showed a new, complete left bundle branch block (LBBB) (). Prior to the initiation of her infusion, her electrocardiogram displayed no conduction abnormalities at similar heart rates. Her symptoms spontaneously resolved within 10 minutes of stopping her infusion.\nShe was admitted to the cardiology service for additional workup. Her complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were within normal limits. Serial troponin I levels were obtained on admission, at 3\u20136 hours and were negative. A comprehensive echocardiogram was performed, which revealed normal left and right ventricular function, with no regional wall motion abnormalities. Coronary angiogram demonstrated no obstructive coronary disease. Her oncologist was informed of the results, and an alternative chemotherapy regimen was chosen. At 1-week follow-up, she reported no recurrence of symptoms; repeat electrocardiogram displayed resolution of her LBBB ().\nLBBB results when the normal activation sequence in the His-Purkinje system is interrupted, with asynchronous and delayed activation of the left ventricle. In most cases, LBBB is associated with underlying conduction system disease, which can be progressive. Multiple chronic conditions that promote myocardial fibrosis, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and valvular disease, can contribute to the gradual development of LBBB. However, there are some clinical scenarios, with acute coronary syndromes being the most commonly invoked, in which LBBB presents in a rather acute or subacute manner, leading to different diagnostic considerations ().",

Physical examination revealed left upper quadrant tenderness, however, no guarding or rigidity. There were no other localizing signs of infection. The patient had his port accessed for labs recently, placing him at risk for bacteremia. Initial laboratory workup revealed a white blood cell count of 21 500, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 3.01, and a normal lactate. Blood cultures and urine culture were also obtained prior to antibiotic initiation. He was hospitalized and started on cefepime. Abdominal tenderness was attributed to constipation due to recent history of hard stools and was treated with a bowel regimen.\nAfter three days of therapy, fever and abdominal pain persisted with a rising white cell count to 38 800 and CRP of 29.86. Blood cultures (including fungal culture) and urine culture showed no growth. Antibiotic coverage was expanded to include vancomycin. Abdominal CT was performed due to concern for an abscess, which revealed moderate retained fecal material, asymmetric thickening and edema of the left lateral abdominal wall musculature, reflecting myositis, and mild splenomegaly, however, no intra-abdominal abscess. He also developed 2-3 cm, tender, blanching erythematous patches on his abdomen and upper right arm (Figure ). Workup was initiated for septic emboli and was negative. New lesions continued to erupt, with expanding size of previous lesions. This included a large plaque on the left abdomen/flank where his previous abdominal pain was located.

The patient showed symptoms of spastic gait, a significant decline in short-term memory, and became disoriented easily after going out, but he had no dizziness, tinnitus, deafness, and disorders of consciousness. A head computed tomography (CT) scan was performed that found multiple lacunar infarcts in bilateral basal ganglia. The patient had a history of hypertension for more than 20 years, but with no detailed information on cognitive functions; he denied a history of repeated cognitive impairment and trauma. On admission, the following examinations were performed: blood pressure, with a value of 140/85 mmHg, and on heart and lung testing, which showed no obvious abnormalities. Upon neurological examination, good responsiveness; obviously decreased memory, judgment, and calculation skills; and pain sensation that was markedly diminished in right extremities were observed. Doppler ultrasound of blood vessels of the neck showed multiple plaque formation on both sides of carotid bulb and the left external carotid artery. Notable changes were observed on electrocardiogram and ultrasound examination. Magnetic resonance + magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain (September 14, 2017, ) showed infarction on left posterior horn of the lateral ventricle and the splenium of the corpus callosum (, arrow) while patchy, nodular acute infarction was observed in the occipital lobe and thalamus, associated with occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery (, arrow). Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was 12 points (). Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 16 points. Antiplatelet therapy, hypolipidemic, and blood pressure lowering treatment were administered and the cerebral blood flow was improved after admission to hospital, which resulted in remission and discharge after 9 days. Follow-up of the patient at 1 month of discharge suggested that the memory was improved significantly (MoCA: 18 points,",

Moreover, the patient noted that he experienced right temporal headaches with radiation to the frontal and left temporal distributions that occurred multiple times per day. These headaches lasted approximately 20 minutes per episode and were associated with right or bilateral vision loss characterized as diffuse blurriness followed by total blindness. An electrocardiogram revealed ST segment elevations in leads II, III and aVF (), warranting emergent cardiac catheterization. A left heart catheterization revealed a distal left anterior descending artery dissection graded as a type 2 spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) () due to diffuse luminal deformities and TIMI 3 flow indicating proper coronary bed perfusion.\nBased on these findings, no intervention was performed, and the patient was started on medical management with nitroglycerin and heparin.

He presented with 8-week history of persistent right lower quadrant pain, anorexia with 20 pound weight loss. Vital signs were stable and normal.\nOn physical examination, a firm, tender, fixed abdominal mass in the right lower quadrant was palpable. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed evidence of multiple masses in the peritoneum and mesentery. A necrotic mass on the right side of the abdomen measured 10 cm with communication to the small bowel and a suggestion of a walled-off perforation. The patient underwent CT-guided biopsy of the abdominal mass. Pathology revealed a tumor consisting mixed spindle and pleomorphic cells with focal rhabdoid features, high-grade nuclear features, and brisk mitotic activity. Ki67 expression was up to 70% []. Initially, a differential diagnosis of poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma of the colon was considered, but fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies for Ewing sarcoma and synovial sarcoma were negative.\nA week later, the patient presented with symptoms of small bowel obstruction. In addition to the previous masses, the CT scan at this time showed a left-sided abdominal mass measuring 8 cm with communication to the small bowel with dilation of the jejunum suggesting a new partial obstruction []. Three lesions were also identified on the liver [] at this time measuring 7 mm, 11 mm, and 1.3 cm as well as a 2.6 cm low-density mass in the spleen. The patient (at this time-delete) underwent an exploratory laparotomy with palliative debulking of the tumor.

His past medical history included a TURP 3 years previously for benign prostatic hyperplasia. A proximal penile urethral stricture had developed after the previous TURP. At the first visit, the patient had normal vital signs, and his blood tests showed a hemoglobin value of 13.0 g/dL and serum creatinine of 0.80 mg/dL. The results of a urine analysis were normal, and the results of urine culture tests were negative. A retrograde urethrogram showed an approximately 2 cm sized stricture in the proximal penile urethra ().\nThe surgery was performed with the patient under spinal anesthesia in the lithotomy position. First, a rectangular 3 cm sized flap was drawn on the stretched skin of the posterior scrotal face, centered over the mid raphe, for tubular urethroplasty (A). The skin strip was tubularized on a 16 Fr catheter with 5-zero absorbable continuous polyglycolic acid sutures and the avoidance of skin eversion. A second plane was made by suturing above the outer edges of the flap with interrupted polyglycolic acid sutures, and the tube was formed by a thick musculocutaneous wall (). Following segmental urethrectomy (), the tubularized flap was interposed by rotating it 135 degrees on its perineal scrotal base, which inverted its 2 ends. Proximal and distal anastomoses with the healthy urethra were performed with 5-zero absorbable interrupted sutures ().\nThere were no complications, and no abnormal blood test results were noted after the surgery.

Vital signs were blood pressure of 125/59 mmHg, pulse rate of 98 beat/min, respiration rate of 24 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5\u2103. On the physical examination, there were no peripheral skin lesions and cardiac auscultation revealed a grade 2/6 systolic heart murmur and electrocardiography demonstrated non-specific depression of ST segment and T wave changes. The blood chemistries, including coagulation studies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, the complete blood count, and lipid profiles were within normal limits. A chest radiograph showed increased interstitial markings on both lower lung fields.\nTransthoracic echocardiography showed left ventricular hypertrophy and enlarged left atrium size (44.3 mm) with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (68%). Moderate aortic regurgitation with senile sclerotic aortic valve change, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation with elevated right ventricle systolic pressure (49 mmHg) was shown. Interestingly, a large fluttering cystic mass (1.3 \u00d7 1.6 cm) in the left atrium attached to the posterior mitral valve leaflet which bulged into the left atrium and ventricle throughout the cardiac cycle resulted in poor coaptation and opening of mitral valve (). The color Doppler flow showed that the cystic mass was filled with flow during systole and also the color flow in the cystic mass was communicated with the left atrium (). Continuous wave Doppler revealed that the mass caused hemodynamic disturbance and there was moderate increase of mean pressure gradient ().

Six weeks after the surgery, the patient presented with pain in the right eye. On examination, IOP was 10 mmHg in the right eye and 19 mmHg in the left eye. The bleb was slightly elevated and cystic with no leak. The anterior chamber (AC) was shallow with peripheral iridocorneal touch. The peripheral iridectomy was patent, and dilated fundus examination was unremarkable. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) showed a shallow AC centrally with peripheral iridocorneal touch, and the ciliary body was rotated forward. The patient had 0.7 cupping in the right eye and 0.5 cupping in the left eye. Given the UBM finding, IOP, patency of the iridectomy, along with the normal fundus examination, the diagnosis of aqueous misdirection was made, and other causes of shallow AC such as pupillary block and suprachoroidal hemorrhage were ruled out. The patient refused any laser or surgical procedure and was given atropine drops in the right eye and was stable during her follow-ups with no need for further intervention. Six months later, the patient decided to proceed with only a cataract surgery in the affected eye. She underwent an uncomplicated phacoemulsification with synecholysis and posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) insertion in the right eye for the cataractous lens changes that occurred secondary to the previous trabeculectomy surgery. Progressive shallowing of the AC continued to develop while on atropine, and the patient agreed to proceed with YAG anterior hyaloidotomy in the right eye 6 months following the cataract surgery. Nevertheless, the AC remained shallow with an IOP ranging 15\u201320 mmHg on atropine and aqueous suppressants.

The patient reported a medical history of spine surgery treated with neurostimulator placement. On examination, the patient was febrile and tachycardic, with elevated WBC, creatinine, and lactate, complicated by acute renal failure and coagulopathy. The provisional clinical diagnosis was sepsis of unknown etiology. A chest radiograph was unremarkable. A chest CT revealed multiple cavitating pulmonary nodules consistent with septic embolism. Echocardiogram showed an 8x4- mm mobile echogenicity on the ventricular side of the aortic valve along the right coronary cusp, which was consistent with infective endocarditis. The patient was treated with vancomycin IV after methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was identified as the cause for sepsis. A repeat chest CT after two days identified worsening septic emboli and a new small intramural proximal esophageal collection at the level of the thoracic inlet (Figure ).\nThe patient underwent surgical debridement of vegetation and aortic valve replacement. A chest CT performed on postoperative day 12 revealed similar-looking intramural esophageal collection, septic emboli, and postoperative changes of aortic valve replacement. Postoperative aortic valve pathology showed valvular tissue with acute inflammation and fibrinoid necrosis with associated necroinflammatory vegetations and bacterial colonies.

Injections of botA sites were 1 cm medial of the middle of the eyebrow (2 \u00d7 2 Allergan units [AU]), above the medial margin of the eyebrow (4 \u00d7 2 AU), in the glabellar area (2 AU), and in the frontal musculature (2 \u00d7 2 AU).\nVistabel 4 AU/0.1 mL (Botox\u00ae, Allergan) was used in all 18 AU. The patient reported a visible effect after 3 days. At follow-up after 2 weeks, the patient reported cosmetic satisfaction with reduction of fine lines. Incidentally, she noted that she had not had any headaches since the injections.\nAt 4 weeks, she described a complete absence of headaches and that she felt more relaxed during the day. When questioned about the headaches, she reported that she had not previously noted that she had headaches, and the quality and frequency of the headaches were difficult to describe exactly. She described the absence of a pressuring sensation on the right side of the head, located at the frontal region. Also, she noticed that she would routinely, out of habit, apply pressure with the fingers to the middle of the superior margin of the right orbit, probably due to the headaches. From her description, the headaches were subclinical and probably of a tension type. The frequency was probably high, as she had made it a habit to apply pressure to the middle of the superior margin of the right orbit.

He was resuscitated on the field, requiring 10 external electrical shocks for an incessant ventricular tachycardia (VT). After reestablishment of the sinus rhythm, he was addressed to our clinic for further investigation. Coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries.

Electrophysiological study was performed, but no ventricular arrhythmias were further induced. The patient was started on amiodarone and reevaluation with cardiac MRI was recommended for the confirmation of ARVC. Furthermore, complete cessation of professional football was advised. Despite this, between 2011 and 2019 the patient did not return for reevaluation, stopped any medical treatment and resumed the endurance physical activity.\nIn February 2019 he presents a syncopal episode while undergoing regular house activities, followed by constrictive thoracic pain and palpitations.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 35-year-old male presented to the ER with right craniofacial trauma due to an occupational injury caused by falling of a plastic pipe on his head. He was awake and aware at the time of arrival. The initial assessment revealed a GCS level of 14. Signs of traumatic injuries in the right side of his face included swollen eyelids due to trauma to the soft tissue of the right periorbital and frontal area along with right superior eyelid laceration, redness, and tenderness. The visual acuity in his right eye was almost no light perception. Right optic neuropathy was evident with a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) of 4+. The eye movements of the right eye were restricted in all directions, but the other side was normal. Other examinations revealed no further abnormal findings.\nCT-Scan depicted a small focus at the level of the right Sylvian fissure in favor of a pneumocephalus and a hyperdense structure in the right orbital cavity, posterior to the globe, suggestive of a bony material (Figs. , , and ). As we were not sure about the origin and material of hyperdense structure demonstrated on CT-Scan, use of MRI was waived in order to prevent subsequent complications in case of metal object foreign body. However, initial assessments of patient\u2019s images amplified the suspicion of skull base fracture, regarding the foci of pneumocephalus, especially at the region of the right superior orbital wall. Based on these findings, the patient was admitted to the trauma section of the neurosurgery ward and received initial necessary supportive care. Antibiotic therapy was commenced for surgery preparation and preventing probable meningitis, with Cefepime and Vancomycin.

The extraocular muscle movements were intact, except for limited left supraduction due to the eyelid swelling. The pupils were equal and reactive, and visual acuity and color vision were normal. Transnasal endoscopic examination was unremarkable bilaterally. Contrasted sinus computed tomography (CT) scan showed an expanding left frontal sinus hyperdense opacification with peripheral enhancement and extension to the left orbit (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a loculated mucocele in the left frontal sinus with hypertense T1 signal and extension to left orbit but no intracranial extension ().\nTOEA was selected after consulting the oculoplastic surgeon due to the lateral location of the frontal mucocele in addition to being an isolated mucocele with frontal sinus outflow obstruction. The frontal mucocele was successfully removed using TOEA through superior lid crease (SLC) incision followed by orbicularis oculi dissection, which exposed the orbital septum. The dissection until the superior orbital rim was exposed. The periosteum of the orbital rim was incised and peeled off, which exposed a bulging mass medially. The mass with surrounding fibrosis was excised completely and sent for histopathological evaluation. A bony defect was revealed at the lower aspect of the left frontal sinus measuring around 1.5 \u00d7 2.0 cm ().

A suprapubic catheter was placed prior to transfer due to a suspected severe urethral injury. The patient had no significant past medical history.\nOn arrival, the patient was tachycardic but normotensive and oxygenating adequately on room air. The physical exam was pertinent for an unstable pelvis and a digital rectal exam that revealed a foreign body in the rectal vault. There was normal rectal tone. The remainder of the exam revealed lacerations to the bilateral lower extremities with ecchymoses to the bilateral hips. Computed tomography (CT) evaluation revealed an intraperitoneal bladder rupture, a complex pelvic fracture involving the right sacroiliac joint, a shattered right acetabulum, a complete right femoral neck fracture, and the femoral head lodged in the pelvis (Figure ).\nThe patient was taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy and anoscopy. Anoscopy confirmed the femoral head was within the rectal vault with severe disruption of the right lateral rectum. The femoral head was removed from the rectum transanally, and the rectum was thoroughly irrigated. The bladder was repaired.\nThe rectum and perirectal space were noted to have significant hematoma and fecal contamination that communicated with the acetabular fracture. Intraoperatively, the patient became critically ill, and the procedure was abbreviated. A temporary abdominal closure was placed, and the patient was taken to the intensive care unit for resuscitation. The patient returned to the operating room in 24 hours for fecal diversion and further debridement, irrigation, and drainage of the right perirectal space.

A FAST exam (Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma) was performed prior to our orthopaedic exam, which demonstrated no signs of hemorrhage.\nInspection of the right lower extremity revealed two large wounds to the anterolateral and anteromedial tibial diaphysis. The anterolateral and anteromedial wounds measured approximately 20 cm and 12 cm in length, respectively. Both wounds exhibited gross contamination with road debris as well as exposed muscle and fracture fragments (Figure ). There was no clinical evidence of compartment syndrome. There were no sensory or motor deficits involving the superficial peroneal, deep peroneal, or tibial nerves. A strong dorsalis pedis pulse was palpable, however the posterior tibial pulse was unidentifiable on palpation or Doppler ultrasound.

At presentation, her visual acuity was 1/60 in the right eye and 6/18 in the left eye. Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) was present in the right eye. Both eyes anterior segment examination findings were normal. Grade 1 vitritis was noted in the right eye. Funduscopic examination of the right eye revealed a pale optic disc and pigmented scar over the macula with salt and pepper appearance. Intense retinitis with focal areas of haemorrhage was present nasally (). There was mild pallor of the left optic disc with macula and peripheral granular retinitis ().\nSystematically, she was diagnosed with combined T and B cell deficiencies by the immunologist at the age of 11. At that time, she presented with high fever, recurrent episodes of diarrhoea, oral thrush, and failure to thrive, with the weight of only 12kg. PIDD screening showed low T cell, very low B cell counts, and low immunoglobulin levels (). Her systemic therapy consisted of 3 weekly intravenous immunoglobulin, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim prophylaxis as well as empirical therapy for fungal infection which include syrup fluconazole 6mg/kg/day and syrup nystatin 1ml QID. She was also treated for CMV colitis as HPE of the colon showed CMV inclusion bodies. She completed 6 weeks of intravenous ganciclovir 3 months prior to presentation of her ophthalmic symptoms.\nWe diagnosed the child of having bilateral eye CMV retinitis based on typical fundus features and history of treated CMV colitis. She was planned for right eye intravitreal ganciclovir injection in view of poor visual function with posterior pole involvement.

At the time of the fall, no notable injury was sustained and the patient reported only minimal low back pain without radiculopathy. Over the next several days, the patient began to experience numbness and weakness of the bilateral lower extremities. Evaluation in the ER, which included a hip X-ray and MRI of the lumbar spine (seen in ), revealed only mild lumbar facet arthropathy and moderate left neural foraminal stenosis at L3-L4 without any concomitant hip or spine fracture.\nFollowing discharge, the patient reported worsening low back pain and bilateral lower extremity weakness in both L5 and S1 distributions. Several weeks after the initial fall, the patient was referred to pain management where he was evaluated and eventually underwent a radionuclide bone scan. This revealed mildly increased uptake at L5/S1 but was suspected to be a result of facet osteoarthritis. The patient denied any fever at this time, constitutional symptoms, or recent illness. Review of symptoms and physical exam were unremarkable aside from mild paraspinal tenderness and lumbosacral radiculopathy. The rest of the patient's neurologic exam was normal. The patient was instructed to follow up in one week's time. At the return visit, he reported continued worsening of symptoms with no relief. At this point in time, the patient mentioned that he had been experiencing shaking chills at night.

Upon arrival of the first responders, the patient was awake, alert, and following commands. The rescue of the patient required lifting of the truck. The patient suddenly became unstable when the pressure of the tire on the pelvis decreased. Subsequent to lifting the truck, the patient became hypotensive and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation, application of a pelvic binder, and endotracheal intubation at the accident scene. She was then admitted by ambulance to our trauma center under ongoing resuscitative measures.

She presented to an emergency department with an acute onset of abdominal pain and bright red blood per rectum. She reportedly had some breathing difficulty. A computed tomography (CT) of her abdomen had shown nonspecific findings suggestive of colitis and therapy had been started with levofloxacin and metronidazole. Urine studies did not have features of urinary tract infection. She was intubated electively at the other hospital due to altered mental status and need for supplemental oxygen prior to her transfer. Also of note, her family reported that she had some difficulties with her speech; this was in the form of difficulties with word-finding alongside slurring of speech. She had no other neurological deficits at that time. A diagnosis of MAHA with a suspicion for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) was made and she was transferred to our hospital for a higher level of medical care. On her arrival at our institution, she continued to receive metronidazole, cefepime, and tigecycline.\nShe had medical comorbidities of essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She had no reported history of infectious, autoimmune, or hematologic diseases. On physical examination, remarkable skin findings of purpura and ecchymoses were noted. She was intubated and coarse breath sounds were appreciated on examination.\nThe laboratory data revealed an elevated creatinine, markedly elevated serum LDH, and markedly reduced haptoglobin levels. Her serum ferritin was 739.8 ng/mL, transferrin saturation was 42 %; her cobalamin and folate were within normal limits.

The patient was referred to our hospital for endoscopic resection.\nLaboratory data, as well as serum carcinoembryonic antigen, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, and cytokeratin-19 fragment levels, were close to normal limits.

On clinical examination, the right leg was shortened and externally rotated. There was no neurovascular deficit in the ipsilateral limb. A comminuted intertrochanteric hip fracture was diagnosed on a plain X-ray of the painful hip and pelvis (grade 31-A2 according to the AO classification) (). Intravenous pain medication was administered at the emergency department, and the patient was transferred to the operating room five hours after admission.\nClosed reduction and internal fixation with a 170 mm 125\u00b0 intramedullary nail (proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA; Synthes\u00ae), 11 mm diameter) were performed. The patient was placed supine on a fracture table with traction and the hip in adduction and internal rotation. The nail could be introduced without any particular difficulty. A 115 mm blade and a 38 mm distal locking screw were inserted with the use of the aiming arm. For distal locking, a drill sleeve, a protection sleeve, and a 4.2 mm calibrated drill bit (340 mm) were used. Drilling was guided, however not guarded. There were no intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications. Postoperative radiographs were satisfactory. Postoperatively, three weeks nonweight bearing were instructed because of the high energy impact of the trauma. Also, low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin 40, 1 subcutaneous injection per day) was administered for six weeks.\nOn clinical and radiographic checkup six weeks after surgery, no particular difficulties were noticed.

He complained of 4 weeks of progressive dyspnea, skin changes on his hands consistent with Gottron\u2019s papules, and 30-lb weight loss. His medical history was significant only for hypertension, which was managed with amlodipine. He had no prior history of autoimmune disease. He was admitted to a local hospital twice in the preceding month for dyspnea and treated for presumed bacterial pneumonia. He received azithromycin, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone during those hospitalizations for approximately 10 days. His symptoms improved minimally during those hospital stays and so he was admitted to our hospital 1 day after his most recent discharge. Computed tomography scan of the chest showed extensive reticular opacities largely sparing the periphery, scattered areas of ground-glass changes, and traction bronchiectasis. High-flow nasal cannula and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation were required for respiratory support. Empiric vancomycin and cefepime were started for presumed pneumonia until it could be ruled out. He underwent bronchoscopy after admission, which did not reveal any infectious causes for his respiratory disease so the antibiotics were discontinued.\nThe patient reported that about a month before admission, he had noticed skin changes on his hands. On examination, he had small papules on the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers, consistent with Gottron\u2019s papules (). He did not have muscle weakness on physical examination. The Rheumatology service evaluated the patient and felt that his clinical findings were highly suspicious for undiagnosed amyopathic DM, favoring a diagnosis of anti-MDA5-associated DM.\nThe patient had noticed new skin lesions that began to develop just 2 to 3 days before presenting to our hospital.
