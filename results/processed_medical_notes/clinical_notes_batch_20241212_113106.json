He had earlier tried to suppress an erection before his routine morning religious rituals by kneading on his erect penis. He heard a popping sound with associated minimal pain and sudden detumescence. He noticed no bleeding per urethra but subsequently had difficulty with voiding and urinary frequency. On physical examination, he had a grossly swollen and deformed penis with deviation to the right side (Figure ). A diagnosis of penile fracture with probable associated urethral injury was made. Bedside urine analysis results were negative for blood and he was taken for penile ultrasound and sonourethrography about an hour after presentation to the emergency unit. This was performed using a high-frequency 7.5MHz transducer with our patient in a supine position and the penis supported with towels between the thighs. A generous amount of sonographic acoustic gel was applied on the dorsum of the penis and images were obtained both in longitudinal and transverse planes beginning at the glans and proceeding proximally to the root of the penis. This was performed initially without urethral distension. A 16Fr Foley catheter was then placed at the urethral meatus with its balloon inflated with 2mL of water at the fossa navicularis. Retrograde urethral distension using normal saline was achieved via the catheter and sonographic images were obtained as above. The penile ultrasound showed a tear of the TA covering the ventrolateral aspect of left CC with associated hematoma in the proximal third of the penile shaft, and the real-time sonourethrography additionally revealed an intact urethra (Figures and A,B).

Symptoms of the initial presentation, which brought the patient under the care of the Neurosurgical team, included impaired ability to self-care and mild cognitive dysfunction. Surgical and Medical teams deemed the histo-pathological diagnosis essential due to the need for tailored subsequent medical management including potential urgent administration of chemotherapy and radiation.\nThe specialised allergy testing was not feasible due to the brief 4 day timeline proposed between the two procedures. Decision was made to proceed with surgery due to the urgent need for the identification of the nature of the lesion.\nBoth patient and the prior care episode were evaluated. Patient had a background of treated hypertension, with no other underlying illnesses. Prior to this, he had undergone uneventful surgical procedures and anaesthesia.\nHistory, records of the procedure, and tests for mast cell mediators, were reviewed by the attending anaesthetist. During the first care episode patient was given a single dose of midazolam, followed by remifentanil and propofol total intravenous anaesthesia, rocuronium and cephazolin in quick succession. The laryngoscopic view was a Grade 3 Cormack and Lehane, with direct laryngoscopy utilising a Macintosh 4 Blade. CMAC\u00ae Blade 4 Videolaryngoscope demonstrated an equivalent Grade 3 Cormack and Lehane view. Following successful airway management, patient developed intractable hypotension, concomitant bronchospasm and was diagnosed with clinical anaphylactic episode. The patient was treated with an adrenaline infusion, procedure was abandoned and he was admitted with an endotracheal tube in situ to Intensive Care Unit where he recovered uneventfully.

No Sezary cell was noted in the blood smear. A biopsy of cutaneous tumor was performed and the pathologist confirmed a localization of tumoral nontransformed MF.\nBetween 2006 and 2014 the patient received several systemic treatment lines including methotrexate, PUVA therapy, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, polychemotherapy, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody. All these drugs were without long-lasting effect and tumoral lesions progressed including the tumoral lesion of the nose (Figures and ).\nThe extent, progression, and resistance of his skin lesions gave a palliative intent to his treatment project. The patient reported that the aspect of his nose refrained him from interacting with people, which led him progressively to get socially isolated. He reported difficulties in interacting with his family members especially with his young grandchildren. Histology from the nasal lesion was obtained and showed classical Mycosis Fungoides of granulomatous type without transformation.\nHe was then referred to our radiotherapy unit in August 2014.

His laboratory findings were as follows: B-positive blood type, partial thromboplastin time 56 seconds, bleeding time more than 12 minutes, hemoglobin 10 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume 75 fL, mean corpuscular hemoglobin 24 pg/red blood cell, factor VIIIc activity 3%, vWF antigen level was undetectable, and vWF ristocetin cofactor activity was undetectable. He had experienced some occasional hemarthrosis, but he had been well for two months before he presented to our hospital. He had no history of trauma. However, his physical examination showed that he had an anxious and painful facial expression. There was severe tenderness on palpation of the right flank. No mass was found. His pain radiated to the hip joint and the inguinal region. He supported himself with a stick and could not stand up on his legs. The patient exhibited an anti-pain posture and held his right leg flexed at the hip joint (Figure ). He had hypoesthesia on the anterior aspect of his right thigh (Figure ). His knee tendon reflex was weak, and weakness of his quadriceps muscle was demonstrable. A plain abdominal X-ray demonstrated lack of clarity at the right psoas muscle line. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a hematoma in the right iliopsoas muscle (Figure ). He was treated with Humate-P at a dose of 40 IU/kg body weight twice daily. The dose was calculated on the basis of factor VIII coagulation.

She had been treated for mycoplasma infection by a primary care physician. At presentation, the headaches were reportedly severe. The patient had no history of fevers but reported a sore throat 3-4 days prior without a cough or other discomfort. Her past medical history had no notable illnesses. Regarding her social history, she lived on a farm with a friend who had been treated for fungal meningitis in the past. No tobacco, alcohol, or intravenous drug use was admitted. She denied exposure or prior treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. She had no significant past medical history. On examination she was afebrile with a blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg. She was alert and oriented with no adenopathy. A complete blood count revealed a white blood cell (WBC) of 12.4 (4.2-9.1 thousand/microliter), 87% neutrophils with no bands. Serology was negative for mycoplasma and HIV-1. Her neurological exam was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 3.5 \u00d7 1.3 \u00d7 1.9 cm contrast enhancing lesion of the left temporal lobe with a mild midline shift []. Evaluation by multiple specialists suggested a differential diagnosis of a noninfectious process (favored) neoplastic process or infection. She was treated with vancomycin 1.25 g IV per 12 h and meropenem 2 g IV q 8 h and decadron.\nThe mass was resected and aerobic, anaerobic, mycobacterial, and fungal cultures were taken. Anaerobic and aerobic cultures as well as gram, modified acid fast bacillus, and fungal stains were negative. Brain tissue polymerase chain reaction analysis at the state Department of Public Health laboratory public was negative for infectious agents.

He presented to our emergency department with extensive swelling and ecchymosis of the face, right shoulder and elbow. The shoulder and elbow were too painful to move. The shoulder had diffuse swelling and tenderness, and any attempt at passive motion was resisted. The neurological examination, including the sensory status of the deltoid area, was difficult to assess due to the patient's enormous pain. An X-ray of the right shoulder revealed a widened joint space and an upward-migrated humeral head (). Right olecranon and facial bone fractures were also found. According to the local physical findings and X-ray of the right shoulder, traumatic rotator cuff tendon tear was highly suspected by the consulting orthopedic surgeon. The magnetic resonance images (MRI) confirmed this suspicion. It revealed an interposition of the ruptured rotator cuff tendons, including the supraspinatus tendon and the infraspinatus tendon (). Nevertheless, the patient has no subjective sense of shoulder dislocation during the trauma.\nAn inverted U-shaped skin incision was made during the operation, which allowed both an anterolateral and a posterolateral approach to the GH joint simultaneously. The operative findings included complete tears of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons and these tendons were interposed in the GH joint. Besides, parts of the torn infraspinatus tendon were interposed into the axillary pouch. Avulsion of the transverse ligament of the bicipital groove leading to dislocation of the biceps long head tendon was also noted. However, the biceps long head tendon remained intact.

In December 2010, the patient was treated for choriocarcinoma with lung metastasis with three courses of EMACO chemotherapy. Hysterectomy with preservation of the adnexa was performed. In May 2011, she developed clinical manifestations of brain metastasis, which was treated successfully through surgery (extirpation of the tumor in the parieto-occipital region of the brain), radiotherapy and 4, 5 and 6 courses of chemotherapy. Thereafter, she was closely followed up by a gynecologist and a neurologist. Her regular therapy was carbamazepine at a dosage of 800 mg daily.\nThe patient was in remission from July 2011 to October 1, 2012 when she addressed herself to our Institute.

Considering the relative good health of the patient, he is discharged. Between September 2011 and November 2011, the patient begins to complain of a chronic cough; he is subsequently admitted to our Pneumology Department and undergoes two FBSs with Anterograd methylene blue injection (5 cc); however, the test fails to provide diagnosis as no methylene blue is detected in the pleural drain. On December 2011 there is still evidence of air and pleural effusion on chest radiography, so a new pleural drain is positioned. Suspecting an esophagus-pleural fistula, the patient undergoes a barium esophagram, but no fistula is detected. The only way for air to reach the pleural cavity is in our opinion through a BPF. In order to confirm our suspicions, we propose to Mr. RR a Bronchoscopy with Retrograde methylene blue Injection. During this final FBS session, a solution of 5 cc of methylene blue mixed in 50 cc of saline solution (NaCl 0.9%) is injected into the pleural drain. The colorant finally appears in the right bronchial tree, demonstrating the presence of a BPF, located in the right inferior bronchus",

Due to deterioration of consciousness, the patient was sedated, intubated and transported to our neurosurgical department for further treatment. After consultation, the patient was indicated for acute surgical clipping of the aneurysm by the surgeon on duty (the first author).

Antiedema measures, including lumbar drainage of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), were unsuccessful; therefore, the surgeon decided to utilize major retraction of the frontal lobe in order to quickly gain access to the lamina terminalis, aiming to fenestrate it. Unfortunately, this maneuver resulted in arterial bleeding from this area, which was successfully controlled with Surgicel, and fenestration of the lamina terminalis was microsurgically performed. This resulted in sufficient CSF decompression and brain relaxation, which allowed the dissection of the carotid and Sylvian cisterns and resulted in the successful clipping of the ruptured aneurysm.

Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy were given.\nSeventeen months after the end of the radiotherapy, she presented with a painful mass in her right breast at the surgical bed. There were neither palpable axillary lymph nodes nor elevation of tumor markers.

The overlying skin was devoid of hair. At birth, she was also noted to have a nodular lesion in the right upper eyelid and scleral mass in the right ocular globe. A few small skin nodules were also present over ipsilateral side of the face []. All these cutaneous and ocular lesions were increasing in size in proportion to patient's generalized body growth. The scleral mass was now interfering with her vision, so the patient wanted its removal. She also wanted surgical correction of the scalp swelling for cosmetic reasons. She had no history of seizures and neurological examination was unremarkable. Plain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain were done to exclude intracranial and intraorbital extension of these lesions.

Coughing and sneezing significantly increased his pain in all areas of complaint and he denied chest pain and shortness of breath. Relevant medical history included concurrent care for high-grade papillary transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder, and presence of a pacemaker. He was a 50-year non-smoker, but with a 30-pack year history of cigarette use.\nHis bladder cancer was diagnosed approximately one year prior after he presented with gross hematuria. Cystoscopy confirmed the presence of an 8 mm papillary tumor near the right ureteral opening and trigone, and a second cystoscopy identified a 5 mm mass on the left lateral bladder wall. Two prior biopsy and transurethral resections of bladder tumor (TURBT) procedures had been performed. Pathology report revealed high-grade transitional cell carcinoma that invaded subepithelial connective tissue, but was negative for muscular infiltration. Upon presenting for chiropractic care he was in the process of completing a second round of Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) immunotherapy.\nCervical radiographs taken one week prior to presentation were read as moderate degenerative changes of the cervical spine with moderate carotid bulb atherosclerosis (Fig. ). Physical examination revealed tenderness to touch of cervical paraspinal muscles and left upper trapezius, and diminished light touch of the left upper extremity. Left anterior chest wall pain was reproduced with manual over pressure of the left lower cervical spine.

His only significant finding on history was a strong family history of factor V Leiden mutation. The physical exam was grossly unremarkable. The initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reported a single mass in the right frontal lobe (Figure ).\nWith high suspicion for primary brain tumor, total resection of the intracranial lesion was performed and revealed a metastatic, poorly differentiated carcinoma with an inconclusive immunohistochemical profile.\nStaging investigations with computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomographic (PET) scans revealed pulmonary and pelvic tumor deposits. A scrotal ultrasound revealed a minimally atrophic right testicle with no further abnormalities detected. A follow-up cranial MRI revealed enhancement in the surgical bed and new metastatic foci (Figures , ).\nPathological and imaging findings were consistent with metastatic carcinoma with progressive brain lesions from an unestablished primary focus. At this time the brain lesions were increasingly symptomatic. Further treatment options with chemotherapy and whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) were discussed with the patient. The patient refused palliative intent chemotherapeutic intervention for unknown primary, but agreed to WBRT with a prescribed dose of 30 gray in 10 fractions delivered.

The patient was treated with corticosteroid therapy. In October 2008, he developed a cough, sputum, and rhinorrhea and five days later displayed fever and dyspnea. He was subsequently admitted to hospital. His chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) scan showed multifocal patchy ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in both lungs with underlying emphysema with large bullae in the left lower lobe and focal irregular nodular lesions in the right upper lobe that were presumed to be TB sequelae. He was assessed as having atypical pneumonia. Considering his immunocompromised status, antibiotic therapy was commenced empirically.\nAfter five days, he was transferred to our hospital, a tertiary referral center, and admitted to the medical intensive care unit. At admission, he had tachypnea with a fever of 39\u2103. He had progressive bilateral diffuse infiltrations on his chest radiography. His initial SaO2 level was 75% and his PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio was 166 mmHg. He was diagnosed with ARDS caused by atypical pneumonia. He then received mechanical ventilation (MV). We started a course of methylprednisolone at a dose of 40 mg twice a day to treat a possible Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in conjunction with a continuing regimen of empirical antibiotics and an antiviral agent. However, no specific pathogen was identified in any specimen from this patient, including bronchoalveolar lavage, blood or sputum. Then, his chest radiography was stationary and his P/F ratio began to gradually improve.\nOn hospital day (HD) 7, he underwent tracheostomy to enable early weaning from MV.

    "original_text": "A 41-year-old Japanese woman presented to our clinic with a 4 month history of bilateral groin pain and right buttock pain. Her right hip was more painful than her left hip. There was no history of trauma, alcohol abuse, or steroid use. Her medical history included iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed 2 years earlier, after which she had been on iron supplements. She had no fracture episodes, including fragility fractures.\nHer height, body weight, and body mass index were 155 cm, 42 kg, and 18.7 kg/m2, respectively. She was able to walk for approximately 10 minutes without a stick, albeit at a slow speed. Limitations in the passive motion of her bilateral hip joint were observed thus: flexion, 100\u00b0, internal rotation 5\u00b0, external rotation 15\u00b0, and abduction 20\u00b0, on both sides. She was able to perform a straight-leg raise of the right limb with substantial pain. The neurovascular status of both lower extremities was intact. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association scoring system for the evaluation of hip-joint function (JOA hip score) was 46 points for her right hip and 56 points for her left hip. The score was based on a total of 100 points, comprising 40 for pain, 20 for range of motion, 20 for the ability to walk, and 20 for activities of daily living [].\nStandard radiographs of both hips (Fig. a\u2013c) demonstrated no characteristic findings such as the crescent sign, sclerotic band pattern, and collapse of the femoral head, and no joint space narrowing was seen in either femoral head.

He had a history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension for 20 years and took metformin 1000 mg/day and diltiazem 60 mg/day. His past medical history revealed progressive slowness in thinking and walking, memory impairment, sleep-wake disturbance and mood disorder, which had slowly progressed for the past 20 years; however, it had rapidly worsened during last year of his life. He was diagnosed with organic mood disorder 5 years before this presentation and treated with risperidone 0.5 mg/day, sertraline 50 mg/day, and trihexyphenidyl 1 mg/day. Even with this treatment, his symptoms had been progressively worsening for the past 1 year to the point that he could not perform daily living activities, such as taking the correct medications. He was the fifth of seven children. His sister had a history of unexplained hearing loss, cognitive decline, and slowness of movement starting at the age of 20. When she was 40 years old, she developed visual and auditory hallucinations as well as recurrent transient ischaemic attacks with full recovery. The patient\u2019s father and mother died at the ages of 70 and 78, respectively, and had no history of cognitive impairment or stroke. A mental status examination showed a good level of consciousness; however, he was mute and slow to respond to commands. A motor examination showed right-sided weakness (grade 2/5 for arm and grade 0/5 for leg) and generalized hyperreflexia except for right leg hyporeflexia and no sensory impairment.

The levels of the thyroid hormones (T3, T4), the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and the antithyroid antibodies were within normal range values. A neck ultrasonography (US) had already been performed describing a heterogeneous thyroid gland and bilateral small nodules with benign radiological patterns.\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck was not diagnostic demonstrating no remarkable pathological findings of the thyroid gland.\nFurther investigation was followed to exclude an ectopic origin of Tg. A US of the abdomen followed by a computed tomography scan (CT) of the upper and lower abdomen was performed. A heterogeneous mass sized 11 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 9.9 cm was detected in the pelvis. The lesion had irregular cystic and solid components, findings highly suggestive of an ovarian teratoma. The tumor was contiguous with the left ovary with no signs of invasion to the neighbor organs. The right ovary showed no pathology, and the uterus had features of fibromatosis. No other intraabdominal pathology was described ().\nTaking into consideration these findings, surgical excision of the adnexal mass was the treatment of choice. Provided that Tg levels remained high postoperatively, the option of a complementary total thyroidectomy was also discussed with the patient. Given the patient's postmenopausal age, a laparoscopic total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was initially proposed. However, taking into account the patient's preference as well as the fact that no pathology of the right ovary was detected, a more conservative approach was finally decided.

Palliative chemotherapy was planned for the child.\nShe came to our department crying with symptoms of pain during daefaecation. Pain was severe in intensity and because of the position of the tumor child was not able to sit.

The next day she came back to the department with not much of relief, was admitted and started on oral morphine solution 2.5 mg 4th hrly. Keeping the neuropathic component of pain in mind, syrup carbamazepine 100 mg BD was started. Cremaffin and ibuprofen were continued. By the second day child had good pain relief, was able to lie down on the back and was sleeping comfortably but was constipated. Therefore, lactulose 10 ml at night was started. On the third day, the child was comfortable and had passed stools.

On examination she displayed emotional liability and cerebellar signs including high pitched scanning speech, down beat vertical nystagmus, dysmetria, past pointing, dysdiadokinesis, truncal ataxia, and marked titubation of neck and trunk which impeded her gait. Visual acuity was 6/18 in the right eye and 6/9 in the left eye with intact visual fields and bilaterally pale discs.

    "original_text": "A 62-year-old man with no history of eye surgery underwent 25G+ pars plana vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy. After retrobulbar anesthesia, a vision system was used to view the surgical field, and an inferotemporal sclerotomy was created using a 25G+ trocar. The trocar obliquely punctured the bulbar conjunctiva and sclera at an angle of 45\u00b0 (sclerotomy), approximately 4 mm from the limbus and parallel to it. The trocar was twisted into the eyeball, and its orientation was gradually changed perpendicular to the limbus. After confirming that the cannula was inside the eye, we pulled out the trocar and inserted an infusion cannula into the port. Two more sclerotomies were created in the superotemporal and superonasal quadrants. However, when we pulled out the superonasal trocar, the collar of the cannula fell off and the cannula tube was missing (Fig. a). Therefore, a bulbar conjunctival incision was placed to search for the missing cannula. No cannula was found in the subconjunctival space. We used a scleral depressor to look for the missing cannula tube along the peripheral retina and found the broken cannula tip in the ciliary body corresponding to the superonasal sclerotomy site. We created a new sclerotomy 2 mm above the original incision and 4 mm from the limbus and subsequently performed vitrectomy around the broken cannula to mobilize it for extraction. The new scleral incision was extended to 3 mm parallel to the limbus and allowed entry of a foreign body forceps (Fig. b). The broken tip of the cannula was brought into view by indenting the sclera adjacent to the original sclerotomy. We used the foreign body forceps to clamp and pull the fractured cannula toward the central vitreous body (Fig. c). With the help of the light probe, the longitudinal length of the cannula was aligned with the foreign body forceps and retrieved through the enlarged incision (Fig. d).",
