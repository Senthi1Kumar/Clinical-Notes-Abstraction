Free flap coverage was planned, with a necessary pedicle length of 14 cm from the middle of the flap to the recipient vessel and 9 cm from the flap margin. A 20\u00d76 cm2 ALT flap from the patient\u2019s ipsilateral thigh was planned. The perforator that branched at the proximal descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery was found intraoperatively (). The length of the branched perforator was 7 cm, and the available length of the descending branch on the proximal side was 2 cm, so the estimated pedicle length was 9 cm (). For pedicle length extension, dissection was performed on the distal aspect, which resulted in obtaining 7 cm of the distal descending branch. Thus, we were able to obtain a reverse ALT free flap with a total pedicle length of 14 cm in the distal direction. Before elevating the reverse ALT free flap, we clamped the proximal descending branch to check for flap circulation. We confirmed that flap congestion was present due to impaired retrograde flow through the valves of the vena comitans in the distal direction. To resolve flap congestion, one of the venae comitantes of the distal descending branch was isolated and connected to the proximal venous stump in an antegrade manner (). When connecting a 1.5-mm vena comitans of the distal descending branch with the 2-mm proximal venous stump, the diameter discrepancy of the venous anastomosis was not significant (). A modified ALT flap pedicle 15 cm in length was formed to prevent venous congestion and to ensure adequate length to reach the recipient vessel. As a result, the direction of the arterial flow to the flap was retrograde, and the venous flow was antegrade. To evaluate the flap condition after surgery, the flap color was checked and the pin-prick test and Doppler ultrasonography were performed. For 2 days after surgery, the flap status was maintained, with no findings of congestion or insufficiency.",

An examination of his extremities revealed contusions over his right upper arm without any evidence of penetrating injury. There was marked swelling and tenderness in the middle part of his right arm associated with a closed injury. His cranial nerves were intact and no neurological deficits were present. No injures were found in his other limbs. In view of the above clinical findings, a radiograph of his right upper limb and a computed tomography (CT) scan of his head were suggested. While the CT scan did not reveal any abnormality, the radiograph of his right arm showed a unilateral displaced comminuted fracture of the mid shaft of his humerus (Figure ). Our patient was then given first aid in the form of a U-slab and immediately transferred to our orthopedic ward for further evaluation. His laboratory results were normal. Liver and kidney function test values were within their normal range.

Her medical history included hypertension and a cardiac murmur, which had already been diagnosed during a medical examination when she was 18 years old. In 1991, she was evaluated because of symptoms of dizziness and near collapse during exertion. Besides systolic hypertension, no structural heart disease was found except for a mild aortic regurgitation and a peak systolic pressure gradient of 17 mmHg (heart rate 68 beats/min) over the aortic valve. She was treated with antihypertensive drugs and visited her cardiologist on a regular, yearly basis. Because of therapy refractory hypertension she was also referred to the internist to exclude underlying causes of her hypertension, but no underlying cause was diagnosed. When she was 50 years old, she stopped smoking because mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was diagnosed. At that time echocardiography showed left ventricular hypertrophy (septum en posterior wall diameter both 12 mm) with normal systolic function, still a mild aortic regurgitation and a peak systolic pressure gradient across the aortic valve of 28 mmHg (heart rate 64 beats/min). In the meantime, she was treated with four different antihypertensive drugs, but she remained hypertensive. To evaluate her complaints of angina in 2007 a nuclear exercise stress test was performed, which showed signs of reversible perfusion defects in the inferior, posterior and lateral walls suggestive of myocardial ischaemia. During following cardiac catheterisation, via the right femoral artery, the catheter could not be advanced up the ascending aorta because of a discrete narrowing of the aorta (Fig. ). Catheterisation performed via the radial artery showed a significant stenosis in the circumflex artery which was subsequently dilated and stented. The calculated peak pressure gradient across the narrowed thoracic aorta was 30 mmHg. Additional computed tomography (CT) scan of the aorta confirmed the diagnosis of coarctation with a pinpoint stenosis in the aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery.

    "original_text": "A 77-year-old female presented to the orthopedic hand clinic with a three-year history of an extremely sensitive small mass on her right wrist. The mass had subjectively grown over this period of time. The pain had progressively worsened over time, and she had developed significant hypersensitivity to light contact. There was no complaint of cold sensitivity to the mass. The pain occasionally radiated down the ulnar aspect of her wrist. She had no known history of previous trauma to this area; however, she did have a history of squamous cell carcinoma to the dorsal-radial aspect of that hand. This had been treated previously for which she subsequently developed a reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), resulting in a delayed recovery in the range of motion. A previous stellate ganglion block did not provide relief for her RSD, and her range of motion had been slowly progressing with home exercises.\nOn physical exam, a small round nodule approximately 5 mm x 5 mm was palpable dorsal to the extensor carpi ulnaris and 1 cm proximal to the ulnar styloid. There was significant point tenderness that did not radiate or display a Tinel\u2019s sign. Her imaging included plain films of the affected extremity that showed no abnormality outside of diffuse osteopenia.\nThe location and exam were consistent with a neuroma that had evolved from a cutaneous nerve or possibly from the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve. The patient was taken to the operative theatre and deep dissection revealed a maroon-colored mass approximately 5 mm x 5 mm, connected to a cutaneous nerve branch. The nerve and mass were excised and sent for histopathological review. The ulnar nerve and dorsal sensory branch were visualized and confirmed to have no involvement with the mass.

He complained of fractured maxillary incisors and presented a desire to get them restored in order to have an aesthetic smile. Clinical examination of the patient revealed complicated crown fracture of the upper incisors. An intraoral swelling with a sinus tract was present on the labial gingiva between upper right central and lateral incisor (Figures and ). A radiograph of the maxillary anterior region illustrated horizontal root fracture at the middle third of the upper right central and lateral incisors () but clinically no mobility of the coronal fragment was evident. On the other hand the roots of the upper left central and lateral incisors were intact and endodontic treatment had been done for the upper left central and lateral incisors ().\nAfter explaining the treatment plan to the patient and obtaining his consent, endodontic treatment with the upper right central and lateral incisors was initiated. The working length was correctly determined and canals were cleaned, shaped using K files in a step-back manner to an apical file size #60. The remainder of the canals were shaped to obtain a uniform taper from apex towards coronal. An interappointment calcium hydroxide dressing was given and the patient was recalled after 7 days.\nOn the second visit, when the swelling had resolved, root canals were sectionally obturated with gutta percha cone and AH plus sealer. A gutta percha cone of the same size of the prepared root canal (size #60, with a taper of 2%) was selected and tried into the canal to obtain a snug fit.

The patient was performing a one-rep max bench press when he felt a pop in his right upper arm, accompanied by severe pain. There was no history of anabolic steroid use. He was initially treated with ice and a sling by a trainer and presented to the emergency department for further evaluation. Plain films were negative for fracture or dislocation and the patient was neurovascularly intact, so he was discharged home by ER staff in the sling. He presented to the orthopedic clinic the following day with moderate pain in the chest and arm. He denied numbness and paresthesia. On physical examination, there was a large amount of swelling and ecchymoses throughout the right upper arm extending into the pectoralis major muscle belly. Additionally, there was a large bulge in the anterior chest with loss of contour of the axillary fold (). The patient had full active range of motion of the elbow, wrist, and digits. He was sensory intact throughout the right upper extremity with a 2+ radial pulse. An MRI was scheduled to determine the extent of the injury and to aid in surgical planning. The patient was given oxycodone and valium to alleviate the pain and muscle spasms until surgery, which was scheduled after his MRI. The MRI demonstrated avulsion of the pectoralis major tendon from its insertion on the humerus with retraction as well as strain of the anterior deltoid (Figures and ). He was scheduled for surgery in five days. Two days later, the patient returned to our facility with severe worsening pain in the right upper arm.

The diameter of his middle esophageal diverticulum was 47 mm, and the accumulation of contrast medium was observed in the diverticulum. A gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a diverticulum in the right wall located 30 cm from the incisor row (Fig. ), and the diverticulum mucous membrane was partially covered by adherent white matter that was unstained with iodine (Fig. ), and narrowband imaging which revealed type A.

The patient had a history of previous left knee ACL reconstruction approximately 25 years ago using the Arthrotek bone mulch screw and WasherLoc system []. She underwent removal of the tibial WasherLoc approximately 10 years later, in the early 2000's ().\nThe patient was positioned supine; standard incision with a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed. A measured resection technique was then performed with an intramedullary guide placed in the femur. The femur was cut in 6 degrees of valgus and 3 degrees of external rotation.

The implantation was surgically revised in 2002 and 2006. In 2014 she noticed hardening and swelling of her right breast. Because of the death of her husband, she did not seek immediate medical attention. She continued to have swelling and increased pain in the right breast. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in January 2016 showed a large fluid collection surrounding the intact right silicone implant as shown in Figure . The case was managed by surgical drainage of fluid collection and capsulectomy. In February 2016, she underwent bilateral prosthesis explantation and bilateral capsulectomy. The pathology demonstrated a 4-cm moderately differentiated invasive SCC. It extended into the muscle, and in situ tumor was noted to extend to the peripheral margin. There was no perineural or lymphovascular invasion. Pathology of the left breast capsule showed chronic inflammation. Computed tomography (CT) of chest, abdomen and pelvis on February 2016 revealed absence of metastatic disease. The patient underwent re-excision of the remaining chest wall mass in March 2016. Pathology showed well differentiated SCC with negative margins. Chest wall fluid was negative for malignant cells. On slide review, it was noted that there was squamous epithelialization of the implant capsule with benign squamous epithelium on both sides. This indicated that the tumor is likely SCC of the implant capsule rather than primary SCC of the breast. Estrogen and progesterone receptor markers were negative as well. Afterwards, she received external beam radiation. She was treated with radiation while supine with free breathing. Four tangent beams were used to target the right breast with 50 Gray in 25 fractions, followed by a 10 Gray boost to the tumor bed delivered in five fractions. Radiation was delivered using opposed tangents completed in May 2016. No adjuvant chemotherapy was offered due to the rare histology and paucity of data.

    "original_text": "A 35-year-old man has been referred to our Dermatology Clinic with the complaint of painful firm immobile nodules along with a surgical scar on the dorsum of his hand. There were also pus drainage and ulceration in some part of the scar. He claimed that there was a tumoral swelling at the dorsum of his left hand in the second metacarpal area for 12 months. It had been gradually increased in size and led to the restriction of the movement of the index finger. Therefore, he came to an orthopedic surgeon and underwent a tumor excision operation about six months ago. He completely improved after this surgery and did not follow up any further treatment. Four months after the surgery, some painful immobile ulcerated nodules with low discharge appeared on the way of the surgical scar. He works as an electrical technician but there was no obvious history of trauma or significant medical problem. Physical examination showed swollen areas at the dorsum of the left hand and palpable tender immobile nodules on the surgical scar with low discharge. Some nodules showed ulcerated crusted surface ().\nThe hematological and biochemical laboratory tests were normal. The hand radiography was done and reported as normal.

The indication was primary infertility, and her husband had asthenozoospermia and teratospermia. At 3 days after oocyte retrieval, the patient presented to our hospital complaining of 7 hours of right lower quadrant and right flank pain with nausea and vomiting for no known cause. Her temperature and blood pressure were normal. An abdominal examination showed normal bowel sounds, moderate right lower quadrant tenderness, and voluntary guarding. A vaginal examination showed a tender mass of 10 cm at the right iliac fossa with rebound tenderness. An ultrasound scan indicated hyperstimulation with enlarged ovaries that measured 97 \u00d7 68 mm (right ovary) and 71 \u00d7 50 mm (left ovary), and excessive fluid in the pelvic area. Doppler imaging showed diminished right ovarian vascular flow compared with the left ovary. A diagnosis of OHSS with right ovarian torsion was made and an emergency operation was immediately performed. At laparoscopy, there was approximately 500 ml of clear ascitic fluid. The right ovary was 9 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 cm in size, dark blue, and the pedicle was twisted 360 degrees (). The left ovary appeared healthy, was 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 cm in size, and had multiple follicles on the surface. At 5 minutes after untwisting the right pedicle, there was an improvement of colour. We continued observation until the right ovary, as well as the fallopian tube, turned a similar colour to the left ovary 30 minutes later (). At 9 days after operation, an ultrasound scan indicated that the right ovary was 63 \u00d7 48 mm in size with good blood flow signals. The patient was then discharged. On 3 April 2017, frozen-thawed embryo transfer was performed, and her pregnancy test 12 days later was positive.

The primary lung cancer was located in the proximal right upper lobar bronchus associated with postobstuctive atelectasis of the right upper lobe. However, at the time of diagnosis, the patient refused all the curative means. He had exhibited cough and increasing blood tinged sputum in the previous 4 months. We performed CT imaging on outpatient clinics, which showed a completely obstructed right upper lobar bronchus by a tumor with postobstructive pneumonia of the right upper lobe. The wall of the right main bronchus and bronchus intermedius was thickened and the lumen of the right main bronchus was almost narrowed by tumor infiltrations. Metastatic lymphadenopathy was observed in the right lower paratracheal and subcarinal area (). Nine days after the CT scan, the patient was hospitalized and underwent bronchoscopy. A bronchoscopic examination demonstrated that orifice of the right main bronchus was nearly completely obstructed by the endoluminal mass and there was diffuse bleeding from the right main bronchus. The patient received urgent external beam radiotherapy to control bleeding from the friable endobronchial tumor and bleeding gradually decreased for several days. However, eleven days after the radiation therapy, a sudden onset of dyspnea developed. Chest radiography showed that the right lung had totally collapsed and bronchoscopic examination revealed complete obstruction of the right main bronchus with diffuse bleeding.\nBronchial artery embolization could not be considered as a treatment option for hemoptysis because bleeding conditions were not because of active arterial bleeding and there was no prominent contrast enhancement of the mass as seen on the CT scan. We decided that bronchial stent insertion in the right main bronchus was necessary to both, re-open the airway and to control the bleeding of tumor through the tamponade effect. After the bronchogram, which was performed to identify the airway on a fluoroscopic image, we decided to sacrifice superior segment of the right lower bronchus to preserve basal segments of the right lower lobe.

    "original_text": "The patient is a 46-year-old female with SCC of the breast. She initially had silicone gel breast implantation for breast augmentation in 1995. The implantation was surgically revised in 2002 and 2006. In 2014 she noticed hardening and swelling of her right breast. Because of the death of her husband, she did not seek immediate medical attention. She continued to have swelling and increased pain in the right breast. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in January 2016 showed a large fluid collection surrounding the intact right silicone implant as shown in Figure . The case was managed by surgical drainage of fluid collection and capsulectomy. In February 2016, she underwent bilateral prosthesis explantation and bilateral capsulectomy. The pathology demonstrated a 4-cm moderately differentiated invasive SCC. It extended into the muscle, and in situ tumor was noted to extend to the peripheral margin. There was no perineural or lymphovascular invasion. Pathology of the left breast capsule showed chronic inflammation. Computed tomography (CT) of chest, abdomen and pelvis on February 2016 revealed absence of metastatic disease. The patient underwent re-excision of the remaining chest wall mass in March 2016. Pathology showed well differentiated SCC with negative margins. Chest wall fluid was negative for malignant cells. On slide review, it was noted that there was squamous epithelialization of the implant capsule with benign squamous epithelium on both sides. This indicated that the tumor is likely SCC of the implant capsule rather than primary SCC of the breast. Estrogen and progesterone receptor markers were negative as well. Afterwards, she received external beam radiation. She was treated with radiation while supine with free breathing. Four tangent beams were used to target the right breast with 50 Gray in 25 fractions, followed by a 10 Gray boost to the tumor bed delivered in five fractions. Radiation was delivered using opposed tangents completed in May 2016. No adjuvant chemotherapy was offered due to the rare histology and paucity of data. She followed up in clinic in June 2016 without complications or clinical recurrence.\nFollow-",

    "original_text": "A 22-year-old nulliparous Chinese woman with no significant family history of cancer presented to a private medical center with a painless 5 cm swelling in the left breast. The swelling, which was first noticed 3 months earlier, increased in size gradually. There was no associated nipple discharge or swelling elsewhere. Core biopsy of the swelling confirmed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma with triple negative receptor status for ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was negative for distant metastasis. By then, 2 weeks had passed since she first presented with her complaints. Following discussion between the attending surgeons, the patient, and her family, the decision to proceed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy immediately, was made. Two weeks into her neoadjuvant chemotherapy, she complained that the left breast mass had significantly increased in size from the initial 5 cm to 10 cm in diameter. She also developed a swelling in the left axilla that was clinically consistent with that of an axillary lymph node. Fine needle aspiration cytology of the left axillary lymph node was reported to be a metastatic carcinoma. A decision was made to proceed with left mastectomy and axillary clearance. Histopathology examination of the 14 cm by 12 cm left breast mass was conclusive for high-grade metaplastic breast carcinoma \u2013 spindle cell subtype, triple negative receptor status. All 12 excised axillary lymph nodes were positive for metastases. Six weeks following surgery, she underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. She defaulted follow-up soon after completion of chemotherapy and underwent Traditional Chinese Medication instead, despite advice regarding potential spread of the disease, and grave prognosis should that occur.\nFour months later, she presented to a district hospital with complaints of pain over the left chest wall and inability to move her left upper limb.

First, the right and left mandibular rami of the 3D model were connected by the autopolymer resin to keep the preoperative position between the proximal and distal segments (Fig. a). Based on the findings in a CT image, segmental resection was performed on the 3D model with a safety margin of at least 10 mm from the tumor (Fig. b).

The patient was healthy with no significant medical history and no previous history of taking medication (the patient denied taking aspirin or any other anticoagulant medications). But he had several previous mild neck pains and was relieved after manipulation treatment. The patient was treated with cervical manipulation and he felt pain and numbness in his lower limbs about 2 h after the end of the manipulation. The symptoms of his sensory abnormalities gradually worsened and spread upwards. The patient felt seriously ill and was immediately sent by his relatives to the emergency room of our hospital to visit a doctor. After being admitted to the emergency room, the patient was mentally alert during a physical examination. There was tenderness in the neck and increased muscle tension in both upper limbs. The superficial sensation of the upper limb had disappeared, but the deep sensation still remained. The lower extremity had 0/5 power on both sides. There were findings of sensory deprivation at the T2 dermatome and below, and anal tone was absent with the bulbocavernosus reflex. An imaging examination was performed after an indwelling catheter was inserted. There were no abnormal findings on a cervical vertebral X-ray and brain computed tomographic (CT) scans.

In June 2006, he fell from a tree at work, and a fracture of his right femur was redressed by insertion of a titanium rod. One week after surgery, he complained of pain in his right calf.

    "original_text": "A 23-year-old male patient was referred to our tertiary academic centre because of a defect affecting one side of his face. The patient underwent adenotonsillectomy at 6 years of age, and numbness started to affect the left side of his face 3 months after surgery. At that time, he was informed by his physician, who performed the operation, that there were no problems. However, the numbness affecting the left side of his face increased, and shrinkage and weakness of the left side of the face occurred over the next 2 years. In ten years after surgery, his complaints and symptoms increased (Figures and ) but he could not see the doctor for socioeconomic reasons.\nA physical examination at the time of referral to our centre revealed atrophy of cutaneous and subcutaneous fat tissue on the left side of the patient's face, phthisis of the left ocular bulb and corneal atrophy, left zygomatic atrophy, and asymmetry (Figures , , and ). Hemiglossal atrophy and an increased size of fissures of the left side of the tongue were also seen (). Maxillary atrophy displaced the left upper teeth in an upward and backward direction ().\nThe patient had no dermal lesions or involvement of the extremities. There was no family history of PHA. The patient underwent autologous fat injection at 14 and 16 years of age, but the desired result was not sustained and the atrophy continued (). No antibodies were detected in serological tests. Sedimentation and core reactive protein levels were within normal limits, suggesting that the facial disorders were not caused by inflammatory diseases. Computed tomography revealed no apparent neurodegeneration (), eliminating Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) from the differential diagnosis. The computed tomographic images revealed a decrease in left retroorbital fat tissue and atrophy of the ocular bulb ().

    "original_text": "A 15-year-old female with a prior history of aborted cardiac death and surgical correction of anomalous origin of the RCA was referred to the cardiology department due to repeated aborted sudden cardiac death after physical exertion with boxing. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (). Biphasic 200 joules defibrillation restored the heart to sinus rhythm and cardiopulmonary function recovered without neurologic sequelae. Two years prior to this event, she experienced chest discomfort followed by aborted sudden cardiac death after heavy exercise for the first time. Initial ECG at the emergency room showed pulseless electrical activity. She was successfully resuscitated after basic life support maneuvers and fully recovered with hypothermic treatment after being admitted to the emergency department. Her family history of structural heart disease, syncope or sudden cardiac death was unremarkable. Several cardiac examinations were performed at that time. Echocardiography demonstrated no structural heart disease with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Cardiac computed tomography revealed anomalous origin of the RCA from the left coronary cusp coursing between the pulmonary artery and the aorta (). Her follow-up ECGs after stabilization showed a sinus rhythm with an inverted T wave and a prolonged QT interval which was suggestive of congenital LQTS (). She was not taking any medications which can prolong the QT interval and laboratory findings did not show electrolyte abnormalities. But this finding was overlooked and anomalous origin of the RCA was provisionally considered as the cause of the aborted cardiac arrest. She underwent surgery to re-implant the anomalous RCA from the left to the right sinus of Valsalva. After receiving surgical correction of anomalous origin of the RCA, she had been doing well before the second event of aborted cardiac death developed.

After a computed tomography (CT) scan the patient was referred to our hospital with the suspicion of a rectal tumor. Complex medical history included a subtotal colectomy with an end ileostomy and a mucous fistula at the descending colon due to Crohn disease at the age of 16 years. In the following years, the patient suffered from repeated ileus episodes and a laparotomy with adhesiolysis was performed in 2007.

Clinical examination showed the patient in reduced general condition; the abdomen was soft and there was no pain during the palpation of the abdominal wall. Laboratory values were in the standard range.\nThe imaging in the CT scan was not conclusive, and therefore we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to confirm the suspicion of tumor and to allow staging. The MRI showed a massive dilatation of the remaining colon and the rectum without detection of a tumor at the anal level (Fig. ). Lower endoscopy failed due to complete anal stenosis and obliteration of the descending colon at the stoma site.\nThe possible therapeutic options were discussed with the patient. She refused a restoration of the intestinal continuity so we decided to perform an abdominoperineal rectum resection. After laparotomy and adhesiolysis the whole sigma and rectum appeared massively dilated (Fig. ). The rectosigmoid was resected until reaching the muscular pelvic floor.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed fluid collection around a small bowel loop in the pelvis and in the upper abdomen (Figure ). Urgent exploration through a midline incision revealed an injury 5 mm long in the small bowel injury at the base of the pelvis.

Clinical examination demonstrated a lesion along the posterior auricular sulcus with exposed cartilage within the depth of the lesion. Extending beyond this lesion was a region of erythema that suggested early involvement. There was no evidence of regional metastatic spread. A previous biopsy confirmed the lesion to be a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The lesion was treated by surgical resection via a partial auriculectomy removing a 3 cm tumour. The deep surgical margin was positive, necessitating adjuvant radiation therapy. This was initially prescribed by the referring radiation oncologist with a hypofractionated regimen of 45 Gy in 15 fractions delivered daily using a single lateral electron field \u2013 15 MeV with bolus. This hypofractionated lower dose regimen was originally pursued due to the advanced age of the patient. After the third fraction, the lesion had regrown to 3 cm, prompting an additional 15 Gy in six fractions as a concomitant boost for a total of 60 Gy in 21 fractions delivered over just 23 days, completed in January 2014. In April 2014, an irregular skin lining was noted within the treatment site, which was confirmed to be disease recurrence after a biopsy. A near-total auriculectomy sparing the lobe was performed, with final pathology showing a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and negative margins. Six months later in October 2014, a new squamous cell carcinoma was noted on the lobule of the remaining pinna, and a third completion auriculectomy was performed. Pathology revealed a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with negative margins.

    "original_text": "A male patient, 62 years old, visited Good Samsun Hospital with a chief complaint of a right inguinal region mass accompanied by pain for the previous 3 months. He had no special history of disease; however, the year before his visit to our hospital, he had undergone hernia surgery due to an indolent fixed mass in the right inguinal region. On physical examination, his vital signs were stable, and a hard, fixed mass, accompanied by oppressive pain, with a size of 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm was felt in the right inguinal region. The patient's progress was observed for a month during which time an anti-inflammatory analgesic drug was administered to distinguish the oppressive pain from that which might have been generated by the previous hernia surgery. The biopsy of the spermatic cord showed a metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma (). The image showed a thickening of the right spermatic cord, and infiltration around soft tissues was confirmed by using the scrotal sonography (). In addition, abdominal computed tomography indicated infiltration of the proximal sigmoid colon and rectum, as well as a diffuse peritoneal seeding metastasis ().

The patient was evaluated for stroke and deferred administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) due to the length of time between onset of symptoms and presentation to the emergency department. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the head and neck was ordered and demonstrated occlusion of the intradural right vertebral artery with a severe stenosis of the intradural left vertebral artery. There was a partially occlusive thrombus extending out of the occluded right vertebral artery into the proximal basilar artery (Figure ). It was decided that the patient be transported to our high volume certified Comprehensive Stroke Center where he could receive more specialized treatment. Before transport, he regained full strength and speech which seemed to be largely dependent on blood pressure.\nUpon arrival to our facility, his only complaint was paresthesia of the right foot and blurred vision as well as exacerbation of symptomology with changes in body position. A cerebral digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) revealed that the intracranial segment of the right vertebral artery was recently occluded and likely related to an underlying severe atherosclerotic stenosis near the dural ring. There was also a markedly severe stenosis of the contralateral intradural left vertebral artery (Figure ). DSA also demonstrated the presence of an unstable, partially occlusive clot at the vertebrobasilar junction and a congenital corkscrew configuration of the mid-basilar artery distal to the clot. Due to the precarious nature of the clot in both stability and location as well as the aberrant configuration of the basilar artery prohibiting thrombectomy options, the decision was made to provide dual antiplatelet therapy and heparin for several days in an effort to resolve the unstable clot and allow for development of more favorable conditions in which stenting of the left vertebral artery lesion could occur.

    "cleaned_text": "a 63-year-old caucasian male with two weeks of lightheadedness, diaphoresis, and two episodes of loss of consciousness presented to an outside emergency room due to an abrupt onset of unilateral paresis of the right side of the body as well as speech deficits. the patient was evaluated for stroke and deferred administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tpa) due to the length of time between onset of symptoms and presentation to the emergency department. a computed tomography angiogram (cta) of the head and neck was ordered and demonstrated occlusion of the intradural right vertebral artery with a severe stenosis of the intradural left vertebral artery. there was a partially occlusive thrombus extending out of the occluded right vertebral artery into the proximal basilar artery (figure ). it was decided that the patient be transported to our high volume certified comprehensive stroke center where he could receive more specialized treatment. before transport, he regained full strength and speech which seemed to be largely dependent on blood pressure.\nupon arrival to our facility, his only complaint was paresthesia of the right foot and blurred vision as well as exacerbation of symptomology with changes in body position. a cerebral digital subtraction angiogram (dsa) revealed that the intracranial segment of the right vertebral artery was recently occluded and likely related to an underlying severe atherosclerotic stenosis near the dural ring. there was also a markedly severe stenosis of the contralateral intradural left vertebral artery (figure ). dsa also demonstrated the presence of an unstable, partially occlusive clot at the vertebrobasilar junction and a congenital corkscrew configuration of the mid-basilar artery distal to the clot. due to the precarious nature of the clot in both stability and location as well as the aberrant configuration of the basilar artery prohibiting thrombectomy options, the decision was made to provide dual antiplatelet therapy and heparin for several days in an effort to resolve the unstable clot and allow for development of more favorable conditions in which stenting of the left vertebral artery lesion could occur. care",
