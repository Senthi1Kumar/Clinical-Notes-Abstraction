During the procedure, viscoelastic and vancomycin (1.0 mg/0.2 mL) were injected into the anterior chamber. Visual acuity on the first postoperative day was 20/20 and no other postoperative complication was detected.\nOn the seventh postoperative day the patient complained of acute painful visual deterioration. Visual acuity was 20/32 in her right eye with minimal anterior chamber and vitreous reaction, not suggestive of endophthalmitis. She was referred to our clinic 2 days later (post-op 9 days) for further investigation. Ophthalmic examination revealed best corrected visual acuity of 20/32 and 20/25 in the right and left eye respectively. Intraocular pressure was 15 mmHg in both eyes, pupil reaction was normal. Slit lamp examination of the right eye revealed 1+ cell in the anterior chamber and 1+ cell in the anterior vitreous. Fundus examination of the right eye was notable for mild vitritis, vascular attenuation, and peripheral artery occlusion, as well as scattered intraretinal and perivascular hemorrhages.\nFluorescein angiography revealed delayed retinal filling, peripheral vascular occlusion, extended areas of non-perfusion, and scattered areas of perivascular staining (Fig. ). Optical coherence tomography examination was unremarkable (Fig. ). A 6 \u00d7 6 zone was acquired using optical coherence tomography angiography demonstrating the junction between perfusion and non-perfusion areas showing the choroidal vasculature intact.\nDiagnosis of hemorrhagic occlusive retinal vasculitis was suspected based on the recent cataract surgery where intracameral vancomycin was used and characteristic clinical findings of the disease. As with previous reports of vancomycin-induced HORV, thorough systemic workup was unremarkable. Based on reports in the literature indicating the poor prognosis of the disease, the poor therapeutic effects of steroids and immunosuppressive treatment, we decided to proceed with early anti-VEGF treatment in an attempt to halt the progression of vision loss and reduce the risk of neovascular glaucoma.

Although he had good flexion and extension of the elbow, forearm pronation and supination were grossly restricted and painful. (Fig.5 and 6). There was no evidence of posterior interosseus nerve palsy. Radiographs showed posterior dislocation of the radial head with no associated fractures of the radius, ulna or disruption of the distal radio-ulnar joint. ().

Her family did not give any history of recurrent pneumonia or cyanosis, although she was underweight for her age. Her dysmorphism and the mild developmental delay were under evaluation by the concerned experts. She weighed 10 kg and was 90-cm tall. On cardiac examination, she had mild cardiomegaly and a machinery murmur.\nThere was mild cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary blood flow on chest radiograph with ECG not showing any major abnormalities. An echocardiogram showed hemodynamically significant PDA of size 3.5 mm and normal pulmonary artery pressures. As the child had otherwise normal intracardiac findings and was not very cooperative, we could not appreciate the exact course and drainage of the IVC. Because of these findings and the fact that we did not anticipate any major systemic venous anomalies, the child was electively posted for percutaneous transcatheter closure of PDA.\nAs per our unit\u2019s policy, catheterization and the device closure were performed under intravenous sedation. The standard digital palpation was used to establish the right femoral vein (max 6Fr) and right femoral artery (max 5 Fr). A descending thoracic angiogram (DTA) using 5 Fr pigtail in lateral view showed a 3.5-mm PDA with L \u2192 R shunt with good aortic ampulla (Fig.a in the panel), decided to use 6/4 ADO I device through standard venous approach to close the defect. When we were unable to enter the right atrium (RA) using a 5 Fr multipurpose (MPA) catheter, we suspected IVC interruption.

Her vital signs were stable at the time of admission and the pertinent coagulation data were unremarkable and therefore 30 mg of subcutaneous enoxaparin was given every 12 hours for thromboprophylaxis.\nSudden onset of left flank pain and cold sweating occurred on the fourth day of admission. Bed-side sonography revealed heterogeneous echogenic fluid collection at the left retroperitoneum. Her blood pressure dropped to 53/33 mmHg with pulse rate of 102 per minute. The administration of enoxaparin was discontinued immediately and the patient was transferred to intensive care unit where she received 4 units of FFP and 12 units and PRBC. After fluid resuscitation, her hemodynamic status remained unstable with pulse rate of 121 per minute and blood pressure 79/56. An emergent CT was performed that showed a large hematoma at the left retroperitoneum (Figure. ). Emergent angiography was performed which included abdominal aortogram and arteriogram of lumbar arteries at variable levels.

The patient stated that his right eye had been blind since early childhood due to a unilateral congenital anomaly complicated by secondary glaucoma. He received the diagnosis of SO in January 2017 after he experienced visual loss in his only seeing (left) eye. At the time of diagnosis, the patient was admitted to the hospital and meticulously investigated for possible infectious and noninfectious causes to rule out other uveitic entities, but without any positive findings. At that time, his best-corrected visual acuity was 6/10. Slit-lamp examination yielded some vitreous cells in the left eye. Fundoscopy showed a few scattered pigmented chorioretinal scars and discrete yellowish round choroidal lesions throughout the left fundus (). Fluorescein angiogram delineated the active lesions as early hypofluorescent () with late staining. Left macular contour was normal on optical coherence tomography (OCT) examination (). He was started on oral prednisolone (64 mg) for 2 weeks with gradual tapering of 8 mg per week. Despite initial visual improvement, he experienced another episode of visual decline while taking 32 mg of prednisolone. His best-corrected visual acuity decreased to 2/10 and he had grade 4 vitreous haze according to the Miami grading. Fundus examination showed marked yellowish-white discoloration of the macula with some evidence of intraretinal hemorrhage ( and ). He was hospitalized and treated with pulse methylprednisolone 1 g (250 mg 4 times daily) for 3 days. Following pulse therapy, 64 mg oral prednisolone and 150 mg (50 mg 3 times daily) azathioprine were co-administered.

A few months later, she developed numbness in all five fingers on the left side. Furthermore, the patient mentioned that she had had a burning sensation in both feet for a few years. Another few months later she complained of weakness in all four limbs and was sent for a neurological consultation with electromyography. Clinical examination revealed a Hoffmann-Tr\u00f6mner reflex on the left side, mild loss of strength in both hands, loss of vibratory sense and hypoesthesia in the distal end of all four limbs and loss of proprioception in both legs.

After initial assessment at the emergency department, she complained of diffuse left knee pain, which was aggravated by passive extension and palpation, mostly around the posterolateral corner. Anteroposterior and lateral plain films of the left knee were then taken for initial evaluation () and revealed a transverse radiolucent line with corrugated borders across an ossified fabella\u2014regarded as a complete fracture\u2014and also a small avulsion cortical fracture at the medial aspect of the medial femoral epicondyle. An ultrasound of the knee was performed to assess the superficial tendons and ligaments around the knee, especially at the posterolateral corner, as well as to confirm the presence of joint effusion. Posterolaterally, the fabella was depicted with a central cortical defect related to the fabellar fracture seen on radiographs. To further evaluate and rule out injury of the internal structures of the knee, a routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left knee was performed.\nMRI was performed in a 1.5 Tesla scanner using sagittal T1-weighted fast spin-echo and triplanar intermediate-weighted fast spin-echo fat suppressed sequences, which confirmed the transverse fracture of the fabella associated with edema-like changes within the bone marrow and within the proximal fibers of the lateral head of gastrocnemius (Figures , , and ). Multiple foci of bone edema-like changes consistent with bone contusions at the femoral condyles, tibial plateau, and the fibular head were also detected.

Due to deterioration of bulbar symptoms she was transferred to our intermediate care unit. Fiber endoscopy revealed a hypotonic and slowed swallowing act with penetration of food at the epiglottis.

She received 20 g methylprednisolone, 270 mg pyridostigmine and 100 g IVIG within the first five days, but did not improve. Subsequently methylprednisolone was elevated to 30 mg per day and pyridostigmine to 440 mg daily.

He was the third child of 37-year-old mother delivered by cesarean section with good Apgar score, normal birth weight (4100gr), head circumference (HC) of 35 cm and length of 53 cm. His parents were non consanguineous and the similar disease was not observed in the family. The mother was a general physician and the father was an engineer. The patient\u2019s sister and brother were healthy. In the past medical history, atopic dermatitis and lacrimal duct obstruction were seen at infancy. Growth and development was normal in the past two years.\nPresent disease began one year ago with painful swelling of the forehead after a mild trauma. Similar swelling in the arm and shoulders started later subsiding spontaneously. At this admission, he had paraspinal (upper thoracic and lower neck) and periscapular muscle swelling which was painful, tender and indurate, without redness and inflammation over the skin ().

His main symptoms were that of nausea and vomiting, but he also reported periods of diarrhea. In the emergency room, his initial evaluation was significant for lab studies demonstrating a mild metabolic acidosis with a bicarb of 16.6 mEq/L, an elevation of his creatinine to 1.93 mg/dL, and a serum lactate level of 5.4 mmol/L. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained and reviewed. The appendix was thought to be normal. There was no evidence of free intraperitoneal air, abscess, or volvulus. There did appear to be evidence of enterocolitis involving the ilium, cecum, and the proximal ascending colon. There was no evidence of pneumatosis or obstruction. Over the course of 12 hours the patient underwent conservative medical management, which included intravenous hydration, intravenous steroids, Toradol and Dilaudid for pain management, and the occasional dose of Ativan for agitation. Failure of conservative management along with medical decline lead to an exploratory laparotomy with a right hemicolectomy for an ileocolic intestinal infarction. Postoperative repeat CT scan of the abdomen incidentally showed pulmonary nodules in the lower lobe. A CT scan of the chest was then obtained, which revealed air in the left chest wall and axilla (Figure ). On physical exam there was very subtle mottling of the left shoulder. The patient was emergently taken back to the OR for further exploration of the shoulder with excisional debridement.

She had a pathological history of chronic constipation since the age of 18 months, treated regularly with large amounts of oral Senna preparations (2-3 g of dry Senna leaves added to a cup of water, given to the patient more than three times a week). She had previously been hospitalized eight months ago, in another hospital structure, for a severe clinical picture of acute hepatitis and bicytopenia (thrombocytopenia and leukopenia), with a good clinical and biological outcome under intravenous corticosteroid therapy with an oral relay. A follow-up blood test taken two months after this episode was strictly normal. She had no particular family history. The story of her current illness began with the onset of sharp abdominal pain, vomiting, greenish diarrhea, anorexia, fever of 40\u00b0 C, and deterioration in general condition. She was first hospitalized in Niger, where a workup was carried out showing hepatic cytolysis with negative hepatitic serologies and a blood smear negative for the malaria parasite. She received treatment based on third-generation cephalosporin and aminoglycoside. Due to the worsening of her condition, with the appearance of disturbances in consciousness, hair loss, facial erythroderma and bicytopenia in biology, she was transferred to us for continued treatment.\nOn admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU), the child was unconscious with a Glasgow score of 11/15 and generalized hypotonia, but without sensorimotor deficit or signs of brain engagement.

He had no significant past medical history. At the initial visit, there was tenderness on his back, especially on the spinous process at T11. Neurologic findings were normal. Plain radiographs were unremarkable. MRI scans indicated low signal on T1WI, relatively high signal on T2WI, and high signal on short tau inversion recovery (STIR) images in the upper part of the vertebral body at T11 without deformation of the cortical endplate (). There was no high signal in the posterior elements of the spine, such as the interspinous ligament. A diagnosis of VBB was made. The patient was treated conservatively with a soft thoracolumbar brace and instructed not to participate in physical activity for a month. At follow-up 1 month later, the patient had no back pain, the tenderness on the spinous process had diminished, and the signal changes in the vertebral body seen on T1WI, T2WI, and STIR images had disappeared (). There was no residual deformation of the cortical endplate.\nThe other 5 children had similar clinical manifestations (). The onset of back pain in all 6 children coincided with mild physical activity, such as performing a handstand, jumping rope, or Japanese box vaulting. None of the children reported a fall. We did not check any blood test for all 6 patients because they had no past medical history. There was tenderness on the corresponding spinous process at the initial visit in all cases.

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a 9-cm, type 2 tumor in the middle thoracic esophagus. Histological examination of biopsy specimens confirmed squamous cell carcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a thick wall around the middle thoracic esophagus, a mediastinal lymph node metastasis, and a giant 9-cm bulla at the apical portion of the right lung (Fig. ). The clinical stage was IIIa (T3, N1, M0) according to the Union for International Cancer Control, seventh edition.

There was marked adhesion between the giant bulla and the chest wall, and bullectomy was performed. During dissection of the lower thoracic esophagus, an approximately 3-cm pleural window was made in the left mediastinal pleura, which led to a connection between the right and left thoracic cavities.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a suspicious hyperintense 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1 cm solid mass arising from posterior lip of the cervical canal reaching fornix. No parametrial involvement or significant retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement was detected. Clinical diagnosis of stage 1B2 (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] 2009) was made based on the findings. Punch biopsies of the tumor were taken and sent for histopathological examination.\nThe diagnosis was moderately differentiated endocervical adenocarcinoma originating from the cervix. Radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy as well as pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection was performed. The final pathology result was consistent with the previous report which showed moderately differentiated mucinous endocervical adenocarcinoma. The tumor size was 4 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 1 cm. The depth of tumor in the hysterectomy specimen was 1 cm. No parametrial invasion was detected. There was no invasion to uterine corpus or vagina. In total, 30 lymph nodes were extracted. There was no evidence of metastasis to the lymph nodes or lymphovascular invasion. The patient did not receive adjuvant therapy following the hysterectomy.",

There was a stricture encountered at 15 cm from the incisors through which the gastroscope could not be traversed. Biopsies were taken from the inflamed esophageal mucosa and the proximal lumen of the stricture. Brush cytology was collected through the stricture as there was a concern for malignancy. A subsequent barium esophagram and upper GI series demonstrated 2 cm irregular narrowing in the cervical esophagus, but no abnormalities in the rest of the esophagus, the gastroesophageal junction, stomach, duodenum, or proximal jejunum. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed no acute esophageal, mediastinal, pulmonary, or cardiac pathology. The esophageal biopsy indicated acute and chronic inflammation with filamentous sulfur granules consistent with Actinomyces; rare fungal hyphal elements were additionally identified (Figures , , and ). The cytology was negative for malignant cells and the acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain was negative, ruling out Nocardia as a potential pathogen. The patient was started on intravenous (IV) Penicillin for a diagnosis of esophageal actinomycosis and oral Fluconazole for a presumed Candida coinfection given concurrent fungal elements. Her human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status was negative and her fasting blood glucose was within the normal range. She was discharged on Fluconazole 200 mg daily for 2 weeks and IV Penicillin G 3 million units every 4 hours for 6 weeks followed by oral Penicillin",

Antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer exchange and debridement were repeated 7 months after revision TKA and eradication of infection was confirmed with aspiration in the outpatient clinic of our hospital more than three times. In addition, after completion of antibiotic therapy, the ESR, CRP level, and total WBC and differential counts in the joint aspirates were obtained, and the patient was observed for 2 more weeks.

She had been diagnosed with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the ovaries with metastasis to the liver 1 year prior. She had undergone three rounds of carboplatin paclitaxel, followed by debulking surgery, followed by an additional six rounds of carboplatin paclitaxel therapy. After her last chemotherapy treatment, her carcinoembryonic antigen normalized. Four months later, she presented with jaundice, dark urine, and pale stools. A computed tomographic scan revealed the cancer had returned to the liver and was now obstructing her biliary duct. A stent was attempted several days later but was not successful. In collaboration with her oncologist, it was decided not to pursue further active treatment, and palliative care was initiated. She was otherwise healthy. The only medication she was taking was pantoprazole 40 mg daily for acid reflux. Her weight was 80 pounds.\nOne month later, she developed intense pruritus throughout her entire body. It was worse at night, and her sleep was significantly disturbed.

Her main problems were obesity, snoring and waking up with a feeling of suffocation in the middle of sleep. The intraoral examination showed a large soft palate (). The soft palate was scored as class III according to the Mallampati classification (visualization of the soft palate and the base of the uvula) []. The electroencephalogram (EEG) showed focal dysrhythmia during hyperventilation with scattered sharp waves (). The patient was depressed and had sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and myoclonus, especially at the onset of sleep. She had experienced several occurrences of complete loss of consciousness during swimming and at work. The patient was on anticonvulsants and antidepressants (at first, she had been prescribed with Lamotrigine for 5 months, but later she was given 500mg Sodium valproate per day).\nOne of the best treatments for snoring during sleep is UUUP. The success rate of this type of surgery is reported to be between 16% and 83% [].\nWe chose a minimally invasive surgical procedure for the present case since the patient had a proper facial profile and a large soft palate (class III according to the Mallampati classification) [].\nIn May 2007, after analyzing the lateral cephalogram, we evaluated the craniofacial and pharyngeal airway morphology before the surgery. Under general anesthesia, 1cm of the soft palatal mucosa, from the right tonsil to the left tonsil, was removed. The patient\u2019s tonsils were also removed during the surgery, and the anterior and posterior tonsillar pillars were sutured together ().\nThe symptoms were significantly decreased after the recovery.

The patient showed no signs of obstructive jaundice and did not require biliary stenting. Initially, her tumor was noted to involve the major visceral vessels, including the celiac artery, portal vein, and splenic artery and vein (). The tumor was deemed unresectable and the patient underwent extensive chemotherapy with multiple cycles of gemcitabine, Abraxane, 5-fluorouracil, Alloxantin, Avastin, and Xeloda. After showing a favorable response, she was referred for surgical re-evaluation. The post neoadjuvant chemotherapy CT scan () showed a poorly defined infiltrative pancreatic neck and body mass measuring \u223c25 \u00d7 15 mm with ill-defined soft tissue encasing the proximal splenic artery, common hepatic artery (CHA), distal celiac axis, and superior mesenteric artery (SMA). The mass also partially encased the portal vein and superior mesenteric vein (SMV). There was no radiologic evidence of hepatic metastasis and there was mild pancreatic duct dilatation. Pre-treatment and post-treatment serum CA 19\u20139 levels were 46 and 9, respectively. The patient did not receive any additional studies to assess GDA flow or the need for preoperative coiling/embolization. The absolute need for resection of the celiac axis was not determined until the time of the operation. The patient's functional status, perioperative risk, and likelihood of response were weighed and she was determined to be a candidate for an attempt at a modified Appleby procedure. After being properly informed of her various treatment options, she elected to undergo the operation.\nExploration of the duodenum and pancreas revealed a firm mass in the body of the pancreas with a soft pancreatic neck.

The intracranial extension of the tumor obliterated the sella turcica, bilaterally invaded the cavernous sinuses, and caused extensive elevation and splaying of the internal carotid arteries, anterior cerebral arteries, optic chiasm, and intracranial optic nerves. The mass measured approximately 10 cm \u00d7 8 cm \u00d7 11 cm. There was no evidence of edema or gliotic reaction in the adjacent brain parenchyma.\nThe patient underwent resection of the tumor through a subcranial transfacial approach.

She had been experiencing voiding difficulty and perineal discomfort for 5 years and had urinary stress incontinence for 2 years. Furthermore, she had not been previously followed up for POP. She visited her previous doctor because of the onset of general fatigue and urinary retention. Bilateral moderate hydronephroureters with dilated calyxes were identified by computed tomography. Therefore, a urinary catheter was inserted, and \u223c1100 mL of urine was collected. Although no urogynecologists were available, she was admitted to the hospital to recover from her general condition. Subsequently, she went into a state of shock due to low blood pressure on the day of admission. Although she was administered antibiotics and dopamine hydrochloride for 2 days, she was transferred to our hospital for treatment because of worsening renal dysfunction and state of shock.\nA gynecological examination revealed total uterine prolapse (Fig.). In addition to hydronephrosis caused by chronic voiding difficulty and excessive residual urine, she was presumed to have pyelonephritis, which resulted in septic shock. She had high levels of activities of daily living and was generally healthy before suffering from this disease. According to laboratory tests, she had a high level of fibrin degradation products (23.4 \u03bcg/mL), high level of D-Dimer (9.8 \u03bcg/mL), and a low platelet count (4.9 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL), which also resulted in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Both blood and urine cultures were positive for Escherichia coli. Ring pessary and bilateral ureteral stents were temporarily inserted for urine drainage. Furthermore, ceftriaxone, nafamostat mesilate, and thrombomodulin were used for treating pyelonephritis and DIC. Serum creatinine, a measure of renal function, increased to a maximum of 6.09 mg/dL before ureteral stent insertion and then decreased to 1.10 mg/dL after 15 days.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 74-year-old man who had previously been diagnosed with MDS. He was diagnosed with calculous cholecystolithiasis at our hospital. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was planned, but we converted to open cholecystectomy with a right subcostal oblique incision because it was difficult to remove the impacted calculus in the cystic duct. The surgical wound was partially erythematous 4 days after surgery (Fig. ), so we opened the wound and cleanse with sterile saline and performed moist environment dressing because of surgical site infection suspected. Inflammation, however, spread to the surrounding skin with erosion (Fig. ). The condition of wound rapidly deteriorated, so we introduced intra-wound continuous negative pressure and irrigation treatment (IW-CONPIT) 10 days after surgery (Fig. ). In spite of IW-CONPIT, inflammation continued to further spread widely with a purulent coating (Fig. ). In addition, skin edema spread from the lower back to the lower extremities. Antibiotic administration and irrigation were not effective, either. Bacteriological examination revealed that Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected in the wound, although those counts were low. We decided to perform biopsy of the skin surrounding the wound to analyze pathological condition.

Eight years before, when she was 82, an advanced atrioventricular block was diagnosed after a syncopal episode and she received a permanent dual chamber pacemaker implantation. She underwent coronary computed tomography (CT) and radioisotope examination at this time, but there was no evidence of cardiomyopathy or of ischemic heart disease. The tip of the pacemaker lead was observed to pass through a PFO at the left ventricular apex; she received a follow-up examination because of no serious adverse event. She had no history of lung disease or tobacco smoking. She had no subjective symptoms associated with cardiovascular disease after pacemaker implantation. There was no evidence of a decline in oxygen saturation levels at that time, which were measured by pulse oximetry.\nHer physical examination findings on admission were as follows: clear level of consciousness and severe hypoxia and cyanosis observed only in the right lateral decubitus position. These symptoms were immediately improved in the left lateral decubitus, the supine, and the upright position. Arterial blood gas values were consistent with her symptoms. Partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) decreased only in the right lateral decubitus position (Table ). These observations were reproducible. There was no evidence of lung rales or cardiac murmur.\nLaboratory tests, including complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and D-dimers were almost normal. A chest X-ray showed a significant elevation of her right diaphragmatic dome.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) showed an atrium-sensing, ventricular-pacing rhythm with a complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) pattern (Fig. ).
