He was scheduled for intravitreal implantation of Ozurdex\u00ae. The implant was injected via the pars plana route 3.5 mm from the limbus following the topical anesthesia with proparacaine. However, the implant accidentally caused a posterior capsular tear and was injected into the crystalline lens because of an involuntary head movement of the patient during the procedure (fig. ). Slit-lamp examination revealed that the implant had penetrated the posterior lens capsule and was lodged in the posterior cortex of the lens with a resultant mild posterior cortical cataract. Since the anterior segment was normal, and the resultant cataract and implant itself did not make a substantial effect on BCVA, the decision was made to observe the patient with intralenticular implant, preserve the therapeutic effect and avoid reinjection.\nCMT and BCVA were 253 \u00b5m and 58 letters at the first month, 262 \u00b5m and 56 letters at the third month and 254 \u00b5m and 48 letters at the sixth month (fig. ). Macular edema resolved within time, while BCVA did not show significant improvement due to an increase in lens opacification (fig. ). IOP was within normal limits during follow-up. The patient underwent phacoemulsification surgery at 7 months after the injection with implantation of posterior chamber IOL into the capsular bag. A gentle hydrodissection-hydrodelineation was performed, and low phaco parameters were used during the surgery of the cataract with a damaged posterior capsule. Posterior capsular fibrosis was encountered in the area of the posterior capsular defect during the surgery. After the cataract surgery, the IOL was well centered with a no anterior chamber reaction, and BCVA improved to 63 letters with a normal IOP",

Pelvic ultrasound revealed a single live intrauterine pregnancy and a 12.7 \u00d7 8.8 \u00d7 9.7 cm right adnexal cystic mass ().\nA preoperative diagnosis of right ovarian torsion was made and the decision was made to proceed with laparoscopy due to acute worsening of symptoms, desire for future childbearing and high index of suspicion for a surgical emergency. Three 5-mm incisions were initially used with intraperitoneal entry obtained at Palmer's point, a surgical landmark in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, approximately 3 cm below the costal margin in the midclavicular line. Two additional incisions were placed in the right and left lower quadrants to accommodate laparoscopic ports. Intraoperative findings were notable for a 9 cm right ovarian cyst, and a right ovarian cystectomy was performed. An additional 8 mm incision was made at the base of the umbilicus for removal of the cyst wall from the abdominal cavity. The fascial layer was not closed at any of the port sites. All ports were subsequently removed and skin incisions were closed in a subcuticular fashion using 4-0 Monocryl (monofilament synthetic absorbable suture) and secured with Dermabond (cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive).

He had complained of some anterior knee pain, 1-2 years post operatively. This was attributed to sight overhang of the patella laterally. The patient declined any further surgery at that time as he was extremely mobile, managing long walks and cycling. His range of movement at that time was from 0-120 degrees flexion. As a precaution, his inflammatory markers were checked and found to be within normal limits.\nAt 5 years follow up, he had no complaints and was pain free. He was given a review appointment for a further 5 years. He represented early, however, at 8 and a half years post operatively, complaining about pain in the knee, with episodes of swelling and instability. Interestingly, he was able to sublux his knee posteriorly, using his hamstrings []\nRadiographs showed an inverse shadow of the polyethylene liner protruding anteriorly over the tibial tray. There was no sign of loosening of the tibial tray or femoral component []. This suggested anterior polyethylene subluxation: this subtle sign has been described as indicative of failure of the locking mechanism in posterior-stabilized prostheses [].\nHe was operated on one month later. On making the arthrotomy of the knee, it was apparent that the polyethylene liner had dissociated from the tibial tray and was protruding anteriorly [].

Diagnosis of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis was made based on frequent diarrhea and the presence of rotavirus antigen in her stool. In addition to Group A rotavirus, norovirus (G2) was also isolated from her stool in the subsequent analysis. Her fever and diarrhea resolved in the first 3 days.

CK-MB was 122 IU/L, which was over the normal limit (reference value <25 IU/L). Hence, she was suspected to be suffering from acute myocarditis, one of several rare complications associated with rotavirus infection. Her past history was unremarkable with no evidence of any developmental delays, although she did have a respiratory tract infection approximately 13 days before hospitalization.

Initial assessment of vital signs showed a blood pressure of 116/70 mmHg, a heart rate of 86 beats per minute, body temperature of 36 \u00b0C, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 99%, all of which were within normal range for her age. On physical examination, she had tenderness in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen without rebound tenderness. The spleen and liver were not palpable. Laboratory examinations yielded normal results with a leukocyte count of 6,050 cells/\u03bcL, hemoglobin concentration of 13.7 g/dL, platelet count of 318,000 platelets/\u03bcL, prothrombin time of 12.3 s, and activated partial thromboplastin time of 30.6 s. Initially, she was diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis, and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was performed to rule out acute appendicitis. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed an enhancing mass, 61 \u00d7 54 \u00d7 65 mm in size and several subcentimeter enhancing nodules in the spleen, suggesting possible hemangioma, as well as diffuse edematous wall thickening in the colon (Fig. ). She was diagnosed with acute colitis and a giant splenic hemangioma that was found incidentally, and treated with intravenous hydration and medication for acute colitis. After the symptoms of acute colitis resolved, she received vaccinations for encapsulated bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis.\nTwo weeks after completion of the vaccinations, the patient underwent splenic embolization at the interventional center by a clinically experienced interventional radiologist.

She presented with infective endocarditis leading to dyspnoea, peripheral oedema and congestive hepatomegaly secondary to torrential tricuspid regurgitation. She abstained from intravenous drugs and had been maintained on methadone therapy prior to her surgery. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed tricuspid valve endocarditis and severe tricuspid regurgitation with evidence of right ventricular dysfunction and congestive hepatomegaly. Based on positive serial blood cultures (Staphylococcus aureus) and echocardiographic findings, antibiotics were commenced (IV Flucloxacillin and IV Vancomycin) as soon as the diagnosis was made. Owing to the compromised clinical picture of the patient (haemodynamic instability and potential for life-threatening sepsis), urgent surgery took place after 2 days of full antibiotic therapy. Coronary angiography was normal. Despite the clinical and echocardiographic features of right heart failure, the patient remained in sinus rhythm.\nIntra-operatively there was an infected and destroyed anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve with posterior leaflet prolapse causing severe tricuspid regurgitation (). There was evidence of raised pulmonary artery pressures and right ventricular dysfunction. A detailed assessment of the remnants of the native tricuspid valve was performed on the operating table to devise a complex reconstructive strategy.\nThe anterior leaflet was almost totally destroyed by infection with only a rim of annular tissue. The posterior leaflet was prolapsing with a significantly dilated corresponding posterior annulus and the septal leaflet was tethered with corresponding annular dilatation. The anterior leaflet was reconstructed using Admedus Cardiocel\u2122 decellularized bovine pericardium (). The template for the anterior leaflet was derived based on the space required with an additional 25% facilitating anchoring of the chordae to the neo leaflet.

He had a history of cholecystectomy, common bile duct anastomosis to the small bowel 5 years previously, and pyonephrosis secondary to transurethral lithotripsy 1 month before the recent admission. He had no history of alcohol consumption and intravenous or illicit drug use.\nPositive physical examination findings on the admission day included fever and mild right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. Initial laboratory test results showed leukocytosis and elevated acute-phase reactants including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C reactive protein, while liver enzymes, creatinine, and electrolyte panel were within the normal limits. Three sets of aerobic blood culture, drawn on admission, were negative.\nOn day 1, computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen revealed a filling defect in the IVC, protruding into the right atrium. Fluid accumulation in the retrohepatic and right perinephric space was found. In addition, a hypodense opacity medial to the caudate lobe of the liver, in favor of a hepatic abscess, was noted but not confirmed by the second report ().\nTransesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed interatrial septal aneurysm, small-sized patent foramen ovale with a negligible flow, and no evidence of infective endocarditis. A large mass was detected at the origin of the IVC entering the right atrium, suggestive of a clot ().\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the heart, abdomen, and pelvis was performed, and it confirmed the previous findings.

    "original_text": "A 43-year-old male had suffered a headache for few days, and was admitted to an emergency department due to a change in his mental status. On arrival, a brain computed tomography (CT) showed a massive hematoma in the dorsal pons (). He took conservative treatments, without operation. Two months later, the patient's caregiver complained of a communication problem, stating that the man could not seem to understand the instructions from his therapist and caregiver. There was no definite lesion other than the fluid collection in both sides of the mastoid air cells, on the temporal bone CT, and the brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) test revealed prolonged latencies of III and V (from both sides), which were suspected to be a central conduction defect. Three months after the onset, the patient was transferred to our department for comprehensive rehabilitative management.

The physical exam of the ocular globe was not possible due to the large hematoma that hindered opening the eyelid. The exploration of right eye was normal. Therefore, the skin wound was initially sutured with a polypropylene 5/0 interrupted suture and an orbital computed tomography (CT scan) and skull X-ray were performed.

This was her fourth pregnancy and it was also diagnosed as a missed miscarriage at 7 weeks\u2019 gestation in a local hospital, as ultrasonography showed an irregular gestational sac with no yolk sac or fetal pole (Fig. A). Suction-assisted D&C was performed and a second ultrasound-guided evacuation was performed 8 days later because of placental remnants in the left uterine horn. However, the second evacuation failed as with Case 1 even under ultrasound guidance.\nThe patient had been bleeding with lower abdominal pain for 4 weeks, so was transferred to our hospital for further management. Transvaginal ultrasonography showed a mixed echogenic shadow measuring 3.78 \u00d7 2.23 cm in the uterine cavity expanding to the left horn, which suggested placental remnants. The left angular myometrial mantle was thinned to approximately 4 mm (Fig. B).

The left uterine horn was significantly enlarged so that it could be mistaken easily for a uterine cavity. The retained placental tissue was found intraoperatively to be tightly adherent to the uterine wall. Old adhesive scars were observed in the fundus of the uterus.

He was asked to fast for 5 days and administered with preventive antibacterial treatment. Meanwhile he ceased peritoneal dialysis and was converted to non-heparin hemodialysis. The abdominal pain relieved and the peritoneal drainage was clear, so he asked for being discharged from the hospital on the second day against medical advice. After 3 days, the microbiological analysis of the peritoneal fluid revealed growth of Enterococcus faecium. He was treated with intravenous (IV) fluids and antibiotics in the emergency room of another hospital. After 10 days of IV treatment, he felt pain in the abdomen again and feculent effluent was found in the peritoneal catheter. He was readmitted to our hospital.\nExamination on admission indicated that he was afebrile and had a soft\u3001tender abdomen.

(the caretaker was a fresh man and came from a nursing home without enough education and training of peritoneal dialysis.)the patient went to the emergency room immediately because of severe abdominal pain. there was no signs of bowel perforation and peritonitis. no abnormality was found in abdominal x ray and complete blood count. the peritoneal fluid culture was sent. he was asked to fast for 5 days and administered with preventive antibacterial treatment. meanwhile he ceased peritoneal dialysis and was converted to non-heparin hemodialysis. the abdominal pain relieved and the peritoneal drainage was clear, so he asked for being discharged from the hospital on the second day against medical advice. after 3 days, the microbiological analysis of the peritoneal fluid revealed growth of enterococcus faecium. he was treated with intravenous (iv) fluids and antibiotics in the emergency room of another hospital. after 10 days of iv treatment, he felt pain in the abdomen again and feculent effluent was found in the peritoneal catheter. he was readmitted to our hospital.\nexamination on admission indicated that he was afebrile and had a soft\u3001tender abdomen. blood examination showed white blood cell count 21.88 \u00d7 109/l, hemoglobin 72 g/l, neutrophil count 19.89 \u00d7 109/l. abdominal computed tomography (ct) showed peri-hepatic pneumatosis and effusion. no free air or dilated loops of bowel were seen. the patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy. a great mount of pus moss",

She presented four years after transplant with intermittent diarrhea for 4 months duration and significant weight loss. On presentation, her creatinine was 3.4 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.2 mg/dL on prior studies. The patient was found to have a positive stool infectious panel PCR for norovirus during an inpatient hospital evaluation. Clostridium difficile study was negative, and fecal fat content was within normal limits. Mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued due to concern that her symptoms may be a result of medication side effect. She was subsequently started on azathioprine 50 mg daily for immunosuppression. With no real improvement in symptoms, she was treated with a 3-day course of 500 mg PO nitazoxanide twice daily with modest improvement. Two months later, the patient's symptoms reoccurred, and she received a second, longer course of nitazoxanide for 3 weeks. Her symptoms resolved within a week of treatment but again relapsed over the subsequent 3 months. Stool biofire PCRs were persistently positive for norovirus when checked monthly over the following 5-month time period. Finally, she was started on a 3-week course of nitazoxanide high dose (500 mg PO every eight hours). Initially, this was difficult to tolerate due to gastrointestinal distress, and the frequency of administration was decreased to twice daily.

    "original_text": "A 51-year-old previously healthy and physically active woman presented as an outpatient with complaints of lightheadedness and dizziness. In addition to her activities of daily living, the patient plays competitive tennis without any limitations or symptoms. Recently, while doing aerial yoga, she felt lightheaded and experienced a presyncopal episode, specifically while hanging upside down and performing hand stands. On physical exam, vital signs were normal and the exam was unremarkable except for the cardiac exam. The precordium was quiet with no displacement of the point of maximal impulse. There was a grade III/VI systolic murmur at the left sternal border and the electrocardiogram revealed a left bundle branch block. Subsequently, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed and revealed a mass in the right ventricle attached to the posterior wall and prolapsing into the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in systole ().\nNext, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed to better characterize the mass, which measured 2.6 cm \u00d7 4.1 cm and was mobile and prolapsed into the RVOT during systole resulting in a mild dynamic obstruction (). Color Doppler revealed turbulent flow in the RVOT and pressure gradient measurements revealed a gradient of 26 mmHg across the RVOT while the patient was heavily sedated and in a supine position (). We suspect that with aerial yoga, and the resulting upside-down suspension, the gradient would be higher. Therefore, the obstruction would be enhanced, resulting in decreased cardiac output and cerebral hypoperfusion, which could explain the presenting symptoms of lightheadedness and dizziness. The patient was referred to cardiothoracic surgery for further evaluation and underwent a cardiac catheterization prior to thoracotomy which also showed evidence of a RV mass ().

The patient was a nonsmoker and had a significant past medical history of complete hysterectomy 7 years prior for bleeding uterine fibroids. Pathology at that time had shown the fibroids to be leiomyomas. On current presentation, her chest X-ray showed multiple pulmonary nodules with a large right-sided pleural effusion. Subsequently, a computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules with a large pleural effusion, and near complete collapse of the right middle and right lower lobes (). The sizes of the nodules was not documented but had borders that were circular and distinct. There were no abnormal lesions seen under the diaphragm. Two thoracenteses revealed bloody, exudative, pleural fluid but cytology failed to reveal any evidence of malignancy. Bronchoscopy of the right lung revealed extrinsic compression of the airways in the right middle and right lower lobe with no intrabronchial lesions. However, there was a large nonendobronchial mass on the right side causing atelectasis and collapse. Being the focus of the bronchoscopy, the left lung revealed 2 endobronchial lesions: one in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe and one within the basilar segments of the left lower lobe. The lesions were smooth, round, and freely mobile with the patient\u2019s inspiratory and expiratory effort. Each was anchored to the inside of the airways by thin stalks (). Biopsy of one of these lesions showed the lesions to be very friable. Histopathology revealed proliferating spindle cells that were highlighted with smooth muscle actin and desmin ().

    "original_text": "The patient was an obese woman, aged 61, with a long history of hypertension, treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for obstructive sleep apnea. Her medical history included incidents of angioedema during attempts at antihypertensive treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. From 2004, the patient was treated for leiomyosarcoma located primarily in the uterus. The patient underwent numerous surgical procedures (extirpation of the uterus, removal of a tumor in the right lumbar area, removal of a tumor in the right thigh, removal of a tumor in the left arm). Surgical treatment was supplemented by radio- and chemotherapy. The patient was referred to the Cardiology Clinic after a cardiac tumor was revealed in follow-up echocardiography. The tumor with jagged edges (35 \u00d7 35 mm) filled the apical portion of the left ventricle.\nCardiac diagnostics was conducted due to the gradually deteriorating exercise tolerance, even though the patient's fatigability could have been attributed to her age, body type, inactive lifestyle, and long-term hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy leading to diastolic heart failure. Regular cardiac function in physical examination (76/min), quiet systolic murmur in the apex and Erb's point, no auscultatory changes over the lung fields, trace of peripheral swelling, and normal blood pressure with the currently applied treatment were noted. After a cardiological consultation, the patient was qualified for surgical treatment of the tumor in the left ventricle. Due to the fact that the echocardiographic image clearly corresponded to a metastatic course of leiomyosarcoma, other methods of diagnostic imaging were not utilized (). The patient was operated on with cardiopulmonary bypass, under systemic hypothermia (28\u00b0C), using crystalloid cardioplegia.

She drinks occasional alcohol but has never used tobacco or illicit drugs. Her family history was remarkable for malignancy.\nThe patient had a recent brain computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrating multiple lesions concerning possible demyelinating disease or malignancy. Subsequent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast confirmed enhancing lesions in the left inferior frontal lobe, the left posterior Globus Pallidus, and the right parietal white matter with associated edema on FLAIR images (). CT scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed to scan for other lesions revealed an incidental calcified right atrial (RA) mass measuring 4.5 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 4.5 cm, which appeared to extend through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle (RV). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) confirmed the presence of a calcified 4-cm RA mass without a mobile component and with no valvular pathology, nor patent foramen ovale (; ). This mass was not identified on TTE performed 5 months earlier. Cardiac MRI further defined the mass as a probable calcified RA thrombus with extension into the RV, inferior vena cava, and superior vena cava with no enhancement to suggest metastatic disease (). The patient was started on anticoagulation with Apixaban and advised to follow-up with TTE. Repeat TTE a few months later indicated an apparent increase in the size of the RA mass.

    "original_text": "A 64-year-old man with a 13-year history of coronary heart disease and 7-year history of hypertension was admitted to our hospital for acute onset dizziness and unsteady gait for one week. He reported acute onset of dizziness and difficulty in walking, and these symptoms would become worsened when he got up from the bed or sofa. On admission, his blood pressure was 135/85 mmHg and heart rate was 66 beats/min; and neurological examination revealed nystagmus on horizontal gaze. His pupillary reflexes and extraocular movements were intact, no limb weakness and sensory deficits were found; and bilateral finger--to-nose and heel-to-shin tests were normal. Additionally, bilateral Babinski signs were absent. However, Romberg sign was impossible to evaluate as the patient could not be able to cooperate with further examination.\nSimilarly, laboratory tests were within normal limits. Brain MRI performed 10 h after admission demonstrated two areas of restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the left hemisphere (Fig. b). However, no acute infarction was seen in the posterior cerebral artery territories. Considering the location of infarction area could not well explain his clinical symptoms, a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was done which revealed that the left ICA was occluded (Fig. a).

It had initially started as an area of erythema, then a small papule developed. The papule then continued to progress into a large, painless swelling, measuring 2 x 3 cm. The lesion is located in the lateral aspect of the middle phalanx of the ring finger. The patient had no other skin lesions or rashes on her body. Additionally, this was the first time that she had presented with such a swelling. There is no incident or injury that preceded this finger swelling. Furthermore, she reported no fever, chills, rigors, night sweats, fatigue, or dizziness.\nShe had sought medical attention for this by visiting her primary care provider, and was prescribed two courses of empirical antibiotics, with no significant improvement.\nOur patient is otherwise healthy, with no known chronic diseases, infections, immune disorders, or such. She works as a housemaid, and no similar condition occurred in her own family or in the family that she currently works for. She has had no contact with sick patients, and no recent travels. There was also no contact with animals. Her systemic review was unremarkable.\nHer vitals were stable and within normal limits. Local examination revealed an ulcerated swelling, surrounded by erythema, over the middle phalanx of the left ring finger (Figure ). A minimal amount of pus was expelled when pressure was applied to the area. Moreover, mild tenderness was noted on deep palpation and we found limited movement at the proximal interphalangeal joint.

Laboratory testing was notable for a complete blood count showing a normocytic anemia, and coagulation studies were with reference range (prothrombin time of 11.9 s, INR of 1.1, and activated partial thromboplastin time of 31 s). A preoperative echocardiogram revealed a severely dilated left atrium, mild to moderately dilated right atrium, and severe mitral valve regurgitation. Coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery stenosis. The patient would undergo a Cox-maze procedure, ligation and excision of the left atrial appendage, and mitral valve annuloplasty with a ring placed: the surgery was completed without complication and the patient would subsequently exhibit normal sinus rhythm.\nPathologic gross examination of the excised atrial appendage noted smooth and unremarkable pericardial and endocardial surfaces, without the presence of thrombus formation along the endocardial surface. Sections of the appendage were submitted for processing for light microscopy. Microscopic examination revealed the common findings of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and endocardial fibroelastosis and also showed few epicardial veins with evidence of an acute thrombotic angiopathy characterized by intimal edema, endotheliosis, and overlying fibrin (). The acute thrombotic angiopathy was non-occlusive, and there was no evidence of associated ischemic injury of adjacent tissues including myocardium.

(figure ). a patent foramen ovale was also identified with evidence of left to right shunting. the rest of the echocardiographic examination was unremarkable. despite a slight resemblance with lv non-compaction cardiomyopathy, strict echocardiographic criteria for the diagnosis of this entity in our case did not exist []. an alternative hypothesis was that the echo dense projections represented mural thrombi and the possibility of some form of intrauterine lv ischemic insult/accident was postulated. a search in the literature for any similar case was negative. heart failure treatment with digitalis, carvedilol, furosemide and an ace-inhibitor was commenced. there was some uncertainty as to whether warfarin should be prescribed for the presumed mural thrombi and the aneurismal apex; therefore the patient was referred for cardiovascular magnetic resonance (cmr) for better anatomic and functional assessment. cmr demonstrated a distorted lv and confirmed the presence of numerous cross bridging muscular projections originating from the inferior wall, inferior interventricular septum and lateral lv walls. some of",
