Three weeks later, He presented acute cataclysmic bleeding associated with two cardiac arrests. After resuscitation, the patient underwent an emergency laparotomy. Preoperative CT scan was not possible.\nFirst finding was a two liters hemoperitoneum. A huge hematoma with active bleeding was found posterior to the bilioenteric anastomosis.

On exam, he exhibited mild left upper quadrant and epigastric tenderness without evidence of peritonitis. CT imaging demonstrated splenomegaly with a large splenic hematoma measuring 15.7 \u00d7 9.2 \u00d7 12 cm and associated hemoperitoneum (Figs \u2013). In addition, innumerable osseous lytic lesions were identified. Given these findings, emergent surgical consultation was obtained and his coagulopathy reversed. He remained hypotensive despite resuscitation, thus was taken for laparotomy. Upon abdominal entry, a large amount of old clot was evacuated. The abdomen was packed in all quadrants in the standard fashion. Upon removal of the left upper quadrant packs, active hemorrhage began to well from the region of the spleen which was mobilized and removed via splenectomy. Upon gross inspection, the spleen was hyperemic and abnormally indurated, with an avulsion type injury extending several centimeters across the inferior pole. There was no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or other gross pathology. Given the patient was mildly hypothermic and coagulopathic with continued oozing from the retroperitoneum, the decision was made to pack the splenic fossa and place a temporary wound vac. The patient was transported to the ICU for resuscitation and brought back to the OR the next morning for re-exploration and closure. Despite hemodynamic stabilization, he underwent a prolonged hospitalization complicated by atrial fibrillation, renal allograft failure, VAP, and ultimately PEA arrest progressing to asystole. He died 6 weeks following splenectomy. The pathology from the spleen revealed splenomegaly with parenchyma that was replaced with amorphous and acellular eosinophilic material. Histologic staining (Thioflavin-T) was positive for amyloidosis, AL-type. Oncology was consulted based on these findings with concern for lymphoproliferative disorder given osseous findings on CT, splenic pathology, and history of immunosuppression.

There was no adherence or attachment to the renal parenchyma [Fig ]. The renal pelvis was opened to remove it completely. There was no intrapelvic growth. The part of the renal pelvis (about 1.5 cm) from which the tumor was arising was excised. Frozen section revealed a benign nature. The renal pelvis was closed after inserting a double J stent into left ureter.

He was referred to us by a local clinic for further evaluation and treatment. At the time of admission, his visual acuity was 0.8 in the right eye and hand motion only (HM) in the left eye. Slit lamp examination revealed a full-thickness corneal laceration 6.5 mm in size spanning from the 4 o'clock to the 7 o'clock position near the corneal limbus. A part of the swollen lens was anteriorly displaced, and hyphema was present. The patient was treated by primary closure of the lacerated cornea. However, the lens surgery was postponed by a couple of weeks until the decrease of corneal edema. He had a one-year history of hypertension, and he had been taking oral antihypertensives. He had no history of diabetes. However, at the time of admission, his serum glucose was 491 mg/dL and other laboratory findings were unremarkable. There was no history of other systemic disease. On postoperative day one, the patient's visual acuity was HM, and the suture site was clear. A small amount of viscoelastics materials remained in the anterior chamber, along with some floating vitreous fibers (). The lens surgery was postponed due to the corneal edema. He was discharged a week after the primary suture. There was no remarkable change during admission and first follow up after primary closure. On his second visit at approximately two weeks after surgery, the patient was noted to have an epithelial defect and subepithelial and stromal cell infiltrates at the laceration site.

This patient suffered from chronic right TMJ pain for more than 5 years. She had consulted several physicians over the past few years, but could not obtain a definitive diagnosis. There was no prior treatment provided. Her past medical history includes surgical excision of left breast fibro-adenoma, recurrent upper urinary tract infection, stress urinary incontinence and infective colitis. She was on active follow up with the Otolaryngology department for hoarseness of voice. She was a non-smoker and non-drinker. There was no known history of any genetic disorder. The patient denied any history of trauma or infection to the jaw area. There were no other family members with a history of temporomandibular joint or jaw swelling.\nOn examination, a localized swelling was palpable over the right pre-auricular region which measured 15 mm by 20 mm. It was tender upon palpation and had a bony hard texture. The swelling appeared distinct from the TMJ capsule as it did not move when the right mandibular condyle translated anteriorly during mouth opening. On maximal mouth opening, the condylar translation at both TMJs was similar. The maximal mouth opening was normal. The overlying skin was normal in consistency and was not fixed to the swelling.\nA series of lab tests were ordered, including liver function test, renal function test and complete blood count. All results were being found to be within normal ranges. A dental panoramic tomogram (DPT) was taken (Fig. ), but no distinct lesion could be observed at the right TMJ. Unenhanced computed tomography (CT) was taken subsequently (Fig. a-b).

There was no history of trauma. Chronic or medical history, family history of chronic diseases, and drug history were all insignificant. On physical examination, a firm immobile swelling in the right anterior forearm was noticed. No skin discoloration, scars, or dilated veins were seen. Pain and tenderness at the site of the lesion were aggravated by wrist extension. Movement of the right elbow was within normal limits. No limitations in extension of the right wrist or fingers were detected. Radial pulses were palpated and bilaterally equal. An MRI was ordered to evaluate the detected mass and showed in (Fig. ) a large intramuscular lobulated fat intensity within the supinator muscle and in a direct relation to the anterolateral proximal radial meta-diaphysis, containing bone protuberance inseparable from the anterolateral radial diaphyseal cortex and periosteum. The lesion contains thin septations inside and measures about 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5.6 cm (in its maximum diameters). The radial cortex is slightly thickened with subcortical bone marrow edema noted. The mass is displacing the extensor muscles. There was no enhancement of the lesion itself but enhancing septations and periosteal layer of the protruding bone and the underlying bone marrow (Fig. ). The posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) was not identified; mostly entrapped and compressed by the mass. Flexor and extensor muscles of the elbow appeared normal with no atrophy. Medial and lateral collateral ligaments appeared intact. There was no significant elbow joint effusion. A CT scan was done and confirmed the findings including the bony changes (Fig. ).

There were associated night sweats, loss of appetite, and loss of weight. There was a history of transient macular rash at the onset of the fever which spontaneously resolved without treatment. Generalized lymphadenopathy was noted by our patient mainly involving cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions over 1 month which became extremely painful a few days prior to his presentation. He had synovitis involving lower limb small joints following the presentation, progressing to lower limb large joints and ultimately upper limb small and large joints over 3 days. He did not have past history or family history of arthritis and he had an unremarkable past medical history. He worked as a mason but had never been exposed to toxic environmental conditions to his knowledge and there was no promiscuous sexual behavior. He did not consume alcohol and he did not smoke tobacco.\nOn examination at the initial presentation he was emaciated, febrile, and pale. There were bilateral, firm, matted lymph nodes of varying sizes of 2\u20133 cm in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions which were tender. There was tender hepatosplenomegaly. The rest of the examination was normal. However, a few days following admission there was bilateral symmetrical polyarthritis involving both small and large joints of upper and lower limbs with lower limb predominance. There was marked synovitis of distal and proximal interphalangeal joints of lower limbs compared to the rest of his joints.\nLaboratory investigations revealed high white cell counts with normocytic anemia.

Intraoral examination revealed extraction socket of the lower left first molar. There was expansion of buccal and lingual cortical plates and loss of vestibular depth from left lateral incisor to first molar region. Left second premolar had grade II mobility. Teeth from right lateral incisor to left second premolar were tender on percussion. Also, two SP were seen on lingual aspect of lower right first and second premolars [].

The post-operative course was complicated by abdominal distention that occurred on post-operative day eight. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a large collection of retroperitoneal fluid measuring 11 x 9 x 22 cm in the left pelvis and left flank area with mass effect on the left kidney and ureter causing hydronephrosis (Figure ).

The patient did not have nausea, emesis, paresis, or paresthesia. Physical examination was significant for diminished visual acuity, bilateral papilledema, and anisocoria in the left eye. He also had right pronator drift. He showed no other neurologic deficit. A T1-weighted MRI with contrast showed a heterogeneously enhancing left anterior temporal extraaxial tumor with mass effect and significant surrounding vasogenic edema suggestive of an invasive meningioma, based on its location and appearance (Figure ).\nSurgical treatment was discussed and determined to be the best option to attenuate symptoms by decompression and obtain diagnosis to optimize long-term outcomes. The patient underwent surgical resection of their tumor through a left pterional craniotomy. Ultrasonic aspiration was used to debulk the tumor centrally followed by circumferential dissection through a plane. The gliotic brain was noted at the periphery of the tumor. No obvious interdigitations of tumor into the brain were grossly noted. Gross total resection was achieved. However, histopathologic examination found meningioma with invading cerebral tissue superficially (Figure ).\nHistologic sections using glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining demonstrated a moderate cellularity meningothelial meningioma with increased mitotic activity. There was also suggestion of early focal necrosis, and high Ki-67 labeling indices were found supporting that this portion of the mass was a WHO grade 2 meningioma with atypical features. In addition, some flanking areas demonstrated distinct disturbances in cerebral parenchyma underlying the meningioma, and a strip of vertically oriented proliferating vessels were seen in vascular columns. This area was also flanked by meningothelial cells that were entrapping and distorting the cortical grey matter between them.

    "original_text": "A 5-year-old girl with no past medical or surgical history had complained of waxing and waning pain around the umbilicus for a few years. On several occasions, she had visited her general practitioner due to abdominal pain, but no abnormalities had been noted. The pain recurred with greater severity, and abdominal ultrasound performed by her general practitioner revealed a cystic lesion in the right lower abdominal cavity. An abdominal abscess was suspected thus she was referred to a tertiary hospital.\nOn admission, the vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 125/81 mmHg; pulse, 166 beats per minute; and temperature; 36.5 \u00b0C. On palpation, rebound tenderness was noted on the right iliac fossa. On laboratory investigation, the white blood cell count was 17,400/\u03bcL and the C-reactive protein level was 1.54 mg/dl. There was an elevation in the serum pancreatic amylase and lipase level (124 U/L, 114 U/L respectively). Contrast enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) (Fig. ) revealed a cystic lesion measuring 6 \u00d7 5 cm with an enhancing thick wall in the ileal mesentery.

Her developmental history was compatible with her age, and her vaccinations were up-to-date. She was followed regularly at our pediatric hematology clinic and receiving regular hydroxyurea and folic acid supplements.\nOn examination, the patient had no organomegaly; her ear, nose, and throat examination was unremarkable; and her initial neurologic examination was unremarkable with normal motor power, sensations, and reflexes. Subsequently, she was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with acute chest syndrome on the basis of her clinical manifestations and bilateral lung infiltrates seen on chest x-rays. Her concomitant abdominal pain was attributed to vaso-occlusive crisis. She was started on full supportive care, including antibiotics, analgesics, intravenous fluids, and oxygen supplementation, and she was given packed red blood cells once with minimal improvement.

    "original_text": "A 57-year-old asymptomatic man was found to have multiple intestinal masses by computed tomography (CT) done as part of his routine medical examination in December 2011. Surgical resection (R0) was performed in December 2011. The resected specimen consisted of a mass measuring 10.0 \u00d710.0 cm in maximal diameter. Final pathologic diagnosis revealed a high-risk GIST according to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) criteria (). The patient was not treated with adjuvant treatment after surgery in the local hospital because he had difficulty paying for adjuvant imatinib therapy. On routine follow-up visit in May 2012, local recurrence and metastasis were confirmed by imaging. He was then referred to West China Hospital in May 2012.\nBeginning in May 2012, this patient received first-line imatinib orally with a dose of 400 mg/day resulting in a partial response. Disease progression occurred after the continuation of imatinib for 54 months. The patient was then treated with cytoreductive surgery combined with imatinib and showed a PFS of 7 months. New biopsy of an abdominal metastasis yielded a KIT mutation in exon 11 as well as in KIT exon 13 (V654A), confirming the clinical observation of secondary imatinib resistance (). In May 2017, this patient received second-line sunitinib. After 11 months of treatment, sunitinib was discontinued due to disease progression. The patient refused biopsy for additional mutational analysis for personal reasons.\nAlthough regorafenib had been approved for the third-line treatment of patients with advanced GISTs by China Food and Drug Administration at that time, the patient refused the agent due to the cost and budget constraints.

Upon intraoral clinical examination, a deep Miller Class III GR was detected on the buccal aspect of the tooth #2. The root apex was exposed entirely and a degree 3 Muhlemann [] mobility associated to a tooth extrusion was diagnosed. Probing examination revealed pockets of 6 mm on the buccal and palatal mesial aspect and pockets of 5 mm on the buccal and palatal distal aspect. Radiograph showed an advanced vertical bone loss on the mesial and distal aspects of the tooth with an apical lesion and mild root resorption. Thermal pulp tests indicated necrotic pulp. Occlusion was checked, and there was an occlusal trauma. A diagnosis of a periodontal-endodontic lesion in the tooth #2 was then confirmed. After oral hygiene instructions, the patient received mechanical therapy (scaling and root planing) associated with antimicrobial drugs (amoxicillin 500 mg+metronidazole 250 mg 3 times a day during 7 days). An endodontic treatment was performed on the tooth #2 (). Two months later, based on the analysis of the possibility of tooth maintenance and on the patient's choice for a more conservative procedure, the decision was made to preserve the tooth. The aims of the corrective phase of the treatment were to cover the GR, to augment KT around the tooth #2, and to correct the occlusion by an orthodontic treatment.

No remarkable findings were identified in his medical records. Among his first-degree family members, only one of his 2 sisters and his brother exhibited the same dental problems and his parents were cousins, so his inheritance pattern of AI was autosomal recessive. He had not received any prior dental treatment. In extraoral examination, the patient had competent lips and showed no facial asymmetry, no muscle tenderness or palpable lymph nodes, and no signs and symptoms of joint disorder. Intraoral examination revealed hypoplastic and hypomature types of AI in posterior and anterior teeth, respectively. The incisal edges were thin and the cuspal structures were aberrant (). There were short clinical crowns, especially in the posterior regions. Other findings included posterior teeth wear and caries on teeth nos. 14, 15, 29, and 30. The patient had constricted maxillary arch and crossbite relationship in bilateral posterior regions and teeth nos. 6 and 7. The patient suffers from pain on teeth nos. 14 and 29. The patient's oral hygiene was generally poor, as evidenced by bleeding on probing and plaque index findings. No packet deeper than 4 mm was recorded and the gingiva was hyperemic and edematous. Esthetic evaluation revealed a \u201cgummy smile\u201d in anterior maxilla and asymmetry in gingival contours of anterior teeth. The interocclusal distance measured at the premolar region during physiological rest was 3 mm. It was not possible to determine the molar relationship, but a Class I canine relationship was observed.
