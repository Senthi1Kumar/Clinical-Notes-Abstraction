Our initial examination found that his best-corrected visual acuity in decimal units was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.6 in the left eye. His refractive error was +3.0 D and +3.5 D for the right eye and left eye, respectively. Full-field rod ERGs were absent and cone-rod mixed responses were the negative type, indicating ON bipolar cell dysfunction (). From the symptoms and ophthalmic examination, he was suspected of having PR.\nA general physical examination revealed small cell carcinoma of the lung and Western blot of the patient\u2019s serum showed autoantibodies against TRPM1. We diagnosed this patient with melanoma-associated retinopathy and retinal ON bipolar dysfunction due to TRPM1 autoantibody and have reported his findings in more detail elsewhere. After diagnosis, chemotherapy was started using cisplatin and etoposide combined with radiation for the lung cancer in August 2010. The patient achieved a complete remission, but underwent cranial irradiation in March 2011 to prevent brain metastasis.\nWe have followed this patient ophthalmologically for more than 2 years since his initial visit and his symptoms have not changed. His best-corrected visual acuity decreased slightly to 0.8 in the right eye and 0.5 in the left eye due to progression of cataracts. His visual field has not constricted and his ERGs have not changed (see ). Rod responses were nonrecordable in 2010 and 2012. The amplitudes for a-wave of cone-rod mixed maximum response were 240 \u03bcV and 220 \u03bcV in 2010 and 2012, respectively, and those for b-wave were 150 \u03bcV and 120 \u03bcV, respectively. The amplitudes of cone response were about 25 \u03bcV for the a-wave and 50 \u03bcV for the b-wave at both times in 2010 and 2012. The amplitudes of the 30 Hz flicker ERGs were 14 \u03bcV in 2010",

According to her, she was well three months back, when she suddenly developed episodes of severe left frontal headache which were continuous for hours to days. It was throbbing in character not associated with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, dizziness or fits. At many occasions, she complained of double vision with severe headache. For the same length of time, she also noticed that her left eye was bulging outwards along with pulsation in the same protruded eye which gradually increased and since one month it had been so obvious that anyone looking at her could appreciate it.\nHer general physical examination was unremarkable. She was conscious and well oriented to time, place and person. Her higher mental functions, gross motor, fine motor and sensory functions were intact. On local examination of the left eye, there was non-axial pulsatile proptosis with outward depression of the left eyeball.

Postoperatively, the patient had no other remarkable neurological deficits besides a light remaining right hemiparesis and had undergone concomitant radio- and chemotherapy followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide. Nevertheless, the doses of temozolomide had to be reduced due to a severe thrombocytopenia developed by the patient during the treatment.\nBrain MRI at the time of consultation due to paraparesis showed no evidence of a local intracranial recurrence (Fig. ). However, MRI of the spine demonstrated a homogeneous contrast-enhancing mass within the spinal canal at the Th8/9 level causing significant spinal cord compression (Fig. ). A lumbar puncture was performed and cytological examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) did not reveal the presence of neoplastic cells.\nDue to the spinal cord compression and progressive paraparesis, we suggested surgery with the aim of decompressing the spinal cord and if possible remove the tumor.

    "original_text": "A 79-year-old man with right hemiparesis was admitted to our hospital for examination of a growing abnormal shadow on a chest radiograph. He had experienced rickets as a child and had been treated for hypertension, mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebral infarction, and cerebral hemorrhage for 20 years. His height, weight, and body surface area were 133 cm, 44.2 kg, and 1.25 m2, respectively. He also had pigeon breast. Computed tomography (CT) angiography demonstrated a saccular aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta with a maximum diameter of 55 mm. The thoracoabdominal aorta adjoining the aneurysm possessed a bend of 180\u00b0, and the right brachiocephalic artery was extremely elongated and tortuous (Fig. ). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed moderate aortic valve regurgitation. Considering respiratory failure by left thoracotomy and his medical history such as cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage, the patient was deemed unsuitable for performing a traditional graft replacement. After informed consent was obtained from the patient, we selected TEVAR under a ministernotomy.\nAlthough the iliac arteries were suitable for the introduction of a sheath for the chosen stent graft, we were concerned that the tortuous thoracoabdominal aorta would prevent safe retrograde delivery of the stent graft to its intended location. The right brachiofemoral through-and-through wire technique was not feasible because of a high risk of vascular injury associated with the severely tortuous right brachiocephalic artery. The use of a transapical approach was considered difficult because of the hemodynamic collapse caused by aortic regurgitation.

    "original_text": "A 39-year-old Caucasian woman presented in our emergency department with acute abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and signs of intestinal occlusion. The clinical history of the patient highlighted two other admissions for the same clinical signs. During the first admission, she was given an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan that demonstrated only the presence of free fluid localized in the pouch of Douglas and the perihepatic region. In relation to these signs, she was given an emergency, explorative laparotomy, with lavage of the abdomen. The laparotomy demonstrated only hyperemic jejunal and ileal handles. She was discharged after nine days without any complications. Two weeks after the patient was readmitted to the same hospital with similar symptoms, and she was treated with corticosteroids, mesalazine, and metronidazole with a complete resolution of the symptoms. Five days later, the patient was admitted to our unit. At admission, she had leukocytosis (WBC, 19.960 \u00d7 106/L) and normal levels of the coagulation parameters. She was given abdominal ultrasonography in association with Doppler ultrasonography (Esaote Megas GPX 7.5-MHz convex probe), highlighting a thrombosis of the SMA.

His clinical history was characterized by a silent inferior-basal myocardial infarction detected by a control ECG that presented inferior Q waves, and he had not previously presented symptoms. The infarct was referable to maximum a couple of months before especially basing on symptoms worsening. So he had not any previous diagnosis or treatment of the acute event.\nFunctional NYHA Class was III, but it was I two months before, and symptoms were rapidly worsening in the last 20 days.\nThe patient was a smoker, affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease, presented in sinus rhythm. Medical therapy was based beta blockers, ASA, and a diuretic with some relief of symptoms.\nA transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a dyskinetic posterior wall of the left ventricle, mild mitral regurgitation, with moderate reduction of the ejection fraction (EF = 44%). An aneurysmatic enlargement was noted in the posterior wall, but with few signs to distinguish a true aneurysm from a pseudo-aneurysm. The patient underwent a coronary angiographic examination that revealed patent anterior descending and circumflex arteries and a right coronary artery that was completely closed and perfused by hetero-coronaric circulation. Contrast ventriculography showed an enlargement of the left ventricle with a large dyskinetic cavity localized in the diaphragmatic region, suggesting the presence of a pseudo-aneurysm. (Fig. )\nA second TTE was done, with results similar to the first one, but a thrombus in the posterior wall was also disclosed.\nAt the time of surgery a large true aneurysm of the posterior wall of the left ventricle was found (Fig. , ).

(fig. )\na second tte was done, with results similar to the first one, but a thrombus in the posterior wall was also disclosed.\nat the time of surgery a large true aneurysm of the posterior wall of the left ventricle was found (fig. , ). the aneurysm consisted of a very thin myocardium layer; inside there was a thrombus about 6 cm \u00d7 4.5 cm.

The mass was hard and fixed and extended from the glans proximally up the shaft. He also had bilateral palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy. There were no associated constitutional symptoms. Given there was a high suspicion for malignancy, the patient underwent partial penectomy within a month of presentation. Biopsy results confirmed a pT2 tumor with invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated, and tumor size of 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2.5 cm, with corpus spongiosum and lymphovascular involvements.\nFollowing the procedure, the patient had PET-CT for staging, and imaging revealed enlarged hypermetabolic bilateral axillary lymph nodes concerning for metastatic disease. In addition, there was a large centrally necrotic lymph node conglomerate in his left groin that had increased FDG avidity. The patient had left inguinal and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissections revealing metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in multiple lymph nodes. The left inguinal mass was also found to be metastatic well-differentiated SCC. His diagnosis was staged at T2N3M0.\nAfter his surgical procedures, patient was started on adjuvant chemotherapy. He began first line chemotherapy with paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (TIP). He underwent 4 cycles of TIP but eventually developed disease progression on repeat imaging. At this point, the patient was started on cetuximab given EGFR amplification on tumor analysis with the FoundationOne testing platform. However, the patient had an allergic reaction to cetuximab, so his treatment was changed to panitumumab.

Mutational analysis revealed that he lacked EGFR mutations or ALK gene rearrangements. CT scans showed that this patient had developed multiple metastases, including mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, and also to the right intrapulmonary lymph nodes. He received 6 cycles of Pem-Cis chemotherapy, followed by thoracic radiation. Review of the CT scan at completion of sequential chemoradiotherapy treatment resulted in a significant shrinkage in the primary tumor in his left lung, while simultaneously resulting in a slight increase in metastatic lymph nodes (Fig. ). In February 6, 2017, CT scans showed that the tumor progressed rapidly. He was then scheduled to receive gemcitabine plus nedaplatin (Gem-Ndp) chemotherapy. However, the patient had to discontinue the planned 2nd cycle of this regimen as he developed moderate pneumonia. After systemic antibiotic treatment, the patient improved symptomatically and became increasingly energetic. However, CT scans on March 29 revealed that his tumors had progressed further. Owing to his poor physical condition after Gem-Ndp treatment, the chemotherapy regimen was changed to Pem-Cis. However, CT scans on May 11 failed to detect any shrinkage in his tumor. In addition, lymph node metastases increased post-treatment. The patient subsequently started standard of care pembrolizumab treatment at 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. During hospitalization, the general condition of the patient was good, with signs of fatigue only present at the first 2 days after each pembrolizumab infusion. The treatment failed to result in an anti-tumor response. The patient then received 2 cycles of initially used chemotherapy regimen Pem-Cis.

    "original_text": "A 79-year-old man was admitted emergently with a 3-week history of fever, chill, and abdominal pain. His past history was remarkable for hypertension and diabetes. He also had a history of receiving acupuncture on his back about a month before the onset of symptoms. Clinical examination revealed tender abdomen, tachycardia of 98 beats per min, and temperature of 38\u2103. Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell count of 28,580/mm3 with 95.6% neutrophils. Abdominal computed tomogram performed at local clinic confirmed the presence of an abdominal aortic pseudoaneurysm from infrarenal to the level of both common iliac arteries with periaortic gangrenous gas formation (). Because of the presence of retroperitoneal pseudoaneurysm and probable rupture, an emergent explo-laparotomy was performed. At emergency laparotomy, a pseudoaneurysm containing gas-forming inflamed friable tissue with hematoma was observed, and the adventitia of the aorta was almost completely destroyed (). The hematoma was partly evacuated and the cavity was debrided. During removal of the infected adventitial tissue, a part of the abdominal aorta suddenly ruptured. By careful management of the patient's vital signs, the ruptured aorta was firmly compressed and the uncontaminated portion of infrarenal abdominal aorta and both common iliac arteries were secured for cross clamping. After the proximal and distal parts were cross clamped, the infected friable aortic walls and pseudoaneurysm were completely removed.

Physical examination showed a supra- and infraumbilical incisional hernia with a periumbilical midline scar (). She underwent ultrasonography of the abdomen; further radiological investigations could not be done. There was a defect 11 cm long and 6 cm wide around the umbilical region containing omentum. We decided to perform a laparoscopic e-TEP Rives repair in March 2018. The operative technique has been followed according to the technique put forward by Belyansky et al., except for the transfascial suture reconstruction of the linea alba []. The omentum was reduced, the midline defect was closed with interrupted transfascial 1-0 polypropylene sutures, and the defect in the posterior layer was closed with 2-0 polygalactin continuous without any tension. Then, a polypropylene mesh measuring 21 cm long and 14 cm wide was placed in the retrorectal space to ensure adequate overlap of the mesh edges. The previous onlay mesh did not need removal because it was in a completely different plane. She had an uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged on the 4th postoperative day (). In 1-year follow-up, she is completely free of any complaints.\nA 45-year-old female had a history of open cholecystectomy 19 years back and developed hernia in the medial part of the incision at the right subcostal region.

The patient's parents and 2 elder sisters were healthy and free of any neurological diseases. The patient reported that he was born at term in his home by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery, and the birth was assisted by a midwife. His birth weight, height, and head circumference were not noted. The patient's bilateral thumbs and feet were weak at birth. The patient could walk by the age of 6 years, although he had an unstable gait and fallen arches in his feet. The arches in his feet developed gradually. The patient underwent bilateral straightening of the feet at a local hospital at the age of 16, which resulted in greater improvement in his right foot. The patients had visited multiple hospitals, but the etiology remained unknown. His parents reported that he had no history of seizures. The patient had a history of chronic gastritis for 10 years, while he was at junior high school; however, he had no other previous history of any disease and was not addicted to either alcohol or tobacco.\nWe examined the patient in August 2019. His vital signs, measured at the time of admission, were normal (body temperature: 36.5\u00b0C; pulse rate: 104 beats/minute; respiratory frequency: 20 breaths/minute; blood pressure: 123/85 mm Hg). The patient walked with a myopathic gait because of weakness in the lower extremities.

Before that time, the patient had always been symptom-free, following a normal active life. The pain was pulsating, with a concentration in frontal and periorbital area with no particular radiation. When severe, it has been followed by eye irritation and involuntary tearing. Headache was progressive along the day, and most severe at night. The severity of the pain has also been intensified within the recent weeks comparing to time it started. The patient had no history of seizure or convulsion, aphasia, and diplopia. Otherwise, she gave a history of occasional vomiting, nausea, amnesia, and sphincter dysfunction in form of stress incontinency and equilibrium problems. Cerebellar tests were abnormal, and she could not walk on her own. She had a history of left kidney tumor, for which she had undergone partial nephrectomy for about three years ago. Furthermore, she gave a history of controlled diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. No history of ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular attack was mentioned. She had a drug regimen of insulin, losartan, memantine, atorvastatin, zinc plus, magnesium, propranolol, and venlafaxine. In her physical examination, cranial nerves were intact, with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15/15. Cerebellar tests were abnormal with obvious equilibrium dysfunction and inability to self-manage walk. Both pupils were normal sized, symmetric and reactive to light. Visual acuity was at level of finger count out of three meters distance. Sensory and motor function of the four extremities were normal; and no sensory level was detected.

    "original_text": "An 82-year-old male patient was referred to our emergency department due to a neglected periprosthetic knee joint infection of his left knee. He had undergone a primary total knee arthroplasty 11 years ago in another institution because of painful osteoarthritis. Failure of the primary arthroplasty led to revision surgery two years later, at the same institution. The patient reported prolonged mild edema and moderate pain subsequent to the revision surgery and deterioration of symptoms during the past two months.\nOn admission, the patient reported severe pain in the left knee. This was the reason for the limitation of his daily activities. The patient was afebrile and no injury in the recent past was referred. \u03a4he knee joint was excessively swollen, with prominent erythema and warmth. Moreover, imaging by X-ray revealed a constrained revision prosthesis and no signs of fracture (Figure ). The range of motion was affected, with a major deficit in flexion and a 10 degrees deficit in extension.\nAn ultrasound of the knee joint was performed in the emergency department and revealed massive fluid accumulation in the joint. Blood samples revealed abnormal inflammatory markers. The C-reactive protein (CRP) was 20.3 mg/L and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 67 mm/hr, but no leukocytosis was observed. Blood cultures were also obtained. The rest of the standard laboratory evaluation was normal.\nAs far as medical history is concerned, the patient reported myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) under treatment.

The lump was present for past 5 months but rapidly grew over the last 3 months to current size. There was no history of coagulopathy, trauma, chronic liver disease or history of similar illness in first degree relatives. The patient attained menarche at the age of 15 years. She is a non-smoker and denies history of contraceptive use or alcohol intake.\nOn examination in our emergency there was severe pallor with tachycardia. However the blood pressure was maintained. There was an oozing ulceration in upper outer quadrant of the left breast with underlying huge lump measuring 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202fcm occupying the upper outer, lower outer and upper inner quadrants with deformed shape of the breast (a). The skin surrounding the ulcer was erythematous and edematous. Axilla did not show lymphadenopathy.\nBefore the development of breast lump, the patient had itchy lesion at the same site. The patient unfortunately attributed all these events to that itchy lesion and sought help late. There was no history of headache, shortness of breath, abdominal distension or bone pain.\nOn investigating the patient, she was severely anemic with hemoglobin of 5\u202fgm% with normal total and differential counts. Coagulation parameters and liver function tests were normal.

She was initially managed conservatively with analgesia and intravenous antibiotics. Flexible sigmoidoscopy the following day showed an ischemic splenic flexure, and the decision was made for the patient to undergo a laparotomy. Preoperatively, the patient remained normotensive.\nOn the second day of her admission, the patient was taken to theater for a laparotomy. A low thoracic epidural was attempted for postoperative pain relief; however, the procedure was abandoned after one attempt due to a dural tap. Consequently, the patient had general anesthesia with systemic opioid analgesia and a rectus sheath block. Intraoperative findings revealed an ischemic left colon and proximal sigmoid colon; therefore, she underwent a Hartmann\u2019s procedure. Intraoperatively, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, with an average blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg. Postoperatively, the patient was commenced on a morphine patient-controlled analgesia for pain relief and was anti-coagulated for the ischemic colitis. Investigations towards underlying conditions likely to have caused the ischemic colitis were also carried out. Screening for presence of the anti-phospholipid antibody, JAK2 mutation, and thrombophilia proved negative.\nPostoperatively, the patient developed an ileus. This was managed conservatively with nasogastric drainage and intravenous fluids. Her blood pressure rose from an average of 150/80 mmHg on postoperative day 1",

He complained of dysarthria and inability to sit, stand and walk since his awakening. On admission, he was alert and oriented. He was slightly dysarthric. His Mini-Mental State Examination score was 30. He showed neither hemispatial neglect nor disconnection syndrome. Muscle strength of all extremities and the trunk was not decreased. On sensory examination, vibratory sensation was slightly decreased on both feet, which was attributed to diabetes mellitus. Thermal, pinprick and positional sensation was perceived normally in all extremities and trunk. The finger-to-nose test revealed terminal dysmetria in the right arm. However, the heel-to-shin test showed no asymmetry. Rapid alternating hand movement was not disturbed on both sides. Deep tendon reflexes were normoactive without pathological reflexes. He did not show any resting or intentional tremor nor asterixis. When he attempted to sit, he grasped the bed rails only with both hands to pull himself up without using his axial and leg muscles, but retropulsion occurred soon after detaching his hands from the bed rails. When tested lying on the bed, he could maintain his legs elevated for more than 10 s.

He had neither symptoms of cardiac diseases such as dyspnea, fatigue, chest distress, angina or arrhythmia nor family history of any cardiac diseases. Physical examination showed his heart rate was 78 beats per minute and the blood pressure was 138/80 mmHg. Grade III to-and-fro murmur was heard over the second intercostal space of his left sternal margin. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm and no significant ST segment or T wave anomaly was found. Chest radiography showed enlarged heart shadow. TTE demonstrated a giant right coronary artery (RCA) aneurysm with a fistula to the right atrium (RA), and the ejection fraction(EF) was 58% (Fig. a, b). The diameter of the RCA increased to 11 mm. Coronary artery computed tomography (CT) revealed a giant aneurysm (65*48 mm) originating from the distal RCA and draining into the RA (Fig. a, b, c). The results of coronary angiography (CAG) were consistent with the above results. Considering the giant size of the aneurysm, surgery was needed as early as possible.

Four months before admission, he developed changes characterized by memory impairment; he could not remember where to deliver. He lost his quick intellect and responded slowly to certain situations. He did not talk much and was unable to say the right words at the right time. One month before admission, his symptoms became worse. He could not calculate correctly and complained of muscle trembling in the limbs. Then, a feeling of heaviness in his legs and double vision precipitated his admission. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. On admission, the patient was oriented, but his speech was slurred, with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 14 of 30. He performed poorly on tests of cognitive function. Impairment was greatest for delayed and verbal recognition memory, and executive functions, language, and visuospatial functions were also impaired. Myoclonic jerks of the upper limbs were observed, with hypomimia and parkinsonian gait. During the next 1 month, he became increasingly confused, with difficulty to recognize family members. He acted like a child and needed to be taken care of. He could not wear socks independently and had difficulties putting on different pieces of clothing, but his motor function was normal. While hospitalized, routine hematological and biochemical examinations were normal. A vasculitis screen based on serological markers was negative.

On examination, power was 5/5 with no sensory deficit and normal reflexes. The patient received NSAID painkillers and active bed rest was advised. However, on the patient's insistence, a lumbar spine X-ray and MRI were done which showed mild IVD protrusion. The patient was reassured and sent home. A week later the patient presented to the ER with an 18-hour history of heaviness and difficulty in raising the left foot when walking, with numbness along the lateral part of the leg and dorsum of the foot. The pain was moderate (VAS 5/10). No sphincter-related symptoms were observed. According to the patient, the decreased pain caused the delay in presentation, against the instructions on first evaluation. On examination of the foot dorsiflexion was 2/5 (movement on gravity alleviation) with decreased sensation along the left L5 dermatome. There were normal reflexes and sphincters. The patient underwent immediate, new lumbar MRI which showed a large disc sequester with disc migration.

She also has borderline intellectual functioning. Fortunately, she has never had any suicide attempts. She was tried on numerous psychotropic medications including different adequately dosed antipsychotic medications as well as antidepressant medications for an adequate duration to ensure that they were on the therapeutic dose and ultimately, she was stabilized on a combination of clozapine and sertraline. There was no drug or alcohol involvement. Medical history is significant for hypothyroidism, history of basal cell carcinoma status post excision, osteopenia, vitamin-D deficiency, history of simple and complex endometrial hyperplasia without atypia, status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She is allergic to penicillin. Family history is significant for alcoholism in father and possibly post-traumatic stress disorder. Mother had a \u201cnervous breakdown\u201d. There was a significant family history of psychosis in maternal grandmother, and drug and alcohol abuse in brothers. The patient had a distant relationship with her parents.

The medical history reveals umbilical cord bleeding and frequent mucocutaneous bleeding events such as cutaneous purpura and ecchymosis after birth. As she experienced recurrent episodes of severe epistaxis, the girl was admitted to the local hospital several times for medical treatment at the age of five. The patient was diagnosed with GT and occasionally received blood transfusions. One year before her hospitalization at our ward, she experienced menarche with excessive menstrual bleeding that required blood transfusion. Since, her menstrual period always lasted more than 9 days and did not cease spontaneously, a platelet or erythrocyte transfusion (usually more than one per period) was needed to stop the bleeding. The family history revealed that she was the only child from her parents\u2019 non-consanguineous marriage. Physical examination showed no abnormalities, except for generalized pallor. A gynecological examination by speculum showed moderate bleeding and laboratory investigation yielded the following results: leukocytes, 5.0 \u00d7 109/L; hemoglobin (Hb), 4.5 g/dL; and platelets, 155 \u00d7 109/L. The prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were normal. An abdominal ultrasound showed uneven endometrial thickness of 7 mm. The patient first received oral contraceptive therapy for two courses each for 21 day cycles. After a course of treatment, the menstrual bleeding stopped, her anemia symptoms were relieved, and the Hb level rose to 8.8 g/dL. However, the patient repeatedly forgot to take the medicine during the course of therapy and this poor compliance caused irregular vaginal bleeding, ultimately leading to worse academic and social performance with a Hb level of 9.5 g/dL.

She had associated intermittent fever, nausea, and loss of appetite. She did not have any urinary symptoms, bowel irregularities, or gynecological complaints. Abdominal examination was performed by two senior surgeons at two different occasions; the same day had findings of guarding and rebound tenderness at RIF. Hematological tests showed polymorphonuclear leukocytosis with left shift. Biochemical tests and urinalysis were normal. Urinary pregnancy test was negative. Abdominal radiographs were unremarkable.

He underwent two more craniotomies with recurrent tumors removal at our institute in 2012 and 2013 (). Thereafter, he has been treated by gamma knife radiosurgery three times successfully for local recurrent and residual HPC. Since then, no local recurrence has been found.
