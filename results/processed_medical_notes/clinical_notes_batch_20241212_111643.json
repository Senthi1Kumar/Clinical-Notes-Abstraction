Her only significant past medical history was well controlled hypertension. She was independent in her daily activities, did not smoke cigarettes and reported a good cardiorespiratory reserve prior to the onset of symptoms. The diagnosis of community-acquired multilobar pneumonia was made with a CURB-65 score of three. She was admitted to the high dependency unit with type 1 respiratory failure and a high alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient. She received intravenous antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam and erythromycin) and non-invasive high-flow continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

The criteria for ARDS were met and the cause was thought to be a combination of the direct pneumonic pulmonary injury and extrapulmonary severe sepsis. With protective lung ventilation, low dose methylprednisolone, antibiotic therapy and a negative fluid balance, gradual improvement was made; over the following five days respiratory parameters weaned sufficiently to allow an uncomplicated percutaneous tracheostomy to be performed.

The cause was thought to be a tracheal injury sustained at the time of tracheostomy insertion. An adjustable flange tube was positioned under bronchscopic guidance just proximal to the carina in an attempt to limit any further tracking of air through the potential tracheal defect.

    "original_text": "When the patient was first seen at the Center for Psychotic Disorders of our University Department of Psychiatry, he was a 27 year-old man in his first episode of schizophrenia (undifferentiated subtype). The onset of schizophrenia was estimated at 26 years of age. He had experienced school difficulties and could not attend regular courses to reach his high school degree. He started but was not able to attend the University courses for several years before schizophrenia onset.\nHe had been never treated with FGAs and was experiencing an acute psychotic relapse two months after the interruption of treatment with olanzapine (10 mg/die).\nAccording to his parents and the referring doctor, he had responded well to olanzapine, therefore, the drug was reintroduced (10 mg/die) while starting cognitive psychotherapy to increase motivation to treatment. Acute psychotic symptoms and active withdrawal improved in 1 month; however, he presented difficulty in concentrating and attention deficits. In the following 5 months, positive symptoms markedly improved (46% reduction of the pre-drug Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) positive factor score), but the patient experienced excessive weight increase (about 10 Kg with respect to pre-drug period) and poor response of cognitive dysfunctions (23% reduction of PANSS scores on the cognitive factor), as well as of social disability (Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) = 51).

Computed tomography (CT) scan findings showed small bowel thickening and were also notable for bilateral hydroureteronephrosis and moderate intra-abdominal ascites (Figures , ). Initial treatment was targeted at IPO in the setting of enteritis, and she was treated conservatively via nasogastric tube insertion, administration of antibiotics: vancomycin, meropenem, and doxycycline, as well as nil per os (NPO) status.\nHer kidney function continued to worsen with an increase in her creatinine level from a baseline of 0.75 mg/dL to 4.55 mg/dL. Urinalysis was negative for blood and protein. CT scans showed persistent bilateral ureter hydronephrosis, and renal Lasix scan revealed decreased renal flow and function bilaterally, with no obstruction in either kidney.

The diagnosis was based on clinical findings and histopathological evaluation which showed an increased number of lymphocytes in the lamina propria, in the epithelium and in a few crypts. There was a thickened collagenous band subepithelially. The findings were diffusely distributed in the whole colon[,]. She had normal biochemical and hematologic parameters, whereas faecal calprotectin levels were increased from 160 mg/kg in 2009 to 500 mg/kg when the CC deteriorated in 2013. Stool cultures were tested for Clostridium difficile at diagnosis, before the first and before the second FMT, and were also negative for Salmonella species, Shigella dysenteriae, Campylobacter jejuni, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Based on histopathologic examination of duodenal biopsies, celiac disease was excluded. Initial treatment with loperamide had only little effect, and cholestyramine, had no effect. The patient responded well to budesonide, and was in remission for 2 years. Gradually, however, the effect of budesonide declined during 2013, and her symptoms worsened with profuse watery diarrhea, severe fecal incontinence, fatigue, and a weight loss of totally 15 kg, though, without biochemical signs of malabsorption. She tried mesalazine without effect, and azathioprine, but did not tolerate it. She had doxycycline in November 2013, 100 mg per day for 10 d as treatment for olecranon bursitis, which resulted in decreased numbers of daily stools, but the effect only lasted one week after the cessation of the antibiotic. She had one additional doxycycline cure in 2014, also with good but temporary antidiarrheal effect. The details for treatments are summarized in Table .

According to the anamnesis, thyroidectomy was performed 15 years ago, because of compression syndrome (neck surface deformation, pressure in the neck, difficult swallowing) and symptoms of hyperthyroidism (palpitation, tachycardia, emotional lability) caused by a toxic multinodular goiter. The surgery was performed successfully, and no signs of laryngeal recurrent nerve lesion or hypocalcemia were observed. Three years ago the patient was hospitalized repeatedly because of hypercalcemia which was diagnosed via laboratory tests (ionized calcium concentration in the venous blood was 1.45 mmol/l and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration was 49.63 pmol/l). Simultaneously, osteopenia was diagnosed via performing a DEXA scan. In addition, neck ultrasound and scintigraphy tests were performed; there were insufficient data for parathyroid gland adenoma. It was decided to perform left superior parathyroidectomy and resection of residual thyroid tissue. The left superior parathyroid gland was enlarged twice; it was round and visually similar to adenoma. Other parathyroid glands were revised during the procedure. The left inferior and right superior parathyroid glands were without visible pathological changes. The right inferior parathyroid gland was not found. Resection of the thymus gland on both sides was performed. Ectopic parathyroid glands were not found in the resected thymus tissue. Below the manubrium on the trachea, a thyroid gland of approximately 3 cm in diameter was found, which was removed. An urgent histological examination was performed during the surgery, which revealed that the removed tissues were a thyroid fragment and a parathyroid gland without pathohistological changes.

The skin sleeve was disrupted at the proximal phalanx with ischemia due to complete avulsion of both neurovascular bundles, but the flexor tendons and bones were preserved (Urbaniak class I) [] (). Primary surgical management was performed in a forward surgical team (FST, role 2 MTF). Considering the situation of warm ischemia with impossibility for MEDEVAC within 6 h a temporary revascularization was attempted by the orthopedic surgeon who was not hand surgeon. The skin and subdermal tissue were first debrided. As the arteries were transected at various levels, a direct arterial anastomosis crossed from one side to the other was decided. After preparation of arterial ends the proximal ulnar digital artery was anastomosed to the distal radial digital artery using 9.0 nylon sutures with microsurgical instruments and \u00d72.5 magnification loupes. A venous bypass was not performed because the surgeon was not familiar with this procedure. Dorsal veins and nerves were not repaired. Loose skin closure and a stab incision made at the pulp tip permit venous outflow. At the end of the procedure the color of the finger, pulp capillary refill and skin temperature indicated good arterial perfusion. During surgery, the patient received 2 g of penicillin with clavulanic acid and 160 mg of acetylsalicylic intravenously. He was evacuated to France few hours later and arrived at the Percy military hospital (role 4 MTF) more than 24 h after the trauma. Unfortunately, an arterial thrombosis occurred during transportation and a distal digital necrosis was noticed on arrival. An early regularization at the metacarpophangeal joint level was required.

The patient had the 4 criteria of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome: involvement of 3 or more organs, simultaneous development of manifestations, antiphospholipid antibodies, and histological confirmation of small vessel thrombosis [, ]. In this case, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome appeared to be induced by an active tuberculosis that was diagnosed and treated later. Over the next 2 months, the patient required TPN, anticoagulation, and specific treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis reactivation. Constant vomiting was attributed to hyperphagia, a common occurrence related to SBS []. Afterwards, she underwent surgery to restore intestinal continuity. Due to necrosis of the terminal ileum with only 4 cm of terminal ileum left, jejunoileal anastomosis at the ileocecal valve was practiced and STEP was performed as in the previous case, using 12 stapler cartridges to obtain a total length of small bowel of 90 cm (calculated length = 45 cm + [12 \u00d7 4.5 cm]). Cholecystectomy and gastrostomy were also performed. Postoperatively, the gastrostomy had a persistent output of 1,500 mL/day. Upper gastrointestinal series performed through gastrostomy showed a stop in the third portion of the duodenum. Magnetic resonance angiography confirmed the diagnosis of superior mesenteric artery syndrome with perivascular fibrosis and intravascular thrombus (Fig. ). Corticosteroid treatment was initiated and a feeding jejunostomy tube was placed endoscopically, with the catheter tip distal to the stenotic area. Subsequent improvement was observed over the next 2 weeks, with a decrease in gastrostomy output and better tolerance of oral liquid nutrition. Citrulline levels before surgery were <20 \u03bcmol/L and 2 months after STEP hade risen above this level. TPN was stopped and the patient was discharged with oral supplements.

The bilateral TMJ ankylosis had been induced due to trauma when the patient was 4 years old. He had undergone TMJ surgery twice, but the operations had been unsuccessful and the TMJ ankylosis relapsed ().\nThe clinical examination revealed no systemic diseases. The patient\u2019s maximum incisal opening was 11mm. Because of the old injuries and unsuccessful operations, the mandibular deficiency had developed. The patient was experiencing sleeping disorders and mostly slept in a prone or a sitting position due to respiratory problems. The lateral and forward motions of the mandible were restricted. Based on the patient\u2019s condition and the past surgical history, a two-step treatment was performed. First, the gap arthroplasty method was applied, and afterwards, DO was performed.\nThe gap arthroplasty surgery was followed by physiotherapy. Approximately 3 to 10 days after the surgery, the patient was put on a soft diet and began the jaw-opening exercises. Three to four weeks after the surgery, a normal diet was started. After the discharge, the patient was visited once a week to evaluate the changes.\nThe osteodistractor was installed four months later (). After the installation, since the condylar stop had been removed in this case, and there was a possibility of upward and backward shift of the proximal mandibular segment, we used a custom-made device to prevent these movements.

There was no surgical indication and the patient followed a diet and continued symptomatic and steroid treatment. However, pain was not fully under control and after 4 months he developed weakness of the lower limbs (January 2008). One month later, because of worsening asthenia and short of breath associated with jugular congestion and lower limb edema, he was referred to the cardiology outpatient clinic. Transthoracic echocardiography assessment revealed a markedly increased left ventricular volumes and a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 27%. Radioisotope-left ventriculography () confirmed the reduced left ventricular function and normal myocardial perfusion scan. Coronary angiography showed the absence of angiographically significant coronary artery disease. Treatment with ACE-inhibitor (ramipril 5 mg tid), furosemide (50 mg, tid) and low dose of carvedilol (6.25 mg tid) was initiated with a prompt improvement of cardiovascular symptoms. Two months later the patients was re-hospitalized for follow-up cardiological assessments. Echocardiographic examination revealed a significant improvement of left ventricular function with an ejection fraction estimated at 43% associated with symptoms improvement.

After the initial right subcostal with midline extension incision was made, approximately 1.5 L of frank hemoperitoneum was evacuated.

He was previously a highly functional person and worked as an executive for a Fortune 500 company. His change in mental status was characterized by several behavioral changes; including cruelty toward family members and pets, promiscuity, adultery, drug abuse, wild spending habits, and lack of empathy.

It shows humeral head fractures with some very little fragments and internal rotation of the humerus.\nIn order to confirm the posterior dislocation and to discover the associated fractures and the dimension of the reverse Hill-Sachs lesion, we requested a CT scan (). It shows posterior dislocation and a damage of the cartilaginous surface of humeral head with loss of the bone that amounts between 20 and 30% of the articular surface. There are also a posterior glenoid rim fracture and a lesser tuberosity fracture.\nIn order to prevent instability and to obtain an anatomical restoration that allows early mobilization and complete range of movement, we reduced the dislocation through a deltoid-pectoral incision, we stabilized the lesser tuberosity with a cancellous bone screw, and then we filled the reverse Hill Sachs with crioconserved femoral head contoured in the right shape to reconstruct the patient's humeral head, maintaining his original bending radius. The allograft was fixed by using 2 Herbert screws (). Finally, we reduced and stabilized the posterior glenoid rim fracture with a Herbert screw, through a posterior miniapproach.\nThis treatment allowed the patient an early mobilization, and so he obtained a range of motion very similar to his previous condition.\nAt 8-month followup, there are no signs of avascular necrosis (Figures and ) and the patient is satisfied with our operation.

Recently, the patient was found to have a liver mass on screening magnetic resonance imaging. The 4 cm mass was located in segment 6 and demonstrated hyperattenuation on arterial phase and hypoattenuation on venous phase, consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma (). The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension and history of intermittent lower extremity skin lesions. previous biopsy of these skin lesions demonstrated leukocytoclastic vasculitis.\nWhen evaluated by the surgical oncology service, the patient reported a recent weight loss of 10 lbs, occasional fevers, and decreased appetite. Physical examination was unremarkable, and there were no signs of ascites, malnutrition, or hepatomegaly. Liver transaminases were mildly elevated (aspartate aminotransferase 70 U/L, alanine transaminase 89 U/L) with a normal total bilirubin (0.7 mg/dL). Platelet count was 271 \u00d7 109/L, and albumin and coagulation factors were within normal limits.\nIn preparation for surgical resection, the patient underwent a right portal vein embolization with coils in order to hypertrophy the liver remnant. The patient was discharged the following day in a stable condition. Five weeks following the right portal vein embolization the patient underwent a computed tomography scan that demonstrated significant hypertrophy of the left lobe.Subsequently, the patient underwent an uneventful right hepatectomy. The patient tolerated the procedure well and did not require blood transfusions. His postoperative course was uncomplicated, and he was discharged home on postoperative day five at which point his liver enzymes and bilirubin had returned to their preoperative baseline.

At the age of two weeks after birth an end-to-side anastomosis of the descending aorta onto the distal arch (left subclavian artery) was performed. Diagnosis of restenosis was based upon upper limb hypertension, a diastolic run-off with echo-Doppler, and an invasive systolic gradient of 36 mmHg (Fig. ). Stenting was followed by post-dilatation with a 20 mm high pressure balloon. The peak systolic gradient decreased from 15 to 0 mmHg and the diameter increased from 11 to 17 mm (Fig. ). One year later, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) suggested a more proximal position of the stent, which was confirmed with a CT scan (Figs. and ). Systolic gradients were measured during diagnostic catheterisation (Fig. ) and with angiography the position of the stent was further visualised. The case was discussed within our team and with external experts. Two treatment options were considered. One option was fixation of the stent with one or two distal stents including redilatation of the narrowed segment. The second option was surgical removal of the stent with reconstruction of the aortic arch. Although the votes were divided, surgical intervention was our preferred approach. At surgery the stenotic part of the aorta was resected and the stent removed. In the ascending aorta an unexpected ulceration due to an eroding effect of the proximal stent end was found.

The patient was clinically diagnosed to have coeliac disease and had presented with recurrent episodes of diarrhea and anemia in the past as well. On her several past visits since September 2015 to this hospital, she was found to have low hemoglobin, low albumin, low calcium, low magnesium and low potassium values. She was also tested for HIV in one of her past visits using HIV Ag/Ab combo, which turned out to be negative.\nThis time her nausea and vomiting had persisted for the previous five days. It contained mostly food particles. There was also a history of several watery, non-bloody diarrheal episodes for three days before the admission, which was associated with feverish feeling and abdominal cramps. The patient had not recorded her temperature and had not taken any medications for it. She also complained of feeling fatigued even on mild exertion. Her fever was of persistent pattern and continued throughout the day. She was received with the above mentioned complaints in the emergency room and was admitted under the medicine services.\nHer general physical examination was unremarkable except for the signs of dehydration, fever of 100 degree Fahrenheit and a nodular swelling in the right cervical region. There was also weakness in all her limbs with a power of 3/5 in all the four limbs. There was no sensory deficit or any other positive neurological signs.

The second episode occurred while the patient was on oral anticoagulant therapy. Based on abdominal and thoracic CT scan, the patient was diagnosed to have a giant cavernous hepatic haemangioma, arising from the caudate lobe. The tumour was surrounding the inferior vena cava (IVC) and occupying segment I, III, IV, V, and in part segment VIII. A CT scan showed compression of the retrohepatic IVC () with thrombosis of the left and middle suprahepatic veins. On the basis of CT-scan imaging, hepatic malignancy such as haemangiosarcoma could not be ruled out () [].\nIn order to prevent the risk of further episode of pulmonary embolism, a liver resection was considered. At laparotomy the exploration of the abdomen confirmed the presence of a huge smooth mass, violaceous in colour, occupying the left and the central segments of the liver surrounding and compressing the IVC. An extended left hepatectomy was planned. During the mobilization of the liver, a laceration of the IVC at the junction of right and the middle suprahepatic veins caused an important bleeding which was difficult to control. After Pringle's manoeuvre a running suture by a 3-0 prolene was carried out. The bleeding was controlled only in part. Soon thereafter a worsening of the venous hepatic outflow was evident as suggested by darkening of the whole liver surface. The mass became diffusely hemorrhagic and despite of hilar clamping the bleeding became soon uncontrollable. We decided to proceed to total hepatectomy and to evaluate the feasibility of ex vivo bench liver surgery. The suprahepatic and infra-hepatic IVC were cross-clamped. The hilar structures were quickly double ligated and resected. A heparinless veno-venous bypass (VVBP) was inserted from the right femoral vein and from the portal vein",

The mass was discovered four months prior to hospital admission when she had frequent episodes of abdominal pain without any other gastrointestinal symptoms. Additionally, there was no history of abdominal trauma or other symptoms that were suggestive of connective tissue disease. She had no history of oral or genital ulcers, and her medical and family history was unremarkable.\nOn physical examination, the patient appeared healthy and not in distress. Her vital signs were stable, and peripheral pulses were normal. There was a large, tender, pulsatile, epigastric mass, and the rest of the abdominal examination was unremarkable.\nHer routine blood investigations, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were within normal limits. Her connective tissue disease workup, including antinuclear antibodies, was negative. Abdominal and thoracic magnetic resonance imaging was performed, which revealed a large, epigastric, arterial aneurysm with an intramural thrombus measuring 6.3 \u00d7 6.0 cm in its maximum transverse diameters. This thrombus originated from the confluence of the celiac artery trifurcation with a nonenhancing wall, suggestive of degenerative aneurysm and excluding (in conjunction with the connective tissue workup) the possibility of Behcet's disease []. There were no other pathologies identified. Echocardiography showed normal valvular and myocardial functions. To evaluate her mesenteric circulation, a transfemoral aortography was performed with selective angiography of the mesenteric arteries, which showed a normal caliber celiac artery trunk with an aneurysm originating from its trifurcation [].

He had neither clinical symptoms nor abnormal physical findings. Routine laboratory data also showed no abnormalities. Serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 were within normal limits. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a 17-mm cystic lesion without a solid component in the pancreas head. The cystic lesion was connected to the MPD (fig. ). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed that the cystic lesion was multilocular and connected to the MPD, which was not dilated (fig. ). On endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), neither mural nodules nor wall thickness within the cystic lesion were detected (fig. ). ERCP revealed a 15-mm cystic dilation of the branch ducts without dilation of the MPD (fig. ). The cystic lesion had no features suggesting malignancy such as a cyst size of >3 cm, dilation of the MPD or an enhancing solid component within the cyst. However, cytological examination of the pancreatic juice collected during ERCP showed atypical columnar cells with loss of polarity, enlarged and hyperchromatic irregular nuclei and partially intracytoplasmic mucin (fig. ). These results suggested atypical cells with high-grade dysplasia, and the cystic lesion was diagnosed as a malignant BD-IPMN.\nPylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. Intraoperative lavage cytology of the MPD of the remnant pancreas revealed no atypical cells. Pathological examination of the resected specimen showed a multilocular cystic lesion (fig. ), 16 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 15 mm in size, composed of dilated pancreatic branch ducts lined by columnar epithelium with mostly low-grade to focally high-grade dysplasia showing micropapillary growth (fig. ).

The patient was maintained on tacrolimus 4 mg twice daily, prednisone 5 mg daily, and mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg daily. She presented four years after transplant with intermittent diarrhea for 4 months duration and significant weight loss. On presentation, her creatinine was 3.4 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.2 mg/dL on prior studies. The patient was found to have a positive stool infectious panel PCR for norovirus during an inpatient hospital evaluation. Clostridium difficile study was negative, and fecal fat content was within normal limits. Mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued due to concern that her symptoms may be a result of medication side effect. She was subsequently started on azathioprine 50 mg daily for immunosuppression. With no real improvement in symptoms, she was treated with a 3-day course of 500 mg PO nitazoxanide twice daily with modest improvement. Two months later, the patient's symptoms reoccurred, and she received a second, longer course of nitazoxanide for 3 weeks. Her symptoms resolved within a week of treatment but again relapsed over the subsequent 3 months. Stool biofire PCRs were persistently positive for norovirus when checked monthly over the following 5-month time period. Finally, she was started on a 3-week course of nitazoxanide high dose (500 mg PO every eight hours). Initially, this was difficult to tolerate due to gastrointestinal distress, and the frequency of administration was decreased to twice daily. The patient completed the three weeks of nitazoxanide with resolution of her gastrointestinal symptoms. She has been asymptomatic since the prolonged course, and repeat stool PCR for norovirus 10 days after completion of therapy is negative.\nThe last patient is a 78-year-old male who underwent renal transplant in 2014 due to ESRD as a result of severe diabetic nephropathy.

The patient reported gastrointestinal symptoms including colicky discomfort and reflux as a teenager that evolved into sharp, severe abdominal pain requiring over 20 hospitalizations for pancreatitis in the last 10 years. Hospitalizations for recurrent acute pancreatitis ranged in severity from multi-day hospitalizations for pain management, anti-emetic therapy, bowel rest, and supportive care to one- and two-day hospitalizations where symptoms severity was less intense; less severe episodes that did not require hospitalization were also increasingly common. With the initial episodes, alcohol use increased the likelihood of symptoms occurring, but complete abstinence for the last two years did not alter the likelihood of recurrence. While episodes occurred initially every 6\u201312 months, the frequency increased over recent years to approximately every 3 months. He denied episodes correlated to diet, but alcohol use did increase the frequency of pancreatitis events. Prior ultrasound and computed tomography imaging for pancreatitis ruled out gallstones or anatomical etiologies. The patient was treated with proton-pump inhibitors and avoided spicy foods and alcohol with minimal resolution of symptom severity or frequency.\nOn presentation, the patient reported intermittent right upper quadrant pain with nausea and episodes of constipation and diarrhea, but without evidence of fat malabsorption. He denied emesis, fever, or weight loss, and also denied sinus or respiratory symptoms. He had no current alcohol use. Family history included a brother with CF carrier status who suffered from recurrent acute pancreatitis.\nPhysical examination was significant for obesity (BMI = 39.4 kg/m2), mild right upper quadrant tenderness, and negative pulmonary findings.

He had had cataract surgery and laser procedure for corneal ectasia a year ago. He denied any exposure to tobacco, alcohol or any recreational drugs. He also admitted to have had weight loss of more than 20 pounds over the past 2 months and had had decreased appetite for the past 3 months.

Optometry revealed visual acuity of 20/30 and 20/150 in the left and right eyes, respectively. Slit lamp examination of the left eye confirmed ptosis with an interpalpebral distance of 3.5 mm. Other cranial nerves were intact. Motor and cerebellar examination was normal. Fundoscopy showed hypertensive changes. On neck examination, a 3 \u00d7 2 cm nontender, mobile left supraclavicular lymph node was palpable. Abdominal examination revealed splenomegaly and ascites. Initial laboratory findings were significant for mild microcytic anemia and hypercalcemia. In view of multiple cranial nerve palsies (third, fourth, fifth and sixth), he underwent MRI and magnetic resonance venogram of the brain which were normal. Magnetic resonance angiogram showed a 2-mm saccular aneurysm in the left internal carotid artery that did not explain the patient's symptoms. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed splenomegaly with splenic masses, ascites, and mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (Fig. ). He underwent endoscopic evaluation for his anemia and weight loss that revealed benign polyps in the stomach, duodenum, descending colon, and sigmoid colon.

One year and five months prior to his presentation to our hospital, he had presented to a peripheral hospital with similar symptoms and had been diagnosed with sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and smear-positive TB. He had been treated with anti-TB medications, which brought him only mild relief. Two months after completing anti-TB therapy, his cough and fevers worsened, for which a re-treatment regimen of anti-TB medications, including two months of intramuscular streptomycin, were started on the basis of clinical findings. The sputum examination for AFB had not been repeated. Four months into the course of his second course of anti-TB therapy, the patient stopped taking his medications because he reportedly experienced only mild relief of his symptoms. Repeat Ziehl-Neelsen staining performed two months prior to his admission to our institution was negative for AFB, and no more drugs were given. One week prior to his admission to our hospital, the patient developed progressively worsening shortness of breath, which was even worse while he was lying flat and was associated with dull left-sided chest pain.\nHis social history was significant for crushing stones (rock cutting) for two years, but he had no history of smoking or working in the mining industry.

There was no history of chronic cough or weight loss. She did not have any purulent vaginal discharge prior to bleeding per vagina.\nShe had a previous left cornual resection for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy five years ago in this hospital. There was also a history of having been managed for sepsis following the termination of an eight week pregnancy four months prior to presentation.\nExamination revealed that she was in painful distress and had mild pallor. Chest was clinically clear. Her pulse rate was 100 beats per minute while the blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg. Abdomen examination revealed a full, soft abdomen with tenderness in the suprapubic region, right and left iliac fossae, left renal angle and periumbilical area. Vaginal examination showed a normal lower genital tract, uterus was normal sized, anteverted, no pelvic masses were felt, pouch of Douglas was empty and there was marked cervical excitation tenderness. Differential diagnoses were those of left pyelonephritis, pelvic inflammatory disease and slow leaking ectopic pregnancy. Complete blood count and urinalysis was normal. Hemoglobin was 10.6 gm/dl. Serum beta human chorionic gonadotrophin was 3,500 mIU/mL. Screening for chlamydia and gonorrhoea were negative. Pelvic ultrasound scan revealed the presence of a left adnexal complex mass with associated free pelvic fluid and increased blood flow activity.

After 8 cycles of nivolumab, patient developed worsening headache and blurry vision of the left eye, which prompted a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain that showed a 2.5 cm enhancing, right parietal mass associated with hemorrhage and edema as well as punctuate areas of enhancement in the left frontal lobe and left cerebellar peduncle. Of note, a baseline MRI brain obtained after his initial diagnosis was negative for metastatic disease. Repeat CT CAP also showed PD with an enlarging left renal mass and worsening mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Patient was started on third-line cabozantinib 60 mg daily and received a course of dexamethasone 4 mg twice daily with referral to radiation oncology for treatment of his brain metastases. Three weeks after starting cabozantinib, a repeat MRI brain was obtained for radiation planning and showed complete resolution of the right parietal mass with now encephalomalacia of the area (). Patient also reported improvement of his headache and blurry vision. Due to resolution of the right parietal mass, radiation therapy was no longer deemed necessary and the patient remains on cabozantinib 60 mg daily.

Pain was aggravated after going up and down the stairs. On physical examination, she had localized tenderness in the lateral aspect of the patella. However, there was no evidence of a soft-tissue mass and overlying skin lesion. Further, no joint effusion was noted. She had full range of motion and the neurocirculatory status was normal. Laboratory studies indicated that all inflammatory markers were within the normal limits. Radiographic examination revealed a well-defined osteolytic lesion with a sclerotic margin in the lateral aspect of the patella, and there was no pathologic fracture or periosteal reaction (). A technechium-99m bone scan showed an increased uptake isolated to the lateral aspect of the left patella. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also conducted, which showed a partially multilobulated and septated mass in the lateral aspect of the patella. A fluid-fluid level was noted in this mass with T1-low and T2-high signal intensity. The margins of the lesion were well defined and a cortical break was not seen in the anterior and posterior cortex of the patella (). Based on the imaging studies, the preoperative diagnosis was foremost aneurysmal bone cyst or simple bone cyst.\nAt surgery, there was no abnormality in the soft tissue around the patella.

    "original_text": "A 48-year-old man presented with radiating pain to lower thoracic region for two years. A physical examination was unremarkable and he had no significant past medical history. Plain radiographs of the thoracic spine revealed a lobulated geographic osteolytic lesion with a partially sclerotic border involving the left side of the T10 vertebral body, which continued up to involve the left side of the T9 vertebral body. The T9-10 disk space was narrow, suggesting disease involvement. Also observed was a permeative osteolytic lesion involving the posterior part of the left 10th rib at the costo-vertebral junction, associated with a soft tissue mass (). The radiographic findings of the permeative osteolytic lesion and involvement of more than two bones, raised the possibility of malignancy, particularly the metastatic deposit. A CT scan revealed a well-defined osteolytic lesion with cortical expansion involving the left side of the T10, which continued up through the narrow T9-10 disk, and also involved the left side of the T9 vertebral body. The lesion caused spinal cord compression and involved almost the entire T10 vertebral body, mainly the posterior portion, along with the posterior part of the left 10th rib adjacent to the costo-vertebral junction. The lesion contained multiple internal trabeculations as well as multiple scattered tiny calcifications. The soft tissue component also formed an extrapleural mass posterior to the thoracic aorta (). In this clinical setting, either infectious process, especially tuberculosis which is rather common in Thailand or metastatic deposits was suspected. As a result, tests were performed to identify primary cancer. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed a normal sized liver without evidence of a mass or intrahepatic ductal dilatation. No remarkable finding was revealed after examining the pancreas, spleen, and both kidneys. The patient's PSA level was within normal limits (1.31 ng/L) and a transurethral prostatectomy specimen revealed benign prostatic hyperplasia.
