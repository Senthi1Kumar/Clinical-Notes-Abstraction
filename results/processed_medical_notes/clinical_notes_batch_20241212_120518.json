His concomitant diseases were coronary heart disease, arterial hypertension and diabetes. There was a giant right inguinal hernia and contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated omentum and a large mesenteric tissue with intestine segments in hernia sacs that displaced the penis laterally (Figure , ). His laboratory findings were normal.\nWe decided that reduction of hernia sac contents could cause an increase in intraabdominal pressure postoperatively, so the patient was prepared for hernia repair with PPP after providing informed consent. A silicone Foley catheter was inserted into the abdominal cavity and insufflated as described in the first patient. The first pneumoperitoneum was applied in the operating room and then at the bedside (the insufflator was moved to the clinic from the operating room). Daily insufflated gas volume, intraabdominal pressure and expansion of waist circumference at the level of umbilicus was recorded (). The waist circumference at the level of the umbilicus increased to 11 cm on the fourth day. With the experience of the first patient, we decided that expansion was enough for operation and the patient was operated on on the fifth day. A standard inguinal incision was preferred under general anesthesia. Small bowel segments, appendix vermiformis, cecum, and 300 cc of free fluid were in the hernia sac. The hernia contents were pushed into the abdominal cavity easily and a zig maneuver performed after prophylactic appendectomy. The peritoneum was closed and a 7\u00d715 cm polypropylene mesh was inserted and fixed to the symphysis pubis, inguinal ligament and conjoint tendon. A suction drain was placed on the mesh and in the scrotum. An abdominal silicone Foley catheter was taken out. The scrotum was elevated postoperatively.

Difficulty climbing stairs and occasional foot drop had been present for approximately 3 years prior to presentation. He was also found to have Pseudomonas pneumonia, chronic sinusitis, and a small scrotal abscess. Since 1995 he had spent an extensive period in an Aboriginal community in the Great Sandy Desert and was in contact for a total of 4 to 5 years with them.

After surgery, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy according to the FOLFOX-6 regimen for a total of 12 cycles. Nearly 4 h after the end of the last oxaliplatin infusion, she experienced pharyngolaryngeal spasm associated with moderate dyspnoea, which resolved after IV steroid infusion. A CT scan performed at the end of adjuvant chemotherapy showed disease recurrence; in fact a single small lump in the inferior lobe of the right lung was documented. Referred to the thoracic surgeon, in March 2010 the patient underwent radical wedge resection; the pathology report confirmed that the lesion was related to the primary colic carcinoma. The patient was followed up for 6 years with no evidence of recurrent disease, until a month ago when she developed a persistent cough. We performed a thorax-abdomen CT scan with contrast, which showed metastatic disease to the mediastinum, lungs, adrenal glands, and liver. The case of this young lady was discussed extensively within our multidisciplinary tumor board: since the disease relapse shown in 2010 had occurred during the adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and, most importantly, at the end of that, she probably had developed an adverse event which could be interpreted as hypersensitive reaction or neuropathic toxicity. Therefore, we decided to start first-line chemotherapy with 5FU and irinotecan according to the FOLFIRI regimen, and molecular analysis of pan-RAS was performed. During the first cycle, about 45 min after the start of CPT-11, the patient developed dysarthria. Irinotecan infusion was promptly stopped, and a bolus of 1 g hydrocortisone sodium succinate IV and 1 mg of subcutaneous atropine were given. Dysarthria regressed completely in about half an hour. Similarly to the aforementioned cases, no other signs were noted at clinical examination. The patient was hospitalized for administration of the second cycle, and the infusion rate of irinotecan was doubled to 180 min",

Four months prior to clinic presentation, she underwent right breast lumpectomy and lymph node dissection. Surgical pathology revealed invasive mammary carcinoma, SBR grade 2 with no involvement of the lymph nodes. Resection margins were negative. She was Her-2-neu negative, estrogen receptor negative, and progesterone receptor positive. A bone scan revealed increased uptake at the eighth thoracic vertebra and in the region of the coracoid in the right shoulder.

Of worthy mention, the patient has multiple comorbidities including: morbid obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and vitamin D deficiency. Her Vitamin D level was 15 ng/mol. Pertinent review of medications includes: Ergocalciferol 50,000 units and Alendronate 70 mg.

He had complained of pain around the second and third metatarsal heads and numbness in the second and third lesser toes five to six years ago, which was accentuated by ambulation and shoes with a tight toe box. He had received conservative treatment including intermittent local analgesic injection a few years ago from other physicians and was referred to our hospital due to the gradual worsening of symptoms, which were unresponsive to conservative treatment.\nWhen he presented at our hospital, he could not walk for more than 10 minutes at a time because of pain accentuated by ambulation. The static observation of the feet in the standing position showed hammertoe deformities of the second and third toes, which did not touch the ground. Clinical examination revealed tenderness to palpation in the second and third MTP joints and the second intermetatarsal space. The foot squeeze test examining Mulder's sign elicited a severe radiating pain but not the click []. The drawer test was positive in both the second and third MTP joints showing more than 50% subluxation and producing intolerable radiating pain in the second and third toes. Radiographs of the feet showed no apparent deviation of the toes but demonstrated a slight opening of the joint space at the second MTP joint. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans in the coronal plane showed an upside-down bulbous-shaped neuroma with low-signal intensity between the second and third metatarsal heads ().

The patient had no history of cancer or other diseases, and had no family member who had been diagnosed with cancer. The patient was a non-smoker and was only a social drinker. In a physical examination, no abnormality other than a wound from the excisional biopsy was found in the left axilla, and no mass or suspicious skin change was detected on the breast. A review of the results of the histopathological examination performed at another hospital revealed a sign of adenocarcinoma, and the immunohistochemistry showed the following signs: TTF-1 (-), CK20 (-), and CEA (+). In the mammography, breast US, and breast MRI exams, no suspicious lesions on the breast or signs of lymphadenopathy on the axilla were observed. In addition, there was no evidence of accessory breast or ectopic breast on the axilla. The PET, chest CT, abdominal CT, and EGD exams, which were performed to determine the origin of the carcinoma, did not reveal any malignant lesion. In the right thyroid lobe, the thyroid US revealed a 0.5 cm-big hypoechoic nodular lesion that was suspected to have been malignant, but the fine needle aspiration cytology confirmed that the lesion was not malignant. In addition, all the tumor markers, such as serum CEA, PSA, CA 19-9, CA 15-3, and calcitonin, were within normal ranges.

In her medical history there was no record of use of an IUD, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal surgery, intrauterine device, or previous ectopic pregnancy. Laboratory evaluation showed quantitative hCG of 3129.94 IU/L and hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL. TVS examination demonstrated no evidence of intrauterine pregnancy, a normal bilateral adnexa and a large amount of free fluid in the abdomen. Considering the above factors, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed. A 90-mm-long mixed hypodense mass was evident on the upper surface of the right liver lobe. She was diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy implanted in the liver and advised to transfer the patient to tertiary referral center. The patient traveled to our hospital and presented to the emergency room with increasing abdominal pain and weakness. On examination, her pulse was 109beats/minute and blood pressure was 90/50 mmHg. Diagnostic abdominocentesis was performed and found blood uncoagulable. Given the concern for ruptured abdominal pregnancy and hemorrhagic shock, she was taken laparoscopic surgery immediately. The laparoscopy revealed a significant hemoperitoneum (of approximately 1500 ml of blood). The uterus and ovaries appeared normal, with a corpus luteum cyst in 50 mm on the left ovary. There was no evidence of bleeding from the pelvic organs while a mount of free blood appearred aroundding perihepatic and spleen.

The patient had a history of lower abdominal pain for last two weeks. He visited his primary care physician and underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis which showed hypertrophy of the prostate and bilateral hydronephrosis. The patient had progression of symptoms leading to hospitalization. On arrival to the hospital, the patient was hemodynamically stable but quickly decompensated. Vitals showed a blood pressure of 88/55 mmHg, heart rate of 143 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and temperature of 96.3\u00b0F. Initial pertinent laboratory findings included acute kidney injury with serum creatinine of 12 mg/dL (from a baseline of 1.2 mg/dL) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 161 mg/dL. Labs demonstrated an anion gap metabolic acidosis secondary to lactic acidosis. Urinalysis showed evidence of infection, and blood and urine samples sent for cultures. Physical exam at arrival was significant for a minor distress, diaphoresis, enlarged and tender prostate, abdominal distension without tenderness to palpation, guarding, rebound tenderness, or abnormal dermatological findings.

He had hypertension and coronary artery stenting. He was under treatment with aspirin and metoprolol.\nIn 2005, he had presented with generalized itching and a skin lesion on his left leg, which was non-significant on biopsy and resolved without any special treatment. He was totally asymptomatic until 2012, when he was admitted at a private clinic hospital in Tehran, for intermittent right flank pain without urinary symptoms.\nUltrasonography revealed cysts in the kidneys. Four cysts with the largest diameter of < 3 cm and one cyst of 36*49 mm size with multiple septa in right kidney were visualizied. There were four cortical cysts in the left kidney with a maximum diameter of 28 mm. The patient had been discharged with the wrong diagnosis of bilateral simple cysts and was advised for continuation of follow-up.\nAfter 3 years, the patient presented at our hospital for the first time with acute-onset severe right flank pain radiating to groin which lasted for 6 h. He also complained of nausea, vomiting, hematuria and passage of small, white, balloon-like, and grape-size structures in urine. Laboratory findings were listed in Table .\nThe kidneys were examined by ultrasonography and there were some cortical cysts in the left kidney with a maximal diameter of 33 mm and fine calcified septa in one cyst. There was also a solid mass containing small cystic regions with the size of 60*74 mm in lower pole of right kidney with external extension and no vascular flow on color Doppler ultrasonography.

No family history of ophthalmic disorders. At the examination, she had visual acuity of 1.0 OU, normal intraocular pressure, and fundoscopy. Biomicroscopy showed intense fibrosis in the perilimbar nasal conjunctival region. In the motility, she had left esotropia of 25PD with \u2212 5 left lateral rectus restriction. Right eye ductions were normal. Passive forced duction test demonstrated a marked limitation of abduction in the left eye without further alterations.

The patient was apparently normal before this. He could not recall any recent trauma, pain, or discharge from the swelling or an increase in size of the lesion. His medical history was non-significant, and he was not on any medication at that time. Prior to this visit, the patient had not received dental care for more than 10 years.\nDuring intraoral examination, a smooth round pink colored nodule approximately 5 mm in diameter was noted. It was located on the attached gingiva in relation to the upper left canine and first premolar extending superiorly up to the mucogingival junction []. The nodule was non tender, soft, and cystic in consistency, fluctuant and non compressible. Probing of the adjacent teeth yielded pocket depths of 2-3 mm with all sites exhibiting bleeding on probing, without any communication between the sulci of the adjacent teeth and the lesion. Pulp testing of the canine and first premolar indicated that both were vital. Radiographically, there was no finding suggestive of osseous involvement []. Based on the clinical and radiographic findings, the provisional diagnosis of cystic lesion of the gingiva was made. The differential diagnosis included a lateral periodontal cyst, peripheral fibroma, parulis, and odontogenic keratocyst. Lateral periodontal cyst was ruled out because there was no radiographical finding suggesting of osseous involvement, peripheral fibroma was ruled since the lesion was soft and cystic consistency, parulis was ruled out since the lesion was not associated with periodontal pocket or pus discharge on probing and odontogenic keratocyst was ruled out since the lesion was not associated with pain or localized expansion of bone, and radiographically there was no osseous involvement.",

    "original_text": "A 26-year-old woman admitted herself for urological consultation to our hospital. She described a recent history of gross haematuria as well as having recognized a prolapsing vaginal mass. After our first examination we presumed the vaginal mass to be a thrombosed urethral caruncle. The initial sonographic evaluation of both kidneys revealed no pelvic dilatation. While the first try of carefully repositioning our clinical findings () was unsuccessful, we decided to admit the patient to the operating theatre in order to do further examinations and explorations under anesthesia.

He was administered an immunosuppressive regimen comprising methylprednisolone, cyclosporine, everolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil, and he was discharged 10 days after the transplantation with a serum creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. At regular follow-up over the next 6 months, his serum creatinine levels remained within the normal range.\nOver the following 9 years, the recipient showed no episodes of rejection, and his serum creatinine levels and creatinine clearance rates were within the normal ranges (Fig. ). In 2010, he underwent coronary percutaneous angioplasty and stent placement for coronary artery disease, and thereafter he regularly took aspirin. However, in June 2014, he suffered a right cerebral aneurysm rupture that resulted in brain death. At that time, his serum creatinine level was 0.94 mg/dL and the creatinine clearance rate was 90 mL/min.

He denied radicular pains in upper or lower limbs, or preceding neurological difficulties. He was otherwise systemically well.

Imaging of the brain was comparatively unremarkable.\nGiven the massive root hypertrophy, an initial diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) was entertained.

Computed tomography (CT) revealed a right chronic subdural hematoma with mass effect on brain parenchyma and mild shift of the midline structures (). Consequently, we proceeded with the surgical evacuation of the right subdural hematoma via a single parietal burr-hole craniectomy. At the end of the operation, a subdural drainage tube was positioned, open to gravity. A few hours after the procedure the patient developed intense headache and mental confusion, without neurological focal deficits. Arterial blood pressure was 150/90 mm Hg. A large amount of recent reddish blood was found in the drainage system, which contained 650 mL of fluid. We decided to immediately close the drainage and perform a CT scan. This revealed a diffuse SAH localized in the basal cisterns, bilaterally in the sylvian fissures, and over the cerebral surface (). No residual fluid collection, acute bleeding or severe pneumocephalus were found in the cavity of the hematoma. CT-angiography and cerebral angiography excluded the presence of cerebral aneurysms and AVM. The drainage system was kept closed for the next two days. The patient was left in supine position and the fluid intake was increased to 1.5 L per day. Headache was successfully treated with analgesics. After two days, a CT scan showed normal brain expansion and the re-absorption of subarachnoid blood without further complications. Therefore the drainage tube was removed. The patient's conditions gradually improved, the headache decreased and after five days he was discharged without neurological deficits. The one-month follow-up showed that the patient was in good conditions. Accordingly, he returned to his work and leisure activities. Head CT was normal.",

He developed right eye socket contracture and right orbito-zygomatic and maxillary bone atrophy, and eye prosthesis insertion was impossible due to a shallow and contracted orbit. He underwent multiple surgical procedures at different hospitals to correct his shallow fornix, including right lower eyelid reconstruction at the age of 5 years with a skin graft and mucosal grafting. At the age of 8 years, he had a tissue expander inserted, with socket deepening and prosthesis insertion after orbital augmentation with rib cartilage. Nonetheless, the eye prosthesis failed to remain in place. He was then referred to our center at 26 years of age, after a long treatment gap with severe contracture of the socket. We reconstructed the depressed and atrophied right supraorbital ridge and right infraorbital region with a calvarial bone graft. A year later, the right inferior orbital rim was further augmented with a rib graft. The right eye socket was deepened and lined with a full-thickness skin graft 1 year later, and a conformer was inserted. Even with multiple operations, he kept having issues with the prosthesis, which continued to fall out. Finally, the upper eyelid contracture was corrected with a temporal forehead (Fricke) flap, expanding the inner upper eyelid lining, and a superiorly-based FAMM flap was used to treat the lower eyelid entropion and contracture.

Peak contrast enhancement in a part of the tumor was seen in the delayed phase. The mass seemed to arise from the adrenal gland or kidney, and there were no metastatic lesions (Fig. ). An MRI study of the mass showed a low signal in T1WI and a high signal in T2WI. As a result of the CT, we made additional endocrinological studies, and the results revealed normal outcomes for serum aldosterone, metanephrine, and normetanephrine and also for 24-h urinary catecholamines and metanephrines.

She had leucocytosis; the other blood analyses were normal. She had hysterectomy operation with Pfannenstiel incision four years ago and has been occasionally having abdominal pain after the operation.

Additionally, she endorsed headache, nausea, and vomiting during the 24 hours prior to admission. She had no fever, vaginal bleeding, leakage of fluid, diarrhea, or constipation. She endorsed good fetal movement. Her prenatal course had been uncomplicated. She endorsed a history of a urinary tract infection two years prior to her current pregnancy and a remote history of urolithiasis which was managed conservatively. On physical examination she had mild left flank tenderness but no abdominal or suprapubic tenderness. There were no peritoneal signs. Her vital signs including blood pressure were within normal limits. A urine dipstick showed moderate leukocyte esterase, 6\u201310 squamous cells per high power field, no blood, and no nitrites. Urine culture later documented no bacterial growth. Her white blood cell count was 12,900. Creatinine was normal. Fetal fibronectin was negative. Laboratory findings indicated normal liver and biliary function. The cardiotocogram showed rare contractions approximately every 30 minutes and a reactive fetal heart tracing. While in the labor and delivery triage area, the patient experienced an increase in the frequency of her contractions to every 5\u201310 minutes and underwent cervical change to greater than one centimeter in dilation, so she was admitted for management of preterm labor. Betamethasone was administered to expedite fetal lung maturity. Although this patient was beyond 32 weeks of gestation, magnesium sulfate was administered for fetal neuroprotection to decrease risk of cerebral palsy as well as for the added benefit of tocolysis.\nThe patient's contractions subsequently resolved while receiving magnesium, she experienced no further cervical change, and the previously reported flank pain had improved.

On ocular examination, he denied perception of light in both eyes; the pupils were mid-dilated and nonreactive. Anterior segment findings were unremarkable and intraocular pressures in both eyes were normal. On dilated fundus examination, the optic discs were pale; no optic disc edema was noted; the macula and peripheral retina were normal in both eyes [, ]. Systemically, he suffered from chronic alcoholism and family members mentioned that they observed a heightened state of anxiety and restlessness for many days before the vision loss. They presumed that this was because he was unable to procure and consume alcohol due to the nationwide lockdown. On questioning, the patient disclosed that 1 day before the vision loss, he had ingested one small bottle of locally procured ABHR (approximately 60 mL). The following morning, the patient noticed the decrease in vision which rapidly progressed to complete loss of perception of light within 24 h.\nOptical coherence tomography of the optic disc showed thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer in both eyes. Visual evoked potentials (VEP) were nearly extinguished in both eyes. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit brain done immediately following vision loss showed multiple white matter hyperintensities lesions on T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery mainly in the frontoparietal region. Bilateral cerebellar abnormalities with areas of restricted diffusion with no significant enhancement postcontrast were also noted, which presented a picture, consistent with toxic encephalopathy. The ABHR bottle was inspected and found to have no labeling indicating its constituents or any toxicological warnings. Basic hematological investigations and serum Vitamin B12 level were normal.

    "cleaned_text": "a 56-year-old-male presented with a 20-day-old history of sudden, painless loss of vision in both eyes. there was no history of trauma or recent surgery. on ocular examination, he denied perception of light in both eyes; the pupils were mid-dilated and nonreactive. anterior segment findings were unremarkable and intraocular pressures in both eyes were normal. on dilated fundus examination, the optic discs were pale; no optic disc edema was noted; the macula and peripheral retina were normal in both eyes [, ]. systemically, he suffered from chronic alcoholism and family members mentioned that they observed a heightened state of anxiety and restlessness for many days before the vision loss. they presumed that this was because he was unable to procure and consume alcohol due to the nationwide lockdown. on questioning, the patient disclosed that 1 day before the vision loss, he had ingested one small bottle of locally procured abhr (approximately 60 ml). the following morning, the patient noticed the decrease in vision which rapidly progressed to complete loss of perception of light within 24 h.\noptical coherence tomography of the optic disc showed thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer in both eyes. visual evoked potentials (vep) were nearly extinguished in both eyes. magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit brain done immediately following vision loss showed multiple white matter hyperintensities lesions on t2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery mainly in the frontoparietal region. bilateral cerebellar abnormalities with areas of restricted diffusion with no significant enhancement postcontrast were also noted, which presented a picture, consistent with toxic encephalopathy. the abhr bottle was inspected and found to have no labeling indicating its constituents or any toxicological warnings. basic hematological investigations and serum vitamin b12 level were normal. based on the clinical picture, radiological findings, and abnormal vep, a diagnosis of methanol toxicity leading to bilateral optic atrophy was made. the patient was referred to the neuropsychiatric division for counseling and",

His past medical history included coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, a metallic mitral valve, a prior ischaemic stroke, hypertension and a previous provoked deep vein thrombosis. He was otherwise a functionally independent, relatively young man with an incidental but high-risk aneurysm that required treatment. Anatomically, his left vertebral artery terminated in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and did not communicate with the aneurysm. The right vertebral artery was occluded at its origin and reconstituted via collaterals from the right thyrocervical trunk at the V3 segment. Attributable to significant tortuosity of this vessel, the initial attempt at stenting the aneurysm was unsuccessful.\nTo allow endovascular access to the aneurysm, the patient underwent a right CCVAB. The procedure was performed under general anaesthetic with nasotracheal intubation. The mid portion of the right common carotid artery (CCA) was exposed in the neck above the omohyoid muscle via a longitudinal incision anterior to the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid.

The long saphenous vein was harvested from the left thigh, reversed and after systemic heparinization, anastomosed in an end to side fashion to the CCA and to the vertebral artery. A contrast enhanced computed tomography scan confirmed patency of the graft on the Day 1 post procedure ().

She had no significant medical history and no significant family history, including of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. She did not smoke or drink alcohol. She had no symptoms, and physical examination revealed no abnormal findings.\nAbdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a multilocular cystic lesion measuring 10 mm at the pancreatic body, the wall of which had no solid component, enhanced with contrast media. Magnetic resonance pancreatography (MRP) showed stenosis of the main pancreatic duct at the pancreatic body and dilatation of the distal side of the main pancreatic duct (Fig. ). Furthermore, communication between the cystic lesion and the main pancreatic duct was suspected based on the MRP findings. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) showed stenosis of the main pancreatic duct at the pancreatic body and dilatation of the distal side of the main or branch pancreatic ducts (Fig. 1). The stenosis of the main pancreatic duct was distant from the cystic lesion. ERP could not prove a communication between the main pancreatic duct and the cystic lesion. Endoscopic ultrasonography showed a multilocular cystic lesion with septal structures at the pancreatic body, whereas an intramural nodule or mass shadow was not found (Fig. 1). Consequently, distal pancreatectomy was performed under the preoperative diagnosis of IPMN with invasion.\nMacroscopically, there were multiple cystic lesions measuring 10 mm in diameter in the pancreatic body.
