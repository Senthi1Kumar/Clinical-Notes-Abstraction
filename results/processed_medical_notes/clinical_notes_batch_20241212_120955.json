The preoperative evaluation was consistent with DM, hypothyroidism, hypertension, coronary artery disease treated with CABG, and coronary stent placement. ECG showed left atrial enlargement and possible lateral wall ischemia. Transthoracic echocardiography showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with EF+60%. E/E\u2019>20 cm/sec was indicative of elevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure. Right ventricular systolic pressure was elevated at 70-80 mmHg. Electrolytes were normal before surgery.\nBecause of preoperative cardiac histories and findings, regional anesthesia with monitoring and sedation during surgery was selected as the preferred anesthesia technique. Regional anesthesia team selected supraclavicular block considering the site of the surgery, which was high medial part of the arm, somehow near the axillary area. Block was placed in the preoperative holding area at the bedside and the patient was transferred to the operating room. Monitoring and sedation with Propofol 50-75 mic/kg/min were started. She also received 100 mics of fentanyl in two incremental doses. Patient\u2019s hypertension was corrected after starting sedation. Other vital signs were stable, and she was comfortable and communicative for the most part of the surgery.\nSurgery was finished after one hour and the patient was verbally communicative with anesthesia provider. While monitoring was unhooked, and she was ready for transferring on the recovery bed, she reported an electrical feeling in the whole body and became unresponsive. The patient was coded, and chest compression was established simultaneously with mask ventilation. The first ECG rhythm after establishing the monitors again was sinus but since she was unconscious, reanimation and resuscitation were continued with endotracheal tube intubation, IV fluid administration, and norepinephrine infusion. The patient was transferred to ICU to continue the supportive measures.",

Venous blood test showed no abnormalities in ESR, CRP, and blood routine. Radiograph and MRI suggested hyperplasia of synovial tissue in the articular cavity and epiphyseal injury of the distal tibia.

We initially planned to perform articular cavity debridement; however, when we conducted the surgery, we saw obvious hyperplasia of synovial tissue and the cartilage was obviously damaged; TB was highly suspected. Considering that the patient was still a child, ankle arthrodesis was not suitable in this case. Therefore, we only performed articular cavity debridement after obtaining the tissue sample for biopsy. Pathological examination confirmed ankle TB, and the result was also positive for TB-PCR.

She was taken to the operating room for laparoscopic small bowel resection.\nDuring laparoscopy, bleeding from the deep inferior epigastric vessels necessitated conversion to laparotomy. The small bowel was then run and a large gallstone was found to be obstructing the distal jejunum. We also identified a MD impacted with two smaller stones. A longitudinal incision was made in the jejunum to remove the stone and perform an enterolithotomy. However due to significant edema and inability to milk the stone distally, a small bowel resection was performed.\nOnce this was complete, we turned our attention to the MD and performed a small bowel resection to include the MD with approximately 5 cm of adjacent small bowel. This resection was performed in lieu of a diverticulectomy due to concern about narrowing",

She had no associated nipple discharge or other constitutional symptoms. Physical examination revealed a 3 cm, non-mobile mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. It was non-tender and the overlying skin was normal. There was no axillary lymphadenopathy. Prior to this presentation, the patient first presented to a private medical center with bilateral breast lumps in 2002.

    "original_text": "An afebrile 39-year-old man was admitted to the University Hospital of Zurich due to a pacemaker pocket infection. This first pacemaker was implanted 22 years ago because of cardiac arrhythmia. A new pacemaker was then implanted on the contralateral side 14 years later because of lead dysfunction of the first pacemaker. The leads of the first inactive pacemaker were left in situ since they could not be removed without causing damage and thus were cut and capped. The batteries were replaced twice, 8 and 2 years prior to the infection.\nUpon admission, the pocket of the inactive first pacemaker was debrided, and the electrodes were trimmed as they could not be completely removed without open-heart surgery. Intraoperatively, turbid fluid was found and sent for microbiological analysis. S. epidermidis grew in multiple tissue samples, and, accordingly, the empirical antibiotic treatment amoxicillin/clavulanate was changed to intravenous vancomycin and rifampicin (Fig. ). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed a methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis, only resistant to ampicillin and erythromycin. Therefore, vancomycin treatment was switched to flucloxacillin and rifampicin treatment was continued.

    "original_text": "A 37-year-old Japanese primipara woman presented to our hospital at 11 weeks gestation, returning to her parents\u2019 house to give birth. The woman had adenomyosis resulting in sterility and hoped to become pregnant. She had previously undergone adenomyomectomy and right chocolate cystectomy to improve her fertility at her previous medical institution. At that time, her surgeons had opened the uterine cavity from the anterior surface of the uterus and had excised the lesion, including the serosa existing on the posterior wall of the uterus, using an electric knife. Subsequently, pregnancy was established using ART (intracytoplasmic sperm injection and frozen embryo transfers).\nAt 29 weeks, although she had no symptoms, she was admitted to our hospital due to the risk of preterm birth owing to a shortened cervical length. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 30 weeks showed no evidence of placenta previa, and the placenta was mainly located on the left fallopian tube angle and partially on the posterior wall (). Because of the location of placentation, the uterine wall was extruded toward the left fallopian tube (). MRI also showed loss of continuity of the uterine wall, suggesting the presence of unexpected PAS ().\nEmergency cesarean section was performed at 34 weeks because of PROM. During laparotomy, we found that the Douglas fossa was completely closed via a strict adhesion between the uterine surface, both right and left ovaries, sigmoid intestine, and small intestine ().

    "original_text": "A 93-year-old woman, with no history of cardiac disease or venous thrombosis, presented with left neck femur fracture. She was scheduled for cemented femoral head hemiarthroplasty. Pre-operative evaluation showed that she was generally well, with no signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) such as tenderness or swelling of the legs. The D-dimer was slightly raised at 5.43 \u03bcg/ml, but ultrasound examination of the lower limbs was not performed. After arrival at the operating room, she was monitored with electrocardiography, non-invasive blood pressure, and pulse oximetry. An arterial line was inserted in the radial artery. General anesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl, and rocuronium and maintained with desflurane and remifentanil, and she was intubated without complication. She was placed in the right lateral decubitus position. She remained stable until the prosthesis was inserted and cemented when she suddenly developed hypotension. PEA was diagnosed by the absence of carotid pulse and sinus rhythm on the electrocardiogram. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated, and three doses of 1 mg epinephrine were administered. Spontaneous circulation returned after 8 min. A TEE probe was inserted during CPR to evaluate the cause of PEA. TEE detected a huge mobile mass filling the main pulmonary artery and its branches causing obstruction from the inferior vena cava to the right atrium. A video recording of this mass can be seen on Video 1. Sixty minutes later, the mass had completely disappeared (Video 1). Postoperatively, she remained sedated and intubated and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Continuous intravenous infusion of 0.1 \u03bcg/kg/min norepinephrine was required for 12 h to correct persistent hypotension. She was extubated 36 h after surgery and remained 4 days in the ICU.

The patient was reported to have decompensated on account of nonadherence with his home medications resulting in frequent hospitalizations and poor functioning. As per the patient's admission records, the patient's initial labs and urine toxicology were within normal limits. The patient had been on various antipsychotics since his diagnosis with schizophrenia at the age of 19, including haloperidol, olanzapine, and risperidone, but he continued to decompensate despite adequate medication trials. The decision was made to start the patient on clozapine due to possible failure of these previous antipsychotics. Clozapine was started at 25 mg PO twice daily and titrated up to 150 mg PO twice daily over the next 12 days. His current daily dose was 300 mg when he was transferred to the telemetry unit following a sudden development of fever and tachycardia on the psychiatric inpatient floor.\nOn the medical inpatient unit, the patient was mostly selectively mute and did not appear to be in any pain, was not vomiting, and had no diarrhea and no reported loss of consciousness or seizures. His admission vitals were a temperature of 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit, BP of 115/81 mmHg, HR of 114 beats per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Physical examination did not reveal any significant findings other than a mild dehydration, no skin rash, no jugular venous distension, basal crepitation or pedal edema.

    "original_text": "A 15-year-old female presented with complaints of pain in the right lower limb and back for 1 month. Ultrasound revealed a retroperitoneal mass adjacent to the lower pole of the right kidney. CT scan revealed a large heterogeneous lobulated mass with intralesional cystic areas of necrosis and heterogeneous postcontrast enhancement in the retroperitoneum measuring 11 \u00d7 5.5 \u00d7 6 cm in size on the right side at the level of mid and lower pole of the kidney. There was no evidence of calcification in the lesion. The mass had extraneous indentation of the inferomedial cortex of the right kidney. The mass displaced the right renal vein anteriorly and the right proximal ureter anterolaterally with compression of the inferior vena cava anteromedially. Medially, the mass was seen to be infiltrating the psoas muscle and abutting the right lateral cortical margin of the L4 vertebra. The right adrenal gland was seen separately and appeared normal (). 3D reconstruction of the imaging was done to assess the relation of the mass with the surrounding structures.\nSerum cortisol and serum and urine normetanephrines were normal, ruling out a functional tumor. The patient underwent USG-guided core needle biopsy which revealed retroperitoneal ganglioneuroma as presence of mature ganglion cells in a Schwannian stroma with no evidence of mitosis/necrosis.\nThe patient underwent exploratory laparotomy through anterior subcostal incision. The mass was found to be displacing the right kidney and proximal ureter laterally with anterior displacement of right renal vein.

This patient was referred by her general practitioner on the urgent head and neck cancer referral pathway.\nThe patient's primary concern was the sudden onset of a large upper lip swelling with associated pain. The patient was not forthcoming and defensive when questioned regarding precipitating factors or possible trauma to the region. She was medically fit and healthy with no risk factors for oral cancer, such as smoking and alcohol consumption [].\nOn extraoral examination, the patient appeared to be well with no clinical signs of systemic illness. In general, the upper lip was disproportionately enlarged with an incompetent lip seal (). On close examination, a 2 cm \u00d7 1 cm firm, erythematous, swelling was noted in the upper right lip. The lesion was not encroaching on the midline and there was no associated cranial nerve deficit or lymphadenopathy. At the vermillion border, there was a puncture wound on a background of traumatised tissue adjacent to the firm swelling (). The lesion was painful on palpation with no suppuration, induration, or ulceration noted. Intraoral examination revealed a concurrent firm swelling within the labial sulcus. Dental health was unremarkable, and there were no signs of systemic infection.\nUpon revision of the patient's electronic health-care record, it was noted that the patient had attended the Accident and Emergency Department at the Homerton University Hospital four weeks prior. The clinical clerking from this visit showed the main complaint to be swelling of the upper lip following self-injection of a dermal filler, purchased over the internet.

She had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. Following an abnormal stress test, an elective cardiac catheterization demonstrated minimal coronary artery disease (30% stenosis of proximal right coronary artery and 20% stenosis of left anterior descending coronary artery). The right femoral artery site was closed with a 6-French Angio-Seal device. After monitoring for an hour, she was started on metoprolol for her coronary artery disease. She was deemed ready for discharge; but, upon standing, she became weak, dizzy, and nauseated. She was found to have a blood pressure of 90/40 mmHg and a pulse of 50. Her blood pressure improved to 130/70 mmHg upon laying her flat in bed.\nOrthostatic hypotension with symptomatic bradycardia was considered likely due to the beta blocker that was started after cardiac catheterization which was eventually discontinued. She was given a bolus of intravenous fluids and her discharge was held. Several hours later, she noticed that her right leg was cold and numb. Her blood pressure and heart rate have been within range during this time. The right dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were absent; she underwent an arteriogram, which revealed an abrupt cutoff of the right popliteal artery below the knee (). Operative exploration of the popliteal artery was undertaken. A Fogarty embolectomy removed the thrombus and the maldeployed Angio-Seal closure device (in its native form) from within the arterial lumen restoring normal flow (with good back bleeding) to the arterial system. Palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were noted thereafter. She was placed on full dose heparin and the wounds were closed. Several hours later, her pulses were again absent and she was emergently returned to surgery where she was found to have arterial compression from a hematoma in the popliteal fossa due to an anastomotic embarrassment of the popliteal artery suture line.",

He was found on the floor next to a collided vehicle with no other passengers. He was unresponsive, with weak respiratory efforts but a palpable pulse. The patient was transported to a nearby emergency department (ED) and upon arrival in the ambulance bay, the patient's respiratory efforts ceased and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated by the EMS crew. In the ED, with obvious signs of a traumatic chest injury and a deformed chest wall with multiple superficial lacerations, he underwent placement of bilateral chest tube thoracostomies after bilateral finger decompression of the chest cavities. His bedside echocardiogram demonstrated a cardiac standstill with no pericardial effusion corresponding to an initial rhythm of asystole on the electrocardiographic monitor. The patient was continued on the standard ACLS protocol while the airway was secured and intravenous access was established. At 10 minutes after presentation, an emergency thoracotomy was performed in the left lateral aspect of the chest (Figure ). The thoracotomy did not demonstrate significant intrathoracic bleeding within the chest cavity, nor any obvious lung injuries. There were, however, multiple rib fractures with fragments within the thoracic cavity. The heart was delivered from the pericardium with no surrounding effusion, a longitudinal nonpenetrating heart laceration was observed over the left ventricle (Figure ). The ventricles appeared to be fluctuating on palpation and the cardiac monitor demonstrated fine ventricular fibrillation (VFIB). Manual \u200b\u200bcardiac massage was initiated, and the patient received conventional chest wall unsynchronized cardioversion due to lack of intracardiac pedals and open chest wall, and ACLS was continued with the addition of two doses of intracardiac epinephrine, and a clamp was applied to the descending thoracic aorta. During the resuscitation period, the patient had received a normal saline bolus through intraosseous access, as well as one liter of un-crossmatched blood through a central femoral line.",

One month earlier, he was hospitalized in our department and underwent omental patch repair for gastric ulcer perforation. Emergent contrast-enhanced CT revealed a retroperitoneal hematoma in the pancreatic head (Figure A), aneurysm formation in the PDA (Figure B), and extraluminal compression to the celiac trunk (Figure C,D). Extravasation was also detected around the aneurysm in the PDA (Figure A), but no liquid was retained in the peritoneal cavity. Emergent IVR for hemostasis was performed for retroperitoneal hemorrhage from the ruptured PDA aneurysm. Arteriography of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was performed through a sheath introduced in the right femoral artery. Imaging of the SMA revealed the development of several collaterals in the pancreatic head (Figure A), and the common and proper hepatic arteries were imaged via these collaterals. The aneurysm in the PDA accompanied by leakage of the contrast-enhanced agent had a diameter of 9.3 mm. IVR hemostasis was completed by PDA coil embolization. Subsequent SMA arteriography showed several collaterals other than embolized PDA perfusing the proper hepatic artery (Figure B). After IVR therapy, blood chemical analysis was monitored for several weeks, revealing that transaminase level was not elevated and hepatic infarction was considered negative. Obstruction of the duodenal passage resulting from the hematoma was observed for a few weeks; however, bypass surgery was not required as the obstruction was completely relieved as the hematoma was naturally and gradually absorbed.\nIn this case, collateral perfusion pathways from the SMA developed to compensate for the reduced CA blood flow due to MAL compression, and the aneurysm might have generated in the PDA due to the abnormal changes in hemodynamic flow. Preservative treatment did not appear to relieve the CA compression. In addition, we considered that new aneurysms may form following new collateral circulation after IVR hemostasis. Therefore",

He initially presented with weakness and numbness of the lower extremities. He had been using intravenous heroin and was lying supine on a floor for approximately 24 hours.\nUpon presentation to our emergency department, the patient had pain in his bilateral lower extremities and no appreciable motor function below the level of the knee. He was in mild distress with a temperature of 37\u00b0C, pulse of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 146/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Examination of the lower extremities revealed erythema and tension in the bilateral posterior thigh compartments. In contrast, the medial thigh compartments bilaterally along with all four leg compartments were soft. Gluteal and buttock compartments were soft and compressible bilaterally. Motor strength testing revealed 1/5 strength bilaterally with manual testing of ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, and knee flexion and extension. The patient was found to have bilateral sciatic nerve palsies, with no sensation bilaterally in the tibial nerve, deep and superficial peroneal nerve distributions. Both legs were warm and pink with brisk capillary refill along with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. Provocative testing demonstrated pain with passive range of motion of the knees bilaterally and no pain with passive ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Lab work was significant for a creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) of 231,360 U/L.\nGiven the high suspicion for compartment syndrome, the patient underwent compartment pressure testing via Stryker pressure monitor system. Diastolic blood pressure recording measured 75 mmHg. The right posterior thigh compartment measured 75 mmHg and left posterior thigh compartment measured 30 mmHg. Based on the history and physical examination findings, the patient was diagnosed with bilateral thigh compartment syndrome likely secondary to his recent IVDA",

She was then followed up with periodic ultrasonic examinations, which showed no evidence of structural disease during the 8-year follow-up. However, a routine ultrasound examination revealed an irregular multilocular cystic-solid mass (measuring 31 \u00d7 26 \u00d7 24 mm) with heterogeneous echogenicity in the left ovary region approximately 2 years ago.\nThe patient was admitted to our hospital at the 39th week of pregnancy for elective caesarean section due to a funnel-shaped pelvis.

In addition, a solid hypoechoic area whose diameter was approximately 22 mm with rich blood flow signals could be detected in the Douglas pouch(Figure). Since there was not a very strong suspicion of malignancy and the clinical presentation was continuously uneventful, gynaecological experts recommended that surgery should be postponed until delivery, and rigorous monitoring should be performed unless there is a very clear indication, such as torsion or a very strong suspicion of malignancy. In the third trimester, ultrasound examination revealed that there were two papillary projections with smooth contours and moderate vascularization on the internal cyst wall of the left ovarian cyst. The other mass had no significant changes. The serum CA125 value gradually decreased from 124.7 U/mL in the first trimester to 25.91 U/mL in the third trimester, and the CA72",

This situation was accompanied by lateral hip joint pain: the hip joint was unable to adduct and sometimes the pain can be felt at the knee joint if severe enough. It was also accompanied by pain during micturition which however, was relieved after rest. The CT scan showed bilateral hip joint degenerative changes, oedema at the region of the right inguinal hernioplasty and encapsulated effusion at the right pelvic cavity (Fig. ). He was diagnosed with neuralgia after right inguinal hernioplasty. When he was admitted to our hospital, local anaesthetics were used at two points: one just above the right pubic tubercle and the other 2 fingers above the right inguinal ligament and medial to the right anterior superior iliac spine.

The only comorbidity was a mental illness.\nAn ultrasound (US) of the neck was immediately performed and revealed a multinodular retrosternal goiter, for which the larger nodule in the right lobe presented with a diameter of approximately 6\u202fcm and complete ring calcification.

    "original_text": "A 68-year-old man presented with a ten-year history of a lump in the right nasal tip, with a significant increase in size over a six-month period. Medical history included adenocarcinoma of the rectum treated with surgery and radiotherapy two years previously, polycythaemia, chronic alcohol abuse and a 50-pack per year smoking history. Clinical examination revealed a large bulbous firm swelling of the right lower third of the nose causing significant cosmetic asymmetry and distorting the right ala (). Rigid nasal endoscopy was otherwise unremarkable, and oropharyngeal and neck examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 2.8 cm soft tissue lesion arising from the right anterior nares, abutting but not obviously involving the cartilaginous septum. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a right-sided 3.4 cm mass arising from the lower lateral alar cartilage () with no apparent invasion of the nasal septum or adjacent soft tissues. An incisional biopsy via the vestibular aspect revealed a well-defined avascular mass with a lobulated surface. The initial histopathological report was suggestive of benign enchondroma, however further review considered low-grade chondrosarcoma to be more likely. Imaging of the neck and chest showed no evidence of metastatic disease, but two small lung nodules were identified, with a subsequent diagnosis of primary adenocarcinoma of the lung.\nAfter discussion at the multidisciplinary head and neck meeting, the patient underwent primary resection via an external rhinoplasty approach. The skin and soft tissue envelope (SSTE) was not adherent to the tumor, which was well-circumscribed and easily dissected from the surrounding soft tissue with no evidence of local invasion.

Our patient had regular menstrual cycles. Her body mass index was estimated to be 21. Previous hormonal and ultrasonographic evaluations confirmed ovulatory cycles. Obstructed tubes were seen on X-ray hysterosalpingography. During the hysterosalpingography, there was no free spillage of contrast material into the peritoneal cavity. Laparoscopy showed tubal patency. Our patient did not have any post-surgical complications. Six intracervical inseminations with donor sperm failed. Four intrauterine inseminations with donor sperm also failed. Finally an in vitro fertilization with donor sperm was performed. A first transvaginal oocyte puncture had been performed eight months previously without any complications. Induction of ovulation was initiated by using pure follicle-stimulating hormone administrated intramuscularly.\nWhen more than three follicles \u226517mm in diameter were present, 5000IU human gonadotropin was administrated intramuscularly. Our patient had not taken any other medication before the oocyte puncture. Transvaginal ultrasonography-guided oocyte retrieval was performed 35 hours after the human chorionic gonadotropin injection had been given. The follicles were retrieved by sequential puncture without reinsertion of the needle through the vaginal wall, so only one puncture was made on each side. A total of 13 oocytes were retrieved without using solutions for flushing. At the end of the procedure there were no ultrasonographic signs of bleeding and our patient was kept in the department for observation.\nThree hours after the procedure our patient stated she had abdominal pain. Her blood pressure was normal, and her pulse rate was 70 beats per minute. There was no fever. An abdomen rebound defense appeared. Her hemoglobin level was 99g/L and hematocrit was 29 percent.

She was diagnosed with a mental retardation grade 2 and had an intelligence quotient of 23. In this time, she was admitted to hospital due to an esophageal foreign body for 3 days. The foreign body, a Chinese date seed, was stuck at the sternal angle level and was suspected to puncture the esophagus and compress trachea, causing moderate wheezing symptoms. For this reason, an urgent procedure to remove the foreign body was required.\nThe patient was obese with a body mass index of 33.2, was well unable to obey orders and did not cooperate with the examination due to mental retardation. Her tongue was hypertrophic and prominent in the oral cavity. Due to the deformed jaw, mouth opening was significantly limited, with an approximately 3 cm of inter-dental interval.

The patient did not give any history of trauma or previous surgery and was not suffering from any metabolic or other chronic diseases. There was no significant previous treatment history available. Clinically, the patient had minimal restricted movement on dorsiflexion of the feet. On computed tomography (CT) examination, there were multiple ossified bone fragments of varying sizes seen within the substance of the Achilles tendon (five on the right and six on the left side). The lesions involved 3.6 cm of tendon length, 1.4 cm above the insertion site on the right side, and 3.5 cm of the tendon length \u2013 1 cm above the insertion site on left side. The craniocaudal dimension of the largest fragment was 2.7 cm on the right and 2.4 cm on the left side ( and ). The maximum anteroposterior dimension of tendons was 1.6 cm on the right and 1.7 cm on the left \u2013 at the level of the ossified fragments. There were associated degenerative changes in form of osteophytes seen at the talo-navicular joint bilaterally at the articulation of the navicular bone with the medial and middle cuneiform bones. Bilateral tendon involvement with multiple ossified fragments within the substance of tendon and no history of previous trauma makes this case unique as most of the cases described in literature had either unilateral tendon involvement or had few intrasubstance ossified fragments. The patient was managed conservatively with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with reduction of pain. The patient was also advised to take care of the involved site and wear comfortable footwear to prevent friction over skin surface leading to infection. The patient had relief of symptoms after taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication for 3 days and refused the option of surgery on being presented with tendon resection and reconstruction techniques.",
