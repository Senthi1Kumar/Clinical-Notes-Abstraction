The patient denied noticeable weight loss, hoarseness, caustic ingestion, and a history of tuberculosis and tumors, among other conditions. After admission, gastroscopy was performed, which demonstrated concentric narrowing of the esophageal lumen at 30 cm from the central incisor; the lumen was approximately 4 mm in size, and the gastroscope could not reach beyond this point. The mucosa overlying the stricture was smooth, and biopsy was performed at this site (Fig. A). Subsequently, the patient underwent barium esophagography and contrast-enhanced thoracic computed tomography (CT). Barium esophagography showed a narrowing of approximately 1.5 cm in length in the middle and lower esophagus without visible disruption of the mucosa; lumen expansion was limited, but the barium was still able to pass through the area (Fig. B). Contrast-enhanced thoracic CT revealed that the wall of the middle and lower oesophagus was obviously thickened, which indicated possible malignancy (Fig. C). However, the biopsy results suggested squamous epithelial hyperplasia (Fig. D).\nFor this patient, gastroscopy indicated only luminal stenosis without the presence of ulcers or masses in the mucosa, and the biopsy was negative for malignancy. However, CT examination revealed a significant thickening of the esophageal wall. It was necessary to determine a better method by which the esophageal lesions could be diagnosed in this patient. EUS revealed that the mucosa overlying the esophageal lesion was significantly thickened and was approximately 8.7 mm thick in the thicker region, with a low echo; the layers of the esophageal wall could not be clearly recognized (Fig. A).

Upon further questioning, the patient reported that she had leakage of a small amount of stool and also passing of a small amount of bright red blood in her stool over the past many months. On physical examination, a palpable mass was present just proximal to the anal verge. Imaging and a rectal endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or echo-endoscopy with fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies were obtained, and the pathology was consistent with rectal gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). She underwent neoadjuvant treatment with imatinib 400 mg daily, followed by a successful complete rectal resection of the tumor. After one year, the patient underwent a follow-up examination, and postsurgical imaging was ordered. It showed a possible residual disease. Therefore, it was decided to restart imatinib postoperatively on a dose of 400 mg daily. The patient developed mouth sores, worsening fatigue and appetite, as well as facial swelling, thought to be due to imatinib.

During a routine evaluation, a nodule was detected in the lower lobe of the left lung on chest computed tomography (CT). At the follow-up examination, the size of the tumor had increased 5 mm each year and he was referred for surgical treatment. Chest CT showed a 40-mm tumor with a smooth margin and a heterogenous inner structure in the left S8 pulmonary segment, close to the interlobar pulmonary artery (PA; Fig. ). Tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratine 19 fragment and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, were within the normal range. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed abnormal F-18 fludeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the tumor shadow, and the maximum standardized uptake value was 4.66. There was no abnormal FDG uptake in the hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes.

A 5-cm utility minithoracotomy was placed in the fifth intercostal space (ICS), and two ports were placed in the eighth ICS at the middle and posterior axillary lines. All procedures were performed under thoracoscopic view. The pericardium was defective, and the epicardium was exposed to the pleural cavity. There was direct adhesion between the exposed heart and lung; therefore, dissection of the adhesion was performed with great caution (Fig. ).

Cytogenetics from time of diagnosis were not available. His MDS was treated with lenalidomide and epoetin alfa. In October 2011, he progressed to AML with normal cytogenetics and was negative for FLT-3, NPM-1, and CEBPa. He was treated with 10-day decitabine for three courses. Recovery bone marrow showed a hypocellular marrow with 10% residual blasts. The decision was made to move forward with maintenance therapy with 5-day cycles of decitabine. Bone marrow biopsy in November 2012 after 10 cycles of decitabine revealed an increase in blasts and the therapy was changed to azacitidine. He received a total of 39 cycles of azacitidine (cycles 1 - 30 were 7-day courses and cycles 31 - 39 were 5-day courses). In January 2016, bone marrow biopsy showed persistent AML with 22% blasts. He was enrolled in this study in February 2016, and ECOG PS was 1 at the time of enrollment. He completed cycle 1 of VSLI with no dose adjustments required. On cycle 2 day 1, he was seen in clinic and reported worsening fatigue, constipation, and grade 2 peripheral neuropathy. VSLI was held due to these adverse effects. He remained pancytopenic with unchanged peripheral blood counts. At follow-up 1 week later, he reported persistent side effects and elected to transition to supportive care. He was enrolled in home hospice 2 weeks later.\nIn summary of the five patients enrolled there were no responses. Two patients did not complete one cycle of therapy and no patient completed two cycles. As the feasibility-stopping rule required at least four of the first 10 patients to complete two cycles combined with the observed toxicity rate and lack of efficacy signal the decision was made to terminate the study early. The median overall survival of the study population was 1.34 months",

Atrial tachycardia was terminated due to a mechanical bump of catheter manoeuvre (Pentaray NAV) and was never induced thereafter.

Automatic electrical activities of the recipient heart were observed in the LA posterior wall and four pulmonary veins, which were dissociated from the donor rhythm. A line of sites with the dissociated two rhythms revealed the anastomosis line between the donor and the recipient heart. The anastomosis line in the LA could be projected in an electroanatomical mapping system by tagging these sites (Figure ).

Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt surgery was performed immediately after birth, and appendectomy was carried out preventively during VP shunt repair at 4 months old. At 5 years of age, outpatient follow-up was started for chronic constipation due to spina bifida. An ACE procedure using a balloon-button gastrostomy tube was constructed in the lower left abdomen for simple management of defecation, and was thus managed for more than 10 years. However, stool leakage around the gastrostomy tube increased from the age of 17 years, and dermatitis began to appear (Fig. ). Therefore, the gastrostomy tube was changed to one of appropriate size and shaft length, and covered with a stoma pouch to reduce skin irritation. However, his QOL declined due to the need for frequent pouch replacement. Thus, we decided to reconstruct the ACE procedure again using MM.\nAfter sufficient intestinal preparation, MM was performed (Fig. ). The part of the sigmoid colon where the gastrostomy tube had been inserted was resected, and a sufficiently long intestinal tract from the descending colon to the sigmoid colon was released. The mesentery was dissected while preserving feeding blood vessels to create a free intestinal tract. The center of the free intestinal tract was cut two-thirds of its width, and the left and right intestines were each incised longitudinally and widened in a reed shape. A 12-cm intestinal tube was created by longitudinal suturing with reference to the literature [], and an 8 Fr tube (Atom Multipurpose Tube\u2122, Atom Medical, Tokyo) was used as a stent.

The patient described her chest pain as a sensation of burning that started suddenly at 11 pm in the night while she was resting comfortably at home after having dinner. The pain was mild in intensity, nonradiating, and lasted for a few minutes before resolving spontaneously. She denied having any dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, or loss of consciousness during this episode. She had no history of smoking or illicit drug use. Her home medications included felodipine extended release 5 mg once daily, isosorbide mononitrate extended release 30 mg once daily, atorvastatin 80 mg once daily, losartan 100 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, and metoprolol succinate extended release 100 mg once daily. The patient activated emergency medical services immediately after onset of her symptoms, who brought the patient to the emergency room.

A chest X-ray was consistent with a stage 2 sarcoidosis according to Scadding classification (mediastinal lymphadenopathy and interstitial pulmonary involvement), confirmed by a subsequent CT scan, also revealing abdominal lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary function tests showed a mild restrictive disease and a moderate reduction in DLco value; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis demonstrated increased number of lymphocytes and a high CD4/CD8 T-lymphocytes ratio. Ophthalmologic evaluation was unremarkable and no skin lesions were detected.\nDue to symptomatic pulmonary involvement, patient was initially treated with corticosteroids, starting with prednisone 30 mg/day (0.5 mg/kg of body weight) in June 2008, progressively tapered until 5 mg/day in September 2009. CT scan and pulmonary function tests both displayed an improvement after therapy, with normalization of lymph nodes size, recovery of interstitial pulmonary disease and increase of FVC with remission of dyspnoea; DLco was stable. Unfortunately, patient remained steroid-dependent and, early in 2010, developed a recrudescence of dyspnoea. Therapy with methotrexate (10 mg/week) was therefore started, obtaining a new remission of symptoms. 6 months later patient was asymptomatic; CT scan only revealed mild fibrotic scars interesting the upper lobes and pulmonary function tests were normal, with exception of a slight DLco decline. Thus, methotrexate was progressively tapered and stopped in 6 months time.\nEight months later patient complained of a new worsening of dyspnoea and a CT scan showed an interstitial pulmonary involvement, prevalent in the upper lobes, with recurrence of lymphadenopathy.

An EBV-viremia (18.500 DNA copies/mL) was detected, and the patient was treated with acyclovir followed by rituximab. The decision to initiate acyclovir and rituximab was taken due to suspected virus-associated haemophagocytic syndrome. During this treatment, three separate episodes of hypothermia occurred with an interval of approximately two weeks between each episode.\nThe first episode occurred the day after rituximab infusion and was accompanied by moderate bradycardia, hypotension, and a prolonged QT interval.

Computed tomography (CT) was performed and clearly depicted a mass with clustered calcifications in the intrapancreatic bile duct, which was dilated (Fig. ). The patient\u2019s medical history, which we describe below, led to a diagnosis of residual intrapancreatic bile duct cancer.\nThe patient had undergone sigmoidectomy in October 1993 for a sigmoid colon cancer, which had the macroscopic appearance of a Borrmann type I tumor with a partial papillary structure and was 2.0 cm in diameter. Histologic examination of the surgical specimen revealed a well- to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma forming the papillary structure (Fig. ). The neoplasm was judged, according to the UICC TNM classification system, to be a stage IIA tumor that had infiltrated beyond the muscularis propria but without lymph node metastasis (pT3, N0, M0). No adjuvant therapy was performed, and the patient was followed up for 5 years with no evidence of recurrence. Nine years after the sigmoidectomy, obstructive jaundice developed, and contrast-enhanced CT revealed dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct extending from the posterior segments of the right lobe to the common hepatic duct and a low-density mass within the duct (Fig. ). Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma was diagnosed. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was performed, and this was followed by extended right hepatic lobectomy and caudate lobectomy with extrahepatic bile duct resection in December 2002. Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was performed, with the jejunal limb placed in the retrocolic retrogastric position. Macroscopically, the mass appeared as a papillary lesion in the posterior segmental bile duct that drains into the common hepatic duct.

Careful dissection successfully led complete removal of the abscess wall without damaging the peritoneum and abscess wall (Fig. ). No intestinal fistula was observed through the procedure. Judging from the huge size of intramuscular defect of abdominal wall, simple primary closure seemed impossible whereas mesh reattachment was not preferable due to potential remnant infection. Therefore, we decided to apply posterior components separation technique (see schema in Fig. ), and abdominal wall reconstruction was successfully achieved by anterior rectus sheath closure (Fig. ).

A transcatheter Melody valve was placed within this homograft soon after balloon dilatation. He did well for 5 years following Melody valve implantation with minimal gradient across the conduit and no more than mild regurgitation. He presented with a 2 days history of fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and an episode of syncope. On examination, he was pale, febrile, icteric, tachycardic, and hypotensive. Two sets of blood cultures grew methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and resuscitated with intravenous fluids and inotropes (dopamine 5 \u03bcg/kg/min). He was commenced on intravenous vancomycin (1 g every 12 h), rifampicin (300 mg every 8 h) and gentamicin (62 mg every 12 h).

On admission, his blood pressure was 86/55 mmHg, heart rate was 60 b.p.m., and a visible apex beat was present at the 6th left intercostal space just medial to the left mid-clavicular line (, Video S1). Computed tomography revealed a pseudoaneurysm with mild calcification, protruding outside the thorax around the apex of the heart (Figure ). Echocardiogram showed akinesis of the anteroseptal wall and a 40 \u00d7 27-mm pseudoaneurysm around the apex of the heart, moving in synchrony with the heartbeat, and a 17% LV ejection fraction (Figure , , Video S2). The connection was confirmed between the pseudoaneurysm and the left ventricle with a spontaneous echo contrast. An underlying infection could have contributed to the formation of the pseudoaneurysm. We theorize that as the pseudoaneurysm progressed, the tissue along its path of progression was mechanically damaged. This gradual damage could have resulted in impaired structural integrity of the surrounding tissue which ultimately allowed certain segments of the heart to protrude into regions beyond the normal anatomical confines of the heart.

In 2005, he underwent a wide local excision surgical procedure of a tumor lesion in his left arm which was diagnosed as DFSP and treated with post-surgical adjuvant radiotherapy (60 Gy dose). No evidence of recurrence was suggested through follow-up visits. Due to the low risk of relapse, further follow-up visits were suspended in 2011.\nIn 2012, seven years after the initial surgery, the patient complained several times of a persistent cough. Antitussives were prescribed without any improvement of the symptoms. A few months later, he developed chest pain and an X-ray was performed, which displayed the presence of a big mass in the left lung. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a huge mass in the upper left hemitorax which measured 14.6\u00d711.1\u00d711.5 cm (). The mass appeared to depend on the pleural space. The mass moved above the main left bronchus decreasing the bronchus\u2019s size. The anterior cortex of the posterior arch of the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth left ribs were thickened, which could be suggestive of periosteal reaction by a slow-growing tumor lesion.\nBronchoscopy demonstrated mucosal inflammation of the left main bronchus, and the patient underwent biopsy of the affected area. Histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimen exhibited a spindle cell tumor of low histological aggressiveness which was reported as highly suggestive of a solitary fibrous tumor.\nSurgery was scheduled and the patient was operated on February 2013. During the surgical procedure, a firmly attached giant mass located on the left upper and inferior lobes, posterior wall and vertex was observed and the tumor infiltrated all the pulmonary parenchyma.

Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) was within normal limits, and the chest X-ray showed prominent pulmonary arteries on the left side, but normal heart size and clear lung fields. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular systolic function with normal ejection fraction at 65%. There was impaired relaxation with Grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular structure and function were normal and there were no significant valvular lesions, with only trivial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. 24-h Holter monitoring demonstrated a normal heart rate profile, with frequent isolated ventricular and supraventricular ectopic beats, and one episode of broad complex tachycardia of 4 beats. She had blunted heart rate response to exercise and the maximum heart rate was 102 bpm despite completing Stage 3 of the normal Bruce protocol. At peak exercise, the blood pressure dropped from 150/94 mmHg to 90/68 mmHg, and this was associated with presyncope.\nCoronary angiography showed a large communication between the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and the main pulmonary artery.

No serological testing for HSV or CMV were performed.\nInfection with HSV2 typically presents as genital ulcers. There is a strong association between HIV and HSV2 infection. Individuals infected with HSV2 have sixfold higher odds of HIV infection compared with those uninfected with HSV2, and 68% of patients with genital ulcers caused by HSV2 were found to be co-infected with HIV.

Careful search of multiple levels through the tissue block and immunohistochemistry may be required to identify the virally infected cells.

This was initially diagnosed as a labyrinthitis and investigated in the form of computed tomography (CT) of head which was inconclusive. The patient later developed girdle pain corresponding to 8th thoracic dermatome which was interpreted as a manifestation of possibility of herpes zoster. Next day, patient developed sudden onset left lower limb weakness (Grade 2 power) and impaired coordination (positive heel to shin test) and was then urgently referred to the spinal unit for assessment.\nThe MRI scan of the spine showed epidural haematoma extending from Thoracic 3 to 12th spinal canal causing posterior compression of spinal cord (Figure &).\nThe blood investigation on admission showed an INR of 2.7 and therefore the warfarin was stopped and Vitamin K was administered to get the INR below two. The patient was taken to the theatre for an urgent posterior decompression. Laminectomy at thoracic level five was performed with standard posterior approach.\nIntraoperatively it was found to be a sub-dural haematoma rather than an epidural as suggested by the initial MRI report.

An magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a tumor located in the posterior horn of the left lateral ventricle. In 2002, a first surgical extirpation of the tumor was performed at an external hospital. The histological examination including immunohistochemical profile showed an atypical meningioma WHO II\u00b0 (, ).\nDuring a prolonged postoperative reconvalescence, the patient suffered from a heparine induced thrombocytopenia II combined with pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis and basal ganglion infarction with consecutive right sided hemiparesis. Two years after the meningioma extirpation, the patient suffered from recurring headaches, dizziness and ataxia. Cerebral CT-scan showed a hydrocephalus for which ventriculoperitoneal shunting was performed in 2004. After this procedure, the patient recovered well.\nIn 2005, the patient was re-referred to the same external hospital because of recurrent headaches and dizziness. Imaging-studies showed a hematoma in the fourth ventricle due to a haemorrhaged tumor located in the caudal section of the aqueduct and dorsolaterally to the fourth ventricle. After tumor removal in 2005, the pathological examination revealed a recurrently haemorrhaged cavernoma with regressive transformations.\nAfter three years (2008) a recurrence of the tumor in the posterior horn of the left lateral ventricle was discovered on MRI Scans () at the same location as the tumor before (2002). Additionally, in this MRI another tumor located in the quadrigeminal lamina was detected (). In 2009, surgical resection of the tumor in the left lateral ventricle was performed. The pathological examination including immunohistochemical studies confirmed the diagnosis of a collision tumor consisting of components of a meningioma WHO II\u00b0 and a cavernoma (). The tumor cells stained positively for the epithelial membrane antigene (EMA) () and the evidence of cavernoma components was shown by positive expression of CD-34 of the epithelial cells (). This exceptional diagnosis was confirmed by the German Brain Tumor Reference",

    "original_text": "We treated a 43-year-old woman with history of bipolar disorder whose family history included a first-degree relative with the same illness who had committed suicide 15 years before.\nHer symptoms began at the age of 21, with a manic and psychotic episode related to drug abuse (cannabis and cocaine). Throughout the years she has experienced numerous relapses, requiring hospitalization on more than 10 occasions.\nThe patient\u2019s first contact with our clinic was in 2012 after admission to the Acute Care Psychiatric Unit. She presented with a manic episode and serious behavioral disorder (aggressiveness) and legal issues. She had previously been stable for 4 years, taking low doses of oral olanzapine (2.5 mg/d). After hospital discharge, she was prescribed 800 mg/d amisulpride, 600 mg/d valproate, 0.5 mg/d clonazepam and 4 mg/d biperiden.\nOur patient remained stable without any incidents until 2013, when she admitted having discontinued her medication the previous month believing to be pregnant, which turned out to be a false alarm. We explained to her the risk of relapse without adequate medical treatment. However, she came off her medication once more and was admitted again in the Acute Care Psychiatric Unit (2014) because of a manic relapse. After hospital discharge, she followed a treatment plan similar to the one prescribed after the previous admission.\nDuring outpatient follow-up she expressed a desire to conceive. She had had a stable partner for 10 years, despite some relationship crises and break-ups. We gave her the appropriate information regarding therapy options, and explained the need to remove valproate. We informed her about the option of lithium, considering on balance that the possibility of bipolar disorder relapse and consequent risk to mother and baby was greater than teratogenicity, including lithium cardiac risks for the baby. Also, lithium could be a better option than antipsychotics due to protection against manic and depressive relapses. Finally, we agreed to introduce lithium,",
