For recent 3 years, the patient felt repeated right upper abdominal pain and distension, and aggravated for half a year, without fever and jaundice. She was admitted to our hospital for further examination and treatment. The patient's physical examination and hematological tests, including tumor markers Ca-199 were unremarkable. Enhanced CT and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) suggested that the intrahepatic bile duct dilatation in segment 4(S4) with an extent of 2.5*3.0 cm (Fig. a, b). Hepatobiliary ultrasound revealed localized dilatation of bile duct with local acoustic enhancement in S4 of the liver (Fig. c). On the basis of these findings, a diagnosis of S4 localized bile duct dilatation with lithiasis was made. Given the recurrent and persistent symptoms, the patient opted for surgical resection of biliary dilatation. Correspondingly, we selected to perform a combined resection of segment 4b and part of 4a with the guidance of subsegmental ICG staining, so as to facilitate the laparoscopic operation more simply and accurately, as well as to retain normal tissues in a certain extent.\nIntraoperatively, after mobilization of the liver, relationships of the pathological segment with the hepatic vessels were confirmed by LUS, which was consistent with the preoperative CT imaging (Fig. d). ICG fluorescence positive staining method was performed to define the exact anatomical location of the lesion. Portal vein branch of the target hepatic segment was super-selected and visualized longitudinally, followed by punctured with a 18G needle by LUS guidance, then an injection of 0.05 mg ICG was performed gently (Fig. a, Additional file ). The specific configuration method of dilution was as follows: 25 mg ICG was dissolved in 10 ml sterilized water, and then taken 1 ml of which into 100 ml saline.

He had difficulty in walking and could not stand without support. There was no history of neck manipulation, trauma, or pain. The patient had a history of difficulty in swallowing solid food for the last year and stated that he had to cough often to make the airway free.\nOn arrival, the patient was conscious with a Glasgow coma score of 15. He was examined in sitting position due to dizziness. The patient was slightly aphonic. Cranial nerve examinations revealed slight anisocoria right > left, although it was uncertain if he had had this symptom before. There was both vertical and horizontal nystagmus. He had diplopia while looking straight and upwards, and there was improvement in dizziness while lying down with eyes closed.

She had visited another local hospital and had been given anti-infection treatment, which had not resolved the symptoms. The repeat fever prompted her to visit our hospital.\nThe patient had been diagnosed with diabetes 1 year prior but was not monitoring her glucose levels. She also had a history of appendectomy and no known drug allergies. She denied any history of hypertension or coronary heart disease. She recalled no experience of physical discomfort. She has not had physical examinations for an extended period of time.\nThe patient denied any relevant family history.\nEvaluation of the vital signs showed blood pressure of 115/71 mmHg, heart rate of 90 beats per min, temperature of 36.7 \u00b0C, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per min. The height was 160 cm and weight was 65 kg (being classified by body mass index as \u2018slightly overweight\u2019).\nPhysical examination showed a slight tenderness under the xiphoid process and upper abdomen. No palpable lymphadenopathy or mass was found.

He had progressive difficulty walking, only ambulating one block without aid. He could neither run nor squat. His leg was very uncomfortable and painful, and it required his constant readjustment and reengagement due to recurrent subluxations. He had two osteotomies, one per leg between ages 10 and 15. The patient had no history of any types of fractures, but minor trauma caused recurrent subluxations throughout the years.

His vital signs on the admission were: temperature 36.8 \u00b0C, heart rate 70 beats per minute, respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and blood pressure 120/80 mmHg.\nThe patient was pale but with good nutrition status [body mass index (BMI) 23.1 kg/m2]. He did not consume alcohol or tobacco. He was married and had two children aged 15 and 19 years.\nHe was taking no medication and had no other underlying disease. Moreover, his medical history was free of any previous surgical interventions. During the clinical examination, there was no sensitivity or tenderness in the abdomen and the bowel sounds were normal. Digital rectal examination revealed the presence of black stools. Clinical examination of cardiopulmonary and urogenital systems showed no abnormal signs. Apart from fatigue, there were no other findings on physical and neurological examination.\nThe blood tests depicted anemia (hemoglobin 6.0 g/dl with normal values between 13.4 and 17.4 g/dl, and hematocrit 20% with normal values between 41% and 53.8%). The results of all other markers were within normal range (Table ).\nDuring his admission to the hospital, the patient was transfused with 4 units of blood and 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma, and a Computerized Tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was performed. The CT scan of the abdomen revealed a mass with vague limits (dimensions 6.8 \u00d7 5.7 cm) between the pylorus of the stomach and the first part of the duodenum. Around that mass, there were several lymph nodes with diameter up to 1.6 cm. Furthermore, the presence of appendiceal mucocele was indicated as an incidental finding.\nOn the third day of his hospital stay, the patient underwent EUS and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, in which the biopsies showed morphologic and immunochemical features",

He was also administered a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist to prevent nausea and vomiting and a regimen of the histamine-2-receptor antagonist to prevent gastroesophageal reflux disease; despite this, he complained of severe nausea and vomiting. The patient experienced hearing impairment because of CDDP, therefore, after the first 4 courses of chemotherapy, the regimen was changed to comprise ifosfamide (4200 mg), etoposide (84 mg), and methotrexate (28 mg). Two courses of this new regimen were administered. Five months after the diagnosis, the patient underwent extensive tumour resection and total knee replacement with a custom-made extendable knee replacement system (Growing KotzProsthesis;Stryker, Germany).Pathological examination showed that the tumour tissue was almost necrotic, which suggested that the preoperative chemotherapy was effective. After the operation, the patient was administered 6 courses of the second chemotherapy regimen over a period of 5 months. During this treatment period, he experienced nausea and vomiting. Four weeks after the postoperative 6-course chemotherapy, he complained of dysphagia and could not eat solid foods. A barium-swallowing examination showed significant narrowing of the distal oesophagus (). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed stricture of the distal oesophagus, demonstrating slightly reddish and inflammatory mucosa at the distal oesophagus (). The distal oesophagus was narrow, and the entire oesophageal wall was thick, so the endoscope could not pass beyond the stricture of the oesophagus. A biopsy of the strictured part of the lesion was not performed. He was diagnosed with chemotherapy-related oesophageal stricture, and balloon dilatation for the oesophageal stricture was performed 10 times over a period of 2 months. Finally, the oesophagus was dilated till its diameter increased by 12 mm. During this period, omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor, PPI) was administered. After ballooning, his dysphagia improved, and",

Her obstetric history is significant for one previous uninvestigated male stillbirth followed by an uncomplicated pregnancy. She has chronic hypertension treated with labetalol. The woman and her partner are both of East Indian ethnic background and there is no history of consanguinity.\nObstetric ultrasound assessment showed severe fetal hydrops with increased abdominal circumference due to ascites and elevated Middle Cerebral Artery Peak Systolic Velocity.

Cordocentesis confirmed fetal anemia (hemoglobin level 46 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count: 9 \u00d7 109/L). The white cell count was normal (13.5 \u00d7 109/L). Two intrauterine blood transfusions were administered in an attempt to improve fetal hemoglobin levels. However, no significant improvement in the anemia or hydrops was observed.

The breast skin appeared dark and had ulceration.\nThe patient had undergone breast lump resection twice in 2001 and 2008, and both pathological diagnoses were benign PT. The patient had no history of cardiovascular or respiratory disease. Moreover, she had no family history of breast cancer.\nPhysical examination revealed that the left breast was normal, without any palpable lump. The right breast was obviously large, nearly 25\u00d725 cm in size, with a circumference of nearly 80 cm. The skin on the surface of the lump was dark, with ulceration area of 7\u00d75 cm and without bleeding or discharge (). On palpation, the size of the lump was 18\u00d720 cm, hard with local tenderness and poor mobility. Axillary lymph nodes were not palpable. Mammography showed a huge right breast, about 23\u00d723 cm, with dermal ulceration around nipple (). Ultrasonoscopy showed the right mammary gland that was enlarged obviously, with inset showing echo intensity disorder and blood flow signal probed (). Several hypoechoic focuses were seen on the area of right axilla, of which the largest was 1.5\u00d70.9 cm in size. The left breast and axilla had no abnormal signal.

    "original_text": "We are reporting a 62-year-old Caucasian male with a history of resected benign parotid gland tumor on 1985. After 22 years of resection, he presented with right kidney mass which was suspicious for renal cell carcinoma. He underwent right nephrectomy with a pathological diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma of unclassified histology. Afterward, the patient was enrolled in the adjuvant Econ 2805 study in the placebo arm; subsequently, he relapsed with retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Following this, the patient was started on sunitinib therapy, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in 2009 for metastatic renal cell carcinoma, though patient's tumor continued to progress. He was sent to be evaluated for a phase-I trial; during the evaluation, multiple pathologists evaluated his renal tumor histopathology studies and core biopsies of the salivary gland resection were compared to his nephrectomy ones. They concluded that the renal tumor is a metastasis from the salivary gland carcinoma with adenocarcinoma features.\nSubsequently, the patient developed severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Follow-up diagnostic studies with positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed disease progression with multiple bilateral hepatic lesions and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy [], with elevated liver enzymes. The tumor was tested for Her2/neu, which was strongly positive, +3 by IHC. Then, the patient was started on weekly trastuzumab (4 mg/kg loading dose, then 2 mg/kg maintenance) and paclitaxel 80 mg/m2.[]\nThe abdominal pain he was having and the elevated liver enzymes resolved after the first dose of trastuzumab and paclitaxel.

In ICU, after the initial examination endotracheal intubation was was found to be indicated, in view of rapidly increasing cervicofacial swelling and respiratory distress []. Patient was conscious but unable to speak. Endotracheal intubation was attempted but since the larynx could not be visualized was quickly aborted. Patient developed hypoxia. Mask ventilation was applied with Ambu bag, but ventilation was not adequate. Patient developed rapidly declining oxygen saturation and decreasing heart rate for which cricothyrotomy was attempted, but again because of the extensive cervical swelling the exact site could not be located. Hence, it was decided to go for emergency tracheostomy with the percutaneous method. Since ventilation could not be established, patient developed severe hypoxia, bradycardia, and finally asystole. At this stage, instead of starting cardiac resuscitation, it was decided to continue with tracheostomy as establishing the airway was the priority in hypoxic cardiorespiratory arrest. As soon as the guidewire was introduced into the trachea we started cardiac resuscitation within 2 minutes and the rest of the procedure of tracheostomy was continued along with cardiac resuscitation. In about 5 minutes time, spontaneous circulation was restored. The patient was put on the ventilator and nor adrenaline infusion was started.\nHer initial examination included cervicofacial swelling in the conscious patient who was not able to speak and was in respiratory distress.

The impaired gait began 3 years after he had undergone subtotal gastrectomy and chemotherapy for 6 months. Thereafter, he felt tingling sensations in the hands and feet and acquired gait difficulties. He denied having a family history of abnormal gait or developmental problems. He had quit smoking and drinking alcohol many years prior to his diagnosis.\nUpon neurological examination, his muscle strength was normal. The limbs did not reveal any spasticity or rigidity. He responded normally to pin prick and thermal stimulation. However, there was a severely decreased response to vibration in both big toes, particularly in the left. The ankle jerk reflexes were bilaterally decreased, whereas the reflexes of other joints were normal. Both toes showed extensor toe signs. Other pathologic reflexes were not observed. Cranial nerve and cerebellar functions were normal. He did not exhibit scissoring or spastic gait, but rather a limping gait. Thus, he had mixed neurological signs that involved the upper motor neuron and peripheral nerves.\nConsidering his previous medical history, we investigated his brain, spinal cord, meninges, and peripheral nerve by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, blood tests, and electrodiagnostic studies. Notable results included the lower-normal limit of serum vitamin B12 (363 pg/ml; reference range 200-1,000 pg/ml) and generalized sensory dominant polyneuropathy with axonal involvement. Blood tests, including those for syphilis, HIV, diabetes, connective tissue disease, vasculitis, and renal and liver function, were normal.

Two weeks prior to this presentation, the patient developed a truncal rash. This was thought to be a drug reaction to Ibrutinib, a small molecule drug that binds permanently to Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase, that he was receiving as therapy for his underlying lymphoma. The medication was discontinued despite excellent disease response over the past two years. On the day of presentation to an outside hospital (three days prior to presentation at our tertiary hospital), the patient was found mildly confused by his family members and unable to stand without assistance. In the emergency department he was tachycardic with high fever, but normotensive. Physical exam demonstrated altered sensorium with a Glascow Coma Score (GCS) of 14 and intact cranial nerves, however there were absent reflexes in bilateral upper and lower extremities and notable weakness in his legs, with equivocal plantar reflexes. Meningismal signs were absent.

She had several cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hiperlipidaemia and a morbid obesity with a BMI of 40), chronic lung disease, and renal chronic insufficiency with a calculated creatinine clearance of 38 mL/min. On the transthoracic echocardiogram, a severe stenosis aortic was diagnosed with an aortic orifice area of 0,7 cm2 and a systolic left ventricle dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 38%. Coronary angiography showed coronary arteries without lesions and good femoral accesses. The intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed a heavy calcified aortic valve with an annulus of 21 mm. The transfemoral implantation of the 26 mm CoreValve prosthesis was complicated with acute moderate aortic leak () and moderate mitral regurgitation associated to a deep prosthesis implantation. Repositioning the prosthesis with a snair was performed to reduce the severity of mitral regurgitation with slight improvement (). The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged eight days later.\nOne month later the patient developed a progressive dyspnea and was readmitted with acute pulmonary edema. Transthoracic echocardiography evidenced a moderate-to-severe aortic paraprostesic leak (which occupies a quarter of the sewing ring, with a steep jet deceleration slope of 6,3 m/s2 and a holodiastolic flow reversal in the descending thoracic aorta) [] associated with a severe left ventricle dilatation and dysfunction (left ventricle diastolic dimensions in paraesternal long axis increased from 53 to 70 mm by M-mode tracing preprocedure and postprocedure, respectively). She performed angiotomography which suggests an adequate position prosthesis although underexpansion ().

Each episode was treated with appropriate antibiotic and antipyretic therapy.\nGeneral examination revealed boils on the face and extensor surface of the hands along with marked swelling extending from the right malar region to the inferior border of the mandible. Intraorally, there was diffuse gingival enlargement [], generalized tooth mobility, spontaneous bleeding from the gums, the presence of local factors [], and mucosal ulcers in the floor of the mouth [].\nBecause there was a history of recurrent febrile episodes and severely mobile teeth along with gingival enlargement, the patient was advised for routine blood investigations, posteroanterior view of the skull [], and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).\nThe CBCT [] and orthopantomogram [] revealed severe loss of alveolar bone up to or beyond apical third of the roots. Hematological reports revealed mild anemia, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), increased C-reactive protein (CRP), and marked decrease in ANC.

He had a medical history of hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis with Child\u2013Pugh class A liver function. An initial blood test revealed a significantly elevated hepatitis B viral load up to 45,400 IU/mL and a serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level up to 6768.5 ng/mL, despite normal serum albumin, serum total bilirubin, and prothrombin time. Abdomen computed tomography (CT) disclosed a huge right lobe liver tumor up to 13 cm that was consistent with HCC enhancement patterns. Direct tumor invasions into the right portal vein, plus the middle and right hepatic veins, were detected, along with tumor thrombi within IVC and RA (A). Furthermore, a small metastatic lung nodule measuring about 1 cm at the right lower lobe was also identified.\nAnti-viral medication with Tenofovir was prescribed after the detection of a high hepatitis B viral load, and prompt surgical removal of IVC and RA thrombi was indicated after multidisciplinary discussion regarding the aggravating IVC obstruction-associated symptoms. The patient therefore underwent a cardiopulmonary bypass and median sternotomy, and RA was incised, with all IVC and RA thrombi excised en bloc under direct vision. Gross pathology examination revealed a cauliflower-like tumor, which was microscopically confirmed as poorly differentiated HCC. The patient\u2019s symptoms were alleviated soon after surgery. As for treatment of the hepatic tumor, initial systemic treatment with sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) was given orally while localized treatment with hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) was also arranged concomitantly. The HAIC was a combination regimen consisting of cisplatin, mitomycin-C, and 5-fluorouracil, followed by lipiodol infusion before infusion catheter removal [].

Physical examination revealed a 7 cm soft mass in the right hamstring and a core needle biopsy showed a tumour with the same histopathological features as those found in the left leg. The patient refused surgery and he underwent local radiotherapy of the mass. One year after initial diagnosis the routine follow-up CAT revealed a huge retroperitoneal mass suggestive of adipose origin. Chemotherapy was initiated with iphosphamide, adriamycin and DTIC with apparent stabilization of the mass.

Echocardiographic evaluation showed left ventricular hypertrophy, dilatation in the right heart cavities, pulmonary hypertension, 2-3\u00b0 tricuspid regurgitation, 1\u00b0 aortic regurgitation, and minimal pericardial effusion. In BP measurements, while blood pressures in both upper extremities were found to be at the hypertension level (BP: 150/90 mmHg), the lower extremity pressures were found to be at low levels (BP: 110/70). Hence, spiral thorax CT angiography was applied to the patient, who was suspected to have aortic coarctation. It was seen in her report that the descending aorta was interrupted in a 1 cm segment starting from the subclavian arterial exit. It was observed that the distal of the descending aorta was being filled with internal mammarian and paravertebral collaterals (Figures and ). Coronary arteries were also evaluated in CT angiography, and no critic lesions were observed. The patient was diagnosed with interrupted aortic arch type A, and with the decision of a common meeting of cardiology and cardiovascular surgery, it was agreed to keep the patient under control with medical treatment (metoprolol 1 \u00d7 50 mg, ramipril 1 \u00d7 5 mg, and acetylsalicylic acid 1 \u00d7 100 mg). The patient, whose complaints have been considerably reduced, is still getting hemodialysis treatment in our center.",

Seven months prior to this admission, she was diagnosed with a low grade noninvasive papillary urothelial carcinoma. A repeat cystoscopy two months before this admission was negative for any gross evidence of tumor recurrence.\nOn admission, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed peripancreatic fluid collections with involvement of the cecal pole and urinary bladder. Findings were suggestive of pancreatitis and worrisome for rejection (). A biopsy of her pancreatic allograft revealed diffuse involvement by poorly differentiated carcinoma. A cystoscopy with biopsy revealed an invasive high grade urothelial carcinoma arising in the background of extensive urothelial carcinoma in situ. A positron emission tomography (PET scan) showed an abnormally increased signal in the region of the pancreas, and anterior abdominal wall. Exploratory laparotomy revealed extensive tumor invading the right ovary and tube, the cecum, and the transplant pancreas with extensive retroperitoneal involvement. Subsequently, she underwent en bloc resection of distal ileum and cecum, resection of transplanted pancreas, partial cystectomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy, and repair of ileocolostomy anastomosis.\nPathologic examination of the resection specimen disclosed a 4.9 cm mass within bladder cuff near the allograft that directly invaded the right ovary, fallopian tube, cecum, and pancreas allograft (), as well as extensive retroperitoneal involvement. The tumor demonstrated a prominent nested growth pattern reminiscent of the nested variant of urothelial carcinoma (NVUC) with other areas showing features more typical of conventional invasive high grade urothelial carcinoma.
