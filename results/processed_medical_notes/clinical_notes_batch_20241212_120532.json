She described a rotatory mechanism and an inability to bear weight on her right lower limb due to pain and instability at the knee. On examination, the invagination of the skin was noted at the medial joint line of the knee in a characteristic dimple sign. Posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses were palpable bilaterally at 2+ and 1+, respectively, with no signs of hypoperfusion to the right foot. All compartments were soft, and no pain with passive range of motion was noted at the ankle and foot. Sensory and motor innervation was intact. Ankle-brachial indices (ABIs) of bilateral lower extremities were documented at 1.10. Neurovascular status was closely monitored throughout the patient\u2019s stay. Further, vascular studies, such as angiography, were deferred.

    "original_text": "A 59-year-old male presented with a history of stroke and diagnosed with streptococcus mitis-oralis endocarditis caused by a recent tooth infection. The patient had an infected mitral valve with vegetations on both leaflets and was treated with intravenous antibiotics but later developed rapid atrial flutter, tachycardia, and mitral valve regurgitation. The condition was severe enough for the patient to undergo a mitral valve replacement.\nAt the start of the procedure, an aortic and bicaval venous cannulation was carried out and tapes were passed around the cannulae. The aorta was cross-clamped with a soft padded clamp. Cold blood cardioplegia was given to arrest the heart. Within 10 minutes after cross-clamping, central venous pressure rose from 5 mmHg to 30 mmHg which coincided with the application of the tapes to the SVC syndrome. Cerebral oximetry values decreased significantly from pre-pump values of 67% in the left and 61% in the right to 44% in the left and 45% in the right shortly after the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine. The perfusionist was alerted to these changes. There were no issues with the functionality of the CPB machine. The patient was noted to have spontaneous bleeding from the left ear.

Physical examinations revealed normal vital signs and oxygen saturation of 94% without an oxygen supply. The remaining physical examinations were unremarkable. The patient did not complain of systemic symptoms such as weight loss, fever, anorexia, and fatigue. Electrocardiography showed atrial fibrillation rhythms and nonspecific ST-T changes. Laboratory tests including complete blood count, renal and hepatic function tests, urine analysis, the coagulation profile, and inflammatory markers (the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein) were all within the normal ranges.\nA 2D transthoracic echocardiographic examination showed severe circumferential pericardial effusion up to 25 mm anterior to the right ventricular outflow tract without right atrial and right ventricular collapse ( & Video 1). Additionally, a large non-homogenous intrapericardial mass was visible on the anterior side of the right ventricular outflow tract without obvious compressive effects on the cardiac chambers. The other echocardiographic parameters were within the normal range except moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.\nTo determine the extension and the invasion of the mass, we performed a multislice spiral thoracic CT scan with contrast and found a large ill-defined non-enhancing mass. The mass was an intrapericardial lesion adjacent to the right atrium and had an extension toward the right ventricular outflow tract and the base of the ascending aorta (). Except for severe pericardial effusion, no other lesions were noted in the chest or the upper abdomen.

The patient complained about pain in the right shoulder and was unable to perform movements; her shoulder did not allow for passive movements as well. Physical examination revealed a swollen and painful right shoulder. The right arm was held in slight abduction and external rotation. On palpation, fullness was felt at the anterior aspect of the right shoulder. Both neurological and vascular examinations were normal. Anteroposterior and lateral x-ray of the right humerus and shoulder showed completely displaced proximal humeral metaphyseal fracture (Fig. ). The anteroposterior view of bilateral shoulders revealed right shoulder dislocation (Fig. ).\nA closed reduction and ESIN retrograde fixation of the displaced fracture under anesthesia was attempted, but it was difficult to reduce the fracture by manipulation because of the downward displacement of the proximal fragment along with traction on the distal fragment. The humeral head could not be pushed into the glenoid. Therefore, we performed an open reduction through a deltopectoral approach and the fracture line was exposed. Two nails were introduced into medullary cavum. Then the glenohumeral reduction was performed by manipulation followed by the reduction and internal fixation of the humeral fracture (Fig. ). After the wound closure, the right upper limb was immobilized with U-shape cast and shoulder spica brace (Fig. ). Four weeks later, the cast and brace were removed and the patient was commenced on physical therapy in order to increase the range of motion of the shoulder joint. Eight weeks after surgery, x-rays showed abundant bone callus and stable reduction of the right shoulder.

    "cleaned_text": "a 6-year-old girl was sent to our emergency room after falling from a ladder and landing on her dominant right arm. the patient complained about pain in the right shoulder and was unable to perform movements; her shoulder did not allow for passive movements as well. physical examination revealed a swollen and painful right shoulder. the right arm was held in slight abduction and external rotation. on palpation, fullness was felt at the anterior aspect of the right shoulder. both neurological and vascular examinations were normal. anteroposterior and lateral x-ray of the right humerus and shoulder showed completely displaced proximal humeral metaphyseal fracture (fig. ). the anteroposterior view of bilateral shoulders revealed right shoulder dislocation (fig. ).\na closed reduction and esin retrograde fixation of the displaced fracture under anesthesia was attempted, but it was difficult to reduce the fracture by manipulation because of the downward displacement of the proximal fragment along with traction on the distal fragment. the humeral head could not be pushed into the glenoid. therefore, we performed an open reduction through a deltopectoral approach and the fracture line was exposed. two nails were introduced into medullary cavum. then the glenohumeral reduction was performed by manipulation followed by the reduction and internal fixation of the humeral fracture (fig. ). after the wound closure, the right upper limb was immobilized with u-shape cast and shoulder spica brace (fig. ). four weeks later, the cast and brace were removed and the patient was commenced on physical therapy in order to increase the range of motion of the shoulder joint. eight weeks after surgery, x-rays showed abundant bone callus and stable reduction of the right shoulder. in the 2 follow-through years, the patient was pain-free, with full range movement of the right shoulder, normal mobility, and symmetric limb length (fig. ). x-rays revealed complete remodeling of the fracture and symmetric bilateral shoulders, with no sign of avascular necrosis (fig. ).",

There was no history of trauma. Her symptoms were aggravated at the time of the hospital visit. The patient indicated that shortly after squatting, she had difficulty extending her hip and had subsequent difficulty walking. Thereafter, she occasionally noticed a snapping phenomenon in her right hip.\nA mass with hard consistency was palpable in the right groin area, but there was no tenderness. The motion of the right hip was fully preserved. There was obviously a snapping phenomenon with mild pain when her right hip was forced into a squatting position.\nPelvic plain films were taken initially (). It was difficult to determine a bony abnormality in the anteroposterior view of the pelvis; however, the internal oblique view demonstrated an irregularly calcified, pedunculated lesion that arose from the right ilium. This lesion presented as a peripheral outgrowth with its cortex in continuity with the ilium (); however, neither a periosteal reaction nor bony destruction was seen. Three-dimensional computed tomography () and magnetic resonance imaging () showed an approximately 3.3 cm \u00d7 2.8 cm \u00d7 2.0 cm sized round mass surrounding a cartilaginous cap with < 5 mm in thickness. Due to persistent pain, restriction of daily activity and the potential for malignant degeneration, the patient elected to undergo surgical excision of the tumor. During the operation, the patient was placed in supine position, and a curved incision was made while palpating the mass around the AIIS. The pedunculated mass was exposed after splitting the muscles.

He started treatment with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg, obtaining a hematological response in the second month but not achieving a cytogenetic response in the 18th month. At that time, the patient continued treatment in another institution.

The patient had a longstanding history of chronic otitis media and had undergone tympanoplasty on the right side 8 years prior. He had been using conventional hearing aids in both ears on and off for 8 years. His main issues with the hearing aids were dissatisfaction with the quality of sound, difficulty with speech discrimination, and intermittent skin problems in the external auditory canal. Pure tone audiometry confirmed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) with increased thresholds at 3 kHz and higher (). Speech discrimination scores for two-syllable words were 72% in the right ear and 76% in the left, at presentations level of 70 dB. Temporal bone computed tomography scans showed no active inflammatory changes, and the ossicular chain appeared intact in both ears. During counseling for hearing rehabilitation, the option of using VSB was discussed with the patient. Since he preferred using a hearing aid in the left ear, surgery for VSB was performed in the right ear. Intraoperatively, after mastoidectomy was performed to preserve the posterior external auditory canal wall, a facial recess was opened, and the long process of the incus was identified. Extra care was taken to widen the inferior portion of the facial recess to allow unhindered entrance of the FMT and the specialized forming forceps. Ossicular chain mobility was intact. After the VORP was secured in the bony well, the FMT was introduced into the middle ear cavity.

He has no history of cardiac disease or trauma and otherwise in good health. On physical examination, the right lower limb was cold and with cyanotic toes. The right femoral and popliteal pulses were undetectable. An urgent color-flow duplex scanning had been arranged which revealed a complete obstruction of the right external iliac artery blood flow by a rather big embolus. A trans-thoracic echocardiography showed an anechoic lesion of 36\u201340 mm originating from the left ventricle (LV). Since it was an endemic area of hydatid disease, a provisional diagnosis of (CHC) had been postulated. An urgent surgical embolectomy through the common femoral artery had been done. The obstruction has been opened with a Fogarty catheter. The catheter harvested a cruor thrombus with a white membrane from the common femoral artery, the histopathology of which was a hydatid tissue as it is shown in a and b. After immediate subsidence of symptoms and signs, and an uneventful post-operative night, a CT scan of thorax revealed a well-defined cystic lesion of 45 mm diameter was protruding into the LV, as shown in a, b, and c. A week later, the patient had been submitted to a standard a sternotomy and under cardiopulmonary bypass between the ascending aorta and the two-vena cava. The LV cavity showed an inside protruding mass, . The mass was incised and the cyst was removed, as shown in a and b). This has been followed by mopping of endocyst, as in , putting stay suture of LV as in , and enlarging of a cystic cavity as in .

She denied any medical or surgical history. We evaluated this patient according to the advanced trauma life support algorithm. The airway was patent, and bilateral breath sounds were clear. The heart rate was mildly elevated to 100 bpm without low blood pressure. She was conscious and clear without any neurologic deficits. No obvious open wounds were observed, except for an erythematous bruise on the right middle abdomen, measuring 3 \u00d7 3 cm in size. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed pneumoperitoneum with mild ascites and a retroperitoneal hematoma in zone 1 (Figs. and ). We performed an emergency exploratory laparotomy suspecting hollow organ perforation and retroperitoneal hematoma. On midline laparotomy, we noted that a considerable amount undigested food had spilled out of the distended stomach onto the gastrohepatic ligament and lesser sac. A transverse full-thickness laceration on the lesser curvature of the stomach was observed, measuring approximately 10 cm in length (Fig. ). On retroperitoneal exploration, we used the Kocher maneuver to examine the first and second portions of the duodenum and observed them to be intact. We then opened the lesser sac to examine the pancreas and fourth portion of the duodenum, which were intact as well. No bilious ascites or active bleeding was noted during retroperitoneal exploration. Therefore, we performed a primary repair of the perforated stomach and sent the patient to the intensive care unit for further resuscitation. However, on the second postoperative day, peritonitis presented again, and the drainage tube showed bilious content. Hence, a second laparotomy was performed.

Thirteen days prior to admission, he suddenly developed right chest and upper back pain while washing his car. He sought help at a nearby hospital. No diagnosis was made, and he was discharged with pain medication. Ten days later, urinary retention occurred, and he returned to the hospital. Bladder catheterization drained 800 mL of urine. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed a presacral mass, and he was emergently referred to our hospital.\nHe had no history of neurological problems in childhood. His family history was noncontributory. He could not walk because of intermittent severe right chest and right upper back pain. He had mild lower leg pain. On physical examination, he had no cutaneous abnormalities at the lumbosacral level. Paresthesia of the right side of the body from the shoulders down was noted. Pain and temperature sensation on the left side of the body below T2-3 were reduced. There were no cranial nerve abnormalities. Muscle strength assessed by manual muscle testing was 3/5 in the right arm and 4/5 in the right leg. Muscle strength in the left upper and lower extremities was normal. Both patellar tendon reflexes were increased; the other deep tendon reflexes were normal.\nThe bladder was catheterized, draining 800 mL of urine. There was reduced anal sphincter tone with fecal incontinence. CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervicothoracic spine showed no obvious abnormalities.

    "original_text": "Patient 2 was a 38 years-old male diagnosed as left temporal glial neoplasia in May 2014 after a seizure. MRI showed an expansive infiltrative lesion predominantly in the subcortical region, with poorly defined contours located in the left temporal lobe, involvement of the upper, middle, and lower temporal gyrus, and an increase in the left temporal gyrus cortex. The lesion compromised a large part of the temporal lobe and extended to the temporal isthmus, the posterior aspect of the insula, and was deep in the trigeminal effigy of the left lateral ventricle. There was diffuse erasure of the regional cortical sulci and the Sylvian fissure, as well as a slight compression over the atrium of the left lateral ventricle. Stereotactic biopsy on April 2014 indicated a diagnosis of oligodendroglioma grade II. He received TMZ 1,875 mg with cycles every 23 days (during the 5 days of use he received a dose of 375 mg/day) from September 2014 to July 2015, with no tumor growth until the beginning of 2016. After checking the evolution of the tumor by MRI in February 2016, there was an increase in the dimensions of the remaining lesion, notably in the temporal isthmus, which had a similar expansive effect on the adjacent encephalic structures. The patient was submitted to a partial surgical resection followed by chemoradiation and lasting 6 cycles of PCV associated with CBD. The CBD dosage was ranging from 100 to 200 mg/day.\nDuring the chemoradiation he had an excellent clinical performance, practiced sports, and had few symptoms of fatigue and/or nausea.\nMRI control immediately after chemoradiation (Figure ) was used to characterize post-operative changes and showed a significant reduction of the infiltrative components of the tumor. The result of the pathological study after the first surgery (Figure ) was oligodendroglioma grade II. After the second surgery, he was diagnosed as oligodendroglioma grade III characterized by an increase in Ki67 staining of 9% and",

On hospital day 6, due to continued fevers, abdominal and pelvic MRI was obtained. This study revealed a pelvic fluid collection concerning abscess; CT guided transgluteal drainage performed by Interventional Radiology resulted in 150ml cloudy yellow fluid. The etiology was believed to be an infected urinoma caused by instrumentation during stent placement and she was treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole. The patient's fevers and pain continued, prompting an abdominal and pelvic CT on hospital day 10. The imaging was notable for diffuse ascites, bowel wall thickening, and organizing fluid collections within the pelvis. She ultimately went for exploratory laparotomy and washout with intraoperative findings of multiple pockets of turbid fluid. The entire bowel was evaluated and there was no evidence of perforations, fistulas, or other causes of gastrointestinal leakage. Peritoneal fluid cultures grew polymicrobial organisms, however, suggestive of gut flora. She was transitioned to meropenem and fevers eventually resolved prior to discharge.\nTwo months following discharge the patient underwent outpatient elective appendectomy, right pyeloplasty, and ureterotomy with stent placement due to persistent hydronephrosis. Pathology revealed normal appendix tissue. Ureter pathology was significant only for acute and chronic inflammation, with no evidence of malignancy. Routine screening abdominal ultrasound 2 months later revealed stable hydronephrosis; however, an incidental 3cm soft tissue mass presumed to be near the sigmoid colon was noted. Follow-up MRI showed nearly circumferential thickening of the sigmoid colon",

    "original_text": "The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of NKH. His biochemical/clinical diagnosis was initially made as a toddler. This evaluation was initially prompted by a history of physical and developmental delays as well as occasional choreoathetosis. It should be noted that his sister (26 months his junior) also had similar delays prompting further study. Urine chromatography completed on his sister at 35 months of age showed an abnormally high glycine level. In addition to routine urine and hematologic studies (which were normal), a glycine loading study was completed on these patients. Pretest and posttest glycine levels were found to be elevated in CSF, urine, and serum of both patients. Glycine/serine interconversion was also impaired as well as an abnormal electroencephalographic pattern following glycine administration. Based on both biochemical and clinical phenotype at the time, the diagnosis of NKH was made. These patients fell into the attenuated classification of NKH with developmental and physical outcomes much less severe than in the classic type. Follow-up evaluations over the next 6 years showed continuation of developmental delays with a Wechsler Intelligence Scale Revised (WISC-R) of 76 at 9 years 3 months. At the time of diagnosis, the patient was given no form of treatment other than a low-protein diet. Additionally, he was not assigned regular follow-up as this condition at the time was not considered treatable, which was a recommendation carried forward for 36 years. Since diagnosis, he has had no history of seizures, but has had persistent cognitive delay. The patient has lived independently for the majority of his life and has not followed a protein restricted diet nor been on pharmacologic therapy.\nThere have been two reported episodes of metabolic decompensation over the last 2 years.

He had limited jaw mobility, which greatly exacerbated his pain and was only able to tolerate eating soft foods. On admission, the patient had obvious facial swelling to the left side of his face and dental misalignment was noted. A maxillofacial CT scan was obtained which showed an acute left mandibular fracture just inferior to the condyles. The remaining facial bones were intact without acute fracture. Also observed on the CT scan were narrow nasal passages and a leftward deviated nasal septum. Otolaryngology scheduled surgical intervention for fracture reduction and maxillomandibular fixation.\nEvaluation preoperatively showed poor mouth opening secondary to pain. He was appointed a Mallampati score of II and was estimated to have a thyromental distance greater than 6 cm. Nasotracheal intubation was the proposed means of airway control due to the necessity of maxillomandibular fixation thus precluding orotracheal intubation. The patient demonstrated patency of both nares and provided no history of nasal trauma or knowledge of any nasal septal deviation.

Upon presentation, he complained of pain in the left humerus, but no neurological findings or impediment to blood flow was found on physical examination. Plain radiographs showed a displaced fracture at the distal humeral diaphysis of the left humerus. The fracture was not reduced and was remarkably unstable (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging showed a vertical fracture line extending into the lateral humeral condylar physis of the distal humerus (Fig. ). Surgical treatment was required because of the severe displacement of the fracture and difficulty maintaining alignment for reduction. Informed consent was obtained from the patient and his parents for surgery and publication of this case.\nWith the patient under general anesthesia, closed reduction of the distal humeral fracture was initially attempted under fluoroscopic control.

We made an anterior mini-incision on the cubital skin line and removed the brachial muscle, which was preventing reduction in the fracture part. After removal of the brachial muscle, the displacement of the fracture was easily reduced and the alignment could be maintained by thumb compression (Fig. ).

The patient was expected to undergo ileostomy takedown in the local hospital in June 2018 and April 2019, respectively, but the operation was not performed because of the COA, which was found by colonoscopy. The patient was admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in May 2019. To address the difficult and complicated post-surgery problems of this cancer patient, the medical team conducted a comprehensive and careful related examination and disease evaluation. The abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed postoperative changes of sigmoid carcinoma. The intestinal lumen above the anastomotic stoma was narrow and adhered to the anterior sacral fascia. The stoma was unobstructed after the right lower abdominal fistulation (Fig. a). Further barium enema examination suggested that the anastomotic stoma in rectum is completely closed and separated (Fig. b). Blind ends were present on both sides of the sigmoid colon and the rectum, and the bilateral blind ends were approximately 3.0 cm apart. The laboratory examination of the patients showed that there was no obvious abnormality in the general hemogram and no significant change in the level of tumor markers. Physical examination showed no obvious discomfort.\nDespite the presence of COA with anastomotic separation, the examination results indicated that the blind end of the anastomotic site grew well.

During her previous pregnancy, an 8-cm uterine fibroid was identified in Douglas' pouch, and the incarcerated gravid uterus was diagnosed. Consequently, a cesarean section was performed at 37 weeks and 5 days of gestation. A midline laparotomy was performed from above the umbilical ring to 2 cm above the pubis, followed by reduction in the incarcerated gravid uterus. The neonate was subsequently delivered through an anterior lower uterine segment incision.\nThe present spontaneous pregnancy occurred 3 years following the previous cesarean section. The patient consulted our outpatient clinic at 5 weeks of gestation. Initial imaging confirmed that the 8-cm uterine fibroid was still located in Douglas' pouch. At 17 weeks of gestation, transvaginal ultrasonography identified a uterine fibroid in Douglas' pouch, with significant stretching of the uterine cervix, suggesting a diagnosis of incarcerated gravid uterus (Figure ), which was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure ). In view of her previous history of persistent incarcerated gravid uterus that necessitated cesarean section, a spontaneous reduction was not expected and the patient was defined as having a higher risk of uterine rupture, and we consequently decided to perform manual reduction in the incarcerated gravid uterus.\nAt 20 weeks and 1 day of gestation, we performed manual reduction in the uterus under spinal anesthesia. We raised the uterus by a transabdominal approach, and concurrently pushed the uterine fibroid vaginally, to achieve successful reduction. After the procedure, the position of the uterine cervix was normalized, and there was a visible improvement in the stretch of the uterine cervix and anterior lower uterine segment (Figure ).

She underwent a third resection when there was rerecurrence approximately 2 years later. The tumor remained grade 2 and was found to harbor the V600E BRAF mutation as well as MGMT promoter methylation. Craniotomy was followed by nine cycles of temozolomide. Approximately 1 year later, she underwent a fourth craniotomy for progressive disease. At that time, the patient started a regimen of alternative therapies outside of our institutions. Within 6 months, there was further tumor progression. At that time, treatment with a BRAF inhibitor was discussed with the patient.

However, she agreed to bevacizumab, and the tumor initially showed radiographic response. However, there was further tumor progression approximately 5 months after starting bevacizumab.\nThe patient agreed to treatment with BRAF inhibitor, and vemurafenib was started at a dose of 960 mg every 12 h.
