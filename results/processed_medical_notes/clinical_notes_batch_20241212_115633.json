A surveillance CT scan performed several weeks after the surgery revealed two new hepatic lesions (). She had no clinical symptoms. She was referred to the interventional radiology service for biopsy of a liver lesion and for placement of a venous infusion port. Complete blood count, liver function tests, coagulation profile, and basic metabolic profile were all within normal limits. The liver biopsy was performed under moderate sedation with the patient in the supine position. Under CT guidance, a 2.5 cm lesion in segment 8 was accessed with a 19-gauge/20-gauge automatic core biopsy gun (Temno, CareFusion, Waukegan, IL) via a lateral intercostal approach (). A good core of tissue was obtained. A touch preparation was made by placing the core of tissue on a glass slide and rolling the specimen gently around the slide. The sample was immediately evaluated for adequacy by an on-site cytotechnologist. No neoplastic cells were seen on the initial touch preparation. Ultimately five core samples were obtained from different areas of the lesion; each appeared visually adequate, but none of the touch preparation samples contained neoplastic cells on the on-site evaluation. The biopsy was terminated based on CT imaging confirmation of adequate sampling of the lesion. The specimens were submitted for both cytopathologic and surgical pathologic evaluations, which revealed liver parenchyma with chronic active inflammation, granulomas, and a reactive bile ductule proliferation (). No carcinoma was seen. Special stains for mycobacteria and fungal organisms were negative. No microbiology specimens were sent due to lack of clinical suspicion for infectious etiology.\nThe patient developed right upper quadrant pain in the recovery area.

The patient was diagnosed with gingivitis, and treated with a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug and oral rinsing with chlorhexidine. The condition of the patient did not improve significantly. When she returned a week later, she had no alleviation, but labial paresthesia on the right side of her lip. As the cause of the new symptom remained unidentified, she was referred to the oral surgery group. Initially, the paraesthesia affected only the right side of the lower lip, but by this time it had spread to the skin of the right side of her chin. The oral surgeons decided to extract the lower right wisdom tooth, but the labial paraesthesia still persisted. Since there was an extended composite restoration in the lower right first molar, and translucency around its apical region was visible, the lesion was diagnosed as periapical granuloma. The lesion on tooth 46 was not close to the mandibular canal; this can be seen on Fig. . Therefore, root canal treatment was carried out, despite the uncertain result of the percussion, palpation and sensibility test. The transparent lesion around the apex and the negative sensibility test lead to the decision of endodontic treatment. Diagnosis was made by a dentist who is not a staff member of our Department. The treatment revealed that the pulp was vital. Our oral diagnostic team examined the patient, and we diagnosed the case as cemento-osseous dysplasia based on the panoramic radiograph showing apical translucency lesions around the anterior teeth with vital pulp (Fig. ).

She had worse pain in both knee joints, followed by hands and wrists, and shoulders.

She had been admitted to the first hospital with abdominal pain and found to have gallstone pancreatitis, cholangitis, and Streptococcus salivarius bacteremia. While a cholecystectomy was considered, she instead underwent ERCP to remove the stone and a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was placed by interventional radiology. After three weeks, she was discharged with a course of oral antibiotics.\nTwo weeks later she was admitted to a different facility with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Liver enzymes and total bilirubin were elevated. The patient revealed that she had not taken the full course of oral antibiotics. ERCP was performed with small stones seen.

A cutaneous biopsy demonstrated an SCC. The ulceration was too large to be subjected to local excision; therefore, after a complete radiological staging with chest and abdomen computed tomography that did not show distant metastases, amputation of the middle third of the right leg was made. The definitive histological examination showed an ulcerated area of 13 cm, necrotic, haemorrhagic, incorporating and full-thickness infiltrating from skin to the underlying bone tissue, compatible with poorly differentiated SCC. For persistence of secretions, the wound was revised and cleaned several times. One month after amputation, a radiological restaging with chest and abdomen computed tomography showed multiple bilateral lung lesions compatible with distant metastases and a dubious intracardiac nodularity. The patient was then studied for a possible infectious disease but all the exams (including tuberculosis screening) were negative. We performed a fibrobronchoscopy with biopsy of a mediastinal lymph node and bronchioloalveolar lavage, resulting in positive SCC in both samples.

    "original_text": "A 54 year-old Korean man visited the orthopedic surgery department due to persistent pain in his right hip joint starting a month previously and a gait disturbance was caused by this pain. He received a stent due to coronary artery occlusive disease in 2006 and received arthroscopic surgery for a rotator cuff tear in 2012. He did not have any notable medical history related to his joints, such as septic arthritis, tuberculosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. He was not undergone joint injection before. The pain started without any trauma about a month prior and worsened with exercises and walking. On a physical examination, he showed severe limping, no signs of rebound tenderness, and a positive sign to a Patrick\u2019s test including a severe decrease in joint ROM (flexion, 100\u00b0; extension, 0\u00b0; abduction, 30\u00b0 internal rotation, \u22125\u00b0, external rotation, 20\u00b0). Spine and sacroiliac joints did not show any significant findings upon physical examination. A simple radiograph showed no remarkable findings thus an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted. Exudation in the right hip joint was increased, and his acetabular articular cartilage and acetabular labrum were almost completely obscured (; ).

On the complete history taking he revealed that he had an episode of trauma one year back over his left arm due to fall on the ground and swelling develops at that time. For it he did not take any medical advice and he took few pain killers and repeated massage over his left arm. Subsequently he noticed that the swelling over his whole left arm is permanent.

By using a laser imaging system, we found reddish lesions on the anterior and posterior walls of the distal esophagus in white light laser images (). In addition, another lesion in the middle esophagus was detected as a brownish area, by using FICE and BLI (). All three lesions were 0-IIc early cancers with slight reddish color changes in the laser white light images: two lesions measuring 15 and 10 mm in diameter on the anterior and posterior walls of the distal esophagus, respectively, and another lesion measuring 5 mm in the middle esophagus. FICE and BLI enhanced all three lesions with high contrast, compared with the surrounding mucosa. Magnification BLI images revealed an irregular surface pattern on the brown lesion compared with the surrounding mucosa and an irregular vascular pattern in one portion of the tumor.

The patient had frequency, residual urine sensation, nocturia and edema of the left leg. On vaginal sonography, there was a 3.8\u00d74.3 cm sized solid mass in the urethra which bulged to the wall of the urinary bladder (). The upper part of the lumen of the urinary bladder was clear. The computed tomographic urography revealed a 4-cm low attenuated mass with a cystic portion adjacent to the vaginal stump (). Many metastatic lymph nodes of 0.5-3 cm in size were present in both the paraaortic space and the pelvic cavity. Based on urine cytology findings, the patient diagnosed with adenocarcinoma. On the surgical field, the patient had a lobulated tumor mass of about 3 cm in diameter in the urethra and had the clear urinary bladder.\nThe voided urine cytology revealed moderate cellularity with small clusters of globular or papillary cells in the inflammatory background (). The necrotic debris and inflammatory cells were present within some clusters of tumor cells (). These tumor cells were enlarged and had abundant clear or granular cytoplasms with cytoplasmic clear vacuoles. Some clusters showed hobnail features (). The nucleus showed granular or vesicular chromatin with prominent nucleoli. It was enlarged and had a round shape with folded, irregular nuclear membrane. It showed a moderate nuclear pleomorphism (). Small globular hyaline bodies were present in clusters of tumor cells ().

    "original_text": "A 58-year-old Iranian postmenopausal woman referred to the hospital because of a abdominal wall mass and hernia. She had a history of three cesarean sections with a midline abdominal incision. Her last cesarean section was performed 20 years earlier. Physical examination demonstrated a partially mobile and large mass in the anterior abdominal wall in the midline cesarean scar, extending bilaterally to the midclavicular line. The upper margin of the mass was adjacent to her umbilicus, where there was a large umbilical hernia above the mass (Fig. ). Pelvic ultrasound showed an irregular 12 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8 cm mass in the abdominal wall anterior to the rectus muscle involving subcutaneous tissue, a large umbilical hernia containing omentum, and a well-defined left solid adnexal mass (4.1 \u00d7 3.7 \u00d7 5.1 cm in diameter). An abdominopelvic CT scan confirmed the ultrasound findings (Fig. ). The peritoneal surface of the anterior abdominal wall was intact, and other abdominal and pelvic organs were normal. The chest X-ray was normal.\nA local incisional biopsy of the abdominal wall mass was performed before referral to our department. The histology implied clear-cell carcinoma\nThe patient was scheduled for surgery as determined by the MDT. Midline laparotomy was performed. The abdominal wall mass invaded the lower half of the rectus muscles. The mass reported in the left adnexa was indeed a large pelvic lymph node adjacent to the left external iliac artery. Uterus and ovaries had a normal appearance. The patient underwent a complete excision of the abdominal wall mass including the rectus muscles and fascia, peritoneal washing, resection of the enlarged pelvic lymph nodes, TAH, and BSO. Due to the large abdominal wall defect following the excision of the abdominal wall mass, reconstructive surgery was performed to repair the abdominal wall.

He was a known case of hypertension on medication and a chronic smoker as well as an alcoholic. A cemented total hip arthroplasty was performed through the Southern Moors (posterior) approach (). Immediately following the surgery, his pulses were felt but had been feeble. However, three hours post-operatively the resident doctor noticed that the patient\u2019s left lower limb had become cold and the dorsalispedis artery, popliteal artery, and femoral artery pulsations were absent on the left side. There were no ankle movements. Since the patient was on epidural anesthesia, the patient did not complain of any pain. An emergency Doppler scan suggested narrowing of the left iliac and left common femoral vessels with monophasic flow. A C T angiogram revealed complete occlusion of the left common femoral artery ().\nWith an urgent opinion from cardiothoracic and vascular surgery, the left femoral artery was exposed and a thrombus was noticed (). Angioplasty was carried out using Forgarty\u2019s catheter and the vessel was recanalized (). On passing the catheter proximally, one layer of thickened intima was removed followed by clots. Good blood flow was established on removal. When the catheter was passed distally, not many clots were present. After removal of the occluding thrombus measuring 2.5 cm in length and intimal plaque of one cm length confirmed by histopathological examination (), the artery was closed using 6-0 prolene sutures (). Peripheral pulses were felt. After 12 hours, there was active movement of the limb. A post-operative Doppler scan showed good flow of blood within the affected vessel ().

Needle aspiration was performed, but only necrotic tissue could be collected. We did not analyze the karyotype since the symptoms suggesting the Klinefelter syndrome were not observed.

She had initiated treatment in the outpatient clinic of her district in June 2013, attending only one visit and refusing all psychiatric treatment thereafter.\nThere was a family history of schizophrenia in second degree relative on her mother's side. The patient's medical history, according to her family, included recurrent acute bronchitis until 10 years of age. No history of alcohol or tobacco consumption or psychoactive substance use was reported. The patient was very selective and restrictive in her meals since her childhood. She only ate biscuits, ham croquettes, bread, and omelettes.\nRegarding school, she described acceptable performance until the previous academic year when she presented some difficulties, and her teachers decided to change her to another classroom with a lower academic level.\nHer premorbid personality was described as quiet and shy, with some difficulty in social relationships, but with a group of friends at the beginning of the episode. She lived with her parents and an 18-year-old sister in a mid-size city (with a population of about 216,000 inhabitants).\nThe patient reported that during the previous academic year she had been separated from her friends due to the change of classroom and at the same time she had begun to suffer digestive cramps and headaches, and as a result she stopped going to school. She stayed at home, with no interest in leaving the house, playing computer games and surfing the internet all day from April 2013 until her admission in our department 6 months later.

Vital signs showed a blood pressure of 100/64 mm Hg, heart rate of 110 per minute, respiratory rate of 18 per minute, oxygen saturation of 96% on room air and a temperature of 100.5\u00b0F. She was cachectic with a weight of 28 kg which was less than 5th percentile for gender and age matched normal population. Physical examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness and rigidity. Her erect abdominal radiography showed gas under right dome of the diaphragm. Clinical diagnosis of perforation peritonitis was made and the patient was wheeled to the operating room for emergent laparotomy. Intraoperatively, a 3 cm x 2 cm single ileal perforation was found 1 foot proximal to the ileocecal junction, with unhealthy bowel margins and multiple mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Resection of perforated bowel segment with proximal ileostomy and mucus fistula of distal ileum was performed. Later, histopathology report confirmed tubercular etiology showing caseous necrosis in mesenteric lymph nodes and epithelioid granuloma in ulcer edge biopsy. Two days after the surgery, the patient was started on oral feeds and was accepting meals orally subsequently. Ten days following surgery, the patient had multiple episodes of bilious vomiting with stoma output decreasing to less than 100 mL per day. Her abdomen remained flat with no increase in bowel sounds. Abdominal radiography showed dilated stomach with no air fluid levels. Oral feeds were stopped and a nasogastric tube was placed for drainage of gastric contents. A contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) abdomen was done to determine the cause of obstruction which revealed a decreased aortomesenteric angle of 15\u00b0 (Figure ).\nAs a result of this decreased angle, an abrupt collapse of the third part of the duodenum was seen along with proximal duodenal and stomach dilation (Figure",

The previous multiple evaluations by many specialists in other hospitals did not succeed to give a clear diagnosis and treatment.\nThe patient had no relevant medical history and took no medication, except ACEI that was stopped some months after angioedema onset. No relation with possible allergic stimuli could be identified and she had no clinical manifestations between attacks. Angioedema was painful, not accompanied by urticaria or abdominal symptoms, located variably to neck, arms or buttocks, without facial involvement during 6 years. The attacks occurred at weeks or months intervals and usually lasted between 48 and 72 h, irrespective of corticosteroids and antihistamines treatment usually administered. The frequency of attacks had progressively increased from one at 2\u20133 months intervals to almost weekly during the last year before presentation. The last angioedema attack, determining emergency hospitalization in September 2014, was more severe and prolonged, accompanied for the first time by laryngeal edema and respiratory symptoms. The extended medical evaluation, including complete blood tests for inflammation, allergy, autoimmunity and cancer, were all negative (Table ). Full body CT scan and bone marrow examination were normal. No criteria for lymphoproliferative, mieloproliferative or autoimmune diseases could be found. Measurement of C1 inhibitor (C1INH) in plasma showed significantly decreased level at all measurements, with low activity ranging from 58 to 4% and constantly low C4 (Fig. ). Complement fraction C1q plasma level was measured twice and had normal value. Genetic tests were not performed, given the patient advanced age and lack of family history of angioedema,",

The patient went into septic shock and was started on norepinephrine for vasopressor support. Blood culture results were Streptococcus dysgalactiae positive, and he was started on ceftriaxone. However, the infection source remained unclear. As his left knee swelling had increased compared to baseline on admission, a diagnostic tap was performed that showed purulent fluid comprising 250,000 white blood cells, which were predominantly neutrophils.

We undertook a computed tomography (CT) scan of the left knee as shown in Figures , , which showed infection extending into the popliteal fossa, along with compression of the popliteal artery and vein. He underwent further surgery to drain 500 mL of purulent fluid from the popliteal fossa.\nCultured samples taken from the knee joint positively confirmed Streptococcus, which was consistent with his blood sample results. Given the extent of the infection, and because he was in septic shock with high-grade bacteremia, we administered a synergistic dose of gentamycin, and management was guided by infectious disease consultants.\nPostoperatively, his condition improved, vasopressors were weaned, and a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out infective endocarditis, the results of which were found to be vegetation negative. Therefore, we did not proceed to perform transesophageal echocardiography as the treatment duration was four weeks.

    "original_text": "A 60-year-old woman presented with grade 3 (morbid) obesity, body mass index (BMI) 40.02 kg/m2, body weight 108 kg, and height 164 cm. Patient-reported history included venous insufficiency and two operations for varicose veins in the lower limbs. The patient underwent a hysterectomy due to giant sarcomas, and a history of two childbirths by natural labor. She was not treated for other systemic diseases. The first rhinorrhea occurred approximately 3 years before. Initially, her symptoms were believed to be due to chronic allergic rhinitis. The patient experienced more frequent upper respiratory tract infections accompanied by pronounced general symptoms, an elevated body temperature of 38\u201339\u00b0C, fatigue, muscle and joint pains, altered mood and meningeal irritation. The patient was referred to a laryngology department at her place of residence where CT and MRI diagnostics revealed a clival bone defect of 9 \u00d7 7 mm and 8 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 6 mm, which was subsequently diagnosed and differentiated as cerebrocranial hernia. Nasal cerebrospinal fluid leak was confirmed in biochemical investigations. The patient was hospitalized in our clinic in July 2014 due to sinogenic orbital complications that manifested as swelling and congestion of the frontal orbital segment and irritation of cerebrospinal meninges. Imaging diagnostic scans confirmed a bone defect within the posterior clival framework that was larger compared to earlier scans. Fluid leaks occurred at several-day intervals. Therefore, the patient declined consent for the procedure and underwent consultations at other neurosurgery clinics. She received no guarantees of the potential endoscopic management of the leak. An intracranial approach was proposed.

Biopsy revealed Gleason 4 + 4 = 8 adenocarcinoma of the prostate involving 50% to 90% of 3 of 12 cores, Gleason 4 + 3 = 7 adenocarcinoma involving 20% to 85% of 4 of 12 cores, and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. He was referred to an outside hospital for surgical removal of his prostate. However, given his history of suprapubic prostatectomy for BPH in Nicaragua more than a decade prior, he was advised to undergo radiation therapy. The patient approached us for second opinion and underwent pelvic MRI, bone scan, and cystoscopy for further characterization of his disease. MRI revealed diffuse heterogeneous postcontrast enhancement of the prostate gland with no discrete mass. There was no abnormal lymph node enhancement and bone scan was negative for metastatic disease as well. On cystoscopy, the patient was noted to have mild prostatic enlargement with a defect from his prior simple prostatectomy as well as a scar at the dome of the bladder, suggesting prior transvesical prostatectomy. Preoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA) was 9.2 and sexual health inventory for men (SHIM) score was 23.\nOur patient underwent bilateral nerve sparing RALP in September 2017. Total operative time was 76 minutes. Blood loss was \u223c25 mL. We used a transperitoneal four-arm approach with a 0\u00b0 lens. Upon entry into the abdomen and colonic mobilization, care had to be taken while performing anterior bladder dissection because of adhesions present from the patient's prior open prostatectomy. After lysis of adhesions and dissection of the endopelvic fascia, the bladder neck was transected and the prostate was mobilized. A blunt posterior dissection was performed thereafter using PK scissors to minimize rectal damage. Dissecting planes at the bladder neck and the apex of the prostate were difficult and great caution had to be exercised to prevent positive margins",

He was also complaining from nausea and vomiting during the week prior to his referral. On physical examination a huge abdominal mass mainly in the right side of the abdomen was detected. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a large solid/cystic, fluid filled mass measuring 17 \u00d7 17 cm in upper abdomen assumed to be originated from right kidney. In computed tomography with contrast the right kidney was not visualized, but a huge heterogeneous cystic, septated mass measuring 12 \u00d7 16 cm in the anatomic area of right kidney, extending upwardly to the diaphragm and liver and anteriorly to the pancreas, was noticed. Absence of right kidney was consistent with its agenesis. The patient was scheduled for laparotomy through which a huge tumoral mass with attachments to the diaphragm was removed.

Thorough clinical examination and radiological imaging revealed a depression fracture of the lateral tibia plateau which was classified as Schatzker III/AO 41-B2 []. Radiological examination by a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed [], which showed the details and personality of this specific fracture to assist in decision making.\nEstimated the clinical and radiological findings as well as the needs of the patient, surgical treatment was decided.\nTaking into account that the position of the fracture was at the most posterior area of the lateral plateau and the difficulties from open reduction of the articular surface, closed reduction via a minimal incision arthroscopically and fluoroscopy assisted using balloon kyphoplasty instrumentation was performed []. After reduction of the articular surface confirmed by arthroscopy the bone defect was filled with calcium phosphate via injection []. The fracture was considered a stable one and no further support and fixation was needed.\nInitial immobilization was obtained with a log leg cast for 2 days. Afterwards, continuous passive motion (CPM) was started with flexion and extension as tolerable. The patient started to walk with crutches and no weight bearing. A knee cast with goniometer was placed permitting knee exercises in flexion and extension. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the 5th postoperative day in a very good condition.\nThe patient was examined 6, 12 and 24 weeks after the operation regarding the movements of the joint and the muscle strength.

The pain had begun the previous day after she had eaten her dinner, and was associated with nausea and vomiting. She had no history of fever. She had had a normal-term delivery 6 years previously. She had undergone bilateral laparoscopic distal salpingectomy because of bilateral oviduct and ovarian cysts 2 years previously. Her menstrual cycle was regular. She had undergone IVF-ET in December 2017 because of tubal-factor infertility caused by bilateral salpingectomy. Two fresh embryos had been transferred. Transvaginal ultrasonography had revealed a dichorionic and diamniotic twin pregnancy with normal cardiac activity and gestational sac situated in a normal uterine cavity. The subsequent course of prenatal care was uneventful. She had no other medical, surgical, or gynecological history.\nOn admission to our hospital, the patient was in a semi-recumbent position and could not lay down. Her pulse rate was 120 to 140 beats per minute. Her blood pressure varied from 110/70 to 120/80 mm Hg, and her respiratory rate varied from 20 to 25 breaths per minute. Her body temperature was normal. She did not appear pale or feel faint. An abdominal examination revealed mild tenderness in the upper abdomen and a firm abdomen. We did not detect uterine contractions or increased uterine tone. The fetal heart rate was >160 beats per minute. A vaginal examination showed that the cervix was closed, and the fetal membrane was intact. There was no evidence of bleeding or abnormal discharge.\nEmergent ultrasonography showed two live fetuses, one in a cephalic presentation and the other in a scapular presentation.

As a child he reported trying to build a good relationship with his physical education teachers, so they would feel pity for him and he could avoid any strenuous physical activities (PA). He experienced three severe episodes of rhabdomyolyses in his life. The first one happened during childhood, which followed vigorous physical activities. The second rhabdomyolysis episode was at the age of 18 following multiple squats, which he performed during a physical test for military service. Not qualifying for the military service, instead he had to complete a civilian service at the university hospital at the age of 22. As he was clearly weaker than his colleagues, a diagnostic investigation took place, which included a skeletal muscle biopsy. At that time, doctors advised him to avoid excessive physical effort. He was told about the second wind phenomenon; however, it was not explained how to reach it. Additionally, he was recommended to eat a maximum of 20% of his daily food intake in carbohydrates. However, the rest of the macronutrients recommendations were not specified. In the following years, his physical activity level decreased, leading to physical deconditioning, loss of muscle mass, and increase in fatty adipose tissue and body weight.\nThe third rhabdomyolysis episode was experienced one year ago and was nearly fatal. He was undergoing physical assessment for the insurance company and pushed himself too hard, resulting in a severe contracture of his lower back muscles. He was admitted to hospital.

    "original_text": "A 5-month-old boy was referred to us for further examination of his right upper-eyelid tumor. The tumor was 8 mm in diameter and observed in the upper eyelid (fig. ). According to his parents, the tumor was first noticed at the child's birth. As the patient could open his eye, it was assumed that the tumor most likely would not affect the visual development in his right eye. Therefore, at that time, we decided that a follow-up examination was the best option for the patient. However, due to a gradual enlargement of the tumor, the patient returned 2 years later and underwent further evaluation (fig. ). At the time of the follow-up examination, the tumor exhibited a distinct boundary and was 12 mm in size. Physical examination revealed that there was no pain or any inflammatory reaction in the lid. When observed from the side of the palpebral conjunctiva, the tumor was found to be buried beneath a portion of the tarsal plate and showed a translucent configuration (fig. ). A T2-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination demonstrated that the tumor was well demarcated from the surrounding tissue. This uniformly high-intensity lesion was 12 mm (height) \u00d7 12 mm (width) \u00d7 8 mm (depth) in size, with the lesion observed to be in direct contact with the tarsal plate (fig. ). Since the tumor caused blepharoptosis in the patient's right eye, this subsequently led to oblique astigmatism. Therefore, 2 months later, it was decided to surgically remove the mass lesion. The wall of the tumor was easily separated from the surrounding connective tissues, with the exception of the portion where the tarsal plate was attached. As a result, the tumor was completely removed along with a round defect of the tarsal plate (fig. ). Pathological examination showed that the tumor was composed of a thin wall and contained a transparent liquid.

We performed ultrasound sonography, revealing a bulky tumor in the thyroid gland and multiple bilateral cervical lymphadenopathies. We performed fine-needle aspiration cytology from both the thyroid tumor and the cervical lymph node, both of which revealed SCC. We found no primary tumor in the pharynx, larynx, or esophagus with laryngoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, nor could we discover any primary tumor in the trachea using bronchoscopy. We discovered a bulky thyroid tumor and bilateral cervical lymph nodes involved in the common carotid artery and brachiocephalic artery using computed tomography (CT) with contrast effect (Fig. ). Using FDG-positron emission tomography/CT, we found FDG uptake in the thyroid, the bilateral cervical lymph nodes, the lungs, the mediastinal lymph nodes, and the vertebra (Fig. ). We diagnosed the patient with stage IVC primary SCC in the thyroid and initiated treatment with weekly paclitaxel. He received chemotherapy weekly at 90 mg/m2 according to a 6 weeks on/2 weeks off schedule.\nFour months after the initiation of treatment, the objective response obtained from CT presented a stable disease. However, a slightly enlarged tumor resulted in dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia, which led to the patient's death. We performed an autopsy according to the patient's wishes. On a macroscopic level, we found that the greater part of the thyroid was replaced by carcinoma.

The pain was associated with rhinorrhea in the right nostril and obvious conjunctival injection in the right eye without oedema. The patient was extremely restless and absolutely nothing he could do would relieve the pain. He was treated with a greater occipital nerve block comprising 40 mg methylprednisolone and 20 mg bupivacaine. The nerve block afforded him complete pain relief within minutes and lasted for 12 months. The block was repeated on two occasions, each time providing relief for a further 6 months. Subsequently, the frequency and intensity of the headaches subsided and by mid-2016 he was free of any headache for the next 2.5 years. Apart from a past history of an abdominal aortic aneurysm which was operated on, he was otherwise healthy. His family history was unremarkable.\nThe patient presented to the pain clinic again in July 2019 after suffering for 6 months from a new constant stabbing pain radiating from the back of the right side of his head to the right side of both the vertex and forehead, right ear and towards the jaw.

In turn, the second pathological fracture involved the left patella visibly changed by multiple osteolytic lesions (). Further multiple osteolytic lesions were in fact found on the left tibia and the left pubic and sciatic bone.\nGiven the history of parathyroid adenoma, disseminated brown tumours were suspected.

An inferior vena cava filter was implanted prior to surgery, given a history of inferior vena cava and bilateral common iliac vein thrombosis.\nThe procedure performed was closed reduction and internal fixation (CRIF) with a proximal femoral nail. A tissue sample was obtained for histopathology, the results sustaining the initial diagnosis of pathological fracture reflecting the presence of a brown tumour.\nAs the surgery was not followed by further complications, the patient was discharged home in a good overall state.

The chest wall defect was reconstructed by using a Mersilene mesh, secured by interrupted pericostal stitches, and covered by a sufficient volume of viable muscles. The postoperative course was uneventful; the radiographic aspect at discharge was normal (). The first symptoms in the form of pains in the region of the incision appeared five months after the operation, and computer tomography (CT) of the thorax showed a lung hernia in the region of the mesh covering the chest wall defect (Figures and ). The patient refused the proposed surgical correction, being only slightly limited in usual daily activities. During the next several months, the symptoms persisted with variable intensity under analgesic therapy, till the moment when pains significantly limited patient's daily activities, 22 months after the operation. The repeated chest CT showed a slight increase in hernia size, with no signs of tumour recurrence (), so that reoperation was planned.\nAfter the excision of the previous skin scar and the incision of the muscular layer, the mesh region was exposed, showing a lung protrusion (4 \u00d7 3 cm) along the anterolateral edge of the mesh (). The local situation is schematically presented on . The mesh suture line in the hernia region was completely disrupted, with a small piece of the herniated lung being completely detached from the mesh, the remaining lung surface under the mesh area being fully adherent to the mesh. By careful dissection, the mesh was separated from a firmly adherent lung and removed (). After adhaesiolysis and complete lung liberation, a wedge resection of the afunctional lung tissue of the superior segment of the lingula was done, just in the region of contact with the mesh. After the chest tube insertion, the chest wall defect was reconstructed by suturing a Mersilene mesh in two",

Her external and internal genitalia, including the cervix, were normal except for the 6 cm accessory cavitated left uterine mass suggestive of hematometra that is compressing the urinary bladder without any other genitourinary system pathologies shown on ultrasound examination (). Diagnostic hysteroscopy revealed a single cervix without any vaginal malformations and a relatively small uterine cavity with right tubal ostium and without left tubal ostium.

Evaluation of the abdominal cavity revealed a left non-communicating rudimentary horn tightly residing on the lateral abdominal wall and two grossly normal ovaries and tubes ().

However, neither endometriosis nor any prior tubal or abdominal operation history was noted.\nFirst, to remove the fallopian tubes from the left uterine horn, they were coagulated and divided by careful tissue transection. Second, the vesicouterine peritoneum was divided to create the bladder flap from the cervix and the left uterine horn.
