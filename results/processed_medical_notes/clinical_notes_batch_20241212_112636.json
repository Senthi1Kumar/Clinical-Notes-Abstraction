The parents also noticed intermittent distension of his abdomen which subsided after vomiting. The symptoms seemed to commence after the child had swallowed a metallic pendant which was coin-shaped and about 12 mm in diameter; at the time of swallowing, the child was about 17 months old. He underwent repeated plain upright radiographs of the abdomen to localize the foreign body and to determine whether it had been passed. However, these continued to detect the foreign body. The last plain radiograph (Figure ) of his abdomen showed the foreign body to be located in the right lower quadrant and it was surmised that the intestinal obstruction was due to impaction of the foreign body in the region of the terminal ileum. The child's parents were therefore advised that their child needed to undergo surgery for relief of the obstruction. However, a review of the plain upright radiograph of the abdomen showed the presence of a 'double bubble sign', in addition to a few dilated loops of small bowel in the left upper quadrant. A pre-operative diagnosis of duodenal obstruction was made with the possibility of another obstructive lesion in the small bowel. The foreign body was presumed to be lodged somewhere in the ileal loops. The child was then subjected to exploratory laparotomy. During surgery, his stomach and proximal duodenum were found to be grossly dilated with thickening of their walls, and an annular pancreas was detected encircling the second part of the duodenum. In addition, there was a membrane with a small aperture in the duodenum. Surprisingly, the metallic pendant was found lodged in the duodenum along with lot of debris including berry seeds. The third part of the duodenum was mobilized and duodenoduodenostomy was performed without dividing the pancreas.",

Her pregnancy had been uneventful, and she reported no digestive symptoms until 26 weeks of gestation.\nHer examination revealed a swollen, hard, and immobile left supraclavicular lymph node.

Upon examination the patient was moderately built and had a normal intellect.\nThe intraoral examinaton revealed a bony enlargement extending from median mandible to the retromolar region, and inferior border of the mandible to the crestal marginal level. The depth of the left vestibul sulcus was thoroughyl decreased due to hard bony expansion. The extraoral examination revealed hard uniform and large expansile mass in the left side of the mandible.

She achieved normal milestones till the age of 6 years. Her past medical history was significant for psoriasis, controlled by topical medications. Dietary history revealed a normal intake of a balanced nonvegetarian diet.\nOn examination, she was noted to have skin lesions due to mild psoriasis. There were no phenotypic features of Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) which is PHP type 1a. Her weight was 25.8 kg (50th percentile for age and sex), height 131 cm (75th percentile for age and sex), with a height velocity of 4.25 cm/year. Examination of her lower limbs showed a painful right hip with minimal shortening and restricted external rotation. Biochemical investigations revealed low serum calcium and high alkaline phosphatase []. The liver enzymes, coagulation screen, renal function tests, serum phosphorus, serum albumin, and serum magnesium were all within normal limits. Radiological investigations showed grade 2 SCFE on the right side and grade 1 on the left side according to Southwick's classification [Figures and ]. Clinically, she had stable slips according to Loder's classification.\nThe operative treatment planned was in situ pinning of both hips using cannulated screws. The right hip was operated on within 24 h of presentation and the asymptomatic left hip was operated 2 weeks later. Due to her small bony anatomy, 5 mm cannulated screws were used for fixation on both sides. The procedure was otherwise similar to the technique described by Loder. The early postoperative recovery was uneventful and postoperative radiographs were satisfactory.

The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a lesion in the anterior neck slightly left of midline, with a second cystic structure incidentally found within the FOM (). The initial differential for these masses included dermoid cyst, epidermoid or rare intestinal foregut cyst. Interestingly, the anterior neck mass showed evidence of a connection to the FOM mass, but no connection to the foramen cecum. As such, TGDC was lower on the differential. An ultrasound again revealed a midline cystic mass extending to the FOM with features suggestive of a dermoid cyst. On repeat physical exam, a small cystic mass in the FOM was palpated, without any obstruction of the oral cavity or airway. Surgical excision of both lesions was recommended. The patient was initially lost to follow up and returned for reassessment at 4 years of age. At that time, there was incremental change in the size of the lesions.\nA transcervical approach was utilized and dissection of the midline neck mass revealed a tract extending anterior to the hyoid bone towards the FOM. Because of the close proximity with the hyoid bone, the decision was made to remove the midportion of the hyoid. Once dissection was carried through the mylohyoid, the tract was found to be in continuity with the FOM cyst. There was no evidence of a connection with the base of tongue/foramen cecum. The final specimen revealed a 3.0 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 1.8 cm mass with a 2 cm long tract connecting to the second 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 0.8 cm mass ().

The patient had significant atrophy of the right thigh, calf, and foot with an asymmetry in his shoe size with the right foot being three US shoe sizes smaller than the right. In December 2010, the patient presented to neurosurgical attention with progressive complaints of proximal right lower extremity pain, muscle spasms, and gait difficulty.\nThe patient's examination revealed a significant asymmetry in size as the measured circumference at the distal thigh was 53.5 cm at the left thigh versus 50.5 cm in the right thigh, 43 cm in the left calf versus 42 cm in the right calf. The length of his foot from the great toe to the heel was 27 cm in the left foot and 24 cm on the right foot. He had normal strength in the left lower extremity.

Orthodontic treatment and the OBS technique were indicated to realign the maxillary teeth and to relocate the implant in a good position, compatible with a screw-retained restoration, and to prevent a worsening implant position due to the continuous alveolar growth. A provisional screwed crown was made during the orthodontic preparation for esthetic considerations, but the restoration was too wide and the screw was positioned on the buccal side (Fig. ).\nThe orthodontic treatment of the malocclusion was carried out and .021x.025 SSW were placed on both arches with additional hooks on the lower arch (Fig. ).

    "original_text": "A 51-year-old woman had lost consciousness while working at a pachinko parlour. She was a never-smoker and had no relevant medical history. She was transported to our hospital by ambulance and had regained consciousness somewhat but was still in somnolent state with limited orientation. On admission, the systolic blood pressure was 92 mmHg, the heart rate was increased at 98 b.p.m., and the Glasgow coma scale score was E3V4M6; she was in a pre-shock state. Blood testing revealed normal findings, including normal troponin T levels. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a significant pericardial effusion, but the wall motion and valve function were normal. Chest X-ray showed enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. We suspected aortic dissection because of the pericardial effusion and performed three-dimensional contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). It revealed two large aneurysms (27 and 31 mm in size) on the anterior wall of the PA (). We suspected CPAF with aneurysm. The blood pressure continued dropping despite the use of a vasopressor. Therefore, pericardial puncture was performed after endotracheal intubation; 400 mL of blood was drained and the blood pressure increased. Subsequently, we performed coronary angiography to determine the definitive diagnosis and the possibility of endovascular treatment.\nCoronary angiography showed an aneurysm of a CPAF originating from the left anterior descending artery (LAD) (). The right coronary artery was normal. Although leakage of contrast from the aneurysm was not confirmed, we suspected that the cardiac tamponade was caused by rupture of the CPAF aneurysm. Regarding the treatment options, we considered that the blood flow from the PA side could not be blocked with a covered stent and that coil embolization would be necessary if we selected endovascular treatment.

In the past, he had identical complaints of dizziness one and half months back after falling off his bicycle. His parents had a nonconsanguineous marriage. There was a positive family history with his father suffering premature cardiovascular death at the age of 35 years.\nOn presentation to the clinic, he was in a hemodynamically stable state. Neurological evaluation was normal without any complaints of weakness, positive Babinski sign, or sensory involvement. He was admitted on the floor for thorough evaluation for his vertigo. Local causes of vertigo were ruled out on initial evaluation by an ear, nose, and throat consultation. Ophthalmology evaluation was done to rule out causes of raised intracranial tension, which showed no evidence of papilloedema on indirect ophthalmoscopy. The patient was reviewed anthropometrically which showed an increased arm length more than height.\nThe patient suddenly became drowsy along with complaints of right-sided weakness and continuous hiccups with high fever spikes, thus he was shifted to pediatric intensive care unit and his neurological assessment showed upper motor neuron facial nerve palsy as evident from right-sided hemiparesis.\nThe magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral cerebellar non-hemorrhagic infarcts.

Arterial hypertension, which was well controlled by the antihypertensive drug amlodipine, was the only known comorbidity. Serological investigations including serology for Lyme borreliosis, antinuclear antibodies, antibodies for anti-dsDNA, rheumatoid factor, and uric acid were negative or within normal limits, and the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis was established. After therapies with oral methotrexate and cyclosporine had proved ineffective in controlling joint and skin symptoms, a therapy with tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) antagonists was initiated. Both subcutaneous etanercept at a dose of 2 \u00d7 25 mg/week over 6 months and subcutaneous adalimumab at a dose of 40 mg every other week over 4 months were discontinued because of insufficient improvement of skin and joint symptoms. In June 2008, intravenous therapy with infliximab (5 mg/kg every 8 weeks) was initiated. Two months into therapy joint and skin symptoms were greatly improved, with a reduction of the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index from 23.4 prior to infliximab therapy (Fig. ) to 3.9, and the therapeutic effect could be maintained throughout the following months of therapy (Fig. ).\nIn January 2009, 1 month after the fourth infusion, the patient noticed weakness of the left arm and right leg with hypesthesia in the absence of other accompanying symptoms such as fever or bladder or bowel incontinence. The patient's family history was negative for multiple sclerosis (MS) and other acute or chronic inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS) diseases.\nNeurological examination revealed a paresis of 4/5 strength at the proximal right leg and 3/5 at the distal right leg.

Other organ examinations were normal. He was emergently transferred to operating room where fluoroscopic study was done.\nAbout 7 cm of the distal radius and 5 cm of the distal ulna were missing. Amputated part included proximal carpal row. Both the amputated part and proximal stump were extremely contaminated. Soft tissues were evaluated. In amputated part, there was no other injury distal-to-amputation level. Flexor and extensor tendons were cut at wrist level. Radial artery was not usable, but ulnar artery had 3 cm healthy stump. Ulnar nerve was cut 3 cm proximal to wrist and had less longitudinal damage than median nerve which was cut at about the carpal bones. Proximal stump showed much more damage. Remained ulna was 2 cm longer than radius. Some flexor and extensor muscles and tendons seemed viable, especially at the ulnar side of forearm. Median nerve had more longitudinal damage than ulnar nerve. Proximal stump of radial and ulnar arteries was damaged up to 5 m proximal to radius amputation level.\nPrimary replantation was not feasible because of the extent of contamination and large vascular gap. We decided to preserve the amputated part, because it was almost not injured distal-to-amputation level (Figs. , ).\nAfter complete debridement of all visible foreign bodies and crushed soft tissues of the amputated part under magnification, right leg was selected for banking (see \u201c\u201d).

The fragment of tooth 11 was found immediately after the traumatic dental injury and was stored in mineral water. The patient and his guardian promptly visited his general practitioner, who performed splinting from self-cure resin from tooth 53 to 63, performed direct pulp capping, and referred the patient to our department for further treatment.\nAn intraoral examination showed the presence of splinting only from tooth 21 to 63 and a complicated fracture of tooth 11 (A). The patient mentioned the partial loss of splinting within a short time after emergency treatment. In the maxillary right central incisor, the fracture was oblique, extending in the apical direction from the labial to palatal surface. The margin on the palatal surface was 2 mm above the marginal gingiva (B). The maxillary left central incisor displayed first-grade mobility even with the presence of splinting, but the patient denied any discomfort or pain. The percussion of the upper incisor was not painful, as well as the palpation of alveolar bone. The thermal sensitivity (cold) tests were positive for both central incisors and comparable to adjacent teeth, so a pulpal diagnosis of normal pulp was made. The diagnostic X-rays showed the presence of crown-root fracture (class III according to Ellis classification of dental traumatic injuries []) of immature tooth 21 (class IV according to Cvek\u2019s classification of root development []), which was located subgingivally all around; therefore, it was not possible to locate the exact path of the fracture line ( and A).

He had a wide local excision done following a confirmatory biopsy for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). No adjuvant therapy was recommended on account of clear surgical margins and the absence of distant metastases. The lesion recurred after two years and re-excision was performed. A second recurrence occurred in a year, which involved the knee joint, necessitating a transfemoral amputation. The surgical margin was clear and there was no evidence of distance metastases. He was rehabilitated and started walking with a prosthetic limb.\nTwo years after the second recurrence, the disease recurred in the left lower limb stump. At this point, a re-biopsy was done and DFSP was confirmed (Figure ). There was no fibrosarcomatous transformation. Immunohistochemistry was positive for CD34 (Figure ), focally positive for actin, and negative for desmin and S100 protein. Metastatic workup, consisting of chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound, was negative. He commenced imatinib mesylate at a recommended dose of 400 mg twice daily. The recurrent lesion on the left lower limb stump gradually progressed in size after five months of imatinib mesylate treatment, and he eventually developed multiple lesions on the posterior torso.\nHe was then referred to the National Radiotherapy Oncology and Nuclear Medicine Centre, Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra. Physical examination showed a 15 x 12 cm mobile mass on the left lower limb stump and two palpable, firm, and fixed lesions on the posterior torso; the largest measuring 9 x 7 cm in size.

An uneventful DSAEK was performed on his right eye. After donor graft insertion, an air bubble was injected into the anterior chamber for graft apposition and kept for 5 min at the pressure between 20 and 30 mmHg, followed by exchanging air with a balanced salt solution. At the end of the procedure, a residual air bubble filling 50% of the anterior chamber volume was left. On the second postoperative day, the graft was partially detached, so it was decided to re-bubble the anterior chamber with air. After re-bubbling, the graft remained well centered and completely attached. Postoperative standard medications included fluoroquinolones eye drops four times a day for 2 weeks and prednisolone acetate eye drops 1% four times daily for a month, then to be tapered accordingly. After the initial visual improvement, at five months post-operatively, the patient began complaining about worsening of visual acuity. At that time, the cornea was slightly edematous with no sign of postoperative anterior chamber inflammation. However, ten months following DSAEK, the corneal graft became cloudy and corneal decompensation was diagnosed. Upon slit-lamp examination, in addition to corneal decompensation, central IOL opacification confined to the pupillary zone of the anterior IOL surface was found. The patient subsequently underwent penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) with IOL exchange. During the surgery, the opacified IOL was explanted from the bag and a new IOL was implanted in the ciliary sulcus because of suspected damage to the capsular zonules.\nThe explanted IOL was then imaged by optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy to investigate the morphology of the surface opacification and its chemical composition.

Histological examination confirmed EMPD with negative margins and lymph nodes. She did not receive adjuvant therapy but remained disease-free for five years until computer tomography (CT) revealed a 24 \u00d7 17 mm tumor in the right pelvic floor. The recurrent tumor was resected, and the patient remained disease free for the next three years.\nIn March 2010, a CT scan demonstrated multiple enlarged pelvic, para-aortic, and mesenteric lymph nodes, which were suspicious for metastasis, as well as nodules in the lingulare superius of the left lung and segment VIII in the liver. Immunohistochemical analysis of a tumor specimen taken from the second surgery demonstrated diffuse positive staining for gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15) as an antibody specific with EMPD and also strongly positive (3+) staining for human epidermal growth factor receptor protein 2 (HER2) (). We administered trastuzumab as monotherapy because she was of advanced age, at a loading dose of 8 mg/kg i.v., followed by a 6 mg/kg maintenance dose every three weeks according to a protocol for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancers []. The patient experienced a moderate headache and flushing during the first infusion, but had no adverse effects during subsequent infusions as she was pretreated with ibuprofen and d-chlorpheniramine maleate.\nIn August 2010, the third trastuzumab infusion achieved a partial response as evidenced by decreases in the measurements of the pelvic, para-aortic, and mesenteric lymph nodes by CT scan.

He had a wide local excision done following a confirmatory biopsy for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). No adjuvant therapy was recommended on account of clear surgical margins and the absence of distant metastases. The lesion recurred after two years and re-excision was performed. A second recurrence occurred in a year, which involved the knee joint, necessitating a transfemoral amputation. The surgical margin was clear and there was no evidence of distance metastases. He was rehabilitated and started walking with a prosthetic limb.\nTwo years after the second recurrence, the disease recurred in the left lower limb stump. At this point, a re-biopsy was done and DFSP was confirmed (Figure ). There was no fibrosarcomatous transformation. Immunohistochemistry was positive for CD34 (Figure ), focally positive for actin, and negative for desmin and S100 protein. Metastatic workup, consisting of chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound, was negative. He commenced imatinib mesylate at a recommended dose of 400 mg twice daily. The recurrent lesion on the left lower limb stump gradually progressed in size after five months of imatinib mesylate treatment, and he eventually developed multiple lesions on the posterior torso.\nHe was then referred to the National Radiotherapy Oncology and Nuclear Medicine Centre, Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra. Physical examination showed a 15 x 12 cm mobile mass on the left lower limb stump and two palpable, firm, and fixed lesions on the posterior torso; the largest measuring 9 x 7 cm in size.

Anorexia, heartburn, sensation of postparandial fullness, nausea-vomiting, early satiety and a 10 kg weight loss were among the other signs and symptoms experienced over the previous year. She was prescribed omeprazol and clidinium C with no significant improvement. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation of worsening symptoms. On physical examination, the vital signs were stable, with no abnormal findings observed in the lungs, heart and extremities. The epigastric area was tender without guarding or detection of a mass. During her hospital course, the patient had two episodes of melena. Laboratory data were remarkable for the following results ().\nThe patient underwent an endoscopic evaluation.

    "original_text": "A 24-year-old woman from a Middle Eastern country presented to the Jefferson Pancreas, Biliary and Related Cancer Center for evaluation of a recurrent pancreatic mass. She complained of right upper quadrant fullness, and physical examination revealed a remote right subcostal incision. At the age of 12 years, she had first developed decreased appetite, weight loss, fatigue, pruritus, and subsequently became jaundiced. Medical records from that episode revealed that an endoscopic biliary stent was placed with surgical exploration through a right subcostal incision and partial resection/enucleation of a pancreatic mass. In the intervening 12 years, the mass had persisted and enlarged, although the patient was asymptomatic, having neither anorexia, pruritus, nor jaundice.\nRoutine hematology and basic chemistry panels were normal. The tumor marker cancer antigen 19-9 was mildly elevated at 89 U/mL (<35 U/mL). An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast revealed an 8.2 \u00d7 7.6 cm heterogeneous-enhancing lesion, prominently involving the uncinate process of the pancreas (). The pancreatic head and neck were displaced and splayed around the anterior aspect of the tumor. The mass abutted the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) as well as the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). There was no evidence of main pancreatic ductal dilatation and the pancreatic neck, body, and tail were normal. Imaging showed no evidence of metastatic disease to the liver or regional lymph nodes. The mass was believed to be an SPT, based on the previous partial resection and the accompanying pathology report.\nThe patient underwent an open cholecystectomy and a difficult classic pancreaticoduodenectomy. The operative time was 12 h and the estimated intraoperative blood loss was 1500 mL.

    "cleaned_text": "a 24-year-old woman from a middle eastern country presented to the jefferson pancreas, biliary and related cancer center for evaluation of a recurrent pancreatic mass. she complained of right upper quadrant fullness, and physical examination revealed a remote right subcostal incision. at the age of 12 years, she had first developed decreased appetite, weight loss, fatigue, pruritus, and subsequently became jaundiced. medical records from that episode revealed that an endoscopic biliary stent was placed with surgical exploration through a right subcostal incision and partial resection/enucleation of a pancreatic mass. in the intervening 12 years, the mass had persisted and enlarged, although the patient was asymptomatic, having neither anorexia, pruritus, nor jaundice.\nroutine hematology and basic chemistry panels were normal. the tumor marker cancer antigen 19-9 was mildly elevated at 89 u/ml (<35 u/ml). an abdominal computed tomography (ct) scan with contrast revealed an 8.2 \u00d7 7.6 cm heterogeneous-enhancing lesion, prominently involving the uncinate process of the pancreas (). the pancreatic head and neck were displaced and splayed around the anterior aspect of the tumor. the mass abutted the superior mesenteric vein (smv) as well as the superior mesenteric artery (sma). there was no evidence of main pancreatic ductal dilatation and the pancreatic neck, body, and tail were normal. imaging showed no evidence of metastatic disease to the liver or regional lymph nodes. the mass was believed to be an spt, based on the previous partial resection and the accompanying pathology report.\nthe patient underwent an open cholecystectomy and a difficult classic pancreaticoduodenectomy. the operative time was 12 h and the estimated intraoperative blood loss was 1500 ml. there was no evidence of metastasis, but the tumor had adhered extensively to the smv and portal vein and surrounded the sma. we were able to accomplish the separation of the tumor from the venous structures without incident; however, separating the tumor from the sma proved challenging",

She has had three consecutive deliveries of dead achondroplastic babies and had no living child. The vaginal bleeding was moderate, and there was no dizziness or fainting spells. There was no history of bleeding from other sites, abdominal pain, trauma, fever, dysuria, vaginal discharge, or chronic cough. She was not known to be hypertensive or diabetic. She had no history of surgery or radiation exposure. There was no family history of achondroplasia.\nThe index pregnancy was spontaneously conceived and was supported by her husband, who was a 34-year-old trader. She booked at a gestational age of 13 weeks in a private hospital and her booking parameters were said to be normal.

Her past medical history was significant for dyslipidemia and peptic ulcer disease, and her surgical history included a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral hip replacements.\nShe underwent a left thyroidectomy for thyroid nodules measuring up to 4 cm, followed by a total thyroidectomy after the initial pathology diagnosed follicular thyroid carcinoma. She subsequently underwent RAI ablation. There was early suspicion that her disease might be non-iodine sensitive, as her thyroglobulin continued to increase. Despite RAI treatment, multiple pulmonary parenchymal metastases and enlarging mediastinal lymph nodes were discovered.

During cycle 1, she developed an acute, severe episode of chest pain that resulted in hospitalization. Diagnostic investigations did not show a clear etiology for this pain, and it resolved with conservative management. As cardiac toxicity is a known potential risk with regorafenib, she was dose reduced to 120 mg daily with cycle length remaining the same. The 120 mg dose was tolerated well until cycle 4 when she developed grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (HFS). Regorafenib was then further dose reduced to 80 mg daily.

The patient signed an informed consent before accessing our services and was actively admitted in the research study (Supplementary Material S1). He referred a slowly but progressive growing during the latest year. In anamnesis he referred no previous illnesses, moreover SLE was under control. He denied allergies and he was not up-taking any therapy. Moreover, he was not under immuno-modulatory treatment. He suffered from a similar mass growth previously, located nearby the current area in his frontal bone and which was surgically excised two years before in local anesthesia, because diagnosed as FD. He reported neither neurological symptom, nor even recurrent headaches.\nThe patient had a CT-scan suggested to assess a sclerotic form of FD, which resulted in a ground-glass appearance of a homogenous matrix expansion within the skeleton, affecting both bone plaques, particularly the external cortex (Report in Supplementary Materials S2). Imaging was unable to assess any presumptive diagnosis; a pathology investigation was attempted to exclude the existence of a malignant neoplasm underneath. Therefore, the patient was evaluated by fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and optical immuno-staining, which excluded the presence of CD138+ cells for multiple myeloma diagnosis (Supplementary Material S3). Furthermore, the histological analysis described a diffuse sclerosis and complete resorption of bone, characterized by intra-trabecular fibrosis.

She reported smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day starting at age 13 but quit smoking in 2011. The patient denied excessive use of caffeine or alcohol and denied any illicit substance use. The time between visits was approximately 1 month.\nShe presented to an outpatient behavioral health clinic for an initial appointment () with the following medication regimen: valproic acid 1000 mg extended-release at bedtime for bipolar I disorder, clonazepam 0.5 mg twice daily as needed for panic disorder, insulin lispro 5 units 3 times daily before meals and insulin glargine 18 units at bedtime for type 1 diabetes, and levothyroxine 100 mcg daily for hypothyroidism (). The patient's primary concern for this visit was her SPS, which she believed was being exacerbated by her uncontrolled panic disorder and vice versa. During this visit, she described stiffening episodes during which she could not move her legs because they felt \u201ctoo heavy\u201d and was stuck midstride. The patient presented with tremors, stiffness, and jerking movements throughout her appointment. She used a quad cane and could walk steadily.\nDuring the initial appointment, fluoxetine 10 mg daily and hydroxyzine 25 mg as needed were added to her medication regimen. During the second visit, she presented with less anxiety. Because the fluoxetine seemed to be improving symptoms related to mood and anxiety, it was increased to 20 mg daily.
