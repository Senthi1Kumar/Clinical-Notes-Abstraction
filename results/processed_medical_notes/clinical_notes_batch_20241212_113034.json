He had no known medical illnesses and was well until the evening prior to presentation, at which time he developed obvious right-sided chest pain radiating to his ipsilateral shoulder with persistent chest tightness. This tightness was described as sticking in nature, significantly worse on deep inspiration and with movement, and relieved by leaning forward or lying down. There was an associated dry cough but no hemoptysis. There was no history of trauma, injury, difficulty in breathing, or palpitations. He was tall and thin and described himself as otherwise quite healthy. He had never previously been admitted to a hospital. He reported no significant chronic medical history, such as primary hypertension, any type of heart disease, disturbed microcirculation, peripheral neuropathy, diabetes mellitus, an impaired immune system, malignancies, leukemia, the long-term administration of corticosteroids, liver cirrhosis, renal failure, urinary tract infection, or hemodialysis. He also reported no history of infection, such as tuberculosis, any type of hepatitis, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). There was no prior history of traumas, blood transfusions, surgical procedures, or other serious events in his medical history. He had not lived in an epidemic area and had no history of toxin or radioactive exposure. He denied a personal or family history of bleeding diathesis but reported a 10-year history of smoking 8\u201310 cigarettes per day. He was an office worker by occupation. He had experienced similar symptoms on one occasion 4 years previously.

The patient reported progressive pain without symptoms of spinal cord compression for 1 month prior to admission.

PET images revealed highly metabolized areas of the liver, indicating likely recurrence of HCC on the grafted liver.\nThe patient exhibited poor liver function due to anatomic stenosis after LT, requiring treatment via stent placement surgery. Due to this decrease in liver function, immediate surgical intervention was not chosen as a treatment for metastasis to the T12 vertebra and suspected recurrence of HCC. Instead, radiation therapy of the affected area was performed to alleviate clinical symptoms. After radiation, the patient reported a significant improvement in pain symptoms and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, a tumor marker for HCC (normal range: < 20 ng/L), quickly returned to normal. However, a month after irradiation, the patient exhibited extremely high serum AFP levels (2526.5 ng/L), indicating a potential recurrence of HCC.\nA follow up PET scan showed no metastasis to the grafted liver or other organs, though the T12 lesion was found to have increased in size, indicating progressive disease after radiation therapy.

    "original_text": "A 26-year-old woman was admitted to our department with dysphagia resulting from an anastomotic stricture following esophageal replacement with the colon. The patient was subjected to operation due to the presence of an esophageal stromal tumor in 2008. Following the operation, she was treated with continued balloon dilatation (14, 18 mm) for 40 days. There was no distinct improvement in the swallowing function by the patient. Six months following the operation, the patient underwent esophageal stent placement. Due to complications of the stent to remain stably positioned in the esophagus, the esophageal stent placement was unsuccessful. To circumvent these issues, the patient underwent an operation designed to repair the anastomostic stricture with paltysma myocutaneous flaps at the end of 2008. Despite the previously mentioned attempts to overcome the impaired swallowing function, the patient oral nutrient intake remained inadequate. The gastroscopy demonstrated that the anastomotic stricture presented with severe scarring. The diameter of the anastomosis was limited to approximately 0.5 cm.

The patient was referred 2 years post trauma to a wound centre as the wound had failed to heal after 6 months of treatment by his General Practitioner.\nAt the wound centre the patient received treatment for a non-healing ulcer by means of various ointments, honey and dressings, with a view to referral for skin transplantation if the wound did not heal satisfactorily. It is noted that the patient was not diabetic and did not have any cardiovascular risk factors but was undergoing follow-up for aortastenosis and polycythemia vera. There was initially improvement in the wound over an approximately six-month period, but due to the return of hypergranulation tissue, increasing size of the wound and a request from the patient, a punch biopsy of the wound was taken which confirmed basal cell carcinoma. The patient was referred to The Department of Plastic Surgery and Breast Surgery, Roskilde Hospital for excision of the carcinoma. The ulcer, approximately 4 cm in diameter (), was surgically excised with a 5 mm margin, without the use of frozen sections, and covered with a split thickness skin transplant. The histology showed an ulcerated basal cell carcinoma of nodular type, with growth deep into the dermis, but not involving the subcutaneous tissue. Histology also showed that the BCC was radically removed. Post-operative control included follow up in the Plastic Surgery clinic for approximately one month. After the skin transplant healed the patient was discharged from follow up in our clinic to yearly control at his Dermatologist. There has been no local recurrence of the BCC. The patient was subsequently diagnosed, with diabetes mellitus type two (DMT2) and started treatment with dietary changes and exercise.",

Laboratory testing was notable for anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP). CMV viral load was positive with a titer of 3.6 log10 IU/ml and valganciclovir therapy was initiated as a result. Morning cortisol level was substantially suppressed at 0.6mcg/dL, and, due to concern for adrenal insufficiency, stress dose hydrocortisone was administered, followed by conversion to prednisone taper.

Clinical examination revealed bruise on the chin, open mouth appearance with profuse bleeding from the oral cavity and derangement of occlusion []. Step deformity with tenderness and mobility was elicited along the lower border of the mandible on the left side canine region. Preoperative orthopantamogram (OPG) could not be taken due to the profuse bleeding needing immediate intervention.\nUnder sedation, upper and lower arch alginate impressions were taken and stone casts were poured. An open occlusal acrylic splint was fabricated [], and under general anesthesia, the mandibular body fracture was immobilized, fixed with the acrylic splint which was retained by circum mandibular wiring [Figures and ]. Patient was reviewed every week, and on the third postoperative week, the circum-mandibular wiring and splint was removed under local anesthesia. No mobility was present at the fracture site. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and occlusion achieved was satisfactory, although spacing was seen in incisor\u2013canine region []. Patient was reviewed monthly for 6 months. On 2 months follow-up, the spacing had closed and the child had good alignment of teeth []. Patient had perfect occlusion and good masticatory efficiency.\nFacial fractures in children account for the approximately 5% of all facial fractures.[] A male predilection is seen in all age groups. The most common fracture in children requiring hospitalization and/or surgery generally involves the mandible and, in particular, the condyle. Fractures in the condylar region are the most common, followed by angle and body fractures.

The patient recounted that the pain and tightness was only on the right side of her neck, radiating to the back of her head. It was worse with movement and progressed to the point where the pain limited her range of motion, causing her to present to the hospital. Shortly before this, she had been diagnosed with chronic serous otitis media associated with hearing loss, for which she had tympanostomy tubes placed. Following the surgery, she developed malodorous drainage from the ear, which continued up to her current presentation, despite treatment with otic drops. Her past medical history was unremarkable. She denied dizziness, headache, vision changes, dysphagia, or other facial pain.\nThe initial computed tomography scan was concerning for acute right mastoiditis, with erosion of the skull and the first cervical vertebra. Neurosurgery and ENT (ear, nose, and throat) were consulted at that time for further recommendations. A subsequent magnetic resonance imaging brain and C-spine showed mass-like enhancement of the tegmen tympani and reactive dural changes. There were also multiple lytic foci present in the right temporal bone, first cervical vertebral body, and posterolateral wall of the right maxillary sinus wall and mandible. She was taken for surgery, where a right mastoidectomy with right middle ear exploration was performed. Surgical pathology samples returned positive for histiocyte proliferation in a background of eosinophilic and lymphoplasmacytic inflammation consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). Immunohistochemical stains performed demonstrated diffuse positivity for CD1a and S-100. Further staining was positive for Langerin (CD207).

Chest CT demonstrated a well-circumscribed mass in the right thoracic cavity measuring 28 cm \u00d7 9 cm \u00d7 10 cm that was compressing the right lower lobe (Fig. a). The mass comprised mostly fatty tissue, and any other organs such as intestinal tract were not included in the mass (Fig. b). The results of blood chemistry studies, including tumor markers, were within normal ranges. Thus, the following differential diagnosis were considered: lipoma, liposarcoma, and diaphragmatic hernia. Surgery was performed for diagnosis and treatment via a small lateral thoracotomy via the seventh intercostal space with thoracoscopic assistance. A retroperitoneal fat pad of 28 cm in size was slid into the thoracic cavity from the right lumbocostal triangle, as the hernia orifice (Fig. a, b). The size of orifice was about 8 \u00d7 5 cm. We transected the neck of the fat pad above the orifice, because the hernia content in the thoracic cavity was larger than the orifice and difficult to reduce. Several feeding arteries contained in the stem were dissected by a vessel-sealing device. The orifice was closed by suturing the surrounding diaphragmatic muscle and the chest wall. The collapsed lung could be re-expanded by positive pressure ventilation without developing acute lung edema. The operation time was 112 min and the total blood loss 220 g.

She had a half a year history of regular oral short-acting contraceptive usage and denied a history of other major illnesses. Gynecological examination indicated that the uterus was enlarged to the size of 4 weeks of gestation and several hard nodules could be felt in the posterior wall of the uterus. The ultrasound results indicated that the uterus was enlarged, and a heterogeneous echo of about 71\u221718 mm2 could be seen from the uterine cavity to the cervical canal. After adequate evaluation and informed consent, endometrial polypectomy under hysteroscopy was performed based on the diagnosis of endometrial polyp and adenomyosis. During the operation, a large ligule vegetation of about 70\u221750 mm2 was found in the posterior uterine wall near the fundus of the uterus, which was completely resected and sent for pathological examination. The pathological diagnosis of curettage tissues was endometrial polyp (Fig. ). Regular ultrasound scan postoperation indicated thickened endometrium and an ill-defined mass with continuous enlargement in the myometrium of the posterior wall of the uterus, which was considered as an adenomyoma (Table ). The patient refused further hysteroscopic exploration, other treatment and follow-up for 1 year since November 2017.

The serum tests showed normal liver function and moderately impaired renal function (creatinine 10\u201315, urea > 200).\nShe had a complex medical history including obstructive sleep apnoea, asthma, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, hypertensive cardiomyopathy and bipolar disorder; registered disabled. She also had a copper intra uterine contraceptive device in situ for the past three years. Given her body habitus (BMI 42), abdominal and pelvic examination was difficult and non-specific. The only finding of relevance was bilateral adnexal fullness.\nShe was managed within the gynaecological oncology multi disciplinary framework (MDT). On reviewing the CT films the features noted include bilateral basal pleural thickening, bilateral hydronephrosis, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy associated with retroperitoneal fibrosis and bilateral adnexal cystic masses. There was a small volume of ascites.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for further characterisation of the adnexal masses. The right adnexal complex cystic lesion measured 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 cm in diameter and had a thick wall (up to 2 cm), which was irregular. There were several septations, some of which measured 3 \u2013 4 mm. There were no enhancing papillary formations, although the wall and septa enhanced. The appearance suggested an ovarian lesion with possible involvement of the Fallopian tube. The left adnexal cyst measured 5 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 4 cm, had a smooth wall and contained a single thin septation, consistent with a benign ovarian cyst.

He underwent laparotomy at the same previous hospital, found the defect which was separated from the previously sutured area of the diaphragm, and repaired it.\nIn May 2017, the patient presented to the local hospital with abdominal pain and vomiting and was diagnosed with an intestinal obstruction; an ileus tube was inserted and the patient was referred to our hospital for treatment. Upon admission, the physical examination was unremarkable, and laboratory findings, including complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and biochemical tests, were all within normal limits. Chest and abdominal radiographs revealed colon gas in the right intrathoracic space (Fig. a, b). On contrast imaging, the ileus tube in the transverse colon was observed to be incarcerated in the right intrathoracic space (Fig. c), a finding which was confirmed on computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen (Fig. d). The patient was diagnosed with a DH and underwent laparoscopic hernia repair.\nThe surgical repair was performed with the patient in the left half-lateral decubitus position. Four laparoscopic ports were placed in the abdomen as follows: a 12-mm port at the umbilicus for the scope, two 12-mm ports at the right lateral lesion as working ports, and a 5-mm port at the middle of the upper abdomen used as an assistant. Under laparoscopic view, the transverse colon and small intestine anastomosis were found to be adherent to the right hemidiaphragm (Fig. a), and we proceeded with careful separation",

The orthopedic examination revealed lameness in the lower right hind limb and a bony thickening at the level of the metatarsophalangeal joint between the II and III digit phalanges, covered with normal skin. The complete blood count, serum chemical and electrolyte analyses were within normal limits, apart from elevated levels of calcium and phosphorus, which were attributed to the young age (5 month) of the animal (Table ). The dog underwent a radiographic examination. Two well-defined lesions within the right II and IV phalanges of the right pelvic limb were found (Fig. a), in the shape of well circumscribed, mineralized new bone formation with a trabecular pattern. The dog underwent surgery to remove the lesion on the II phalange, and the excised tissue was sent for a histopathological examination. This revealed well-differentiated bone tissue, hyaline cartilage, and fibrous tissue in addition to hematopoietic tissue and connective tissue. Based on the histopathological findings, multiple cartilaginous exostoses (ostechondromatosis) were diagnosed. In the 1 month follow-up examination, the dog showed progressive ataxia of hind limb, a stiff gait and hyperesthesia in the thoracolumbar vertebral column. Radiographs of the hips and vertebral column exposed similar lesions to those in the pelvic limb. They were located in the distal part of the femur, on the tail and on the thoracic spinous processes of the lumbar vertebral bodies (Fig. b, c) and on the ribs (Fig. b).\nAt the age of 8 months, the dog was presented to the Wroc\u0142aw University of Environmental and Life Sciences at the Department of Internal Medicine with Clinic of Horses, Dogs and Cats for neurological assessment.

Her medical history was significant for hepatitis C, mitral valve (MV) replacement secondary to MV endocarditis, and IV drug use. At presentation, she was in septic shock, and her blood cultures subsequently yielded group A streptococcus. Of note, she stated that her last use of IV drugs was two weeks before presentation. Fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, and vasopressors were appropriately utilized. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed infected mitral valve leaflets, 2-3 cm vegetation in the left atrium, a 0.9 cm atrial septal defect with the left to right shunt, and LV ejection fraction of 15%. No abscesses were visualized. Two weeks later, transthoracic echocardiography revealed a large LVPA originating from the posterolateral wall as shown in Figures -. Cardiac computed tomography (cardiac CT) scan further elucidated the PA that measured 6.9 x 8.4 x 7.2 cm as shown in Figures -.\nThe cardiac CT also disclosed a fistulous tract communicating from the infected MV annulus to the aneurysmal portion of the LV. A left heart catheterization was performed to rule out a septic embolus to the coronary vessels as a cause for the PA. No coronary artery disease (CAD) or suspicious lesions were discovered. The sheer size of this PA placed this patient at a very high surgical risk. Various institutes were contacted for LVPA repair and redo MV replacement. Due to the high perioperative mortality and poor healthcare coverage, attempts to transfer the patient to tertiary cardiac care centers were futile. The patient\u2019s ongoing drug use also affected her candidacy for MV replacement. When stabilized she was discharged from hospital care on antibiotics and supportive cardiac medications (beta blocker and ACE-inhibitor).

He had previously received partial liver transplant under a diagnosis of liver cirrhosis in March 2005 but fever with an unknown origin persisted after the transplant. Suspecting sepsis, the patient was treated with multiple antibiotics, but a fungal colony was found in the left lower lung field during the antibiotics treatment. Aspergillus was confirmed in the sputum culture test. Accordingly, 60 mg of Amphotericin B was injected intravenously for two weeks but with no significant improvement. Consequently, 50 mg of a different antifungal agent, candidas (caspofungin acetate), was injected over a 2-week period, and a lobectomy was performed on the left lower lung. The patient was under immunosuppression (cyclosporine 250 mg orally), which was continued under antifungal treatment after the lobectomy. After the lobectomy, he complained of mild low back pain and consulted our department. Mild tenderness was found over the low back but there was no abnormality on the plain radiograms except for the degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. Low back pain was not significant enough to recommend a MRI, so we just recommended limited activity, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and close observation. However, the low back pain did not subside, and he again consulted our department. A physical examination revealed severe tenderness and rigidity over the lower lumbar area. Straight leg raising on the right lower extremity was restricted to 50\u00b0, and extension of the right great toe and dorsiflexion of right ankle were poor.

The dog had been involved in a traffic accident 2 days prior, which had caused severe facial wounds and proptosis of the left eye. The eye had been proptosed for approximately less than an hour. Prior to presentation the prolapsed eye was manually reduced by placing pressure on the globe with the handle of a scalpel. Basic wound care consisted of flushing debris away with sterile saline and applying daily bandages.\nOn physical examination, the dog presented with tachycardia and tachypnea. Other vital signs were unremarkable. Skull radiographs were normal, and no abnormalities were noted involving the dentition. However, along the left lateral maxilla, the external skin and middle part of the sphincter colli profundus pars intermedia muscle were exposed (). Ocular examination of the left eye revealed moderate periocular swelling, conjunctival injection, and severe dorsolateral globe displacement with mild exophthalmos (). No abnormalities were observed in the right eye, including intraocular examination by slit lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy. Neither cornea appeared damaged based on fluorescein dye staining OU. The trigeminal and facial nerves involving both sides of the face were presumed to be intact, based on normal palpebral reflexes and vibrissae responses. It was difficult to determine a clear menace response in the left eye because of the globe displacement. Vestibuloocular reflexes appeared positive for the right eye, but accurate assessment was difficult because of the periocular swelling.

There were no voluntary contractions of the tibialis anterior, flexor halluces, or extensor hallucis muscles bilaterally. She had sensory deficits in the perineum. The anal reflex was absent. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a displaced, H-shaped Roy-Camille type 2 sacral fracture; an L1 burst fracture with 30% spinal canal compromise (); and bilateral calcaneal fractures. Soon after the initial assessment, she was transferred to the operating room for reduction of the sacral fracture.\nThe patient was placed in the supine position on a transparent surgical table. Under general anesthesia, two 6-mm half pins were placed from the anterior inferior iliac spine to the posterior ilium on each side. They were connected with one bar and two clamps. Next, a triangular pillow was placed under the lumbosacral junction to induce hyperlordosis (a). At that time, the fracture had not been reduced yet (a). We applied rotational force to the ilium in the direction of extension with an external fixator on each side (b). A percutaneous screw was inserted after confirming that the fracture had been reduced appropriately with an image intensifier (b). Five days later, the screw was replaced with a long transiliac-transsacral screw at the same time as percutaneous fixation for the L1 burst fracture. During the initial emergent operation, we were only able to use a short screw. Although the right ankle and toe gradually began to move, direct decompression via sacral laminectomy was carried out at 19 days after the injury to promote further neurological improvement.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 75-year-old woman, who had developed left shoulder pain five years earlier without any known precipitating factor. She presented to our department because of gradual difficulty in raising her left arm and worsening pain. Physical examination on presentation did not reveal any swelling or feeling of heat in the left shoulder. The range of motion of the left shoulder showed extremely severe restriction; namely, flexion 80\u00b0, abduction 60\u00b0, and external rotation 0\u00b0, and prominent impingement symptoms were found. On plain radiographs and computed tomography (CT), prominent shoulder arthropathic changes and numerous calcified lesions around the joint were found. On plain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), around the shoulder an irregular hypointense region was identified in the center on T1-enhanced images and on T2-enhanced images (). Routine blood examinations did not reveal any obvious abnormalities. This patient was diagnosed with synovial osteochondromatosis associated with a massive tear of the rotator cuff and shoulder arthropathic changes, for which the treatment RSA was chosen.\nIntraoperative findings: A delto-pectoral approach was used.

The swelling was initially asymptomatic and eventually developed dull and intermittent pain. Intraoral examination revealed a well-defined swelling of size 5 \u00d7 4 cm in the right posterior maxilla, extending anteriorly up to the distal aspect of 13, posteriorly covering the hamular notch and medially involving the soft palate (). The tooth 17 in relation to the swelling was found to be missing. The mucosa over the swelling appeared smooth and bluish in the anterior aspect and erythematous over the posterior aspect. On palpation, the swelling was tender and rubbery in consistency. There were no palpable regional lymph nodes. Patient's medical history was unremarkable with all biochemical examination results within normal limits.

    "original_text": "A 36-year-old man presented to the orthopedic outpatient clinic with complaints of pain and inability to bear weight on the right lower limb following a road traffic accident five months back. He had sustained an injury to the right lower limb and had been treated elsewhere with a cephalomedullary femoral nail. Details of previous treatment including the pre-treatment radiographs were not available. He had never borne weight on the right lower limb following the primary surgery. He described severe pain in his right thigh and groin that confined him to a wheelchair. He had shortening of the right lower limb and painful restriction of movements of the right hip. Radiographs showed delayed union at the femoral shaft fracture site while the femoral neck was in varus malalignment with bone resorption. The neck fracture had been fixed using two hip screws that were missing the nail; the Pauwels' angle measured ~65\u00b0 (Figures , ). Workup for infection was negative and he was neither a diabetic nor a smoker.\nAt revision surgery, the previous hardware was removed and a reamed retrograde femoral nail was inserted and locked in compression; the shaft fracture site was not opened. Next, to correct the varus neck malalignment, Pauwels\u2019 intertrochanteric osteotomy was performed. A 30\u00b0 wedge of bone was removed from the lateral cortex, and a 120\u00b0 double-angled condylar blade plate was inserted under fluoroscopic imaging; the femoral neck nonunion was not opened.
