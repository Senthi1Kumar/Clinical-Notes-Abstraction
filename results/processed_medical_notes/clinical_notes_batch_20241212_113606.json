She had previously received surgical relief of congenital pulmonary valvular stenosis at the age of five years. On admission, she was suffering from shortness of breath. A systolic murmur was noted at the left sternal border in the third left intercostal space, and abdominal physical examination revealed four fingerbreadths of hepatomegaly. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with bradycardia and low-voltage f wave. Moreover, transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated severe PR and severe TR, and significant amount of TR was owing to the tricuspid annular dilatation (41 mm) and marked right ventricle (RV) enlargement (end-diastolic dimension, 41 mm) with a TR gradient of 26.9 mmHg. The tethering height of the tricuspid valve was 12 mm (Fig. ). Additionally, the left ventricular dimensions and function were normal, the inferior vena cava was not respiratory-collapsed, and a systolic hepatic vein flow reversal was noted. Cardiac catheterization showed a mild elevation of systolic RV pressure (37 mmHg) with normal mean pulmonary artery pressure (16 mmHg). Although RV dilation (RV end-diastolic volume index 141 ml/m2) was revealed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), RV ejection fraction was normal (71%) and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) by echocardiography was within normal limits (28 mm), suggesting that RV function was preserved. Liver congestion was demonstrated in both abdominal echography and computed tomography. The patient was judged an acceptable candidate for surgical treatment for severe PR, severe TR, and bradycardia. We did not apply ablative surgical therapy for the atrial fibrillation because of the low-voltage f wave, which is a risk factor for surgical ablation failure.\nFollowing a sternal re-entry, a cardiopulmonary bypass was established with ascending aortic and bicaval cannulation.

The patient endorsed a several month history of gaining weight, though she attributed it to her lifestyle, accompanied with strong, intermittent, crampy right lower quadrant pain. The pain was random in onset and would dissipate very quickly. However, 5 days prior to presentation, her pain dramatically increased and was persistent in nature.\nHer surgical history included a myomectomy performed 5 years prior followed by a laparoscopic hysterectomy 2 years later. She was a regular drinker, consuming four to five alcoholic drinks per night, but stopped when her symptoms worsened and had no history of withdrawal.

Her preoperative cervical cytology results were negative for intraepithelial lesions and malignancy. The endometrial cytology and needle biopsy results were also negative.

The left internal iliac vein forming the common iliac vein was transected at the bifurcation region.

    "original_text": "A four-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with left elbow swelling and pain. Plain radiography in anteroposterior and lateral view revealed a Gartland type 3 left supracondylar humerus fracture (Figure , ).\nThere was no neurological deficit. Under general anesthesia, using c arm control, closed reduction of the fracture was done by an orthopedic trainee under consultant supervision. After maintaining the reduction in hyperflexion and pronation of the elbow, a 1.6 mm diameter K-wire was inserted using the lateral entry point. After drilling the lateral column, it was felt that the wire was skiving proximally in the medullary canal, hence, further drilling was done to obtain purchase in the medial cortex. While the wire was being drilled it broke near the entry point and the broken end disappeared under the skin, leaving the remnant portion buried in the distal humerus (Figure ). Since the reduction was acceptable in anteroposterior and lateral views, three more 1.6mm K-wires were inserted from the lateral to the medial side (Figure ).\nFixation of fracture was confirmed under fluoroscopy. After fracture fixation, attempts were made to remove the broken K-wire but it was not possible to grab the tip, as the broken end was buried under the cartilaginous bone.

This was preceded by perineal scratching for itchiness. A day prior to presentation, the pain had increased in intensity and the patient had difficulty in passing stool.\nShe had asthma and hypertension, which were well controlled. She was on salbutamol 4 mg three times a day and used becotide inhaler for her asthma and nifedipine 20 mg twice a day for her blood pressure. Her recent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test was negative. There was no family history of diabetes or malignancies. She was married with one child, and she neither drank alcohol nor smoked cigarettes.\nOn examination, she was ill-looking and in pain. She was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 85/35 mmHg, a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. She had an elevated temperature of 38 degrees Celsius and a low oxygen saturation of 88%. Examination of her perineum and perianal area showed a huge mass with extensive necrosis and oozing pus from its surface. This is shown in her preoperative image below (Figure ).\nCrepitus was elicited in the tissues adjacent to the ulcer. There was exquisite tenderness on digital rectal examination. Examination of other systems was normal. A random blood sugar test done showed a high blood sugar of 18.05 mmol/L. A diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis was made in a patient with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus.\nThe patient was very sick and in septic shock from fulminant sepsis.

The patient had an 8-year history of cigarette smoking, and his father had been diagnosed with lung cancer. Repeated antibiotic treatment had been used since he started coughing, which produced a small amount of yellow sputum, and on January 6, 2018, he was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. Unfortunately, his condition did not improve, and he gradually developed persistent right chest pain and shortness of breath after activity. He was admitted to our hospital on March 19th, and chest computed tomography (CT) showed an irregular solid nodule in the anterior segment of the upper lobe of the right lung and lamellar density shadows in the lower lobe of the right lung ( and ). A bronchoscopic examination showed that the bronchi were unobstructed, slightly congested and had a mild amount of purulent exudate. A transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) was performed in the posterior basal segment and dorsal segment. Galactomannan (GM) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was 1.068. No fungus, interstitial fibroblastic proliferation, incrassation or fibrosis was seen in the lung tissue biopsy, but acid-fast staining and PAS negativity suggested organizing pneumonia; the patient was then diagnosed with organizing pneumonia. The patient was started on prednisone 30 mg orally once a day on March 27, and he was discharged after his symptoms of cough, chest pain and shortness of breath had gradually improved. He took prednisone as prescribed after discharge. However, his condition worsened with a fever that developed on May 8, and he was admitted to the hospital on May 15.

She had been placed on an antagonist protocol and her stimulation was unremarkable. Her medical history was significant for hyperlipidemia and oligoovulation secondary to PCOS, which was diagnosed at the time of her initial presentation. At that time, she had irregular menses occurring every 1\u20134 months and evidence of bilateral polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. Her androgen levels were normal and she did not exhibit any evidence of clinical hyperandrogenism. Prior to returning for FET, her menses remained irregular; however she denied the use of any hormonal agents. There was no personal or familial history of endometriosis or gynecologic malignancies. Pelvic ultrasounds (PUs) performed at her initial infertility consult as well as during treatment and in the early stages of pregnancy revealed polycystic-appearing ovaries, but were otherwise normal.\nPrior to the commencement of a FET cycle, the patient had a baseline PU, which revealed a complex ovarian cyst with layered low level echoes measuring 5.1 \u00d7 3.8 cm (). One area at the base of the cyst had a papillary growth (), while color Doppler revealed venous flow within the growth suggesting malignancy. Tumor markers including CA125 (21 U/mL) were within normal range. A repeat PU and a subsequent CT scan confirmed the previous ultrasound findings.\nAt exploratory laparotomy by gynecological oncologist, an enlarged fluctuant and cystic left ovary adherent to the rectosigmoid was found.

There was no history or evidence of any invasive procedure in the upper limbs of that person.\nOn both sides, the brachial artery in the middle third of the arm originated a SuBUA (Figures and ). This artery penetrated the brachial fascia in the lower third of the arm, crossed anteriorly to the bicipital aponeurosis and to the muscles that originated from the medial epicondyle, and ran over the pronator teres muscle in a doubling of the antebrachial fascia (Figure ). In the elbow region, the SuBUA was in intimate contact with the superficial structures, namely the medial antebrachial nerve and the subcutaneous veins (Figure ). It then dipped into the forearm fascia, passed through a gap between the palmaris longus and the flexor carpi radialis, ran deep to the palmaris longus muscle belly, and superficially to the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle, reaching the gap between the latter and flexor carpi ulnaris muscle (Figure ). In the middle third of the forearm the SuBUA was positioned lateral to the ulnar nerve.\nThe brachial artery continued through the radial artery (RA), which followed its usual course. In the upper third of the forearm, the RA gave off the common interosseous artery. This latter artery branched into the anterior and the posterior interosseous arteries (Figure ).

Additional CT scan supported the radiographic findings with a more pronounced central cystic bone alteration and irregularity of the fracture border (). The diagnosis of AVN was confirmed with signal loss of the scaphoid on MRI T1 (). A dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was performed for further assessment of the proximal pole vascularity and treatment planning. Therefore, a region of interest was placed on the proximal and distal scaphoid poles. Time-signal intensity curves were recorded and were considered to represent the degree of vascularity. The time-signal intensity curves are classified into good, fair, or poor vascularity based on their shape and maximal enhancement comparing proximal pole with the distal pole [, ]. In this study, the time-signal intensity curve on the proximal pole was lower than the distal pole with a maximum enhancement of 50%, defining fair perfusion of the proximal pole. The fair perfusion of the proximal pole on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was with the account of measuring associated fibroblasts in the cystic alteration in the distal pole (). Because of fair perfusion of the proximal pole, an adequate healing potential with conservative treatment was estimated.

She had a past history of atrial fibrillation, tympanoplasty for tympanitis, and total ovariohysterectomy. Removal of the supratentorial and infratentorial cyst was performed via a left transzygomatic approach. The tumor was almost totally resected with no sequelae; the supratentorial and infratentorial compartments remained. Because the patient had a preoperative history of atrial fibrillation, postoperative warfarin therapy was administered to prevent embolism.

He had a four-month history of similar but less severe pain, preceded by loose stools with mucus and frequent PR bleeds on a background of poor appetite and 7 kg weight loss over six months. Family history was notable for colorectal cancer in his uncle at 71 years of age. Social history was significant for 10 cigarettes a day, 70 units of alcohol a week, and extensive travel history to Thailand. On examination, the lower abdomen was distended and diffusely tender with tinkling bowel sounds but no guarding or rigidity.\nA plain supine abdominal radiograph showed a hugely dilated caecum (maximum diameter: 15 cm) and transverse colon (maximum diameter: 10 cm) with paucity of gas in the descending colon (). A CT scan revealed apparent intussusception of a polypoid lead point into the distal descending colon () but no signs of bowel perforation as well as bilateral cavitating lesions in the lung apices ().\nAn urgent exploratory laparotomy revealed an irregular mass in the distal transverse colon and another adjacent mass in the splenic flexure with apparent spontaneous resolution of the intussusception seen on CT. Widespread lymphadenopathy was noted in the transverse colon mesentery.

Gastric contents were aspirated from the PEG tube and abdominal distention was noted. Hemogram demonstrated an elevated white blood cell count of 31.5 K/mm3 with a left-band shift and a lactic acid level of 4.9 mmol/L. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) with contrast administered via PEG displayed the first and second portions of the duodenum to be thickened with evidence of retrograde jejunoduodenal intussusception due to tube migration into the left upper abdominal quadrant (Figure ). The PEG was initially evaluated and repositioned at bedside with deflation of the bumper and gentle retraction of the tube back toward the stomach. Repeat migration was of concern as the tube altered position over the following days. Later, the tube was replaced with a 20 French right-angle PEG with position confirmed via plain film. Repeat CT demonstrated resolution of intussusception with maintained thickening of the proximal duodenal wall (Figure ). Another CT scan performed 9 months later indicated continued proximal duodenal wall thickening likely due to scarring from the intussusception inflammatory process. Endoscopic evaluation was not performed to evaluate the duodenal wall thickening as multiple comorbidities, including severe dementia and mental retardation, precluded the patient to a change in management.\nRetrograde jejunoduodenal intussusception is a very rare complication of gastrostomy tube use. Bowel ischemia is of grave concern requiring a high level of suspicion in patients presenting with nausea and vomiting and a history of PEG tube. The mechanism of intussusception is not well understood, but several hypotheses have been previously discussed.

The patient had a history of percutaneous kidney biopsy under real-time ultrasound guidance using a cutting needle at 15 years of age. Macroscopic hematuria started shortly after biopsy, but ceased within a couple of days without development of significant anemia. The size of a subcapsular hematoma (up to 38 mm long by 7 mm wide), which occurs in most renal biopsies, also decreased over time. Thus, common complications such as gross hematuria and subcapsular hematoma occurred, but were settled within days of the biopsy. Based on our institutional protocol, the patient was discharged 7 days after biopsy. However, immediate rehospitalization was required on the day of discharge due to abrupt onset of severe left flank pain. Gross hematuria reemerged and was intermittently observed for several days, resulting in hypotension (94/58 mmHg), a significant decrease of blood hemoglobin (14.2 to 10.7 g/dl), and acute dysuria. Embolization via IR was considered as an emergency therapy to stop bleeding, but gross hematuria eventually disappeared within days with intravenous injection of hemostatic agents such as carbazochrome sodium sulfonate and tranexamic acid, in addition to bed rest. It was noteworthy that color-coded Doppler US detected AVF as a mosaic signal in the lower pole of the left kidney (Fig. ), which was the puncture site of the biopsy. However, in terms of size, this lesion was morphologically undetectable, even by dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) (Fig. ). After disappearance of gross hematuria, the patient was free from renal AVF-related manifestations, including abdominal pain, hypertension, and renal impairment. Thus, it was determined that IR was not required at this time.\nIgA nephropathy was diagnosed based on the findings of renal biopsy.

She reported hearing a \u201ccrack\u201d whilst turning the tap off and noticed an obvious bump over her right shoulder, which prompted her to attend the A&E department. Patient denied any history of previous trauma to her right clavicle, and there was no prodromal symptom such as pain over the right shoulder or clavicle.\nRadiographs revealed an acute transverse right mid-clavicular fracture, with evidence of superior cortical thickening and a small superior spike (). Her only past medical history was osteoarthritis of her knees and bilateral varicose veins.

Less than a month after beginning therapy, the patient showed complete remission of the genital ulcers and marked improvement of the oral aphthae, polyarthritis and auricular chondritis.\nHowever, 8 months later, the patient developed paraesthesia of the lower limbs. As these symptoms did not improve when thalidomide was reduced to 50 mg, an electromyogram was performed and revealed sensitive peripheral neuropathy. Thalidomide was suspended, and the patient was medicated with azathioprine together with corticosteroids and colchicine, but showed only a partial response. Later, due to worsening of BD symptoms and the development of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea (with colonoscopic evidence of colonic involvement), the patient was treated with adalimumab with an excellent response. However, 4 months later, he presented hilar and mediastinal adenopathy with pulmonary interstitial involvement; biopsy confirmed pulmonary sarcoidosis probably induced by adalimumab.

His vital signs included a respiratory rate of 40/min, a pulse of 121 beats/min, a blood pressure of 105/38 mmHg and 100% oxygen saturation at 2 L/min per nasal cannula. Physical examination showed a pale appearing male in severe distress but was otherwise unremarkable. A complete blood count revealed a hemoglobin concentration of 3 g/dL. His medical history included arterial hypertension, alcohol abuse and nicotine dependence. Treatment for hemorrhagic shock was initiated immediately by administering large intravenous volume infusions, transfusions and multiple vasopressors. A focused assessment with sonography for trauma scan was performed. However, the infrarenal part of aorta was not visible due to excessive bowel gas. The patient was intubated and a nasogastric tube was placed which revealed fresh red blood. An emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, which showed large blood clots in the stomach (). However, an active source of bleeding was not present, neither in the stomach nor the duodenum (). High-dose proton-pump inhibitors and erythromycin were infused intravenously. Despite rapid fluid replacement, the patient went into acute renal failure and required continuous hemofiltration. The next day, repeat EGD revealed a small gastric erosion which was supplied with a metal clip. Otherwise no source of bleeding could be identified. A few hours later, the patient suffered from repeat hypotension and hematochezia. A colonoscopy demonstrated blood clots in the colon but no source of bleeding. The following days, his condition improved. He had a nonbloody bowel movement and his renal function recovered. For three days, he did not exhibit any signs of bleeding.

Physical examination revealed that the 3-cm movable neck mass was firm and slightly tender on palpation and had a distinct margin from surrounding tissues. An ultrasound examination showed that the well-defined oval mass was 31 \u00d7 23 \u00d7 17 mm in size and exhibited heterogeneity. Furthermore, a non-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck revealed that the distinct neck mass in the subcutaneous tissue had a mixture of soft tissue and fatty components (Fig. ). Based on these findings, the cervical tumor was clinically diagnosed to be an unusual lipoma with degeneration; however, we could not exclude the possibility of it being a malignant tumor such as liposarcoma. Thus, fine-needle aspiration cytology of the tumor was performed, but no diagnosis of malignant cells was obtained. Further examinations were conducted to address concerns related to her menstrual pain, and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral ovarian cysts in the lower abdomen. Under general anesthesia, the patient underwent neck mass extirpation and bilateral ovarian cystectomy; pathological examination of the cysts resulted in a diagnosis of ovarian endometriotic cysts.

The patient, who recently returned from a mountain climbing trip in the Himalayas, was in good physical shape. On a physical examination a holosystolic murmur, best heard at the left lower sternal border, was noticed. The patient was sent for transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), which showed elliptical, mobile homogeneous hyperechoic mass, 28x24 mm, with smooth surface, located in the left atrium (Figure ).\nThe mass did not prolapse through the mitral orifice during diastole, did not obstruct diastolic filling of the left ventricle, was attached to the interatrial septum, although the peduncle was not clearly visualized (Video ). The left atrial diameter was on the upper limit of 3.8 cm. Color Doppler did not reveal increased velocity of blood flow across the mitral valve. Moderate tricuspid insufficiency was noticed. A diagnosis of a left atrial tumor was made. The findings were discussed with the patient and she was referred to a specialized Cardiac Surgery Center for surgical intervention. A minimally invasive approach was chosen.\nThe patient underwent a right lateral mini-thoracotomy under general anesthesia. Peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass using right femoral artery and vein and right internal jugular vein was established. Induced ventricular fibrillation was used. Left and right atria were opened. The tumor was excised with a part of an interatrial septum (Video ), which was closed using autopericardial patch. Heart chambers were closed, cardiopulmonary bypass was discontinued and the operation was finished in the usual manner. The total operation time was 220 minutes.

The patient denied alcohol consumption and reported to have quit smoking 41 years ago. Liver chemistries, serum bilirubin, serum triglycerides, and immunoglobulin subclasses were within normal limits (). Abdominal CT scan demonstrated peripancreatic haziness consistent with noncomplicated acute pancreatitis (). Home medications included atorvastatin for several years and the addition of 160 mg fenofibrate six months prior to admission. These medications were held upon admission but resumed at discharge. Full medication lists on admission and at discharge are shown in (). The patient was managed with fluid resuscitation and pain control. The patient recovered well and was able to tolerate regular diet without any pain or nausea. The patient was discharged in a stable condition after three hospital admission days, and lipase level at the day of discharge was 307 u/l.\nThree days later, the patient returned with similar symptoms. Lipase levels were >30,000 u/l (), and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis (). The patient was treated conservatively with intravenous fluid resuscitation, pain control, and nothing per mouth until his symptoms resolved. Four days after his second admission, the patient recovered well and was discharged home in a stable condition.

A non-contrast head computed tomography scan was negative for any abnormalities. This prompted a cardiac work up for her symptoms. An electrocardiogram revealed premature ventricular contractions that led to a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). This showed a 1 cm mass within the left atrium, concerning for a thrombus. A transesophageal echocardiogram () with subsequent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, was performed to better characterize the mass. This revealed a mass attached to the ridge between the left atrial appendage and superior pulmonary vein by a discrete stalk, measuring 1.4 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm. The mass appeared hypovascular on perfusion imaging, with no specific enhancement with delayed enhancement imaging (Figure 2). Her preoperative workup was completed with a left heart catheterization that did showed nonobstructive coronary anatomy.

A lump measuring 30 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 20 mm in size was surgically removed. Grossly, the resected specimen featured a cyst (15 mm in diameter) with an intracystic proliferative lesion 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 8 mm in size. Histopatholological examination revealed an intracystic IDP without evidence of malignancy (Figure ). No axillary lymphadenopathy was found at the time of surgery. Whereas no changes were seen in the patient's breast on ultrasound or mammography during follow-up, an enlarged lymph node became palpable in the left axilla 10 years later. A metastatic carcinoma in ALN was suspected and the patient was subjected to excisional biopsy.\nA lymph node sized 15 mm in diameter was removed. Histology revealed a proliferative epithelial lesion measuring 11 mm in the largest dimension in the cystic space of the node. The proliferative lesion consisted of papillary and tubular structures lined by luminal cuboidal cells and a distinct outer layer of myoepithelial cells which were very similar to IDP of the breast (Figure and ). Apocrine metaplasia was found. No mitoses, necrosis or cells with atypical features were detected, suggesting the benign nature of the neoplasm. In addition, both the proliferative papillary lesion and small clusters of duct-like structures were also observed in the lymphoid tissue surrounding the cystic area (Figure and ). Immunostaining with a series of antibodies (all from Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) was used to confirm histogenetic origin of tumor cells in ALN. Staining for AE/AE3 was diffusely positive in tumor epithelium and staining for alpha-smooth muscle actin and p63",
    "cleaned_text": "a 34 year-old woman previously operated for a solitary encapsulated papillary thyroid microcarcinoma in the right lobe of the gland, without familial history of breast or thyroid malignancy, was admitted to the institute of oncology and radiology of serbia, belgrade, after feeling soreness at breast self-examination followed by a suspicious mammographic finding in the left breast. a lump measuring 30 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 20 mm in size was surgically removed. grossly, the resected specimen featured a cyst (15 mm in diameter) with an intracystic proliferative lesion 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 8 mm in size. histopatholological examination revealed an intracystic idp without evidence of malignancy (figure ). no axillary lymphadenopathy was found at the time of surgery. whereas no changes were seen in the patient's breast on ultrasound or mammography during follow-up, an enlarged lymph node became palpable in the left axilla 10 years later. a metastatic carcinoma in aln was suspected and the patient was subjected to excisional biopsy.\na lymph node sized 15 mm in diameter was removed. histology revealed a proliferative epithelial lesion measuring 11 mm in the largest dimension in the cystic space of the node. the proliferative lesion consisted of papillary and tubular structures lined by luminal cuboidal cells and a distinct outer layer of myoepithelial cells which were very similar to idp of the breast (figure and ). apocrine metaplasia was found. no mitoses, necrosis or cells with atypical features were detected, suggesting the benign nature of the neoplasm. in addition, both the proliferative papillary lesion and small clusters of duct-like structures were also observed in the lymphoid tissue surrounding the cystic area (figure and ). immunostaining with a series of antibodies (all from dako, carpinteria, ca, usa) was used to confirm histogenetic origin of tumor cells in aln. staining for ae/ae3 was diffusely positive in tumor epithelium and staining for alpha-smooth muscle actin and p63",

The child was asleep, semi-prone with left shoulder up on a pavement when he was hit on his left shoulder by the vehicle.\nHe was brought awake, oriented to time, place and person to the emergency department 2 hours after injury. His blood pressure was 118/82 mm of mercury, and pulse was regular with a rate of 103 per minute. An ovoid, tender swelling was present over the left sternoclavicular joint []. There was tenderness over the lateral end of clavicle and difficulty in moving the ipsilateral shoulder. He complained of numbness over the medial aspect of upper forearm. There were no abrasions or tyre marks. A serendipity view radiograph of the Left side [] showed displacement of the medial fractured end of the clavicle with the proximal epiphyseal fragment in situ. The lateral epiphyseal end too remained in continuity with the joint while the fractured proximal fragment was displaced inferiorly and posteriorly. The serendipity view (40\u00b0 cephalic tilt view) is considered the next best thing to a true cephalocaudal lateral view of the sternoclavicular joint. A Computed Tomography revealed a bipolar physeal injury of the left clavicle []. The middle floating shaft fragment had displaced anterosuperiorly at its medial end and posteroinferiorly at its lateral end. The Thurston Holland fragment was visualized at either ends [].\nAn initial attempt to reduce the medial physeal fracture failed, probably because of the floating intermediate segment which failed to transmit the reduction force. The position was accepted in view of the reported natural history of similar physeal injuries at either ends of the clavicle and the child was treated in a shoulder immobilizer.
