Renal history began at 10 years of age when she was hospitalized for several episodes of ureteral colic due to recurrent stone disease. She was married with four children. During each pregnancy, she was treated for hypertension. At 40 years of age, she was evaluated for severe arterial hypertension. Investigations revealed proteinuria (2 gr/24 h) and an increase in plasma creatinine (12 \u03bcmol/dL). Renal ultrasound showed multiple stones in the left kidney and bladder, while the right kidney was atrophied. The diagnosis of primary hyperoxaluria type I was established by the detection of the G170R mutation in the peroxisomal alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) gene. The residual activity of AGT was less than 28% in biopsied liver tissue from our patient. As chronic renal failure progressed, our patient experienced, at 44 years of age, multiple embolic episodes involving the femoral arteries, hypogastric arteries, splenic artery and renal arteries, and requiring surgical thrombectomy.

    "original_text": "A 50-year-old previously healthy man presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of worsening bloating, abdominal pain, and inability to pass flatus. The physician made a digital rectal examination and found a stricture of the rectum 2 cm above the anal edge. After depositing a tube into the proximal cavity of the narrowing part of the rectum, flatus and stool passed out, relieving the abdominal pain and bloating. A rectal MRI, an abdominal enhanced CT scan, and PET-CT were performed, finding that a rectal tumor growing circumferentially caused a stricture of the lower rectum. In the retrorectal space, several cysts were present, the largest of which had a diameter of about 8 cm. These cysts had a clear border with the sacrum but showed adhesion to the rectal cancer (). The patient recalled that, 3 months previously, he received a routine health checkup, but a colonoscopy found nothing abnormal. The rectal tumor was probably missed\ndue to its location adjacent to the anus.

    "original_text": "A 72-year-old woman with a past medical history of sarcoidosis underwent an endoscopic examination owing to dysphagia. The endoscopic examination revealed a circumferential tumor with ulceration in the cervical esophagus. Biopsies obtained during the endoscopy indicated squamous cell carcinoma. Contrast-enhanced CT showed extensive tumor growth with suspected tracheal invasion and enlarged lymph nodes extending from the cervical region to the upper mediastinum. FDG-PET/CT revealed abnormal FDG accumulation in the primary lesion (SUV max: 23.1) and lymph nodes (SUV max: 5.45) from the cervical to upper mediastinal region (Fig. ). However, it was difficult to determine whether the multiple lymphadenopathy was benign or metastatic because of her past medical history of sarcoidosis. Therefore, and also for the purpose of preserving the larynx, we initiated definitive chemoradiotherapy. The patient was administered 2 cycles of 45 mg cisplatin and 700 mg 5-fluorouracil with 60 Gy/30 fr radiation therapy over 2 months. In each cycle, 8 mg dexamethasone was administered to prevent side effects of chemotherapy. After completing the chemoradiotherapy, we observed complete disappearance of FDG uptake in the primary cancer in the esophagus, and only a slight reduction in FDG uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes (SUV max: 3.26; Fig. ), which indicated that the lymph nodes were affected by sarcoidosis. The primary lesion of the esophagus relapsed 3 months later. Then, the patient underwent thoracoscopic and laparoscopic total laryngopharyngoesophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction via the posterior mediastinal route. The pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the cervical esophagus. The resected lymph nodes demonstrated no tumor metastasis. However, some lymph nodes showed granulomatous reactions and contained several small epithelioid cell granulomas (Fig. ), suggesting the presence of sarcoidosis.

    "original_text": "An 83-year old female with a past medical history of diverticulitis presented to the hospital with sharp, consistent, 7/10 abdominal pain that woke her up at 3 AM. The pain moved from the epigastric region to her right flank. She denied any other symptoms, including nausea/vomiting or fever/chills. The patient reported that she had eaten chicken breast at a restaurant earlier that evening. On physical exam, vital signs were stable and the abdomen exhibited diffuse tenderness. Laboratory studies revealed leukocytosis of 17.0, otherwise unremarkable. CT of the abdomen/pelvis was negative for free air/fluid collection but revealed a linear hyperdensity, approximately 2.7 cm x 2 mm, within the stomach, which penetrated through the gastric wall into the abdominal cavity ().\nThe patient was informed that the CT scan may suggest an ingested foreign body, which has likely perforated through the gastric wall. Treatment options were discussed, and the patient opted to have esophagogastroduodenoscopy with attempted endoscopic removal of the foreign body.

He presented on the same day and his best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 6/60 in the right eye and 6/6 in the left. His anterior segment examination was unremarkable and his intraocular pressure was 17 OD and 15 OS. On fundoscopy, we found a recent cilioretinal artery occlusion on the right and a normal left fundus. White retinal oedema was present along the artery course leading into the fovea. No thrombi were seen within the artery lumen. The optic discs were healthy bilaterally and there were no other peripheral retinal or vascular lesions. No signs of inflammation were found in the anterior or posterior chamber.\nHe had normal eye movements and a neurological examination did not reveal any other signs of stroke. The patient was otherwise well with no other medical history. He was not taking any regular medication and there was no significant family history. He admitted to smoking cannabis three times earlier in the day, before his vision loss. He denied the use of tobacco and informed us that this was his first use of Skunk cannabis. He also denied using any other illicit substance, most pertinently, cocaine.\nOn general examination, his blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG were within normal limits. His full blood count, kidney, liver, and thyroid function tests were normal. Furthermore, inflammatory markers, glycosylated haemoglobin, plasma homocysteine, lipid panel, coagulation screen, and serum protein electrophoresis were also normal. His blood tests did not reveal any signs of dehydration.\nThe fundus photograph of the right eye showed neuroretinal thickening along the route of the cilioretinal artery (), while the left eye showed normal retinal layers.

She had received manipulation therapy to manage posterior neck pain and radiating pain with right upper limb at a local clinic for 5 months. Five days before the visit, she received manipulation therapy with thrusting and stretching neck and shoulders. She reported no history of shoulder or neck trauma.\nPhysical examination revealed limited active ROM of right shoulder joint during abduction and flexion. Lateral edge of the right scapula appeared to be more prominent and winged during shoulder abduction. Shoulder elevation was impaired with droopy shoulder, although trapezius muscle did not seem to be wasted. There was mildly diffuse tenderness along the right trapezius muscle during palpation. Passive right shoulder ROM was preserved. There was no loss of sensation. Neurologic examinations revealed nothing abnormal.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed cervical herniated nucleus pulposus in C4-5 and C5-6 (). Ultrasonography of neck and shoulder was unremarkable. Needle electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction study (NCS) were performed. Motor NCS of spinal accessory nerves recorded from the right upper trapezius muscle showed that the amplitude of compound muscle action potential was reduced over 50% with delayed onset latency over 30% compared to the left side (). Needle EMG studies revealed positive sharp waves, reduced recruitment pattern, and discrete interferential pattern of motor unit potentials in the right upper trapezius muscle (, ).\nPhysical therapy (PT) sessions three times a week for 2 weeks were prescribed. Assisted gentle ROM and strengthening exercises were performed.

Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) demonstrated a hypoechoic and homogeneous mass in the submucosal layer. Subsequently, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a homogeneous irregular mass arising from the posterior wall of the distal esophageal wall that was 69 \u00d7 36 mm in size and compressed the esophagus and trachea (Fig. ). Physical examinations, biochemical tests and cardiopulmonary function were normal. This patient had no medical or family history and was referred to our department for further treatment. Surgical evaluations were discussed preoperatively. Based on the current imaging data, a diagnosis of esophageal SMT was made, most likely leiomyoma. The patient was not recommended further preoperative endoscopic biopsy, which could probably result in mucosal adhesion to the tumor and a subsequently increased risk of mucosal injury during surgery. Taking into consideration the precarious location and large size of the tumor, a decision of robot-assisted resection surgery via the right transthoracic approach was made. The plan was to completely excise the tumor and maintain the integrity of the esophageal mucosa with a low threshold for conversion. Additionally, an esophagectomy with intrathoracic gastroesophagostomy was prepared if the tumor could not be removed.\nThe surgical procedure was performed using a da Vinci Surgical System (Model S; Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

His family history was unremarkable.\nReview of medical history revealed that vesicles first started to appear on the patient\u2019s feet when he was beginning to walk at 11 months of age. Later, at the age of 20 months, the vesicles spread to the hands, and subsequently, lesions have always been associated with injury. As his growth progressed, skin lesions continuously progressed and occupied a large area of skin. Permanent formation of vesicles on the skin was noted, with nonhealing erosive surfaces with a bright red base at the age of 4 years. By the age of 8 years, bullous and erosive lesions were localized to the skin of the abdomen, back, and upper and lower extremities. On erosion sites, scar tissue had formed. At the same age, he had also developed contractures and pseudosyndactyly of the toes and hands.\nLater in his life, periodic exacerbations of the disease occurred approximately every 2 months leading to the formation of new vesicles with purulent exudate and erosions, sometimes accompanied by fever up to 39\u00b0C.

He experienced a significant blunt trauma to the abdomen resulting in a brief loss of consciousness. He felt immediate pain in his left ankle on awakening; however, he was able to bear weight briefly until the pain became too severe. On examination, he had a generalized swelling over both the medial and lateral aspects of the left ankle compared with the right. Ecchymosis was also present on the medial side of the left ankle. He displayed tenderness to palpation over the anterolateral portion of the left ankle only. Radiographs in the anterior-posterior (), lateral, and oblique views revealed a Salter-Harris type IV fracture of the distal left tibia involving the posterior tibial metaphysis and the anterolateral aspect of the tibial epiphysis.\nThe epiphyseal fragment was displaced proximally, anteriorly, and laterally, with a 2.5 mm step-off at the articular surface seen on the lateral view. Due to high suspicion for a Tillaux fracture and inadequate evidence on plain radiographs, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the left ankle without intravenous contrast was taken. This study revealed an avulsion fracture of the anterolateral tibial epiphysis that is laterally and anteriorly displaced in addition to the non-displaced fracture of the posterior malleolus involving the metaphysis and extending into the tibial plafond with no significant step-off (\n).\nThe decision was made to treat surgically based on the size of the articular step-off (2.5 mm) of the epiphyseal fragment.

In the last two weeks before his examination he had also been suffering from frequent episodes of right-sided hemifacial paraesthesias. Upon neurological examination, it was revealed that there was a deficit of the 6th cranial nerve on the right side, which arose only when the patient looked sideways, to the far right.\nThe patient had undergone a cerebral MRI scan () that showed a 3 cm maximal diameter isointense lesion centred in the region of the right cavernous sinus on T1-weighted images. In T2-weighted images, the lesion was hyperintense compared with the surrounding brain. The lesion presented inhomogeneous enhancement after contrast injection.\nWhile in hospital, a CT angiography was performed in order to document the relationship of the tumour with the ICA and with the cavernous sinus. The mass appeared adjacent to the wall of the carotid artery (); the CT venous phase () showed that the cavernous sinus was compressed and medialized by the tumour rather than invaded by it. On the basis of the images and of the clinical history of the patient it was theorized that the tumour might have developed in the virtual space existing between the dura and the inner membrane of the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus ().\nThe patient underwent microneurosurgery using the pterional approach; we opened the dura, moved with a spatula the medial part of the temporal pole, and exposed the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus, which was severely bulging especially in the lower part.

A stone was passed spontaneously by the patient seven days before sent to the urological clinic. The boy was born in Henan Province of China (Central China, Han) and was the second child of non-consanguineous parents. The family denied the presence of PH in the family history. The physical examination of the patient was in normal range. The boy has moderate nutrition, normal intelligence, a height of 130 cm, a weight of 24 kg, a blood pressure of 105/77 mmHg. A computerized tomography (CT) scan showed the hydronephrosis in his right kidney, and stones occurred in his left kidney, right ureter and bladder (Fig. ). The crystals passed by the patient spontaneously were identified as mostly (> 95%) composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate according to the infrared spectroscopy test (Supplementary Fig. ). From the examination of his renal and liver function, we found the serum creatinine concentration was as low as 2.07 mmol/1.73m2/24 h, the concentration of urinary oxalate was 2.44 mmol/1.73m2/24 h (Table ).\nDue to the high concentration of urinary oxalate and the composition of the stone from the patient, we highly suspected that the subject might suffer PH because of a genetic variant inherited from this family. In order to identify the type of PH for the patient and appropriately conduct further treatment, the Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed on the patient (described below).\nBased on the four follow-up visits of the patient, the function of his liver and kidney were back to normal and all clinical examinations were within the normal range after the first treatment. Four 2\u20133 mm new kidney stones were found in the second examination and passed with the aid of physical auxiliary vibration, no obvious stone residue was found",

    "original_text": "A 30-year-old female patient presented to our clinic with a left neck mass that she noticed a few months prior to clinical evaluation. She had a full range of motion in her neck and rarely complained of pain but did notice a lot of difficulty swallowing. The patient reported the mass has been increasing in size. She denied any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, redness, or drainage around the mass. The rest of her history was unremarkable to the case. On physical exam, the patient was noted to have a BMI of 43.67 and all vital signs were within normal limits. The physical exam showed a left neck mass with poorly defined borders, nontender, and without inflammatory changes. The patient previously had an ultrasound of the left neck which demonstrated a circumscribed solid echogenic mass measuring 6.7 cm \u00d7 1.8 cm \u00d7 4.8 cm which corresponded to the palpable abnormality superior to the clavicle. The mass was identified as a lipoma ().\nA left lateral transverse incision and dissection showed no subcutaneous mass. Intraoperative Doppler showed extreme medial displacement of the carotid sheath vessels. Then, a formal lateral neck dissection released the medial investing fascia of the sternocleidomastoid muscle enabling its further lateral retraction (). The mass was located substernocleidomastoid, from the C3 vertebral level down to the lung apex. It was medially displacing and abutting both the carotid sheath and the cervical thoracic duct as it drains into the internal jugular and subclavian vein junction.

She had a past history of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and was treated with prednisolone (40 mg/day) 3 months before presenting at our hospital. Her bone mineral density in the hip had a T-score of \u22124.7, and bisphosphonate and vitamin D were initiated to treat osteoporosis. She underwent computed tomography (CT) and was diagnosed as having a left vertical sacral fracture and treated conservatively. Three weeks after her initial diagnosis of sacral fracture, her low back pain worsened and she started to have radiating left posterior thigh pain with symptoms of stress urinary incontinence, constipation, and loss of anal sensation.\nOn examination, she had weakness of dorsiflexion of her left ankle and flexion of both great toes, in which the muscular power was grade 3/5 and 4/5, respectively, as measured with manual muscle testing (MMT).

The preoperative X-ray and MRI showed an osteochondral defect of the medial femoral condyle (Figure A-C). Preoperatively, the cartilage defect was predicted to be classified as an International Cartilage Repair Society Grade IV lesion and arthroscopic evaluation demonstrated the same grade lesion of the femoral medial condyle (Figure A). Osteochondral graft transplantation was performed utilizing the Arthrex osteochondral autograft transfer system (Arthrex, Naples, Fla.). A bone plug 9 mm in diameter and 13 mm in depth was removed from the lesion (recipient site). Then an osteochondral plug 1.0 mm oversized in diameter and of the same length was harvested from the lateral patello-femoral joint surface of the ipsilateral knee and transplanted into the recipient site measuring 10 \u00d7 15 mm using the press-fit technique. However, the extended lesion partially to the non-weight bearing deep area from the transplanted site made it difficult to perform grafting even during deep knee flexion. Thus we only stimulated the bone marrow by using the microfracture technique at the lesion (Figure B). Postoperative managements were performed in the same manner as in Case 1. The patient had to keep taking steroid after the operation in order to control primary disease. X-rays and MRIs taken two years after surgery showed the restoration of the articular cartilage surface and good engraftment of the graft (Figure C-E). A second-look arthroscopy performed two years after surgery showed that the lesion was covered with cartilageous tissue even though a part of the non-grafting site at the posterior aspect of the defect exhibited only fibrous tissue coverage (Figure F). The surface of the articular cartilage was smooth both at the recipient and donor sites. We did not find any abnormality in the donor site condition",

He reported increasing muscle weakness along with poor coordination and recurrent falls to the left side. He had fallen not only while standing but also while getting on his bicycle. He had been experiencing difficulty turning his head either way sideways, along with difficulty turning the steering wheel of his recreational vehicle to the left side. Other symptoms included hoarse voice, dysphagia for solids and liquids, difficulty writing on a straight line, and difficulty typing on his keyboard.

The patient presented to her first postoperative visit with inflamed, erythematous surgical sites and high-grade fever of 103.6\u00b0F. The patient was started empirically on cephalexin and ciprofloxacin without resolution of symptoms. The results of wound, blood, and urine cultures were found to be negative. The patient was admitted to the hospital 3 days later for suspected infection. Repeat radical debridements over the following 2 weeks revealed dramatic wound dehiscence. The results of repeat wound cultures were found to be positive only for contaminant microorganisms. The patient remained febrile throughout her hospital course, with peak white blood cell count of 55,000. Abdominal skin biopsies revealed ulceration, severe necrosis, and significant neutrophilic and lymphocytic inflammation.\nThe patient was started on a course of oral steroids and discharged from the hospital the following week. The ulcerations continued to expand despite treatment, and the patient was subsequently transferred to our academic institution for evaluation 1 month after initial symptom onset.

His only known previous ophthalmic history was of corneal foreign body removal 45 years previously although previous medical history included peripheral vascular disease, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Initial ophthalmic assessment revealed vision of light perception only, with an inferior descemetocoele and positive Seidel test. His right eye was unremarkable with no evident corneal pathology.

Patient reported self-medicating with biperiden and developing tolerance to this drug. He described this effect as feeling relaxed and sociable. Given his multiple unsuccessful attempts to quit biperiden, the patient thought that he was addicted to this drug and wanted to be treated for it.\nPast psychiatric history was significant for a 31-year history of alcohol and marijuana abuse and a 22-year history of cocaine abuse. At the time of presentation, he had been abstinent from alcohol or other drugs for two years. Family history was significant for a brother with alcoholism and an uncle who committed suicide. The patient had been hospitalized 18 times for behavioral problems related to his substance abuse. He was taking pregabalin 75 mg twice daily and 5 mg of diazepam every 8 hours as needed for anxiety as prescribed by his family physician.\nOn his first visit to our unit, the patient had already been using biperiden for three months. He had progressively increased the amount and was taking up to 50 mg daily. He presented with an anticholinergic intoxication. He was somnolent and disoriented to time and place. He had poor short-term memory and showed generalized weakness. He had poor and incoherent speech and was not able to carry a normal conversation. He complained of dry mouth, blurry vision, resting tremor, urinary incontinence, constipation, and poor appetite. Family reported that the patient had seemed very confused and was not able to do simple tasks such as eating at the table.

Endoscopic examination at a previous hospital revealed the presence of early carcinomas in the stomach and distal esophagus. The patient was referred to our hospital for endoscopic resection.\nLaboratory data, as well as serum carcinoembryonic antigen, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, and cytokeratin-19 fragment levels, were close to normal limits. Endoscopic examination revealed mild granular elevated lesions, with slightly depressed irregular mucosa, extending from the anterior wall to the right wall of the distal esophagus (Fig. ). This irregular mucosa further extended from the anterior wall to the left wall, with the boundary on the oral side being unclear (Fig. ). A superficial elevated tumor-like lesion was also observed in the lower body of the stomach, with a diameter of about 10 mm (Fig. ). Based on the endoscopic biopsy specimen, this gastric lesion was diagnosed as a well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. On the other hand, the preoperative biopsy specimens of the esophageal tumor showed intraepithelial tumor cells, which were isolated or in clusters, and consisted of large clear cells with atypical nuclei and prominent nucleoli. No glandular structures and no obvious intracytoplasmic mucin were observed.

The pathological diagnosis was lipoma.\nThe tumor recurred in the left thigh at age 62. At the time of presentation to our department, the tumor had been present for 11 years and had gradually increased in size. Physical examination at first visit revealed an elastic hard mass measuring approximately 25 cm in width and 30 cm in length, located in the posterior left thigh. No tenderness, redness, or local warmth was noted. Laboratory examinations revealed that serum creatine kinase (CK) was mildly elevated at 825 \u03bcIU/L. Plain radiography showed a soft tissue mass shadow in the left thigh without calcification or periosteal reaction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed high signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images and heterogeneous hyperintensity on short-TI inversion recovery images (). In addition, severe muscle atrophy and lipomatous changes were observed in both thighs. Open biopsy revealed no evidence of highly malignant cells. Therefore, we considered the tumor to be a lipoma or an atypical lipomatous tumor.\nSurgical excision of the tumor was performed. On exploration, the tumor consisted of fat globules partially surrounded by a capsule and with poorly defined margins that was infiltrating different layers of the thigh muscles.

Since the age of three months she was hospitalized several times with intermittent wheezing, inspiratory stridor, epigastrical retractions, dyspnea and cough. Each time, she was diagnosed either with bronchiolitis or wheezy bronchitis and treated with bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids and antibiotics. However the symptoms recurred frequently, therefore further diagnostic approaches were initiated including chest-radiography, allergy tests (specific IgE) and otorhinolaryngeal examination, which revealed no abnormalities. At the age of two years the girl was admitted to our hospital because of an acute exacerbation of her pulmonary situation. She presented in reduced physical condition with respiratory distress at rest, wheezing and dry cough. Inhalation therapy with beta agonists showed no success, there were no signs of a severe viral or bacterial infection. Based on her medical history of several episodes with recurrent, therapy-refractory wheezing without signs of an infection and her acute condition of severe respiratory distress we decided to extend the diagnostic approach and underwent flexible bronchoscopy under general anesthesia. The larynx appeared with a mild malacia, the branching of the right upper lobe bronchus (RUL) was atypical in the anterior aspect of the carina followed by tracheal stenosis. The main bronchi could not be entered with a two millimeter bronchoscope (Figure ). Therefore and to identify the exact anatomical situation a CT scan of the lung was performed with a three-dimensional reconstruction of the tracheo-bronchial system, which demonstrated a voluminous right upper lobe bronchus branching of the trachea at the level of the aortic arch, followed distally by a tracheal stenosis to the left (Figure ).

He had a high fever, anorexia, tachycardia, and tachypnea. He had no comorbidities or surgical history. The white blood cell count, liver enzymes, and C-reactive protein level were elevated. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic lesion with a maximum diameter of 40 mm in the left lobe of the liver (Fig. ). Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a lesion with coexisting low- and high-density areas in segment III of the liver. The lesion was adjacent to the stomach antrum and had a maximum diameter of 55 mm, with enhancement at the edge. The lesion contained air and a high-density linear object measuring about 24 mm (Fig. a, b). We suspected a liver abscess secondary to gastric perforation caused by a foreign body. The patient underwent abscess drainage and removal of the foreign body using five-port laparoscopic surgery. Adhesions had formed between the liver and reticulum due to inflammation (Fig. a). We confirmed pus leakage, performed lysis of adhesions, and found a fish bone inside the reticulum (Fig. b\u2013d). The fish bone was removed laparoscopically. We lavaged the abscess cavity with saline. The operation was completed with the insertion of a drain inferior to the left lobe of the liver. There was no bile leakage from the abscess cavity. The total operative time was 62 min, and the total intraoperative blood loss was 20 ml. The pus culture showed the presence of Streptococcus anginosus, which matched the result of the blood culture. We used meropenem until postoperative day 10. The clinical course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 11. When the patient was discharged, we changed the antibiotic treatment from meropenem to a combination of potassium clavulanate and amoxicillin hydrate according to the indications",

Condyloma acuminatum was suspected and the decision was made to monitor her. However, the mass continued to grow throughout the pregnancy, causing significant discomfort.

On examination, a discrete mass, less than 1 cm, was noticed in the left labium majus. A biopsy of the right labial lesion was recommended and plan for cesarean section to decrease the risk of birth trauma was discussed with the patient. Patient declined the biopsy as an outpatient expressing concerns about possible discomfort related to the procedure with local anesthesia and opted for excision of the right labial lesion at the time of the cesarean section. The patient underwent elective primary cesarean section with spinal anesthesia at 39 weeks' gestation due to increased risk of birth trauma and bleeding from the right labial lesion with a vaginal delivery. In addition, excision of the right labial mass was performed, which measured 4.5 cm at the time of surgery. Given the small size of the left labial lesion (<1 cm) at the time of the delivery and in order to minimize the risks from multiple invasive procedures, the sampling of the left labial lesion was deferred.

At the time of the thymoma detection, she had not shown any abnormal neurological symptoms. However, she has been suffering from symptoms such as moderate bilateral ptosis, severe diplopia, and muscle weakness after 10 years of thymoma operation, despite no recurrence of the thymoma. The affected muscles were the bilateral external ocular muscles, pharyngeal musculature, neck extensor muscle, deltoid, biceps, triceps, and iliopsoas. In particular, her left eye movement was limited in all directions. The diplopia developed at approximately the same time as the onset of the ptosis, and the extremity muscle weakness occurred during the 6 months following the onset of the external ocular symptoms. MG was diagnosed by the fluctuating symptoms, the waning detected in a repetitive nerve stimulation test on the median nerve, and positive test results for the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody. The patient's quantitative MG score [] was of 24 points. After plasma exchange treatment, her qualitative MG score improved to 11 points. The AChR antibody titer at the initial visit was 250 \u03bcmol/l. The antibody titer decreased to 95 \u03bcmol/l after plasmapheresis (PP) treatment. However, improvement of the left external ocular movement (EOM) without ptosis was poor compared to the improvements in the right EOM, dysphagia, and limb muscles weakness. An orbital MRI was performed because the diplopia did not respond to PP or an edrophonium test, and revealed an intraorbital tumor of 3 cm in diameter. The tumor was diagnosed as an orbital cavernous hemangioma (OCH) by the imaging characteristics (fig. ). It was followed closely without treatment because the patient did not want surgical treatments for the tumor.
