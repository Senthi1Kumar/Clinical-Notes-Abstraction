    "original_text": "A 39-year-old male patient who was a non-smoker with no comorbidities arrived at our hospital in August 2019 and presented with dry cough for 6 months and a weight loss of 5 kg per month. The patient had no previous chest pain or dyspnoea. A physical examination was also performed. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax revealed many bilateral lung lesions of approximately 4\u20139 mm with enlargement of the mediastinum, hilar and supravicular, and abdominal lymph nodes with the largest size of 28 \u00d7 31 mm. The brain MRI showed that the lesion in the frontal region located in the top left and right frontal lobe had the largest diameter of approximately 24 mm, causing oedema. Moreover, bone scintigraphy showed numerous bone metastases in the spine and bilateral pelvis. A CT-guided fine-needle biopsy of the lung tumour was also performed, and the histological identification illustrated lung invasive adenocarcinoma with both TTF1 and napsin A. The patient was diagnosed with stage IVC lung adenocarcinoma (brain, bone, and abdominal lymph nodes). Tissue samples were tested for next-generation sequencing. According to the results, the patient had both types of EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation mixed rearrangement ALK (ALK-EML4 fusion). In September 2019, we decided to use a second-generation ALK inhibitor, ceritinib (alectinib is not available in Vietnam), instead of EGFR-TKIs for the initial treatment of the patient. The patient's brain lesions were also closely monitored.\nWithin 3 months of treatment, the patient's clinical symptoms markedly improved. The patient did not experience cough or chest pain. The CT scan indicated that lesions of the bilateral lungs, as well as the mediastinal and abdominal lymph nodes were greatly reduced and exhibited partial response (Fig. ).\nNevertheless, brain MRI showed that metastatic tumours responded poorly to treatment. Thus, the patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery with one fraction at a dose of 18 Gy on the brain lesion for local control, whilst continuing with ceritinib",

The patient had a previous clinical history of arterial hypertension and atrial fibrillation. He had two previous cardiac surgery procedures. He underwent, 10 years ago, a full aortic root replacement with a composite graft (Dacron graft with mechanical valve, Bentall-De Bono procedure) associated with triple coronary bypass (IMA to anterior descending artery and vein grafts to intermediate branch and posterior descending artery).\nThe second procedure was performed 6 months before the current episode, when the patient suffered from a native mitral valve IE episode (\nStaphylococcus epidermidis\n). He was admitted in cardiogenic shock with confirmed endocarditic involvement of the mitral valve. The critical preoperative status did not permit a preoperative angiogram. No signs of myocardial ischemia were present, so the patient underwent an emergent mitral valve replacement by a mechanical prosthesis performed through a right thoracotomy approach, to avoid possible complications related to the previous coronary grafts. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged home after completing 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotic treatment with daptomycin and rifampicin.\nThe current episode started when the patient was readmitted to our institution in a critical clinical state, with congestive heart failure and sepsis. The patient presented with persistent fever, dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. On physical examination, no peripheral stigmata of endocarditis were found. A diastolic murmur was heard along the left sternal border. Three blood cultures were positive for\nStaphylococcus aureus\n. Antibiotic treatment was initiated with intravenous oxacillin, rifampicin, and gentamicin. Complete imaging studies were conducted.\nTransesophageal echocardiography revealed a mitral peri-prosthetic leak that caused severe mitral valve regurgitation.

She had undergone surgery for right breast cancer (pT1aN0M0 stage I) one year ago and had received endocrine therapy. There was nothing important in her family history. She had a history of smoking (20 cigarettes/day for 20 years) and drinking alcohol. We treated her with chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Because in this case, as the pathological diagnosis was HPV-positive squamous cell carcinoma, it was thought that the primary and neck lesions were more likely to be controlled by CRT. Besides, the distant metastasis was only to the right lung and it was a single lesion and small of around 1 cm. Therefore, we thought the lung metastatic lesion could be controlled by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) after local treatment. Actually, we had the experience of such a case before.

Her medical history included high myopia for more than 50 years, but she had never had diabetes, hypertension, or other systemic illness. On admission, her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg, her visual acuity was light perception, and her intraocular pressure (IOP) was 5 mmHg in the left eye. An ocular examination performed on the left eye showed a flare and was positive for cells in the anterior chamber. A fundus examination and B-ultrasound revealed retinal detachment with choroidal detachment (A, B).\nAll hematological and biochemical tests were within normal limits. After surgical contraindications were excluded, we performed a combined phacoemulsification without intraocular lens implantation and vitrectomy in combination with silicone oil injection. The choroidal detachment (C, star) was clearly visible before phacoemulsification was performed. After phacoemulsification, 20G and 23G vitrectomy cannulas were placed 3.5 mm from the limbus. The 20G cannula was left open, and the infusion line was placed in the anterior chamber through a clear corneal paracentesis with a bottle height of 40 mmHg. As soon as the infusion line was opened, a copious, thick flux of blood flowed out of the 20G cannulas and was followed a yellowish liquid (D). As the blood flow continued, the choroidal detachment visibly recessed. Though there was tight adhesion between the posterior vitreous and retina, the posterior vitreous cortex was completely separated from the inner surface of the retina. A 1/5PD hole was found in the arch of the vascular arch below the macula (E, black arrow), and a full vitrectomy combined with intravitreal silicone oil tamponade was performed.

Five months following sacrectomy, the tumour recurred and the patient received 34 doses of a total 7000 Gy RT for 6 weeks. One month after the last RT session, the patient was operated for the second time by the Orthopaedic Surgery Department. Re-resection was done through anterior as well as posterior approach. A sigmoid loop colostomy was done simultaneously. A myocutaneous gluteus maximus flap was used for closure of the 20 \u00d7 10 cm defect formed after resection of the tumour.\nFifteen days after surgery when Plastic Surgery consultation was sought it was observed that the sutures in the intergluteal area had given way, the raw wound surface of the dehisced area was covered with whitish yellow necrotic tissues and considerable amount of purulent discharge was coming out of the wound. The necrotic area was of 28 \u00d7 25 cm in dimension and the gluteal flap raised from the left gluteal region was completely necrosed. The surrounding tissues showed post radiotherapy changes with intense inflammation and unstable parchment like skin [].\nDebridement revealed that the necrotic area extended to the muscle of the utilised left myocutaneous gluteus maximus flap, and also to the right gluteal area where no surgery was done before. As soon as 3 days after debridement, further necrosis occured on the area possibly due to the recent RT.\nA second debridement followed by immediate reconstruction was planned. At the end of the second debridement neurovascular structures, distal lumbar vertebra and mesocolon were all left exposed.

The onset of pain was 24 hours prior to arrival at the ED. He had a history of 10 pack/year smoking but had no history of alcohol consumption. He also reported two episodes of similar abdominal pain in RUQ with a continuous pattern in the past year. He underwent supportive treatment with a sonography report of chronic cholecystitis. His past medical and drug history were unremarkable. In review of systems, there was no further complaint except abdominal pain. On initial evaluation he was afebrile (axillary temperature of 37.1\u00b0C) with blood pressure of 120/85 mmHg, pulse rate of 85 per minute, and respiratory rate of 10 per minute. There was no evidence of icterus. In abdominal examination, on light palpation there was moderate tenderness in RUQ and epigastric region. Murphy\u2019s sign was negative. There was no evidence of organomegaly and no palpable mass was detected. Laboratory results showed white blood cell count of 5600/\u00b5L with 60% polymorphonuclear, amylase level of 63 U/L (normal range of below 100 U/L) and normal liver and renal function tests. The patient underwent ultrasonography with primary diagnosis of biliary colic. Sonographic findings included gallbladder with thick edematous wall, free fluid around and a number of stones inside and also bile ducts with normal diameter. According to these findings the patient was transferred to the operating room for laparoscopic cholecystectomy after hydration and initiation of intravenous antibiotic. Due to the inability to detect the gallbladder during laparoscopy, laparotomy with Kocher incision was done. The gallbladder was not detectable even after laparotomy and a mass was seen and palpated in right lobe of liver. The laparotomy was ended after lavage of abdominal cavity and placing a surgical drain without any further action. Afterward a gastroenterology consult was requested and the",

He had multiple hospitalizations in the preceding 3 months for similar symptoms and had been diagnosed with pneumonia 3 times and cholangitis once. He had recently finished a course of intravenous antibiotics for presumed pneumonia 2 days prior to presentation.\nThe patient\u2019s past medical history was significant for Alagille syndrome which presented as direct hyperbilirubinemia at 2 months of age. Liver biopsy was performed at 3 months and revealed cholestasis, paucity of bile ducts and giant cell transformation (Figure ), consistent with Alagille syndrome. He was also noted by imaging and clinical examination to have butterfly vertebrae, right and left pulmonary artery stenosis, and prominent forehead and eyes.

She revealed a 12-h history of abdominal pain that had suddenly worsened and was associated with vomiting 1 h prior to presentation. She was otherwise healthy and denied the regular use of any medications.\nA physical examination showed a blood pressure of 96/58 mmHg, heart rate of 95 beats/min, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, and hypothermia. An abdominal examination showed a diffusely rigid abdomen with rebound tenderness over the entire abdomen and reduced bowel sounds. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography showed a paraesophageal hernia in which part of the stomach was incarcerated (Fig. ). Free air and ascites were observed in the hernia sac and peritoneal space. The patient developed gastrointestinal perforation-induced peritonitis; however, the association between the incarcerated hernia and the perforation was unclear.\nAn emergency laparotomy was performed through the upper abdominal midline incision, and we observed that part of the stomach was incarcerated within the paraesophageal hernia sac, which also contained ascitic fluid that appeared like gastric fluid. After reducing the stomach, we detected a perforation measuring 7 cm on the posterior wall of the gastric fundus (Fig. ). The affected part of the stomach showed full-thickness necrosis, for which we performed total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction. During the operation, the patient\u2019s hemodynamics was unstable; thus, hernia repair only involved closure of the orifice, and fundoplication was not performed. The operative time was 3 h 22 min and the amount of bleeding was limited to 104 ml. The resected specimen showed an ischemic necrosis\u2013induced perforation measuring 7 \u00d7 4.5 cm on the posterior wall of the gastric fundus (Fig. ).

From the point of study, he had been taking alcohol for the last 8 years, which has increased for the last 2 years. Initially, the amount used to be taken was 750 ml/day. Since the last 2 years, the quantity of alcohol taken has increased to 1500\u20132000 ml/every day. The period of abstinence during these years was limited to a few days; the maximum abstinence period was 16 days. The case reported of no other physiological or psychological withdrawal symptoms except feeling distress and disturbance of sleep. He reported an increased urge to take the substance during 2\u20135 pm and after 9 pm (critical time).\nMr. A reported that he was experiencing more stress because his wife was asking for a divorce which he did not want. He reported that due to his habit of alcohol, conflicts with his wife escalated. The patient reported that he as a laboratory technician has been able to perform his job properly. Impairment was reported more in his familial relations. The patient had gradually limited himself to few of his friends; he had started avoiding his relatives as they used to ask him to quit alcohol.\nHe had attempted few times to quit alcohol but was unable to maintain the sobriety for long.

She had a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and essential hypertension. She denied any history of thyroid disease and neck irradiation. She had no family history of any cancer. She was a housewife and had no history of tobacco smoking or consuming alcohol. A physical examination at the time of presentation was not significant except for right costovertebral angle tenderness. Her heart rate was 96 beats per minute and blood pressure was 155/90 mmHg. The findings of laboratory tests, which were complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, and urine analysis, were within normal range and they did not help us find the etiology of her right flank pain. Abdominal screening with computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass on her right kidney, which was considered a primary renal cell carcinoma and she underwent a right nephrectomy. Unexpectedly, PTC metastasis was diagnosed from demonstrative histopathological findings, such as positive immunoperoxidase staining for thyroglobulin (Tg). After further examinations of her thyroid and neck with ultrasonography (USG), a total thyroidectomy was performed. Pathological examination of thyroid tissue revealed a 5 cm tumor with capsular invasion and a strong positive immunoperoxidase staining of cytokeratin-19, HBME-1, and galectin-3. She was diagnosed as having metastatic PTC. Orally administered levothyroxine 75 mcg daily was initiated in addition to the metformin 1000 mg twice daily and amlodipine 10 mg daily treatments she received prior to PTC diagnosis. Postoperative serum Tg was above 300 ng/ml and anti-Tg was negative. Afterward, she was screened with unenhanced thoracic CT and skeletal scintigraphy. They revealed bilateral multiple nodules in her lungs and bone metastasis on T10 vertebra and right sacroiliac joint. Initially, 30 Gy radiotherapy was implemented to her T9\u201310 vertebrae for 12 days. We also started treating her with L-thyroxine to keep her thyrotropin (TSH) level below 0.1 mIU/L",

She also noticed right nasolabial fold fullness for a year, which increased in size over time associated with right facial pain. Clinical examination revealed a swelling in the right nasolabial fold measuring 2 \u00d7 1 cm. It was tender to palpation, hard in consistency, but with normal overlying skin. Anterior rhinoscopic examination of the right nasal cavity revealed lateral nasal wall swelling obliterating 90% of the nasal vestibule with normal overlying mucosa and skin colour externally. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a well-defined subcutaneous soft tissue density measuring 1.6 \u00d7 1.6 cm located in the right nasolabial fold. The lesion demonstrated isointensity with no drop in fat saturation T1 but showed hypointensity on T2 and homogeneous enhancement postcontrast ().\nIn August 2014, the patient underwent surgical excision of the mass through a sublabial approach, and the mass was found to be encapsulated with no infiltration to surrounding tissues and was excised completely with its capsule with uncomplicated postoperative period. Histopathological examination of the mass revealed spindle cells proliferation, forming fascicles and whorls on a background of collagen fibres. The fascicles were associated with foci of mixed inflammatory cells infiltrate composed mainly of lymphocytes and plasma cells, along with scattered eosinophils and neutrophils. The lesion infiltrates the surrounding striated muscles and fatty tissue with no infiltration to cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue.

During the femoral fixation, the graft was pulled to the femoral tunnel, and unrestricted back and forth motion of the wire (transverse motion that is an indirect sign of full proximal migration) was achieved. A dilator was inserted over the guide wire. The Bio-TransFix implant was inserted using the appropriate protocol and stability was checked. The stability was excellent but the guide wire could not be pulled out and was found to be broken at the end. This is because the bio-TransFix implant and medial side wire co-existed in the predrilled narrow space, which is located in the medial side of the femoral tunnel. If the wire is removed, the graft can not be fixed with any approach. The TransFix implant must be inserted between two strands. However, the implant in our case was inserted above the loop portion of the graft. A broken wire that exits medially is compressed by the forehead portion of the Bio-TransFix implant and the graft is hung on the wire loop because the Bio-TransFix implant and medial side two wire co-exist in the predrilled narrow space located on the medial side of the femoral tunnel (). During the operation, a 1 cm incision was used for the TransFix insertion. We maintained the guide wire because fixation failure could occur if the wire was pulled. Therefore, we cut the wire via a skin incision for the TransFix insertion as maximally as possible. The patient underwent routine post-",

    "original_text": "A 78-year-old woman was taken to the emergency room because of pain and bulging in the right groin. After evaluation by the emergency physician, the patient was sent for ultrasonographic examination with the clinical suspicion of an inguinal hernia. The patient had a 15-year history of type 2 diabetes, currently treated with insulin, and a 7-year history of hypertension treated with amlodipine 5 mg/day. The patient referred a slow onset with an abdominal stabbing pain of moderate intensity in the right inguinal area and a bulge with no changes in the skin.\nUltrasound was performed with a Philips iU22 ultrasound using a 9 MHz linear transducer. A well-defined cystic mass was observed over the area. Right in the middle, a tubular image that terminated in a blind-ended tip in the longitudinal plane () and a target appearance on the cross-sectional plane () consistent with the appendix were demonstrated. The appendix measured 0.63 and 0.72 mm, discreetly above normal range, and it showed hypoechoic thickening of the mucosal layer. Color Doppler flow of the tip () and adjacent soft tissue showed inflammatory changes. The patient presented pain on compression with the transducer. The surrounding fat tissue presented increased echogenicity suggesting inflammatory tissue. The preoperative surgical diagnosis was a strangulated inguinofemoral hernia.

An intrasellar, multilobular, and cystic lesion extending to the suprasellar region was detected by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) []. The lesion compressed the optic chiasma upwards. Her endocrinological function was normal, based on the results of several hormone loading tests. She underwent surgical treatment by endoscopic transsphenoidal approach, and the tumor was completely removed. During surgery, the dura on the sellar floor was sutured with a PVDF suture to avoid postoperative CSF rhinorrhea, though intraoperative CSF leakage was not detected. Subsequently, reconstruction of the sellar floor with an autogenous bone graft from the anterior wall of the sphenoid sinus was performed. The pathological diagnosis was null cell adenoma. She took 5 mg oral hydrocortisone daily for 2 weeks after surgery for the prevention of temporary central adrenal failure. She had an uncomplicated postoperative course without recurrence of the tumor. She did not require hormone replacement because her postoperative endocrine function was normal.\nFive years after the TSS, she complained about abnormal odor and visited an otolaryngologist at a local clinic. On rhinoscopy, a white mass was detected in the sphenoidal sinus. A diagnosis of bacterial sphenoiditis was made, and daily intake of oral antibiotic drugs for 2 weeks improved her symptoms. However, after 3 months, the unusual odor recurred. Brain MRI showed a thickened sphenoid sinus mucosa, well-enhanced on T1-weighted images []. During the second rhinoscopy, a fungal ball was suspected, and a second surgery was performed. In the second operation, while the sphenoid sinus mucosa was intact, the end of a dural suture was focused to be the focus of the fungal ball [].

On clinical examination a localized gingival swelling of 1.5cm X 1cm size with clear signs of inflammation was present in relation to 41, 42 (Fig. ). The swelling was a smooth exophytic lesion manifested as a small erythematous papule on a pedunculated base which was hemorrhagic with spontaneous bleeding on probing the area (Fig. ). The lesion was painless and asymptomatic except for the slight discomfort to the patient due to the growth. Physical examination revealed no other abnormalities, and there was no cervical lymphadenopathy. On hard tissue examination there were 31 teeth with atraumatic occlusion. There was moderate supra- and subgingival calculus with moderate gingivitis. Grade 1 mobility was present in tooth 42. The patient\u2019s medical history was uneventful. The periapical radiograph showed a deep bony defect extending from 41 to 42 (Fig. ).\nSo by considering all the above features a provisional diagnosis of pyogenic granuloma was made and excisional biopsy was planned. A conventional non-surgical therapy was first of all performed, with full mouth scaling and root planing. There was severe bleeding while doing scaling and curettage. However, the bleeding stopped within a few minutes by applying pressure with gauze. The patient was advised to perform and maintain their oral hygiene by brushing twice a day and to use a chlorhexidine mouth rinse of 0.2% twice daily.

    "original_text": "In 1982, a 33-year-old male patient presented with a pathological fracture of the left proximal femur. X-ray images of the proximal femur showed a large lytic lesion involving the whole intertrochanteric area. The lesion was expansive and bubby (). An open biopsy was taken the day after the patient was admitted to hospital. The histology was difficult. Sheets of roundish cells with moderate nuclear pleomorphism were seen. Their cytoplasm was predominantly clear to granular (). The lesion was initially mistaken for benign osteoblastoma. Since the lesion was diagnosed as benign no further examinations were undertaken. The fracture was supported with intramedullary nails until a custom-made endoprosthesis was available. Two months later the final intralesional resection was done and custom-made Link endoprosthesis was applied. Later the final pathology report from the resection was still difficult, but the treating physician concluded it might be an osteoblastoma or low-grade osteosarcoma. The surgery could be defined as intralesional and follow-up was conducted. The patient subsequently returned to near normal activities. He was working for 30 years with moderate physical strength but was unable to play any sport.\nHe was followed-up for ten years with local X-rays as well as lung X-rays and no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis was found. The latest X-ray from the operated femur was taken in 1993 and from the lung in 1994.\nIn November 2011, 29 years after the primary surgery, the patient was referred to our institution because of symptoms suggestive of prosthesis loosening. He had symptoms such as pain and uncertainty in every step, but otherwise his overall health status was excellent. Because of locally increasing symptoms he had taken one cane for support, but otherwise he was able to walk unlimited distances. X-ray showed a typical aseptic loosening of the prosthesis with substantial subsidence. On the lateral X-ray some ectopic ossification could be observed at the prosthesis-bone junction ().

    "original_text": "The patient was an 83-year-old woman who was referred to our institution from a nearby clinic for further investigation of lower back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple spinal lesions from the thoracic spine to the lumbar spine, suggesting spinal metastases (shown in Fig. ). She did not have any past illness or family history of malignancy. Laboratory studies revealed slight anemia and elevated serum lactic acid dehydrogenase and serum calcium levels. The levels for tumor markers, including CEA, SCC, CA19-9, and sIL-2, were within the normal range. A computed tomography scan from the-chest to the pelvis revealed multiple small lung nodules which were suspected to be lung metastases; however, no primary malignant lesion was detected. Multiple osteolytic lesions were detected from the thoracic spine to the pelvic bone, and a soft tissue mass was also detected in the subcutaneous tissue of the right buttock (shown in Fig. ). Although it was found to be a malignant disease with multiple metastases, it was difficult to determine the primary lesion and diagnose based on imaging alone.\nTo determine the pathological diagnosis of the lesions, a biopsy of the subcutaneous mass of the right buttock was performed. Histological examination showed that the tumor had an alveolar structure with nuclear irregularities with very few mitoses. Round or spindle tumor cells were surrounded by vascular lumen. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the tumor cells were diffusely positive for the vascular endothelium marker CD34 and the epithelial marker CK, and negative for AE1/AE3, which corresponds to EHE (shown in Fig. ). Due to her age and the nature of the tumor, the patient received only pain control therapy without antitumor therapy.\nOne month after the patient first presented to our hospital, she had spontaneous subcutaneous hematomas on the left forearm and right thigh. Subsequent work-up revealed a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, platelet count of 3.7 \u00d7 104/\u00b5L, fibrinogen value of 62.9 mg",
