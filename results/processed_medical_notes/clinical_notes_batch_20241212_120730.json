He underwent a transverse colectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy which he could not tolerate, and therefore stopped after three cycles. One year later he developed a single metastasis to the left lobe of his liver which was successfully resected. Following the resection he tolerated 12 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (irinotecan and de Gramont) and continued in remission.\nFour months after finishing chemotherapy, a surveillance computed tomography (CT) scan showed a new single liver nodule highly suspicious of metastasis. Another surgical resection was being considered and a positron emission tomography (PET) CT scan was performed to exclude the presence of metastases elsewhere. Unfortunately, three fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -avid pulmonary nodules were found, as well as a small focus of intense tracer uptake in the spinal canal at the C2-C3 level in his neck (Figures , , ). These findings precluded surgical resection. At that time our patient was totally asymptomatic from a neurological point of view.\nOne week later our patient started to feel pins and needles in his right upper and lower limbs. His symptoms worsened rapidly over the next three days and progressed to motor weakness. Two days later he was unable to walk without using a stick or being supported. There was no history of trauma and he denied any loss of sphincteric control. He was referred and reviewed as an emergency and admitted on the same day. A neurological examination revealed the following signs on his right side: spasticity, hyperreflexia (all right deep tendon reflexes), weakness, decreased tactile discrimination, joint and vibration sense, and upgoing plantar reflex.

After the treatment, the tumors in segments 6 and 7 were well controlled, while the pre-ruptured tumor in segment 5 and the lesion in segment 8 still remained viable.

The patient was diagnosed with AD at 5 months of age and reported a progressive worsening of his eczema over the past 5 years before the initial visit to our hospital. He had also allergic rhinitis; however, there was a no family history of allergic diseases. On physical examination, eczematous skin lesions on the whole body surface area were noted. The clinical severity score of AD in this patient (SCORAD value) at the initial visit was 81.5. Serum house dust mite-specific IgE assay (ImmunoCAP, Thermo Scientific Inc.) showed a strong positive result (). After admission, he was treated with a topical corticosteroid, systemic corticosteroid, and oral cyclosporine (200 mg/day). During the admission, he received subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy with house dust mite extract with ultra-rush schedule as previously reported. He was discharged from the hospital with clinical improvement. After discharge, he was treated with topical corticosteroid, topical calcineurin inhibitor, emollients, oral antihistamine, and oral cyclosporine (200 mg/day) as well as a monthly maintenance dose of subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy at the out-patient clinic of our university hospital. However, his clinical condition was not completely controlled even after treatment. At 11 months after the initial admission to our hospital, the patient was hospitalized again due to a severe acute exacerbation of AD with secondary bacterial skin infection. After admission, the acute flare-up was treated by a systemic corticosteroid with oral antibiotics.

The medical history was only notable for a car accident that had occurred 6 months earlier. In that car accident, the patient was provided with thoracic surgery to treat the rib fractures and lung injury. Following this, the patient was admitted to the Breast Center, General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command of the People\u2019s Liberation Army due to the sudden onset of a protruding mass on the right abdominal wall, which was indicated to be breast tissue by CT imaging. Upon examination, the right mammary gland was missing from its normal position, leaving a nipple areola complex on the right chest (), and a mass ~11\u00d715 cm in size was apparent in the right upper abdominal wall (). This was further viewed by chest CT and ultrasound scans. The CT scan showed no right mammary gland on the right chest wall (), but a mammary gland image of normal appearance was present in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen (). Moreover, the ultrasound scan also indicated that the protruding mass on the abdominal wall was a mammary gland ().\nReversion of the transposed breast to its original position was planned, however, the patient requested that it be removed. Therefore, a resection of the mass was performed resulting in complete removal of the transposed mammary gland (). Following surgery, an ultrasound scan was performed again to ensure complete resection of the mass ().

She had sensory impairment below the L1 dermatome of the left leg and hypoactive deep tendon reflexes in the lower extremities. She had no urinary incontinence. Rectal tone and sensation were both normal. Routine laboratory studies yielded normal values. Plain radiographs showed no evidence of bone destruction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 10 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 20 mm intradural mass lesion, between Th12 and L1. The lesion was hyperintense on T1-weighted (W) images and less intense on T2-weighted images, indicating the presence of fat tissue (, ).

Thoracic and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed no abnormalities. Four years later, he was referred for multiple lung nodules (in the middle lobe, the right upper lobe, and left lower lobe) without any other visceral lesion (). There was no deterioration in performance status, and no symptom. Bronchoscopy showed no anomaly and no histological diagnosis was obtained. There was no evidence of infectious disease. A surgical removal of the right upper lobe nodule was performed by axillary thoracotomy. Pathological findings confirmed metastasis of the urachal adenocarcinoma. The patient was treated with chemotherapy consisting of three courses on Day 1 and Day 14 of 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 as intravenous (i.v.) bolus followed by 2400 mg as i.v. continuous injection over 46 h and irinotecan 90 mg/m2. Tolerance was acceptable, despite a grade 2 neutropenia. CT scan showed lung nodules had almost disappeared. Four months later, the disease progressed with increasing size of the previously described lung nodules. Three cycles of chemotherapy with the same drugs were administered, with an acceptable clinical tolerance; due to a persistant neutropenia, chemotherapy was administered on Day 1 and Day 21 instead of Day 1 and Day 14 and the patient had to receive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). There was then a small regression of the nodules, with persistent activity on PET scan on the right lower lobe nodule. A surgical approach was decided, and a metastasectomy (in the right upper and lower lobes) was performed.

After birth, he was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and managed in an incubator for 2 weeks. Brain magnetic resonance imaging before discharge revealed bilateral cystic periventricular leukomalacia. The patient was discharged from the NICU at 38 weeks of gestation and started on physical therapy for 90 min once a week at the outpatient clinic of Japan Baptist Hospital at 2 months of chronological age.\nAt 2 years and 6 months of age, he acquired the ability to roll over, and his Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level was level IV. He had moderate spasticity of the modified Ashworth scale level 2 in both the lower extremities and right upper extremity, but the left upper extremity showed relatively mild paralysis, with his left hand being the dominant one. He intentionally grasped and released objects with only his left hand. When he tried to stand up, his lower limbs and equinus foot showed a scissors position (). There were no problems with the range of motion. The patient also had no swallowing or respiratory problems. However, he had impairment of the oculomotor system, such as strabismus, abnormal fixation, and following movements disorder. At 4 years and 9 months of age, he had acquired the ability to maintain a sitting position on a bench for several minutes.

Primary antiphospholipid syndrome was diagnosed 2 years prior to renal transplantation when he developed recurrent episodes of thrombosis of the arteriovenous fistula and neck veins, for which he was started on warfarin. Anticoagulation was optimized prior to surgery by withholding warfarin 5 days before surgery while bridging with heparin. During the early postoperative period (first postoperative week), he developed a peri-renal hematoma (ultrasonography 13 cm \u00d7 7 cm). Noncontrast computed tomography scan detected a homogenous fluid collection posterior to the transplanted kidney which extended superiorly up to the right subhepatic area and inferiorly into the pelvis, displacing the bladder to the left (Figure ). Anticoagulation was then withheld and he recovered over the next few days with normalization of serum creatinine and urine output. Prior to discharge, his urethral catheter and ureteric stent were removed and warfarin was restarted.\nThree weeks after the surgery, he presented with reduced urine output and progressive abdominal distension associated with pain and fever. Ultrasound scan revealed a large perigraft collection. Resuscitation and urgent exploration revealed a viable graft with a large urinoma posterior to the kidney. A possible anastomotic leak was suspected and a passive external drain was placed to allow adequate drainage of urine and healing of the anastomotic site. However, the conservative approach failed and there was no reduction in the drain output. Therefore, surgical exploration and definitive reconstruction were planned.\nSurgical exploration revealed an allograft vascular pedicle in the inferolateral aspect of the graft with a completely sloughed off allograft ureter (Figure ). Sloughed part of the allograft ureter was excised up to the pelviureteric junction where the graft renal pelvis appeared well-perfused and healthy. Free flow of urine from the graft was noted. Ipsilateral native ureter was divided close to the native renal pelvis and approximated to the graft extraperitoneally",

Elective repair was highly recommended. Her clinical examination along with the preoperative RX and CT scan revealed a severe pectus excavatum. Her sternum was angled and was only 1.5 cm close to the column vertebrae at the point of apex. This resulted in a total cardiac dislocation to the left ().\nDue to the severe sternal deformity, the affinity of the right atrium and the vena cava to the sternum, we enacted the operation with the exposure of the right femoral artery and vein to assure a quick access to cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP) if it was required. After the sternotomy it was very difficult to continue with sternal retractors, even if we tried to use a couple of them in upper and lower sternum. Alternatively, we used an Osler retractor at the left hemisternum to expose ascending aorta and right atrium. A partial CBP was then introduced with the ascending aorta and right atrium cannulation that gradually resulted in a total one with the cannulation of superior and inferior vena cava. Afterwards, a standard valve and aortic root replacement with a re-implantation technique was performed with the use of a 21 cm composite graft and Tricuspid valve annuloplasty with a 32mm physio tricuspid annular ring.\nOnce the operation was performed and the hemostatic procedures achieved adequate bleeding control, a post-repair transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated normal ventricular function with overall good composite graft function and no tricuspid insufficiency. Then a second Osler retractor was applied to the right hemi-sternum to minimize the compression of the cardiac structure and to achieve a safer disconnection from the CPB ().

She underwent colonoscopy that revealed a friable erythematous area with contact bleeding that spanned from the splenic flexure and 15 cm down the descending colon; biopsies were taken throughout the procedure. These findings were interpreted as Crohn's disease because of the distribution of inflammation although histology-pathology showed unspecific inflammation more closely related to ulcerative colitis.

Follow-up with fecal calprotectin showed no response and the patient was started on balsalazide.\nWhen the patient came for follow-up at 9 months she suffered from fever and bloody diarrhoea once daily. This was regarded as colonic Crohn's disease and budesonide was added to balsalazide, An MRE was made one month after the follow-up and it revealed no small bowel engagement; however it showed multiple signal changes in the spleen, benign cysts where suspected. A contrast enhanced ultrasound was made that showed indentations in the superior portion of the spleen as well as multiple minor cystic lesions and a central 1 cm lesion with late contrast loading, possibly a hemangioma. After two months the effect of budesonide wore off and the patient again suffered from bloody diarrhoea. Sigmoidoscopy showed proctitis with diminished vascularity and contact bleeding. Budesonide was switched to mesalamine which had no effect; therefore azathioprine was tried but a colonoscopy one month later showed inflammation from the sigmoid colon till the splenic flexure. The MRE images were once again examined and it was decided that an MRI was necessary to establish the nature of the splenic lesions.

Physical examination using palpation revealed burning and local tenderness. X-ray revealed a displaced fracture of the left olecranon with soft tissue swelling.

The physician held the patient's left palm in one hand and held the left elbow of the patient in the other hand. Next, the doctor pushed the proximal end of the patient's elbow with his finger to move closer to the distal end, and at the same time, straightened the patient's elbow slowly. Finally, the patient slowly buckled the elbow to 60\u00b0. It was then braced securely.

She reported that her pain started 2 weeks prior to presentation while she was seated on the toilet straining to void. Due to symptoms of her UC, she had been experiencing frequent diarrhea. While attempting to void, she experienced a sudden onset of excruciating lower pelvic pain. Her pain persisted, and she was subsequently evaluated at an outside ED later that evening. She was diagnosed with a suspected ulcerative colitis flare given her history. Her dysuria was diagnosed as a urinary tract infection, and she was treated with empiric antibiotics. Over the next 3 days, despite adherence to antibiotic therapy, her symptoms persisted. She then presented to her primary care physician who agreed with the outside ED findings. She was additionally treated for hemorrhoids and advised to continue her antibiotic course. The following day, she had a new onset of gross hematuria for which she was again evaluated at an outside ED. Ultimately, she was admitted to the outside facility for 11 days before being discharged with a urology follow-up. After another 5 days elapsed, she was seen by her gynecologist who expressed concern for hematoma vs. abscess vs. malignancy due to an ulcerated, ecchymotic mass near the urethra. The patient was then advised to be evaluated at a tertiary care facility.\nOn presentation to our facility, she was found to be tachycardic with HR of 116, normotensive, normothermic, and nontachypneic with oxygen saturations of 98%.

Postnatal echocardiography confirmed the cardiac diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot.

On routine surveillance with positron emission tomography, a metabolically active right upper lobe lung lesion was noted, and the patient underwent right upper lobe wedge resection with negative margins. Further, the patient began treatment with nivolumab 240 mg IV and no complications were noted after completion of three cycles. Prior to receiving the fourth cycle, he presented with a one day history of left-sided chest pain and palpitations. On initial presentation, his labs were notable for troponin-I of 0.31 ng/mL. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with new lateral ST segment depressions. His chest pain subsequently resolved with nitroglycerin and he was discharged home. He returned the next day for a coronary angiogram which showed patent grafts with no coronary stenoses elsewhere. Given the elevated troponin and a negative coronary angiogram, he was admitted for possible myocarditis. His troponins peaked at 1.55 ng/mL, while creatinine kinase-MB and myoglobin were normal. He then developed new-onset atrial fibrillation/atypical flutter with a rapid ventricular response. An echocardiogram demonstrated mild bi-ventricular dilatation with reduced right ventricular systolic function, bi-atrial dilatation, and an estimated LVEF of 55%.\nIV methylprednisolone 1 g daily for three days was started. Cardiac MRI confirmed the suspicion of myocarditis, with an elevated regional T2 ratio and early gadolinium enhancement ratio suggestive of myocardial edema. Also, there was significant abnormal late gadolinium enhancement involving both basal and mid septal (anterior and inferior septum) and inferolateral segments of the myocardium.

He was found to have a peripherally situated tumor 21 mm in size. He had no other relevant medical history and his serum creatinine was within normal limits (104 \u03bcmol/L). He was referred to my department for consideration of percutaneous renal RFA. This case was discussed at the local urology multidisciplinary meeting, where the consensus was to offer surgery such as radical or partial nephrectomy or percutaneous RFA. The treatment options and risks were discussed in detail with our patient, who agreed to proceed with percutaneous RFA as first-line treatment.\nThe procedure was performed under general anesthesia. A 16G co-access sheathed needle system (Boston Scientific, Boston, MA, USA) was inserted into the tumor under imaging guidance, using a combination of ultrasound and contrast-enhanced CT (100 mls Ultravist 300; Schering AG, Berlin, Germany). An 18G needle core biopsy of the tumor was obtained, immediately followed by the insertion of a Le Veen RFA array probe (Boston Scientific) with a diameter of 30 mm. Three overlapping treatments were performed, with a total ablation time of 20 minutes and 50 seconds. Our patient was given 80 mg gentamicin intravenously as prophylaxis. Histological examination of the tumor biopsy confirmed a grade 2 conventional renal cell carcinoma. Our patient was able to pass urine adequately after the procedure, and was discharged on the following day with stable renal function (creatinine 100 \u03bcmol/L). He was followed up with imaging at one, three, six and twelve months. Repeat imaging two years after the operation showed no evidence of residual of recurrent disease within the treated area (Figure ).

A colonoscopy revealed ascending colon cancer, and she was referred to our hospital. She had no previous history of abnormal bleeding. Her brother had pointed out any abnormalities in his blood coagulation test; however, we could not find the details because he had already died. Her family history except the brother was negative for bleeding tendencies, purpura, and hemophilia. She did not smoke or drink alcohol. She had no allergies. A total colonoscopy showed an ascending colon tumor with severe stenosis (Fig. ). Computed tomography revealed the wall thickness of the ascending colon (Fig. ). There were no distant metastases on the liver or lungs. Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT 93.9 s) was found incidentally during a routine preoperative examination. However, the prothrombin time (11.2 s), platelet count (480 \u00d7 103/L), and liver function test results were all within normal limits. We conducted a cross mixing test, and she was diagnosed with a deficiency pattern (Fig. ). The activities of factors VIII, IX, XII, and von Willebrand factor were normal. The plasma activity of FXI was 3%, and the diagnosis of FXI deficiency was confirmed. It took about 2 weeks from confirmation of an abnormal APTT time to diagnosis of FXI deficiency. A total of eight units of FFP were transfused for 2 days before the operation. After the transfusion, APTT improved to 37 s, and FXI also increased from 3% to 25% as a result (Fig. ).\nIt takes about 3 days to obtain the result of FXI plasma activity in our hospital.

He developed septic shock, so norepinephrine was applied for 5 days and peripheral ischemia of four extremities occurred. The patient underwent right knee disarticulation, left trans-femoral amputation and right elbow disarticulation on December 21th, 2010 (). He underwent skin flap operation of the right knee and left hand skin defect area on January 10th and 24th, 2011, and joint range of motion exercise and isometric exercise were performed. After the operation wound healing, he was admitted to the Severance Rehabilitation Hospital for prostheses measurement and rehabilitation on March 5th, 2011.\nConsidering the patient's young age, we set the final goals as gait, independency of ADL and going back to work. During the initial stage of the rehabilitation program, we focused on upper extremity function improvement and independency improvement on wheelchair level activity. After this short-term goal had been reached, gait training and car training were planned. Finally, before discharge, we planned to do computer training since he used computer a lot for his marketing business.\nBefore admittance to our hospital, the patient had a psychiatric consultation due to depression. There was no objective data for the depression score, but he showed clinically meaningful level of depression, so he took antidepressant medication. After symptoms improved, medication was stopped, and he no longer took the pills after being admitted to our hospital. Since his limb was amputated when he was on shock status, he finally recognized amputation after recovering from the shock. This made him feel negative body image of himself, and thus he went through anorexia and sociophobia.

She had developed a subarachnoid hemorrhage, followed by a spasm and then cerebral infarction in the left middle cerebral artery territory (Figures , , ). She had no history of hospitalization or surgeries besides this stroke episode. The patient was treated in the acute and convalescent wards, received rehabilitation training, and was discharged home five months after the onset. The rehabilitation included the exchange of the dominant hand during hospitalization, and the patient's right upper limb did not participate in daily activities at discharge. After that, she continued her rehabilitation program at home, but her right upper limb dysfunction did not improve. She continued to use the left upper limb for daily activities and rarely used the right upper limb. Two years after the onset of the disease, the patient visited our hospital with right upper limb dysfunction. Thus, we decided on the clinical application of shoulder HAL. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, with approval from the Ethics Committee of the Tsukuba University Faculty of Medicine (approval no.: TCRB18-38). The participant provided written informed consent for participation and publication, including the use of accompanying images.\nHAL intervention\nShoulder HAL\nShoulder HAL was developed using single-joint type HAL. It was originally developed for the knee and elbow joints, supporting uniaxial movements at a single joint, such as flexion and extension of the joint [].

The procedure was performed under general anesthesia, and transseptal access was performed with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and fluoroscopy guidance. His maximum LAA width measured by echocardiography was 21 mm with maximum depth, 27 mm, measured to the anterior lobe. A 27-mm Watchman device was selected and prepped in the usual fashion and delivered via a dual curve sheath. The activated clotting time during deployment was 213 seconds. As the device was being delivered through the sheath at the area of greatest curvature, the sheath whipped anteriorly before the device exited. Contrast injection during fluoroscopy revealed pericardial staining. Given a presumptive diagnosis of LAA perforation, the device was deployed with sheath remaining in the same distal position given the concern for losing LAA access. After deployment, angiography through the sheath confirmed LAA laceration, with TEE visualization of the device in the transverse sinus (). Given increasing hypotension, 2 pericardial drains were placed with acute evacuation of approximately 1 L of blood.
