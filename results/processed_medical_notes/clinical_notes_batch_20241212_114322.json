She underwent iliac artery embolization and exploratory laparotomy to repair the iliac artery and a liver laceration at another hospital, and was subsequently transferred to our emergency center for additional surgical intervention involving the pelvic bone, spine and anterior trans-olecranon fracture dislocation (). Fortunately, computed tomography (CT) confirmed that she had no brain injury and no systematic neurologic symptoms, although there was a chance fracture of the T10 vertebra. She was subjected twice to a closed reduction of the injured elbow joint, once at the first hospital, and then in our emergency room. According to the Mayo classification, the olecranon fracture was diagnosed as type IIIB. Sixteen days after the initial trauma, the anterior trans-olecranon fracture dislocation of the right elbow joint was treated by open reduction and internal fixation by applying a pre-contoured olecranon plate (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN, USA) using the posterior approach incised along the triceps, followed by application of a long arm splint ().\nAfter surgery, the elbow was immobilized in a long arm splint at 90 degrees of flexion and neutral rotation.

She denied any history of flank pain, dysuria, urgency, fever, or weight loss, or appetite. Clinical examination was normal, laboratory findings were within the normal range, urine analysis showed >40 red blood cells (RBCs) per high power field, and urine culture showed no bacterial growth. Bladder smooth muscle cell markers (smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin, and calponin) were positive. B-catenin and CD117 were negative. An abdominal and pelvic CT scan with contrast was done and showed a large submucosal urinary bladder mass. An abdominal/pelvic MRI was performed and revealed a large submucosal well-defined round mass with a slightly lobulated smooth margin originating from the submucosal layer of the left anterolateral wall of the urinary bladder.

In addition, in 2001, a right-sided localised ductal breast cancer in situ was identified and was treated surgically with a partial mastectomy. Secondary to her lymph node dissection, she developed lymphoedema of her left arm, which had been continuously treated with compression stockings. The patient was on treatment with an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker due to hypertension, and in addition, she had a known systolic murmur, characterized as physiological, as transthoracic echocardiographs in 2011 and 2017 were normal. Since her surgery in 1999, on a total of six occasions prior to her last and seventh visit, of which the first episode occurred in 2008, she had been treated for erysipelas in her left upper arm. The presentation had always been sudden with spiking fever and erythema spreading in approximately the same localisation. Interestingly, on all three out of the three occasions where a blood culture has been drawn on presentation with erysipelas, the cultures have shown growth of a bacterium belonging to the S. mitis group. These first two isolates also had similar MIC values for penicillin of 0.064 and 0.125 mg/L, for vancomycin of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/L, and for gentamicin of 2 and 2 mg/L ().

She had her retinal detachment repaired, but the macular hole persisted despite long term tamponade with silicone oil. A year after the initial one, she had a second surgery using short term gas tamponade with sulfur hexafluoride gas (SF6), but the hole failed to close. A third attempt to close the macular hole was carried out a year after, with carbon hexafluoride gas (C3F8). Despite her strict obedience to face down positioning, the hole failed to close.\nAfter three operations that failed, the patient did not prefer to have further interventions and remained on regular follow-up visits for about 4 years. During this time period no significant anatomical and functional change occurred in her left eye.\nIn her last visit, she had a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of counting fingers (CF) in her left vitrectomized eye which had a chronic large macular hole with a base daimeter of 1697 micrometers. Upon proposal, she has accepted a fourth surgery with autologous PRF application.\nThe surgical technique included four ports pars plana approach for the application of a round button of PRF to the macular hole, followed by fluid-air and air-SF6 gas exchange. The patient was ordered to have face down positioning for three days following the operation.\nThe PRF button was cut with scissors from a PRF membrane which was prepared with Choukrun's procedure described elsewhere [, ].

At birth, the patient was immediately intubated due to forced breathing and hypoxemia. Her craniofacial anomalies including exophthalmos, prominent forehead, blue sclera, and micrognathia indicated the possibility of one or more complications of a genetic disease. Radiographic examinations demonstrated advanced skeletal maturation, and she was diagnosed MSS at 2 months old. She underwent tracheostomy for tracheomalacia at 3 months old, followed by gastrostomy at the age of 2 years, but not required ventilator support. Gastrostomy was performed under inhalation anesthesia via tracheostomy tube under spontaneous breathing in combination with regional anesthesia.\nOne month before the patient\u2019s admission to our hospital, intermittent tracheal bleeding was observed and managed by a change in the smaller cannula size and shorter length. Two weeks later, the patient needed hospitalization at a primary medical clinic because of acute tonsillitis and pneumonia-induced hypoxemia. Intermittent tracheal bleeding reappeared, and granulation at the distal site of the cannula without bleeding was detected by bronchoscopy. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed extremely thin connective tissue between the innominate artery and the trachea, suggesting TIF and she was transferred to our hospital (Fig. ).\nAfter admission, the patient\u2019s vital signs were stable; blood pressure 96/57 mmHg, heart rate 143 bpm, and SpO2 97% (room air attached with heat and moisture exchangers).

She was also taking folate 0.5 mg PO daily as she was attempting to conceive. Her TPMT (thiopurine methyltransferase) activity before therapy was normal at 8.5U/mL (7.0 \u2013 14.5). In evaluating her steroid dependency her 6TGN was found to be 134 with 6MMP 5560, giving a 6MMP:6TGN ratio of 41, consistent with shunting. It was judged that an increased azathioprine dose would have lead to a large 6MMP rise (with such a ratio) and probable toxicity, so co-therapy was decided on. The azathioprine dose was reduced to 25 mg PO daily and allopurinol 100 mg PO daily was dosed concomitantly. She declined treatment with a biological agent or entry into a clinical drug trial as she was attempting to conceive.\nShe conceived 15 months later on the allopurinol & azathioprine co-therapy. The prednisolone dose was reduced to 7.5 mg PO daily; the lowest dose she had been on. To avoid a flare during pregnancy the decision was to maintain her at low dose prednisolone. At the time, her 6TGN was 254 and 6MMP was < 500 (6MMP:6TGN ratio ~2). Allopurinol, azathioprine and prednisolone were continued for the duration of the pregnancy and her ulcerative colitis was well controlled.\nA healthy baby boy was delivered by caesarean section at term due to breech position.

Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a 2 cm linear vegetation on the prosthetic aortic valve and a possible ring abscess without evidence of aortic insufficiency. Therapy with intravenous ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and levofloxacin was initiated.\nOn the third day of hospitalization, our patient experienced an acute onset of left upper quadrant abdominal pain. No history of recent trauma could be elicited. Our patient's vital signs were as follows: temperature 40\u00b0C, blood pressure 85/48 mmHg, heart rate 104 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99% breathing room air. On physical examination our patient was found to be in mild distress and diaphoretic with dry mucous membranes. The skin of the upper and lower extremities was indurated at sites of frequent subcutaneous injections, but without erythema, exudate or abscess. No petechiae of the skin or nail beds were identified. A cardiac examination revealed a III/VI crescendo/de-crescendo systolic ejection murmur radiating to the apex and to the carotid arteries. An abdominal examination revealed a distended abdomen and tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed an enlarged and fractured spleen with surrounding hematoma, but no evidence of liver laceration, infarct or intra-abdominal abscess (Figure ).\nOur patient underwent an emergency splenectomy.

He was commenced on World Health Organization (WHO) multi-drug therapy (MDT) regimen for multi-bacilary (MB) leprosy, which was complicated by type II lepra reaction (ENL) with right sided panuveitis and treated with oral prednisolone 30 mg/day with gradual tapering to 10 mg/day. He continued to develop recurrent episodes of ENL reactions since the completion of MDT-MB which was managed only with prednisolone. 3 months before the current admission he was started on a second course of MDT-MB treatment for new skin nodules with a positive slit skin smear for mycobacterium leprae. 3 weeks before he was commenced on thalidomide 100 mg twice daily in addition to oral prednisolone of 15mg per day for refractory ENL. He did not have recent major surgery, prolonged immobilization or recent diagnosis of any malignancy. There was no history suggestive of past venous or arterial thrombosis and tendency to develop thrombosis in his family.\nOn examination he was dyspnoeic at rest without central cyanosis. He had leonine facies and generalized erythematous skin with multiple nodules. His right leg was swollen with pitting ankle oedema (figure ) while having normal arterial pulses.

A routine blood test showed severe anaemia (Hb 6.6 gr/dl) and physical examination showed no abnormalities but traces of melaena. She had a previous history of nicotinism and ischaemic heart disease with hyperkinetic arrhythmia. She was hospitalized on a medical ward to receive blood transfusions and to undergo more diagnostic examinations. A cardiology consultation showed no abnormalities, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed. A bleeding endoluminal gastric mass was found arising from the antrum, extending to the angulus and involving both the anterior and posterior gastric wall. An adrenalin injection (1:10000) was executed on the site of the bleeding to control the haemorrhage and biopsies were collected. A surgical consultation was requested and the patient was transferred to the division of general and emergency surgery. The pathological report from the biopsies revealed a moderately differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma (G2). A computed tomography (CT) scan was also performed and confirmed the presence of a gastric mass with perigastric adenopathies (Figure ). No evidence of metastastic activity was found. After an anaesthesiological consultation and subsequent fluid therapy to achieve a good balance, surgical intervention was scheduled. Given her age, the extent of the tumour and general clinical conditions, we decided to perform a gastric resection with D1 lymphadenectomy, and reconstruction using a Billroth II Hofmeister-Finsterer retrocolic loop with mechanical sutures. We inserted a nasogastric tube to obtain gastric decompression and a surgical drain next to the anastomosis. The pathological report disclosed a mixed type adenocarcinoma of the stomach, with signet ring cells, cellular elements typical of the Lauren's intestinal type and undifferentiated cells (pT3 N0 Mx G3 R0) with surgical rim with no evidence of pathological findings.

A duodenal tumor was identified on gastrointestinal endoscopy (Fig. ), and a biopsy revealed a NET. The serum levels of insulin, gastrin, and glucagon were within normal ranges. CT did not initially reveal evidence of pancreatic invasion between the tumor and the pancreas; however, irregularities of the duodenal wall and swelling of the lymph nodes around the pancreatic parenchyma were observed. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with non-functional duodenal NET with multiple liver metastases, T2N1M1 stage IV (UICC 8th). In addition, CT revealed the anatomical variation of the CHA, which branched from the SMA and ran fully through the head of the pancreatic parenchyma (Fig. , Additional file Figure S1). The CHA branches into the left hepatic artery (LHA), the middle hepatic artery (MHA), and the right hepatic artery (RHA) (Fig. a, b).

The patient was a full-term baby with a birth weight of 3 kg, born by normal vaginal delivery. He was hospitalized at 1.5 months and 2 months of age with respiratory tract infections. During the second admission, he had two episodes of apnea for which he required ventilatory support. Chest X-ray showed bilateral hyperinflation with patchy consolidation. It did not show any evidence of common causes of stridor, like lobar emphysema, bronchogenic cyst or mediastinal mass. Because most common causes for stridor in the neonatal period include laryngeal and tracheal diseases, e.g. laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia, laryngeal and tracheal cysts, webs, stenosis and mucus plugs fibreoptic laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were carried out. Bronchoscopy revealed external pulsatile compression on trachea. Hence, suspecting vascular ring, imaging was performed using 64-slice MDCT to confirm the diagnosis and determine further details. MDCT with three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction showed double aortic arch forming a vascular ring, encircling and compressing the trachea and esophagus [Figure and ]. The right aortic arch was the dominant arch with right subclavian and right common carotid arteries arising from the right arch and left common carotid and left subclavian arteries arising from the left arch. Echocardiography did not show any evidence of double aortic arch because of suboptimum suprasternal acoustic window. However, it helped to rule out any associated intracardiac anomaly.\nThe infant underwent an emergency surgery through left posterolateral thoracotomy. Before the anomalous arch was removed, pulling endotracheal tube proximally from the site of constriction led to increase in airway pressure, which suggested that the anomalous arch led to constriction of trachea and the resultant symptoms. During surgery, the left aortic arch after the origin of the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries was removed and both ends were oversewn.",

    "original_text": "A 48-year-old woman, 2-year postmenopausal presented at the Fortis Hospital, Bengaluru, India in February 2016 with a complaint of severe dysuria of 1-year duration with neither hematuria nor lower urinary tract symptoms. There was neither abdominal pain nor any symptom referable to other systems. She had four children through spontaneous vaginal delivery; two of them were after the IUCD insertion. The third and fourth deliveries occurred at 3 and 6 years respectively after she had IUCD insertion. Her last delivery was 18 years before presentation. Since the onset of symptom, she had been treated severally for urinary tract infection following repeated microscopy culture and sensitivity testing of her urine at the referring hospital, which grew Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. There were no comorbidities or significant social history. General and systemic/regional examination findings were essentially normal. Baseline complete blood count, urea, and creatinine were within normal limits. Abdominopelvic computerized axial tomographic scan showed an IUCD at the dome of the urinary bladder with a portion of it in the perivesical space adjacent to the sigmoid colon and the remaining portion being intravesical forming about 1.4 cm dense area of nodular calcification [Figures and ].

Two years after the diagnosis, the patient had been diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma and melanoma of the ear. Eight months prior to his presentation at our institution, the patient was seen by his local physician for persistent back pain. A thoracic spine-computed tomography (CT) showed a pathologic fracture of T-4 vertebra that was associated with a soft tissue mass as well as a hilar mass. An abdominal CT revealed a mesenteric mass and biopsy showed large cell lymphoma. The patient received palliative radiotherapy to the spine and chemotherapy. A restaging positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan revealed a persistent hypermetabolic hilar mass.\nThe patient then sought consultation at our institution. A CT scan showed a 5-cm mass involving the right main pulmonary artery. A PET-CT scan showed a hypermetabolic mass involving the right perihilar space []. The patient was referred for an endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) with ROSE. The findings were in keeping with a PAS. Subsequently, the patient underwent preoperative chemotherapy followed by resection of the right pulmonary artery tumor with reconstruction, followed by a right thoracotomy.

    "original_text": "A 40-year old male was diagnosed with a silent ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma in 1997 when an MRI of his sinuses demonstrated a 3 cm enhancing area of soft tissue within the inferior aspect of the sella consistent with a pituitary adenoma with no evidence of expansion. MR spectroscopy showed metabolically inert tissue. Since he was asymptomatic, he underwent active surveillance with annual MRI scans. His ACTH levels ranged between 100 and 120 pg/mL, but there was no clinical evidence of Cushing's syndrome and urine free cortisol was normal. Lab values were normal for prolactin, testosterone, LH, FSH, free T4, TSH, and alpha subunit. There was no family history of pituitary adenomas or other endocrine disorders.\nIn 2004, seven years after initial discovery, his cortisol levels started to increase and he developed clinical features consistent with Cushing's syndrome including weight gain, facial rounding, hypertension, and edema. His ACTH levels increased to >300 pg/mL, which was accompanied by an increase in his late night salivary cortisol (). An MRI showed a 2.5 \u00d7 3.3 cm enhancing mass arising in the pituitary fossa. The mass displaced the optic chiasm, invaded the sphenoid sinus, and exerted mass effect on the cavernous sinus bilaterally (). He underwent transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) debulking of this invasive tumor. Pathology showed pituitary adenoma of corticotroph-type staining positive for ACTH and negative for TSH, prolactin, LH, GH, and FSH. Postoperative MRI showed substantial debulking with a near-complete tumor removal (). This initially resulted in reduction of plasma ACTH to 105 pg/mL and improvement in symptoms. However, over the next year his cortisol levels continued to increase and symptoms worsened. He received adjuvant radiation therapy using a 5-field noncoplanar arrangement.

Her body mass index (BMI) was 19.4 (height 157 cm, weight 48 kg). Although she had a history of asthma, she had been incident-free for more than 2 years. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer 3 years previously and was treated by partial resection of the left mammary gland. The excised mass had a positive margin and was identified as ductal carcinoma in situ based on histopathological findings: Estrogen receptor (ER) (+), Progesterone receptor (PR) (+), HER2 (1+), and Ki67 (10%). These findings prompted the doctors to perform a left total mastectomy, which yielded an excised mass with a negative margin. The patient tested negative for lymph-node metastasis.

The episode was precipitated by patient's worries of passing semen in urine, which he believed would lead to gradual decline in masculinity, something he had learnt from his peers. Further, he was told by his peers that because of the fact that he has been masturbating regularly he is going to lose his masculinity at an early age. He consulted faith healers and Ayurvedic practitioners who further strengthened his belief that masturbation at the early age was responsible for current passage of semen in urine and his weakness was due to the same.

While the cough resolved with proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, suggesting a gastrointestinal nature of the symptom, the patient also underwent a routine chest radiograph. The imaging showed a nodule with a diameter of 3.5 cm in the right lower lobe. Thus, a chest CT scan was performed, which confirmed the presence of a solid lesion with well-defined margins, mild contrast enhancement, and a diameter of 34 \u00d7 26 mm in the anterior basal segment of the inferior right pulmonary lobe. The exam also revealed an enlarged axillary lymph node that was later confirmed to be inflammatory in nature. To further characterize the lesion, a PET-CT scan with an injection of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was done; the images showed mild uptake at the level of the nodule in the right lower lobe (with a maximum SUV of 2.8) (, ), suggesting a possibly benign or locally invasive biological behavior. Fine-needle biopsy for typing of the lesion was attempted but ultimately not performed due to poor compliance of the patient during the CT-guided procedure. Therefore, wedge resection of the right inferior lobe and nodal sampling were performed with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. A frozen section procedure was performed during the operation, which gave unconclusive results.

He was apparently alright 5 months back, after which he started getting up at night and would walk out of the door. He would wander aimlessly for few minutes to hours and return subsequently. Parents reported that during his sleepwalk, he would remain unexpressive and uncommunicative and used to become irritable and confused if he was forcibly awakened. The patient had complete amnesia of the event on arousal.\nEvents were episodic initially and used to occur once or twice in a month. However, from the past 3 months, these episodes are occurring almost every alternate night. The last episode was also associated with nocturnal enuresis. There was no history of any precipitating stressor (parental divorce, interpersonal, sibling issues, no bullying, no change in school environment, no history of sexual assault, or any other major psychological trauma).\nThere was a past history of tuberculosis of bone at the age of 1 year for which he was treated. There was no history of seizures, head trauma, or psychiatric illness in the past.\nFamily history was unremarkable. His birth and developmental history was uneventful. There was delayed walking due to weakness in the limb caused by tuberculosis. Secondary sexual characters were not yet developed. His scholastic performance was average.\nPhysical examination showed a body mass index of 18. The patient had low set ears, hypertelorism, broad and small nose, webbing of the neck was present, the left shoulder was higher set than the right shoulder, low set and widely spaced nipples, and dark patches were present on the forearm.

    "original_text": "A 61-year-old never-smoking Caucasian woman presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and right-sided thoracic pain in May 2010. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax showed a 3.5-cm pulmonary lesion of the middle lobe and pleural carcinomatosis. A CT-guided percutaneous biopsy was performed, which revealed stage IV lung adenocarcinoma. An EGFR exon 19 deletion was detected in the biopsy specimen by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification and bidirectional sequencing of exons 18\u201321.\nThe patient was treated with gefitinib 250 mg daily, with the achievement of a partial response (PR) that was maintained for approximately 4 years. The treatment was well tolerated, and no clinically relevant side effects were reported. In August 2014, a thorax CT scan demonstrated progressive disease, with an increase in the size of the lung lesion, and pemetrexed was added to gefitinib, with disease stability maintained for 6 months. In May 2015, the patient received palliative radiotherapy of the thorax for symptomatic infiltration of the chest wall. She experienced progressive disease with new contralateral nodules in December 2015. A re-biopsy was performed, which revealed the resistance mutation EGFR T790M by PCR amplification and bidirectional sequencing of exon 20. Treatment with osimertinib 80 mg was started within a clinical study. Two months later, a chest CT scan showed PR with a reduction in size of the bilateral lung nodules and stability of the lesion in the middle lobe, which was maintained for approximately 2 years.\nHowever, a chest CT scan performed in August 2018 showed an increase in the size of the middle-lobe lesion and a new re-biopsy was performed. The result of next-generation sequencing confirmed the presence of EGFR exon 19 deletion and T790M mutation and indicated a low-level amplification of MET. Confirmatory chromogenic in situ hybridization showed a clear increase in the MET signal with a clustered pattern (Fig. ) and a 6.9 MET/CEP7 (cent",
