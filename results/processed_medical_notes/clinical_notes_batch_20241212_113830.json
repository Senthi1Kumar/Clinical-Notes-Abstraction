She denied issues with prematurity or issues with development as an infant, chest trauma, or MVA history. She did complain of occasional right shoulder pain but attributed this to arthritis. Denied history of heart attack, stroke, DVT, or PE. She had a 30-pack-year smoking history but quit a year prior. She was up-to-date on her colonoscopy, current within the past year.

The pain was continuous and throbbing. His medical history was noncontributory. His dental history revealed trauma to lower anterior teeth due to accident five years ago. On clinical examination, both mandibular central incisors were discolored. Soft tissue examination revealed labial swelling over these teeth; a sinus opening was seen on the labial aspect of mandibular right central incisor. The area was tender on palpation and the teeth were tender on percussion (). On vitality examination, teeth were nonvital. Radiographic examination revealed a large dumbbell shaped periapical radiolucency associated with 31, 41 (). As dumbbell shaped periapical lesion is a rare occurrence, a computed tomography (CT) scan was advised for 31, 41 to know the exact extension and for the accurate diagnosis of the periapical lesion (). The periapical lesion associated with 31, 41, having regular borders, was seen along the apical and lateral root surfaces of mandibular central incisors. The periapical lesion resembles a dumbbell shape and was approximately 2.5 \u00d7 1 cm in its greatest dimensions. Based on the above clinical and radiographic findings, mandibular central incisors were diagnosed as having chronic apical periodontitis with cystic changes. A combined approach of orthograde endodontic treatment for 31, 41 followed by periapical surgery was planned. The patient was informed about the procedure and consent was taken.\nLocal anaesthesia was administered, under rubber dam isolation, and access cavity was done using a number 2 high speed round diamond bur.

The abdominal pain started in the periumbilical region and was shifted to the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. The pain started gradually and had been progressing in severity. He described the pain as a stabbing in nature. It was exacerbated by movement and food intake. The pain was partially relieved by oral analgesic medications like paracetamol. The pain was associated with low-grade fever and decreased appetite. The patient also complained of diarrhea with five bowel motions/day. The stools were watery with no mucus or blood. He reported that diarrhea developed after he received an oral antibiotic therapy (cefuroxime) for a recent upper respiratory tract infection.\nThe past medical history of the patient was remarkable for diabetes mellitus that was well-controlled with oral antidiabetic agents. He did not undergo any previous abdominal surgeries. He had a smoking history of 15 pack-years. He had never drunk alcohol before. He worked as a taxi driver. The family history was unremarkable for any inherited gastrointestinal disorders.\nUpon examination, the patient appeared sick. He was not pale, jaundiced, or cyanosed. Vital signs revealed tachycardia (115 bpm), low-grade fever (37.5\u2103), normal respiratory rate (14 bpm), and maintained blood pressure (122/80 mmHg). The oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed a soft abdomen with diffuse tenderness. However, the tenderness was more pronounced in the right iliac fossa with a positive rebound sign. Further, the Rovsing sign was positive. Initial laboratory investigation revealed elevated leukocyte count and elevated inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein.

Blood reports such as total leukocyte count with differentials as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin were normal. Computed tomography (CT) chest done was suggestive of bilateral lower lobe pneumonia (left > right). His cardiac evaluation including doppler echocardiography was normal. He was started on treatment with antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators, and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The patient showed clinical and radiological improvement. However, he had unexplained hypercapnia, which led to further evaluation. His serial arterial blood gas initially showed acute on chronic Type-2 respiratory failure which later compensated []. On further workup for Type-2 respiratory failure, pulmonary function testing was suggestive of severe restriction with reduced diffusion capacity of lung. Sleep Study done which was normal. Thyroid profile and serum electrolytes were also normal. There was no history of thoracic neck surgery or trauma. Electromyography phrenic nerve could not be done. Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) showed mild involvement of median nerve only. At this point, a more detailed history was taken and clinical examination was carried out. We found the paradoxical diaphragmatic movement with respiration []. Neurological examination and investigations ruled out any neuromuscular disorder including myasthenia gravis.

She underwent a partial mastectomy of her right upper inner breast and a sentinel lymph node biopsy 7 years previously. The tumor was a 0.9\u00d70.8 cm tubular carcinoma with a low nuclear grade, and lymph node metastasis was absent. The resection margins were all negative, with a minimum distance of 0.6 cm. Immunohistochemistry was positive for the estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR). One month later, she received adjuvant RT for 6 weeks. The dose delivered to the whole breast was 50 Gy in 25 fractions using tangential fields of 4 MV photons (), and the boost dose to the primary tumor bed was 10 Gy in five fractions using a 9 MeV electron beam. Adjuvant RT was well-tolerated, and no specific complications were observed during RT. After completion of RT, she took toremifene for 5 years.\nShe has undergone outpatient follow-up for a right ovarian cyst at the Department of Gynecology for the past 5 years. An abdomino-pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan was performed 1 month ago to evaluate the characteristics of the right ovarian tumor. A rapidly growing tumor from the anterior arc of the right fifth rib was incidentally detected on a CT scan (). The tumor was not seen on a CT scan performed 4 months previously. The tumor was hypermetabolic () on positron emission tomography (PET), and a whole body bone scan demonstrated increased radio-uptake ().

The patient presented with symptoms of airway obstruction, such as an inspiratory stridor and retracted breathing. A hormonal test revealed subclinical hypothyroidism with a free thyroxine level (1.44 ng/dL) within the reference range, although the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level (34.6 \u03bcIU/mL) was increased beyond the normal range. Laryngo fiberscopy revealed a lingual mass compressing the epiglottis (Fig. ). Enhanced computed tomography (CT) and thyroid scintigraphy revealed that the mass was an ectopic thyroid with the absence of a normal pretracheal thyroid gland (Figs , ). The patient received oral levothyroxine at a dose of 12 \u03bcg/kg/day for 4 weeks to lower the TSH level and reduce the volume of the ectopic thyroid tissue. However, we observed no reduction in the volume of the thyroid tissue and a concomitant progression in his symptoms of airway obstruction. He underwent surgery to relieve the airway obstruction when he was 2 months old. Under general anesthesia, nasotracheal intubation was performed in a sniffing position, and a transverse skin incision measuring 2.5 cm was made at the level of the hyoid bone. We split the hyoid bone at the midline, dissected the base of the tongue towards the foramen cecum, detected the ectopic thyroid mass, and suspended the mass by suturing it to the hyoid bone (Fig. ). We used 5\u20130 monofilament absorbable sutures and sutured between the lingual thyroid and the hyoid bone. The bite length of both the lingual thyroid and hyoid bone was about 3 mm.

After a month, she was referred to our institution with suspicion of metaplastic breast carcinoma with a core needle biopsy at the breast clinic. Physical examination revealed a hard, tender, and 25-mm mass in the upper outer quadrant of her right breast and a palpable lymph node in her right axilla. Mammography indicated an indistinct mass on the mediolateral oblique view and the craniocaudal view. Ultrasound (US) showed an 18 \u00d7 16-mm, irregular-shaped, and hypoechoic mass with a suspicion of a spread to the nipple inside the duct (Fig. a) and several swollen lymph nodes in levels I to II (Fig. b). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected enhancement of a 17 \u00d7 17-mm indistinct mass surrounded with a non-mass enhanced segmental lesion toward the nipple side spreading a maximum of 74-mm range, which had no interaction with the chest bone, muscles, and breast skin, in the right breast tissue (Fig. ). Invasive carcinoma with multiple axillary lymph node metastases was strongly suspected on clinical examination and imaging.

Treatment with 500 mg of azithromycin daily was introduced by a general practitioner (GP), but no symptom relief was observed. Additionally, after a few days, the patient reported a non-productive cough and the fever increased up to over 39 \u00b0C. The treatment was changed to 2.0 g of amoxicillin daily. A day later the patient noticed a significant malaise, loss of smell and retrosternal discomfort. He was admitted to the emergency unit where an active SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by a PCR test. Cardiac tests did not reveal any abnormalities. At discharge from the emergency unit, azithromycin, 250 mg/day was recommended. There was no improvement from the treatment, and the dose of azithromycin was increased to 500 mg/day by the GP. Instead of symptom relief, the patient reported worsening of fever, cough, headache, insomnia and neck pain, with palpable hard neck tumor. Blood laboratory tests were not performed at that time, but due to the lack of efficacy of the previous therapies and the diagnosis of COVID-19, a treatment with dexamethasone 4.0 mg daily was introduced, with further gradual reduction of the dose. In the following days, the patient\u2019s general condition improved significantly. About 4 days after the end of the steroid therapy, the symptoms reappeared, with a palpable hard tumor on the right side of the neck, insomnia and headaches, tachycardia up to 120 beats per minute and an increased blood pressure even to 170/115 mm Hg.

She reported fevers, generalized malaise, and weight loss. She had similar gastrointestinal complaints in the past without any visual loss, weight loss, claudication, or joint pains. Her history was significant for appendicitis in 2003 and a perineal abscess/fistula repair in 2000. She denied smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use.\nPhysical examination revealed blood pressure of 126/73 mmHg in the right arm and 114/74 mmHg in the left arm. Her right radial pulse was not palpable and the left one was thready at 70 beats per minute. The femoral and dorsalis pedis pulses were difficult to appreciate bilaterally. An abdominal bruit was noted, as well as tenderness of the right lower quadrant. Musculoskeletal exam was normal except complaint of pain in both arms when raised above her head for more than 6 seconds. The shoulder exam was normal on both sides. Laboratory evaluation () was significant for anemia of chronic disease and elevated inflammatory markers. She underwent colonoscopy and the right colon biopsy showed benign colonic mucosa with cryptitis, ulceration, and mild-moderate architectural change, consistent with Crohn's disease. Due to her symptoms of shoulder/arm pain, unequal blood pressure, and pulses in both arms and an abdominal bruit, further imaging studies were pursued. A magnetic resonance angiogram of the chest and abdomen was done and showed severe irregularity and narrowing of the descending thoracic aorta which tapers down from 2 cm transversely at the level of the distal arch to 7.5 mm transversely at the narrowest point just beyond the aortic hiatus.

    "original_text": "A 28-week-old premature boy, with a birthweight of 1280 grams, was intubated with a 2.5 mm endotracheal tube via the nose and ventilated for severe hyaline membrane disease (HMD). After receiving two doses of surfactant, the premature neonate was successfully weaned off ventilation and extubated to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). On day 9, his clinical course was complicated by a pulmonary hemorrhage, requiring re-intubation. He was given another dose of surfactant and stabilized on high-frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV). The chest radiograph showed extensive bilateral pulmonary interstitial emphysema, with the left side more extensively involved in comparison to the right. A hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus was treated by intravenous paracetamol. The baby's condition did not improve, and he was selectively intubated into his right main bronchus. The position of the endotracheal tube was radiologically confirmed, allowing the right lung to be oscillated while the left lung was rested. The baby was nursed on his left side for a period of 36 hours, after which the endotracheal tube was retracted into the trachea and secured in that position. The baby's ventilatory status subsequently improved, allowing for extubation on day 7 after the relapse. On day 28 of life, he presented with severe stridor, requiring re-intubation. Difficulty during intubation suggested that subglottic stenosis might be present. One week after this re-intubation a flexible bronchoscopy was performed, which revealed two major findings. The first was a Cotton grade 2 subglottic stenosis, and the other abnormality was near-complete obstruction of the bronchus intermedius.

She had undergone extensive workup at that time with X-ray of the knee, which was only significant for osteochondritis dissecans of the lateral femoral condyle, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, leg, knee and ankle. The MRI revealed no significant findings, including no visible abnormality of the peroneal nerve but did show mild tenosynovitis of the flexor hallucis longus and flexor digitorum longus. It was believed that she suffered from CECS, and she was treated conservatively with foot orthotics and physical therapy.\nSeveral years later, she experienced foot drop twice in 6 months which brought her back to the orthopedic office for reevaluation. Physical examination at that time was significant for 3/5 strength with dorsiflexion and 4+/5 strength in her extensor hallucis longus (EHL). In addition, she exhibited hyperesthesia in her deep peroneal nerve distribution and tenderness to palpation throughout her anterior leg musculature. A right lower extremity MRI was performed, which showed no evidence of neuropathy or compressive lesion. She re-presented 2 days later with complaints of severe pain, persistent foot drop and a cool leg in the absence of a clear etiology.\nAt that time, she was sent to the emergency room for evaluation of acute compartment syndrome. In the emergency department, compartment pressures were measured with a Hand-Held Stryker compartment monitor (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan). Compartment pressures were 51 mm Hg in the anterior compartment and 45 mm Hg in the lateral compartment.

A swab culture of the fistula was positive for Bacteroides fragilis and Corynebacterium striatum, so the patient underwent therapy with metronidazole (500 mg by mouth every 6 h). After 30 days, the fistula had increased in size, and fibrotic tissue, perilesional erythema, and malodor were present.

His medical history included hypertension and diabetes and there was no history of drinking or smoking. However, the patient reported being exposed daily to the sun without UV protection. The examination showed a 3-cm ulcerated and crusted area on the lower lip ( and ). There were no clinical changes in the intraoral examination. The clinical findings and the patient\u2019s occupation led to the diagnosis of lip squamous cell carcinoma or actinic cheilitis.\nAn incisional biopsy could not be performed at the first appointment due to the patient\u2019s high blood pressure (200/120 mmHg). The topical use of 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide cream was prescribed until the next appointment. After seven days, the patient returned to the clinic with significant clinical improvement. The incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia and the tissue specimen was sent to histopathological analysis. The tissue sections showed parakeratotic stratum corneum with ulcerated areas, showing in the lamina propria a dense sheet-like infiltrate predominantly of mature plasma cells, some lymphocytes, few eosinophils, and sparse Russell bodies (). The plasma cells infiltrated the entire connective tissue up to the minor salivary glands. It is worth noting the absence of cellular atypia, pleomorphic figures, and mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry to kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains showed polyclonal plasma cells, with a predominance of lambda ( and ).\nConsidering the clinical and histopathological findings and a negative serological test for syphilis, PCC was diagnosed.

Her complaints had started approximately three years ago. Implant loosening and malposition were detected in the right hip prosthesis; therefore, revision surgery was indicated (Figure ).\nThe patient underwent hip arthroplasty revision surgery with a posterior approach (Figure ).\nAcetabular cup no. 48, CoCr femoral head no. 32 (+4 mm) and lateralized offset neck (+4 mm) (Lima Corporate, Italy) were used. The femoral head was impacted on the neck with an appropriate force and the hip was reduced.\nWeight-bearing was allowed at the end of sixth week. At third-month follow-up, the patient was able to mobilize pain-free. However, a few days after her third-month follow-up, she was admitted to the outpatient clinic with complaints of severe pain and limitation of motion in the right hip without any history of obvious trauma. The patient reported that the pain and limitation emerged following a sound she heard while getting up from her seat. Disassociation of femoral head and neck components and accompanying hip dislocation was detected in the right hip (Figure ).\nThe femoral head was in the acetabular cup.

Four months prior to establishing care in our clinic, he had presented with epigastric pain to the emergency department. During that emergency department visit, he underwent a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast, which was notable for peri-pancreatic stranding and multiple small fluid collections around the entire pancreas, the largest of which was along the superior aspect of the pancreatic tail measuring 4.7 x 3.4 cm (Figure ).\nEvaluation done at an other center showed a hemoglobin level of 5.9 and was admitted to the emergency department for workup.

At time of admission, she had intermittent high grade fever and sore throat for 1 week duration. Additionally, a non-itchy skin eruption was noticed for 2 weeks duration. As well as she started to have yellowish eye discoloration 5 days after the onset of fever. The patient was taking phenytoin 200 mg QD PO as a seizure prophylaxis since she had significant head trauma 4 weeks prior to her presentation.\nShe denied any history of red eye, digital swelling, seizures, photophobia or any weight changes. Family history was unremarkable. She was sexually inactive and started to have irregular menstruation 1 year before the time of admission. In addition to phenytoin, her only medication at the time of admission was acetaminophen 500 mg twice daily.\nOn physical examination, she was alert, oriented and conscious. Her hemodynamics were stable. Temperature 39.9 C and her tonsils were erythematous. Generally, she looked deeply jaundiced as well as fatigued. Systemic examination was normal except maculopapular rash on her limbs, abdomen, chest and back (Figs. , ) besides peeling on both palms (Figs. , ).

Manifestations of his disease included arthritis, a rash on sun-exposed skin, and skin lesions resembling urticaria. Laboratory findings are shown in Table . A skin biopsy revealed urticarial vasculitis. There was no evidence of cerebral or renal involevement. His therapy for SLE required long-term plaquenil and prednisone. In September 1997 the patient was admitted with progressive exertional dyspnoea, cardiac decompensation, and a blowing systolic murmur at the apex radiating to the left axilla. Transthoracic (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed severe MR with thickened mitral valve leaflets and a small vegetation on the posterior mitral valve leaflet. Repeated blood cultures were negative and there was no other evidence of infective endocarditis. The patient was recompensated with diuretics and discharged. Echocardiographic follow-up over the following months revealed a rapid increase in left ventricular diameters and normal left ventricular (LV) function. Results of cardiac catherization are shown in Table . The patient underwent mitral valve repair in March 1998. Intraoperative inspection showed slightly thickened, but otherwise surprisingly normal leaflets. A small perforation was found in the P2 section of the posterior leaflet. Preoperatively a small vegetation was found near this location. Although rare and more often seen in infectious endocarditis, leaflet perforation in LS endocarditis has been reported before []. This patient's history did not reveal any documented thromboembolic events. A quadrangular resection of the P2 section of the posterior mitral valve leaflet was performed, followed by implantation of a 32 mm Carpentier-Edwards Classic annuloplasty ring. Microscopic examination of the excised mitral valve segment revealed myxoid degeneration and no evident signs of inflammation.
