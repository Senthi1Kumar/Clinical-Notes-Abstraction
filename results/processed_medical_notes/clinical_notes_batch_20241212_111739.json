The patient denied any unintentional weight loss, lightheadedness, palpitation, shortness of breath, urinary symptoms, or difficult defecation. The pelvic exam demonstrated normal external genitalia with a large lower uterine-cervix mass. The physical examination was remarkable for an enlarged firm right supraclavicular lymph node. The right elbow appeared swollen with a severely compromised range of motion due to pain. The patient underwent an exam under anesthesia with a biopsy of the uterine mass.\nUltrasound of the pelvis () showed heterogeneous echotexture of the uterus with possible masses, a thickened endometrial stripe, and a vascular soft tissue lesion within the posterior wall of the urinary bladder. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis () demonstrated a large heterogeneous mass centered within the uterus and cervix which involved more than 50% of the myometrium. There was local invasion to the urinary bladder, bilateral pelvic and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and suspicious findings for a rectovaginal fistula. A right supraclavicular lymph node was found, and the patient underwent ultrasound-guided biopsy of the lymph node. A right elbow radiograph showed findings concerning an aggressive lytic lesion within the proximal ulna (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right elbow () confirmed an enhancing mass centered within the proximal ulna with soft tissue invasion.\nThe pathology report from the cervical biopsy () revealed infiltrating malignant high-grade carcinoma with areas of undifferentiated sarcomatous morphology, which was positive for vimentin. The mutation pattern studied by molecular pathology study suggested an endometrioid differentiation with ARID1A mutation and lack of p53 mutation. The aggressive behavior of the tumor and morphologic findings were highly suggestive of carcinosarcoma.

Physical examination revealed a large elastic palpable mass in the upper abdomen. No neurological change was observed. His white blood cell count and amylase serum levels were normal. The patient underwent supine abdominal radiography and unenhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT).\nSupine abdominal radiography revealed the VPS in the left upper quadrant and a soft-tissue mass in the upper abdomen (Figure \n).

The cystic mass was independent of the pancreas.\nThus, a peritoneal pseudocyst around the VPS causing stomach obstruction was suspected and emergency laparotomy was performed. The large mass was localized in the left upper abdomen between the stomach and transverse colon mesentery, exactly at the omental bursa (Figure \n).

Echocardiography revealed moderate aortic stenosis (mean gradient 30 mmHg), good function of the mechanical mitral valve, severe (free) tricuspid valve regurgitation, and significant tricuspid valve stenosis (Figures and ). The maximal velocity through the tricuspid valve was measured to be 2.06 m/s with a calculated maximal pressure gradient of 17 mmHg and a mean pressure gradient of 11 mmHg. A right heart catheterization that was performed verified these measurements. STS score for mortality was 9%, and the patient was considered by the heart team to be extremely high risk for surgery. The patient was thus referred for percutaneous transfemoral tricuspid VIV implantation under conscious sedation. Due to normal right-ventricular contraction and high systolic pressures, it was decided to perform the procedure with rapid pacing. Several options for placement of the electrode were considered. Insertion of a right-ventricular electrode is associated with the risk of it being jailed between the old and new prostheses. Furthermore, insertion of a left-ventricular electrode is technically difficult due to the presence of aortic stenosis. In addition, rapid right-atrial pacing did not allow for proper capture of the ventricle. It was decided to place a temporary electrode in the coronary sinus for rapid pacing, but again rapid ventricular pacing could not be achieved due to technical difficulties. Therefore, cardiac arrest was attempted with 6 mg of adenosine; however, this dose was not adequate, and thereafter cardiac arrest was induced with bolus injection of 18 mg of adenosine through a peripheral vein access. Asystole was induced, and a balloon expandable valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Sapien XT 29 mm)",

In addition, the patient presented with weak aspiration and nasal leakage during fluid intake.\nThe routine physical examinations showed a wide fissure which split from the palate vertical anterior cleft to 1/3 of the hard palate. There was no congestion in pharyngeal mucosa with the uvula in the middle. Bilateral tonsils showed hypertrophy without exudation. Epiglottis and bilateral pear-like nest were not clear. The pear bone could be seen. Thus, the patient had incomplete cleft palate. Meanwhile, we also found an unclear-bordered uplift in the left palate and a soft mass which could be moved in the right soft palate trailing edge with endoscopy (Fig. ). Then, the patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan. Consistently, radiographs of the palate revealed a mass convex to the pharyngeal cavity which was about 27 mm \u00d7 21 mm \u00d7 26 mm in size (Fig. ). In addition, no obvious abnormality was found on the nasopharyngeal bone or soft tissue. According to the above examination, the diagnosis for the patient was incomplete cleft palate and soft palate vascularized space-occupying lesions (involving the left posterior wall of the nasopharynx, most likely fibrous hemangioma).\nThe patient was treated by palatal lump resection and cleft palate repair with endoscopic guidance from the oral cavity while under general anesthesia. During the surgical resection process, the mass was dissected from the dorsal side of the left soft palate with the pharyngeal mucosa preserved and the nasopharyngeal mucosa completely removed.

The tumor was mobile without evidence of dermal invasion, and the axillary lymph nodes were impalpable. A round, high-density mass measuring 17 mm in diameter (tumor 1) was found in the right breast on a mammogram (). An ultrasound examination revealed one intracystic tumor in the right breast () and two tumors (each 8 mm in diameter) in the left breast (Figures and , resp.). A magnetic resonance imaging examination also showed these tumors (Figures , , and , resp.) with diffuse small nodules surrounding the tumors in the bilateral breasts (Figures , ). The serum CEA and CA15-3 levels were not elevated. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the tumors was performed, which revealed a diagnosis of histopathology suspected invasive carcinoma. Bilateral partial mastectomy and a sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. Lymph node metastasis was detected in the right axilla, and lymph node dissection of the right axilla was performed. Tumor 1 was diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma NOS, and tumors 2 and 3 were diagnosed as mucinous carcinoma. All of these invasive tumors involved intraductal SPCs, and a wide range of surgical margins were positive for SPC. Therefore, an additional bilateral total mastectomy was performed on day 21 after surgery. Synchronous bilateral invasive breast cancer with intraductal SPCs was eventually diagnosed. The patient continues to receive oral aromatase inhibitor treatment without recurrence five years after undergoing surgery.\nMicroscopically, tumor 1 was diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma NOS.

A CT scan showed a 12 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 8 cm mass in the left kidney extending into the hilum consistent with RCC and a gallbladder polyp. A number of bilateral small peripheral and sub-pleural pulmonary nodules measuring less than 5 mm and of indeterminate nature were present. In June 2011, the patient underwent an open radical nephrectomy and adrenalectomy, with an uneventful recovery. Pathology revealed a CC RCC Fuhrman 4 with extensive sarcomatoid changes and areas of necrosis, invading muscular veins of renal sinus including the main renal vein but without invasion of perinephric fat. All nodes were negative for malignancy, staging the tumour as pT3bN0.\nThe next month, the patient experienced two episodes of severe upper abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting which completely subsided after administration of intravenous morphine, accompanied by unremarkable CT emergency scans. He had a Barium swallow test and an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, both of which were normal. On the third episode of acute abdominal pain in July, he finally underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with relief of symptoms. Histopathology revealed a 22 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 8 mm polyp with normal mucosa composed of nested/alveolar pattern of moderate-sized polygonal cells with clear cytoplasm and well-defined cytoplasm borders, round central nuclei with a moderate degree of nucleolar prominence, occasionally multinucleated, with fine fibro-vascular septae present within thin wall vessels and an admixture of inflammation and foamy macrophages at the periphery of the polyp.

There was no joint pain, no alopecia, no rash, no oral ulcers, and no heart failure symptoms. On physical examinations, she was febrile with the temperature of 38.2\u00b0C and mildly dehydrated, but otherwise comfortable, not tachypneic, and not in distress. Her blood pressure was 128/86 mmHg, and her pulse rate was 110 beats per minute. Her abdomen was soft, not tender, and no palpable organomegaly. Examination of the cardiorespiratory and neurological system was also revealed no abnormal finding. Initial blood investigation was done (as shown in Table ). Her white blood cells and C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated, and there was mild hypoalbuminemia, acute kidney injury, and minimal proteinuria.

Previous medical history included maxillary osteomyelitis in 2009 with multiple interventions resulting in a complex mediofacial resection, with a subtotal defect of the hard plate, maxillary sinus, and nasal septum. Concomitant diseases included depression and type two diabetes mellitus on peroral therapy.\nA nasal endoscopy and computed tomography (CT) showed a huge pathologic cavity resulting from communication between the oral cavity, right maxillary sinus, and nasal cavity, with a minor communication with the right orbit (Figures -).\nDue to the past medical history and the severity of the case biopsy specimens were obtained under general anesthesia.

With some symptomatic relief after initial 2 months of treatment, he discontinued medications without any medical advice or further follow-up. For another 9 months he continued to have recurrent off and on headache at irregular intervals which used to get relieved with over the counter medications. Over the last 6 months he had symptoms suggestive of progressive gait ataxia and right upper limb intentional tremors. For last 1 month he had resurgence of the symptoms in the form of severe holocranial headache, vomiting and fever. There was no history of seizures, loss of consciousness, any bulbar symptoms, diplopia, facial numbness or weakness. There was no significant past medical history. He was unmarried, rural dweller with agriculture as main vocation. There was no history of any high risk sexual behaviour. His mother took treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis for 9 months, 15 years back. Her exact medication records were not available.\nOn examination the general physical examination was unremarkable. He was conscious and well oriented to time place and person. All the cranial nerves including fundus were within normal limits. There was horizontal nystagmus in right eye on right lateral gaze with fast component towards the side of gaze. There was hypotonia on right side with grade power five in all limbs. Deep tendon reflexes were bilaterally grade two. Pendular right knee jerk was observed. Sensory examination was normal for touch, pain temperature, joint position, and vibration sense.

The abdominal mass appeared to be fixed to adjacent structures, with its limits poorly defined.\nAll routine blood test results and levels of tumor markers (CEA, CA 19\u20139, \u03b1-fetoprotein) were within the normal ranges.

Moreover, the mass was in close proximity to the left colic flexure.\nAfter appropriate fluid resuscitation and positioning of a naso-gastric tube, the patient was urgently taken to the operating room for exploration.

His physical examination revealed a soft, non-tender, palpable 3 \u00d7 4 cm mass on the medial aspect of his left knee. In full flexion the mass appeared more pronounced. He denied any history of trauma and there was no effusion in his knee, with the joint not showing any signs of instability; he also had a full range of knee motion and normal strength in the lower extremities. McMurray and Apley tests were negative. There was no difference in leg length and there were no cutaneous lesions. Laboratory tests, including a complete coagulation profile, were all within normal range and his medical, developmental and family histories were unremarkable.\nPlain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained (Figures , and ). The anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the left knee showed no abnormality, especially no signs of phleboliths but the MRI scan showed a well-defined mass located within the suprapatellar pouch, but infiltrating the vastus medialis muscle. The mass appeared lobulated in contour with internal septae. On T1-weighted images the lesion had a low or intermediate signal and was not clearly distinguishable from adjacent muscles (Figure ). On T2-weighted images the mass had a signal intensity brighter than fat with thin fibrofatty septae of low-signal within the lesion (Figures and ). The differential diagnosis mainly included pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) and synovial sarcoma.\nDue to the differential diagnosis, an incisional biopsy was performed first, strictly according to the guidelines of orthopaedic tumour surgery.

She was seen by the Ophthalmologist who noted reduced visual acuity in right eye (6/15) compared to the left eye (6/12). Visual field testing revealed a defect in the left upper quadrant of the right eye with enlargement of the blind spot. Both pupils were however of equal size, diameter of 2.5 mm and equally reactive to light. The patient was referred for a computerized tomographical (CT) scan, which showed osteolytic honeycomb radial changes of the outer plate of the skull, with external protrusion (Fig. ). The lesion originated from the right wing of the sphenoid bone, destroyed the outer plate and inner plate, extended to the ipsilateral middle cranial fossa and orbit, and showed a helioradial change. The trabecula of the bone was arranged from the center to the periphery in the shape of chrysanthemum petals. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed to obtain further details. T1-weighted (T1W) imaging showed slightly low signal mixed with small patchy high signal. T2-weighted (T2W) imaging showed uneven high signal.

He was diagnosed with EB during a genetic consultation that he had received before getting married at the age of 28 years. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with RDEB at the age of 38 years. Application of a strong external force to the skin results in blister formation as early as 15 min. In June 2012, he presented to a nearby hospital with epigastric pain, where he was diagnosed with cholelithiasis and cancer in the transverse colon and was referred to our hospital. In September 2012, transverse colectomy and cholecystectomy were performed via laparotomy, followed by an uneventful postoperative course. In April 2013, a liver metastasis (S2) was detected. The lesion was a solitary tumor measuring \u22642 cm and was treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in June 2013, again followed by an uneventful postoperative course. In September 2015, a recurrent tumor was detected at the site of RFA, with suspected invasion into the diaphragm. He was then admitted to our hospital for curative open surgery. On admission, although no active blistering was noted, pigmentation and scars due to recurrent blistering were noted especially in the extremities and back.

The patient received adjuvant radiotherapy (42 Gy) and chemotherapy. However, the size of the residual neck mass and lung nodules increased, and the patient died 9 months after their last operation.\nThe patient had a history of total thyroidectomy for a PTC 6 years previously. In addition, the patient underwent a dissection of neck lymph nodes for PTC recurrence and a total of 200 mCi of radioactive iodine (131I) therapy 3 years previously.\nThe patient's tissue samples were reviewed retrospectively, and additional immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and direct sequencing of the BRAF gene were performed. The primary PTC samples could not be included due to their poor quality.

The patient was a non-insulin-dependent diabetic, on treatment with oral hypoglycemics and insulin at different periods. He was operated upon with excision of the left submandibular gland. Histopathology report was chronic sialadenitis [, Specimen 1]. Patient continued to have enlarging cervical lymphadenopathy which would swell to three or four times the usual size over three to four days, accompanied by fever of around 38\u00b0C and rising blood sugar levels. Subsequently the nodes would regress to stable size over the next 10-15 days, with gradual subsidence of fever. Different lymph nodes were affected in each such episode. The patient also developed features of sinusitis over the next three months. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the head showed a left nasal mass and multiple cervical lymph nodes. Routine hemogram and serum biochemistry were normal except for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which was raised at 62 mm in the first hour. Serum globulins were 4.1 g/dL.\nThe patient stabilized over the next three months with regression of nodes followed by a stable cervical lymphadenopathy. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of both left and right cervical stable nodes was performed, and reported as RDD [, Specimen 3].

The patient had been on prednisolone and methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis.

We decided to perform pleurodesis because his left lung expanded well after chest drainage and he had some risks for pneumothorax surgery, as previously mentioned.

    "original_text": "A 72-year-old woman with a past medical history of sarcoidosis underwent an endoscopic examination owing to dysphagia. The endoscopic examination revealed a circumferential tumor with ulceration in the cervical esophagus. Biopsies obtained during the endoscopy indicated squamous cell carcinoma. Contrast-enhanced CT showed extensive tumor growth with suspected tracheal invasion and enlarged lymph nodes extending from the cervical region to the upper mediastinum. FDG-PET/CT revealed abnormal FDG accumulation in the primary lesion (SUV max: 23.1) and lymph nodes (SUV max: 5.45) from the cervical to upper mediastinal region (Fig. ). However, it was difficult to determine whether the multiple lymphadenopathy was benign or metastatic because of her past medical history of sarcoidosis. Therefore, and also for the purpose of preserving the larynx, we initiated definitive chemoradiotherapy. The patient was administered 2 cycles of 45 mg cisplatin and 700 mg 5-fluorouracil with 60 Gy/30 fr radiation therapy over 2 months. In each cycle, 8 mg dexamethasone was administered to prevent side effects of chemotherapy. After completing the chemoradiotherapy, we observed complete disappearance of FDG uptake in the primary cancer in the esophagus, and only a slight reduction in FDG uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes (SUV max: 3.26; Fig. ), which indicated that the lymph nodes were affected by sarcoidosis. The primary lesion of the esophagus relapsed 3 months later. Then, the patient underwent thoracoscopic and laparoscopic total laryngopharyngoesophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction via the posterior mediastinal route. The pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the cervical esophagus. The resected lymph nodes demonstrated no tumor metastasis. However, some lymph nodes showed granulomatous reactions and contained several small epithelioid cell granulomas (Fig. ), suggesting the presence of sarcoidosis. The final stage was determined as pT2N0M0, pStage IB (UICC 7th). The patient was discharged 27 days after surgery. Contrast-enhanced CT performed 6 months after surgery showed no tumor recurrence.

There was a history of weight loss over the last few months. On general physical examination, the patient was moderately built and poorly nourished. All the vital signs were within the normal limits.\nExtra oral examination revealed facial asymmetry with a diffuse swelling on left side measuring 22 \u00d7 17 cms in dimension. Swelling was extending from lower eyelid superiorly to 2 cm below the lower border of the mandible inferiorly. Medially it extends from the philtrum and lateral wall of the nose to 2 cm anterior to tragus of the ear. Skin over the swelling was stretched, shiny, and erythematous. The nasolabial fold was obliterated and the patient was not able to close his mouth. Swelling was firm to hard in consistency and nontender on palpation (Figures and ).\nIntraoral examination revealed a proliferative growth measuring approximately 12 \u00d7 10 cm extending from left buccal mucosa involving upper alveolus, extending downwards crossing the midline, and extending towards the opposite side. Surface of the growth was lobulated, covered with necrotic slough, with pus discharge, and erythematous areas. The growth was firm in consistency and tender on palpation ().\nInvestigations included complete hemogram, panoramic radiograph, skull views, CT scan, and biopsy. The hemogram showed a normal blood count with an elevated total leucocyte count and elevated ESR. Orthopantomograph and postero-anterior views showed erosion of the left maxilla and downward displacement of 24 (Figures and ). CT scan revealed a large mass epicentered over the left masticator space with destruction of the posterolateral wall of the maxillary sinus. The mass extended into the sinus cavity anteriorly",

He had suffered a stroke 10 years ago and was diagnosed with hypertension. He underwent a total gastrectomy due to stomach cancer 2 years ago. Last year, he was diagnosed with ischemic cardiomyopathy and chronic renal failure and has been under continuous medical treatment since that time. On admission, uremic syndrome and pulmonary edema were diagnosed, so he was treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Forty-eight hours after admission, the pulmonary edema had resolved and vital signs had normalized. Anuria improved with the use of diuretics, after which the CRRT was interrupted. He developed sudden monomorphic refractory ventricular tachycardia on the third hospital day (), and CPR was performed for 1 hour. Amiodarone was used to control the ventricular tachycardia. Echocardiographic findings showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 20% (decreased compared to an EF of 40% before CPR, but laboratory studies did not show any abnormal findings). Because of a persistent state of shock after the ROSC, coronary angiography (CAG) was performed. No acute myocardial infarction findings were found. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was inserted for hemodynamic support and no coronary intervention was performed. The next day his level of consciousness had normalized, and his vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature were stable with the use of inotropic agents. The IABP was removed quickly. Amiodarone (1,800 mg) was infused for 24 hours; however, a prolonged QT was observed (QTc, 560 msec); thus, the amiodarone was stopped. Ventilator weaning was difficult because of rib fractures, and gastric tube feeding was started subsequently. The inotropic agents were decreased, and dopamine was decreased to 3 \u00b5g/kg/min. Ten days after the ROSC and 3 days after gastric tube feeding, the inotropic agents were increased. The echocardiographic EF (40%) recovered to that seen before",

He had a loud pansystolic murmur on the left sternal edge and had tenderness on palpation of the left upper abdomen. His initial investigations showed a high white blood cell count and C-reactive protein (CRP) (). A chest X-ray showed left mid and right lower lung zone infiltrates, and an ultrasound of the upper abdomen showed an ill-defined splenic lesion without internal vascularity suggesting either an abscess or infarct. Three sets of blood cultures were subsequently negative. Echocardiogram showed vegetation on the VSD patch along with dehiscence, a large VSD, and moderate right ventricular outflow obstruction. A CT abdomen with contrast was done which showed multiple liver, splenic, and lung abscesses with infarcted left kidney and thrombus at the bifurcation of the aorta secondary to the septic embolic phenomenon. Cardiothoracic surgery consultation was sought, and the patient underwent a redo-sternotomy and removal of vegetations from right ventricular outflow tract site, removal of Dacron Patch, and complete repair of TOF. Postoperative echocardiogram did not show any residual VSD or vegetation, only mild left ventricular dysfunction and moderately reduced right ventricle function was seen. The vegetation removed from right outflow tract and Dacron Patch was sent for bacterial, mycobacterial, and mycology",

She was in her usual state of health until January 2013 when she suddenly began to suffer from frequent vomiting with no apparent reason. She immediately went to her local hospital where she was diagnosed with gastroenteritis and treated accordingly. However, the problem persisted for a time and then worsened, adding severe constipation (only passing stool every three days) to the list of symptoms. She was once again admitted to the hospital and, once again, treated for the same condition. As her problem did not improve, she went to her local clinic and demanded the opinion of an expert. A gastroenterology team was consulted and, following their advice, she undertook a barium follow through. The results showed all the symptoms of severe superior mesenteric artery syndrome, a condition that causes almost complete intestinal obstruction at the level of the third part of the duodenum. With this new information, she was readmitted to the hospital on January 11 and underwent an upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy and NJ tube insertion. A biopsy was also taken because of the severe difficulties in performing the endoscopy. Despite all this, her condition worsened and, on January 15, she suffered an episode of vomiting, choking, and aspiration pneumonia, which required an ICU admission of 10 days for a course of antibiotics. After this, she was allowed to start gradual NJ feeding with a small amount administered initially (2 cc) and an incremental increase until the full dose (45 cc) was reached.

The cervical area of the tooth had a slightly greyish discoloration due to presence of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), and an access cavity was adhesively restored. Palpation was mildly painful but responses to percussing and probing the pocket depth were all within normal limits. A diagnostic x-ray from a referral dentist showed that the tooth was in the second stage of root development and revealed a periapical lesion and radiopaque material in the pulp chamber. The access cavity was inadequate because the mesial pulp horn was not included in the access cavity design (Fig. ). The tooth was diagnosed as acute exacerbation of chronic apical periodontitis with maxillary abscess. The dental history disclosed that the patient was treated two weeks earlier when the RRT was performed according to AAE\u2019s guidelines. The dental history also disclosed the patient had suffered dental trauma nearly 4 months earlier, sustaining a subluxation of her permanent maxillary right incisor. After discussion with the patient\u00b4s parents about possible treatment modalities and the signing of informed consent forms, the RRT was repeated. During the first appointment, local anesthesia 4% articaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine (Supracain 4%; Zentiva a.s., Prague, Czech Republic) and a rubber dam were applied and the access cavity was redesigned.

He is a lifelong non-smoker. A staging computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed two right lower lobe lung nodules (2.7 cm and <1 cm), and a 6.3 cm tumor in the left kidney. A positron emission tomography computerized tomography (PET/CT) in November 2013 (Fig. ) showed enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes in addition to FDG uptake in the lung nodules and a complex left kidney mass. A mass in the thoracic spine (T3 vertebra) and a small focus of uptake in the right sacral ala were also noted (Fig. ). A biopsy of the T3 vertebral lesion was performed and pathologic review demonstrated RCC. A core needle biopsy of one of the right lower lobe lung nodules was also performed and unexpectedly revealed recurrent metastatic melanoma (Fig. ). In December 2013, a brain MRI showed a subcentimeter left temporal metastasis. The patient received radiation to the T3 vertebral metastasis and stereotactic radiosurgery to the brain metastasis.\nWhile weighing the treatment options for these two cancers, although our initial thoughts were to focus on the more aggressive melanoma (BRAF and NRAS wild type), we were motivated to design a therapy regimen that could yield efficacious responses against both cancers.

The lesion had developed in size over time. By the time she was referred to our dermatology department, the lesion was 20 \u00d7 20 cm (Figure ). She did not complain of itching, bleeding, or scaling. She denied having any systemic diseases or using any drugs, and she did not have hypertrichosis. After examining the patient, she was diagnosed with Becker's nevus, which was later confirmed by biopsy. There were no findings to support the diagnosis of other conditions. Re-evaluation of the patient by another dermatologist confirmed the diagnosis. We initiated laser therapy by Q-switched ruby laser (694 nm, energy: 5 J, spot size: 3 \u00d7 3 mm), but there were no signs of improvement after three sessions. Since laser therapy was unsuccessful, we decided to use the dermabrasion method to remove the epidermis and upper dermis in the affected area by Becker's nevus. After injecting local anesthetics, we used a sterilized 180 grit sandpaper and removed epidermis and superficial dermis in a 10 \u00d7 10 cm surface manually in circular patterns. Prophylactic Cephalexin capsules and topical Mupirocin ointment were prescribed for the patient to use every 6 h for a week. We followed up the patient for 3 months afterward and the procedure was not followed by any complications including skin bleeding, infection, scarring or skin discoloration. The lesion was successfully removed after only one session of dermabrasion and did not recur afterward (Figure ).
