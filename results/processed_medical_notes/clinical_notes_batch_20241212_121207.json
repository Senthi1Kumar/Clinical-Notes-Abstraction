The headaches are described as dull holocephalic headaches with no light or sound sensitivity. Treatment of the left frontal meningioma by surgical resection and gamma-knife radiation for recurrence did not provide sustained relief of the patient's headache. Likewise, treatment for possible hydrocephalus with placement of ventriculoperitoneal shunt with multiple revisions did not provide any relief, and the shunt was removed by age 42. Since the age of 46, the patient was reported to have progressive cognitive decline and frequent falls. She was admitted to a local hospital and diagnosed with myasthenia gravis (MG). She was started on pyridostigmine, and after a brief rehabilitation, she was discharged home. On followup with a neurologist, the diagnosis of MG was challenged and excluded based on the clinical picture, serological testing (negative antiacetyl choline receptor antibody), and neurophysiological testing (negative repetitive nerve stimulation). Hence, pyridostigmine was discontinued, and the patient was started on valproic acid for headache control. Three months prior to admission to our tertiary center, the patient continued to experience a rapidly progressive cognitive decline. By the time the patient presented to our institution, she was bedridden and almost nonverbal.\nOn admission, the patient was noted to be tachycardic but afebrile.

There was no family history of twin pregnancies, congenital malformations or prenatal illness. Obstetric sonography at 26 weeks' gestation revealed a single fetus of appropriate size for gestational age, but bowel wall edema and small bowel obstruction were suspected. Sonography at 29 weeks' gestation showed a large amount of amniotic fluid and the aforementioned findings were not changed. Sonography at 33 weeks' gestation which was performed at our institution showed that a markedly dilated bowel and the bowel obstruction were still suspicious. The amount of amniotic fluid was increased, and a 6.8\u00d76.4 cm pseudocyst and a 4.39\u00d73.22 cm calcified heteroechgenic mass were found (). Otherwise, there were no abnormal findings. Our clinical diagnosis was a giant cystic type of meconium obstruction associated with peritonitis induced by perforation and atresia of the small bowel. The weekly ultrasonographic follow-ups showed no significant interval changes.\nAt 38-weeks' gestation, a female newborn weighing 4,120 g was delivered by an elective cesarean section, with Apgar scores of 2, 4 and 9 at 1, 5 and 10 minutes. The baby had a grossly distended abdomen and did not present any evidence of dysmorphic features. The patient had respiratory distress after birth which was probably induced by elevated abdominal pressure due to the abdominal mass and ascites and necessitated assisted ventilation. She was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for further evaluation and treatment. Laboratory tests showed no abnormalities except for a slightly decreased albumin level of 3.1 g/dL and an alpha-fetoprotein level of 5,845 ng/mL. Abdominal radiographs showed a large abdominal mass containing multiple calcifications in the lower abdomen (). Abdominal ultrasonography showed a huge solitary and cystic mass which filled most of the abdomen. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a well-demarcated intraabdominal mass measuring 15",

The history obtained revealed that the patient was followed up regularly by paediatric neurologists for her CP, and she had multiple botulinum injections when she was 8 years old. The physical examination based on the walking analysis illustrated limited range of motion in addition to 55\u00b0 of increased femoral anteversion in either hips. From the data of walking analysis, physical examination and radiological findings, the increased femoral anteversion and excessive soft tissue contractures due to CP were considered the primary reason for her walking difficulty. To improve her gait pattern, a combination of soft tissue procedure and distal femoral derotational osteotomy were planned.\nUnder general anaesthesia, the tendons of adductor longus, iliopsoas, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, gracilis, and gastrocnemius were released from the musculotendinous junction bilaterally. Bilateral distal femoral derotational osteotomy was then performed just above the metaphysis level with a lateral approach, and osteosynthesis was obtained by dynamic compression plate and screw fixation. Bilateral long leg casts were applied postoperatively to maintain osteosynthesis. The patient was discharged on the third post-operative day, casts were removed one month later and routine rehabilitative physiotherapy was instituted.\nAt one-year routine follow-up, there was complete union of the osteotomy. Although pre-operative radiographs of the right knee showed no evidence of any cystic or tumoral lesions around the distal femur (), the second-year follow-up radiographs revealed an asymptomatic large bone cyst in the distal part of the right femur. A computed tomography (CT) scan identified the lesion as a large cystic lesion located just above the lateral femoral condyle expanding from metaphysis to the femoral diaphysis involving the osteotomy site with cortical thinning (). The initial diagnosis was an aneurysmal bone cyst. To verify the diagnosis, an incisional biopsy was performed under general anaesthesia. Cortical bone was partially destroyed by the lesion",

Upon inspection, it was noted that the left globe was displaced superiorly with increased scleral show (a). Bimanual palpation was done and a hard object could be felt behind the orbital rim of the left eye; although it was not visible externally. No evidence of diplopia was noted by ophthalmological examination.

    "original_text": "The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of well-controlled hypertension who is diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and treated with a doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy regimen. During therapy, he is continued on hydrochlorothiazide for his hypertension. Three months later, he complains of dyspnea on exertion and mild lower extremity edema. A transthoracic echocardiogram reveals a moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), which is new compared with a study performed before he underwent chemotherapy.\nWhat are the mechanisms of cardiotoxicity due to cancer therapies? What basic and clinical data are there to support the use of particular medications to treat cardiotoxicity in the oncology patient?\nLife expectancy after the diagnosis and treatment of cancer has increased significantly in the past 2 decades, uncovering the unintended consequences of cancer therapy on the cardiovascular system and leading to accelerated cardiovascular disease in patients treated with a wide variety of antitumor agents. Given the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease and associated risk factors in the general population, patients may have compromised reserve before starting chemotherapy. Furthermore, patients treated with cardiotoxic cancer therapies often develop multiple risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome, further worsening cardiovascular reserve and increasing the likelihood of subsequent cardiotoxicity.\nCancer therapy\u2013induced cardiotoxicity is due to a combination of \u201con-target\u201d and \u201coff-target\u201d effects. These effects result from redundancy in essential signaling cascades that promote undesired cancer cell proliferation but also protect cardiomyocyte and endothelial cells, especially in response to stress. Effective therapies for treating cancer therapy\u2013induced cardiotoxicity need to either exploit tissue-specific differences between cancerous tissues and the cardiomyocyte/cardiac endothelium or, more specifically, affect the cardiotoxic mechanisms without disrupting antitumor pathways. In this review, we focus on 3 classes of commonly used agents (anthracyclines, the ErbB2 inhibitor trastuzumab, and the vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] signaling pathway inhibitors sunitinib and sorafenib), which have established cardiotoxicity. For each class of agents, we first provide a",

In past medical history, she mentioned a secondary infertility for four yrs and had one child aged eight yrs. The patient was candidate for In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) protocol due to tubal factors. In the first cycle of ovarian stimulation, metformin and Gonal-f 75 IU for six days were prescribed () and then continued for two days. The cycle was cancelled due to poor response after the second month from this protocol. She suffered from gradual abdominal distention.\nDespite the failure of IVF, she was under the outpatient care and supportive treatment with possible diagnosis of hyperstimulation syndrome. Therefore, antagonist GnRH was prescribed for two days. At the next delayed month visit, because of persistent symptoms with the probability of hyperthyroidism, she received gonadotropin hormone agonist (Decapeptyl). She was re-evaluated due to unresponsive to treatment within this period.\nTrans-abdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography were performed that showed multiple multiloculated cystic masses with predominantly solid components in both adnexa. The results of cross-sectional CT-scan and magnetic resonance imaging suggested the ovarian neoplasm. Also, massive peritoneal and pleural effusion was detected (). In this time, 4 months after management of hyperstimulation syndrome, due to persistent large ovarian mass and increased tumor marker inhibin more than 3000 pg/mL, she was referred to our oncology department. Physical examination demonstrated enlarged masses extended up to hypogastric region which resembled 36 wks of pregnancy.\nExploratory laparotomy was performed that showed massive ascites fluid and multi solid cystic masses in both ovaries extended up to the Xiphoid.

He continued the same treatment for approximately 6 months, but the symptoms did not disappear. In September, 2017, he had nausea and vomiting, and finally he could not take any meal.

In physical examination, there was no special abnormality in his heart, lungs, and abdomen. Table shows the clinical characteristics on admission. His C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased up to 13.36 mg/dL, suggesting the presence of inflammation. An increase of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and uric acid was observed which we think was probably due to dehydration. Although he had high fever and high CRP, all the infection markers that we examined were negative. In addition, several antibodies which we examined were all negative. Taking into account these data, we thought it unlikely that he had some inflammatory disease and/or autoimmune disorder such as collagen disease. Since his blood glucose level was relatively low and the number of eosinophils was relatively high, we examined the possibility of adrenal deficiency. As shown in Table , ACTH and cortisol levels were low and urinary cortisol level was also low, suggesting the presence of ACTH deficiency and adrenal insufficiency. An increased prolactin level was also observed which we assumed was induced by the side effect of dopamine blockers.\nNext,",

The patient was seen by an otolaryngologist approximately 3 weeks following the incident for complaints of burning and soreness of the tongue and loss of taste. His physical exam was notable for an area of mild erythema of the right lateral tongue, tender to palpation but without ulceration, and he was prescribed a supersaturated calcium phosphate rinse for oral mucositis and topical benzocaine for symptomatic relief. Approximately 6 weeks following the incident, the patient was seen in follow-up by the otolaryngologist for tongue soreness. At that time, examination revealed erythema and shallow erosion/ulceration of the dorsal tongue just anterior to the foramen cecum, and light erythema of the lateral tongue. The patient was diagnosed with candidiasis and prescribed nystatin.

At that time, the patient received a transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy due to elevated PSA of 10.8 ng/mL that revealed adenocarcinoma in two of the six specimen cores. The adenocarcinoma had a Gleason score of 3 + 3 and an estimated prostate volume was 25 gm. A metastatic evaluation of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and bone was negative. As the patient did not want surgical treatment at that time, he was treated with monthly injections of LHRH agonist at private clinics and had no evidence of an increasing prostate specific antigen (PSA). After 8 years, he revisited our department, presenting with aggravated irritative and obstructive urinary symptoms. An increased postvoid residual urine volume of 180 cc was noted. His PSA was 9.3 ng/mL, and serum testosterone concentration was measured to determine whether he was indeed castrated and found to be 0.65 ng/mL. There were no other specific clinical symptoms to suggest metastases of the prostate cancer. A physical examination of the testis and scrotum was normal. Metastatic evaluations, including a bone scan, were negative. Considering his poor health and old age, we suggested and performed a bilateral subcapsular orchiectomy for hormonal management and a palliative transurethral resection of the prostate, rather than a radical prostatectomy, to relieve his urinary symptoms.\nA histopathological analysis showed that the testis and resected prostate were infiltrated by metastatic adenocarcinoma that had a Gleason score of 4 + 3 ().

Hypertension had already been diagnosed 20 years before and she was treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker. Every now and then she suffered from chest pain, especially in bed at night, sporadically during exertion. She had no pregnancy wish and besides hypertension and migraine she had no further medical history. The arterial blood pressure at her right arm was 155/85 mmHg and on the left arm 135/70 mmHg, arterial blood pressure was unobtainable in the lower extremities, and there was a marked delay in the femoral pulses compared with the brachial arteries (\u2018femoral\u2013brachial delay\u2019). Auscultation of the chest revealed an early systolic ejection murmur and a soft diastolic murmur. The systolic murmur was also heard on the posterior thorax. The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm and conduction times, but also signs of left ventricular hypertrophy (high R-waves in the left precordial leads with associated ST-segment changes). At transthoracic echocardiography, left and right ventricular dimensions and function appeared within normal ranges. However, a functional bicuspid aortic valve was identified, with a grade I/III regurgitation. The diameter of the ascending aorta was enlarged (38 mm). Suprasternal view revealed poor acoustic images, but in the abdominal aorta a clear diastolic forward flow was demonstrated. Aortic coarctation was suspected and confirmed by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showing a wide aortic arch and a significant narrowing, with minimal diameter of 6 mm, just distal of the left subclavian artery and poststenotic dilatation of the descending aorta. The systolic blood pressure gradient between upper and lower extremities appeared to be 30\u201340 mmHg. An uncomplicated balloon angioplasty was performed (using a 30 \u00d7 14 and 40 \u00d7 18 mm balloon, respectively) resulting in a coarctation diameter of 16 mm (Fig. ). A stent was not placed",

The patient had been under the care of Dermatology since 2003 for an itchy rash on the legs, scalp and chest. A biopsy from a crusted lesion on the scalp (Fig. ) in 2003 revealed acantholysis of the keratinocytes in the upper part of the prickle cell layer (Fig. ), and direct immunofluorescence studies showed IgG positivity around the upper epidermal cells. These features were consistent with a diagnosis of PF. He was started on Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) 500 mg twice a day and Prednisolone 10 mg once a day by Dermatology in 2006, which had resulted in excellent control of his cutaneous lesions. Prior to this, Azathioprine alone had been introduced on two occasions by Dermatology, however the patient failed to tolerate it due to nausea and vomiting. Oral involvement only began in January 2008 which required hospital admission for a short period.\nHis only other relevant medical history was hypertension, for which he took Nifedipine. At initial presentation, he was also taking Ranitidine and Alendronic Acid for protection against osteoporosis with prolonged systemic corticosteroid use. He was a non-smoker and had low alcohol intake.\nAt initial appointment, MMF dose was increased to 1 g in the morning and 500 mg in the evening for 2 weeks, and thereafter 1 g twice a day. Full blood count, urea and electrolytes and liver function tests were normal, and regular blood monitoring was carried out appropriately.

The patient's vital signs were temperature 36.5\u2103, heart rate 105 beats per minute, respiration rate 20 per min, blood pressure 100/60 mmHg, and pulse oximetry 98% on room air. On the initial physical examination, a pansystolic murmur was heard along the lower left sternal border with inspiratory accentuation, but signs of right heart failure were not detected. Chest radiograph was normal. Electrocardiogram showed complete right bundle branch block with left posterior fascicular block (). Results of laboratory tests were notable for elevated cardiac biomarker, creatine kinase myocardial band isoenzyme was 144.1 ng/mL, troponin I was 13.88 ng/mL. Echocardiography was performed for evaluation of chest pain and elevated cardiac biomarker. A flail of the septal and anterior tricuspid leaflet was present and rupture of the papillary muscle was suspected on transthoracic echocardiography (). Although all cardiac structures were identified on transthoracic echocardiography, we performed transesophageal echocardiography to delineate exact anatomy of subvalvular structure. It confirmed prolapse of the septal and anterior tricuspid valve leaflet with large portions of the valve and the subvalvular apparatus protruding into the right atrium indicating rupture of both anterior and posterior papillary muscles (). Color-flow Doppler echocardiography shows severe tricuspid valve regurgitation (). Peak velocity of tricuspid valve was 1.62 m/sec and estimated right ventricular systolic pressure was 20.5 mmHg (). We decided to repair tricuspid valve and referred to thoracic surgery department. Intraoperative findings confirmed the echocardiographic diagnosis of papillary muscle rupture. Tricuspid valve repair was performed with reimplantation of the ruptured papillary muscle and a ring annuloplasty. Postoperative echocardiography showed satisfactory leaflet coaptation () and repaired papillary muscle (). Only mild tricuspid regurgitation remained.

Upon inspection of the left main bronchus, there were substantial changes as compared to the bronchoscopy 2 weeks before, showing narrowing of the airway lumen and mucosal edema with friability to the point of not being able to advance the bronchoscope into either the left upper or lower lobe segments. Subsequently, the right allograft was evaluated with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsies of both right middle and lower lobes being performed without difficulty. The patient tolerated the procedure well including biopsies until 5 min after withdrawing the bronchoscope when she dropped her oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2) to 86% despite mechanical ventilation. Chest radiograph revealed left lung collapse [], so the bronchoscope was immediately re-inserted with the discovery of complete occlusion or vanishing of the left main bronchus []. The bronchoscope was not able to be advanced through this tissue occluding the airway, so alligator forceps were used to try to perforate it. After numerous attempts, eventually a small opening [] was obtained. However, her respiratory status declined due to severe hypoxic respiratory failure with no improvement with inhaled nitric oxide and trial of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. She was therefore placed on VV ECMO with immediate normalization of SaO2. While on VV ECMO, balloon dilatation of the left main bronchus was successfully performed through the small opening attained earlier. A CRE\u2122 balloon was used to dilate the area from 4 mm initially to 6 mm, and then to 8 mm diameter. The balloon was passed through a 6.4 mm dia Olympus bronchoscope.

Color Doppler ultrasound showed moderate ascites and right ovarian accessory mass. Abdominal aspiration was taken as bloody osmotic fluid, and pathological smears found adenocarcinoma cells. She was then given preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy: intraperitoneal perfusion (cisplatin 120 mg) and systemic chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 700 mg, pirarubicin 60 mg), every 3 weeks for 3 cycles.\nOn July 11, 2001, the patient underwent total uterine attachment, omentum, pelvic lymphadenectomy, and pelvic floor tumor reduction under general anesthesia. The postoperative examination was ovarian cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy was performed after surgery: intraperitoneal perfusion (cisplatin 120 mg) and systemic chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 700 mg, pirarubicin 60 mg), every 3 weeks for 3 cycles.\nThe patient was taken to the hospital because of the left breast mass on November 20, 2018. Physical examination showed that there was a hard mass in the left breast, which was not movable and painless, with a diameter of about 2 \u00d7 2 cm. The right breast and bilateral axillary fossa were normal. Molybdenum target showed a mass lesion in the lower quadrant of the left breast, which may be malignant.

She received a regular physical examination, showing good results without abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding or any other discomfort. The pregnancy was terminated through a cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation with a healthy neonate. During the operation, we found one case of a cervix uteri, right rudimentary horn and left unicornate uterus separately connected to the fallopian tube and ovary. This pregnancy occurred in the unicornate uterus. The fetus and placenta were delivered smoothly. The patient was expecting again four years later. She did not complain of any discomfort during gestation. Under close surveillance, she received a cesarean section at 38 weeks. A rudimentary horn pregnancy was diagnosed during the operation. The placenta was attached to the wall of the uterus and stripped by the obstetrician. Massaging the uterus was used to promote uterine contractions. The Apgar score of the newborn was 10. Menstruation accompanied by dysmenorrhea occurred 6 months after the second cesarean section with the same menstrual cycle and volume. The patient complained of gradually aggravated lower abdominal pain with low back pain one year after the second surgery.\nIn terms of the gynecological examination, we palpated an anterior uterus with a normal size and a hard mass with a diameter of 7 cm, a smooth surface, poor activity and tenderness.

Additional venous access and arterial line placement occurred concurrently while the correct placement of the endotracheal tube was confirmed by bronchoscopy. The placement was then reconfirmed after the patient was situated in the right lateral decubitus position. The left lung was isolated and deflated, and the surgeon proceeded to place ports to facilitate the robotic resection as follows: the sixth intercostal space in the anterior axillary line, the third intercostal space in the anterior axillary line, and the ninth intercostal space in the posterior axillary line. The surgical procedure continued uneventfully from an anesthesia perspective with level 7 and 10 lymph node dissections, extensive lysis of adhesions and pericardial and pleural fat to facilitate visualization, and a left lower lobectomy. Surgical blood loss was estimated at less than 50 cc. Chest tubes were placed through the sixth and ninth intercostal port incisions.

In addition, this vestibular mass was very painful, and it required manual reduction to allow for her to void. LUTS got progressively worse over the course of the two years. In addition to the dysuria, she had intermittent hematuria, frequency of every hour as well as nocturia 3 to 4 times per night. Her personal past medical history was only positive for a remote appendectomy and a caesarean section. The patient had been previously worked up by her obstetrician since the LUTS appeared after her caesarean delivery. She had repeated urine analyses and cultures that were negative. Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated the presence of two cystic lesions in the bladder of 2.5cm and 9mm in diameter. The kidneys did not show any hydronephrosis nor hydroureter.

She appeared to be immunocompetent with no history of recurrent infections or any other skin lesions. Her parents and siblings (3 brothers and 2 sisters) were all normal and healthy.

Upon examination, the central part of the face, i.e. the malar area and nose including the ala nasi, showed scattered annular papules and plaques of different sizes ranging from 0.3 to 2 cm. The lesions were asymptomatic and symmetrically distributed on both sides of the face (figs. , ). Routine laboratory tests were done and the results were within normal ranges. Multiple biopsies were taken from different lesions. The diagnosis was confirmed as DSAP, with a classic and very illustrative pathological picture (figs. \u2013).

She did not complain of an engorgement of the left breast, nipple discharge, or retraction. There was no family history of similar complaints. On examination, her vital signs were stable.

The mass itself was adherent to the chest wall although the overlying skin was not. The left breast had been lifted up by the mass and was not adherent to it. There was no palpable breast nodule, ulceration, nipple discharge, or retraction. There were no palpable lymph nodes. Breath sounds were equal and normal bilaterally. The systemic examination was unremarkable. Chest X-ray showed a diffuse opacification over the mid-lung field extending over to the lateral chest wall. Bronchovascular markings in the periphery were normal. A blood investigation revealed a raised lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase, positive C-reactive protein, and normal total counts. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the thorax showed evidence of irregular destruction and periosteal reaction involving the left 3rd rib ().

Odontoid fracture from the neck extending to the superior part of the corpus was seen in the cervical roentgenogram. Three-dimensional (3D) cervical spinal computed tomography revealed that the oblique odontoid fracture extending to the apex of the corpus was comminuted sagittal image [] and axial image []. Magnetic resonance imaging arose the suspicion of posterior longitudinal ligament rupture [], and showed that the atlantoaxial interval was about 6 mm. Dislocation was not reduced by closed traction.

    "original_text": "A 13-year-old male was evaluated for congenital webbing of the neck secondary to Noonan syndrome. The patient presented with characteristic features of pterygium colli with a low and laterally displaced nuchal hairline. Presurgical testing did not reveal any coagulation abnormalities. These patients can often have specific factor deficiency or platelet aggregation anomalies, but none were noted with this patient. Surgical treatment was outlined to address both the neck and hairline abnormalities.\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a prone position and the webbing was carefully marked from the mastoid to the acromion. A pinch test of the skin overlying the trapezius muscle was used to determine the excess (). A horizontal incision was marked perpendicular to the web to form a \u201cT.\u201d This incision was placed parallel to a crease in the anterolateral neck. The length of this limb (releasing incision) was determined from the midpoint of the web line to the palpated edge of the pinch test.\nA triangular flap whose apex was at the intersection of the limbs of the \u201cT\u201d was then marked. An equilateral triangle, with the limbs and base of the triangle measuring the same length as the releasing incision, was marked.

Birth weight was 1870 g and Apgar scores were 7 at 1 min and 8 at 5 min. Due to immediate respiratory distress, the infant was intubated and mechanically ventilated. One dose of surfactant was given and he was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. Caffeine was administered for apnea of prematurity, and ampicillin and amikacin were initiated for concern of neonatal sepsis due to preterm labor and delivery. Within hours, the infant became hypotensive requiring normal saline boluses and a dobutamine drip, prompting an increased concern for sepsis and the addition of cefepime. However, after 3 days, blood cultures were negative, and the clinical condition had improved. Therefore, the antibiotics were discontinued.\nOn the day of life three, a routine cranial ultrasound was found to be normal. Echocardiogram was also normal with no structural abnormalities. The initial cranial circumference was 31 cm, and the neurological examination after resolution of hypotension was normal with no focal findings. On the day of life six, significant abdominal distention occurred with pain elicited on examination. Necrotizing enterocolitis was suspected, so empiric intravenous vancomycin and meropenem were initiated. However, pneumatosis intestinalis and portal venous gas were not observed on serial abdominal X-rays, and blood cultures never isolated a pathogen. Due to clinical severity, 2 weeks of antimicrobial treatment was given with clinical improvement and enteral feedings by nasogastric tube were started.\nOn the 18th day of life, the cranial circumference suddenly increased 34 cm.

Left vertebral artery angiography demonstrated a 2.5 mm sized left side SCA aneurysm with a narrow neck (). Under general anesthesia, we coiled this aneurysm by using a 2 mm\u00d74 cm Microplex Hypersoft Coil V-trak system (MicroVention, California, USA) (). The most proximal part of the detachment zone protruded minimally into the basilar artery (BA) after detachment (). No thrombus formation was seen on angiogram.

In the ninth POD, she complained newly developed headache and dizziness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a small size acute infarction in the left side SCA territory, but there is no evidence of recanalization of the aneurysm or recurred subarachnoid hemorrhage. Left side SCA was intact on MR angiography (MRA), however, fluoroscopy revealed unraveling of proximal coil loop and herniation into the BA (). Herniated coil loop and remaining coil mesh were pulsating together with arterial pulsation. We initially considered stent placement to trap the coil loop, but decided to wait because she was stable and BA and its branches were intact on MRA. Oral aspirin 100 mg per day was given. During following three days, we repeated fluoroscopy and ascertained no further herniation of the coil loop.\nShe was discharged and we repeated fluoroscopy weekly. Oral aspirin was maintained during follow-up period. In the 23rd POD, the shape of the herniated coil loop was changed and the herniated coil was spontaneously repositioned into the probable left side SCA on fluoroscopy (). We considered that this configuration was more stable than previous one.

She had no prior history of alcohol consumption and she was a nonsmoker.\nThe patient first experienced symptoms of persistent diarrhea and abdominal pain in 1994. In 1997, she underwent comprehensive testing including stool cultures, gastroscopy, colonoscopy, and small bowel biopsy and numerous blood tests, which ultimately confirmed very active small bowel CD and a small patch of colitis at her terminal ilium, palpable hemorrhoids, lactase deficiency, and shallow duodenal ulcers. Thorough treatment of the duodenal ulcers and a lactose-free diet made no difference to her complaints. Stools were greater than 10 per day without medication and often 1 or 2 at night.\nCD was managed with pharmacologic therapy mesalazine (500 mg Bid Po), prednisone (75 mg Qd Po to induce remission and 5 mg Qd Po as ongoing maintenance dosage), and azathioprine (50 mg Bid Po). Although medication helped the patient to return to work and resume her daily life, the condition was not well controlled. She continued to suffer from blockages and symptoms of pain and vomiting, for which she required frequent hospitalization and in 2005 she underwent a bowel resection. Pharmacologic therapy was continued after surgery and helped to maintain symptom remission; however, the patient continued to experience blockages, accompanied symptoms of pain and vomiting, which occurred on a monthly frequency.
