The intraoral examination showed no pathologic signs in the related soft tissue. The buccal vestibule of relevant tooth was also painless to palpation. The tooth had a mobility of 2+ and was painful to percussion.\nPeriodontal examination showed the presence of a periodontal pocket with the probing depth of 4mm. The crown of the affected tooth was intact; however it displayed a lingual pit above the cingulum.

She underwent a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection with total omentectomy, followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. In 2012, the patient was re-examined and found to have newly developed seeding metastases in the perihepatic space, omentum, perirectal area, diaphragm, and external iliac chain. Her CA-125 level had increased to 51.06 U/ml. Following a debulking operation, she received 9 additional cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with the previously described regimen. Subsequently, the CA-125 levels were tested every 3 months.

    "original_text": "We describe the case of a 26-year-old man who suffered a severe cranio-facial trauma in 2004, caused by a car accident. Consequently, the patient presented subarachnoid hemorrhage and panfacial fracture. After an initial assessment in the emergency services, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit of our Hospital. Here, the profesionals involved in the case decided that the subarachnoid hemorrhage did not require surgical treatment. Notwithstanding the above, the patient needed close monitoring in the intensive care unit for several week. Therefore, in the light of these developments, we also adopted a conservative attitude with regard to the facial trauma. In fact, during ICU stay the patient presented an unstable neurological status. Due to all this, we decided to reassess the patient in a year with the aim to estimate the fallout of trauma. Finally, when the patient came to the outpatient department of Maxilofacial unit we could observe the typical signs of CCF. Indeed, the physical examination of the patient showed zygomatic-orbital dystopia with pulsating exophthalmos and chemosis of the right eye. Moreover, the patient referred decreased vision in this eye. In addition to all this, we note the presence of an orbital murmur. This finding made us suspect the existence of CCF secondary to trauma. Bearing this in mind, a craniofacial CT scan was performed in order to confirm the diagnosis. As expected, this test showed the presence of CCF draining into the right superior ophthalmic vein. Thus, we decided to present the case to the interventional neuroradiology service of our Hospital.\nAfter evaluating the case, Neuroradiologists decided to carry out a bilateral arteriography of the head. This test also proved the existence of a direct posttraumatic CCF. In addition, this test also showed that the fistula presented high blood flow, with significant impact on intracranial hemodynamics (Fig. ). Against this backdrop, neuroradiologists decided to treat the patient with endovascular approach. More in",

On detailed history elicitation, the patient stated that the rash was asymptomatic to begin with. It started on the right forearm, and later became generalized. The patient applied some native medications and developed generalized itching and presented with a picture of contact irritant dermatitis in the form of papules, vesicles, and scaling, all over the body. The patient was treated for the same with a combination of topical steroids and antihistamines. The patient had little symptomatic relief with this. The patient's rash was persistent in the form of macules, papules, and scaling. A thorough examination revealed the presence of few lesions on the genitalia mainly on the labia majora [], which were flat topped papules and the patient also had a mucous patch over the hard palate []. Thus, secondary syphilis was strongly suspected and the patient was subjected for Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) testing. The VDRL testing was non-reactive. As the suspicion of secondary syphilis was high, we conducted a detailed examination of the patient's husband. He denied a history of any sexual exposure and any genital lesion, but gave a history of intermittent urethral discharge. The rest of the physical examination was found to be within normal limits. He was also tested for VDRL and was found to be positive. Therefore, we requested for repeat VDRL test, with higher dilution and it was reactive with 1 : 512 dilution.

At the time of the diagnosis, he presented with a painful and progressively enlarging mass over the left ankle which restricted any weight bearing on the affected leg. A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the lower extremities revealed a well-defined multicystic mass arising from the distal metaphyseal region of the left fibula (Figure ).\nThe mass was subjected to a core needle biopsy and subsequent histological evaluation of the biopsy specimen revealed a collection of hypercellular, spindle polygonal cells with an abundance of osteoclastic giant cells; which provided the tissue diagnosis of an osteosarcoma. Following this diagnosis, the patient presented to our clinical setting for further management. He underwent surgical excision of the tumor followed by the placement of a vascularized fibular bone graft. Following the surgery, the patient was provided with a total of 32 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin, methotrexate, and leucovorin. He subsequently went into remission. After six months, he presented again with complaints of resurfaced pain in his left leg. A bone scan was performed due to the suspicion of tumor recurrence, which revealed an intense and irregular uptake in the distal segment of the left leg; confirming the reemergence of his primary pathology. The bone scan also showed areas of bony metastasis (evidenced by multiple areas of moderate tracer uptake) in the left maxilla, left parietal bone of the skull and greater trochanter of the left femur (figure ).\nFurther assessment with a contrast-enhanced high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs revealed multiple soft tissue nodules of differing sizes in both lungs. Some of these nodules were pleural-based and some showed internal cavitations (with the largest in the right upper lobe measuring 1.8 cm in diameter), which were suggestive of a metastatic disease process (Figure , Figure ).",

Investigations revealed a negative autoimmune screen, including a negative ANCA. She proceeded to a renal biopsy, which demonstrated diffuse segmental sclerosis in all glomeruli, marked tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis and chronic inflammation. Small vessels were constricted with some fibrinoid change in the walls. This was interpreted as being due to a pauci-immune ANCA-negative vasculitis. She received 3 months of cyclophosphamide and prednisolone, followed by azathioprine and prednisolone.\nFollowing a rapid and progressive decline in kidney function, she was established on peritoneal dialysis. Two years later she underwent a living unrelated donor renal transplant, achieving excellent renal function with creatinine between 90 and 100 \u03bcmol/l within 2 weeks after transplantation.

There were multiple displaced costal fractures on the right side with lung contusion and minimal pneumothorax that did not need drainage.\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) while waiting for surgical stabilization of the fracture. During the 6-hour preoperative stay in the ICU, the patient was stable and awake. The patient was operated upon in general anesthesia. Intramedullary insertion of a femur nail was attempted but was quite difficult to achieve. A great deal of manipulation and drilling was required in order to insert a 400 mm nail. The patient was stable peroperatively.\nThree hours later he was transported back to the ICU, still intubated and on 0.5 fraction inspired oxygen (FiO2). A wake-up test was performed at arrival to the ICU, and the patient seemed to be awake but suffered from pain. The patient deteriorated during the next 6 hours. He developed a high fever, and his oxygen saturation decreased. A new chest X-ray showed 2.5 cm pneumothorax that was drained successfully, but saturation continued to decrease during the next 6 hours. His oxygen demand increased ending up at 0.9 FiO2.

Examination showed a clean, shallow ulcer 2x3 cm with surrounding hyperpigmentation from stasis dermatitis; without discharges or signs of infection. Upon assessment, the pain was deemed to be due to chronic venous insufficiency. It improved with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and she was subsequently discharged from the emergency department.

She denied fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms. Physical examination revealed erythema around the ulcer with increased warmth and mild tenderness. CT of her left lower extremity with intravenous (IV) contrast revealed subcutaneous edema and fascial thickening most prominently at the medial aspect of the lower extremity, compatible with cellulitis in the absence of a drainable fluid collection (). The patient was treated with IV ampicillin/sulbactam.

She was otherwise healthy apart from obesity. Urodynamics confirmed poor detrusor contractility and high post voiding residual in which straining was not adequate to empty properly. She was started on self-clean intermittent catheterization (CIC). On follow up, she was happy and content. The recurrent UTIs subsided. In November 2016, she presented for stating that performing CIC was not convenient since she has started college and wanted to seek an alternative treatment modality, so we agreed to proceed with SNM. In April 2017, she underwent stage I SNM with InterStim device. There was >90% improvement and thus stage II was carried out. In February 2020, she presented having noticed a piece of the hardware wire eroding through the skin with minimal discomfort. Nevertheless, the device was functioning well with spontaneous voiding. The patient noted that she underwent sleeve gastrectomy in 2018 and lost ~70 kg. Examination revealed that part of the wire had eroded through the skin with clear exist and entry points, but no signs of induration or infection noted (). She was told this necessitates full explantation and an implementation of a new device. Patient was reluctant to proceed as the system was otherwise functioning perfect and was wondering if a less invasive measure can be undertaken. Since there were no signs of infection locally or systematically and after obtaining an informed consent discussing risks and benefits, we made a decision to proceed with a salvage procedure in 9 September 2020. The patient received 2 g of ceftriaxone prophylactically. Prior to incision, the operative field and wire were cleansed thoroughly with chlorhexidine and alcohol solution for 10 min. A small incision was made underneath the exposed wire revealing a clean healthy tissue (). Swap was sent for culture",

This crack produced a sound that was also heard by his partner on the other side of the room. The patient subsequently experienced a spontaneous coughing fit. During the history, he described pain over the thyroid cartilage, odynophagia, pain on moving his neck and a hoarse voice. He also described the sensation of having something flapping in his throat while breathing. He denied any recent history of throat trauma and had no other ENT complaints. On examination he had a tender thyroid cartilage with palpable crepitus of the thyroid cartilage when balloting it between the fingers of each hand. There was no palpable surgical crepitus of the soft tissues of the neck and no lymphadenopathy. Flexible fibre optic nasendoscopy allowed dynamic and real-time evaluation of the vocal cords and revealed significant bruising and swelling of the right arytenoid cartilage.

On physical examination, conjunctiva was found to be pale. Blood pressure was measured as 100/70 mmHg, heart rate was 110/min., and measured body temperature was within normal limits. On abdominal examination, a 5 cm sized mobile mass was palpated in the right lower quadrant. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL and hematocrit of 27.5%, while white blood cell and platelet counts were normal. Since abdominal ultrasonographic (USG) examination demonstrated a hypoechoic right lower quadrant lesion with a size of about 6 cm which had vascularisation on color Doppler ultrasonographic examination, the patient was referred to hematology outpatient clinic for the investigation of the etiology of intraabdominal lymphadenopathy and anemia. The patient in whom performed endoscopic interventions detected nothing pathological underwent computed tomography (CT) which demonstrated semisolid mass lesions with lobulated margins and necrotic centers, which were 3 cm in the middle of the abdomen, 5 cm in the left upper quadrant, 5 cm in mesentery adjacent to superior mesenteric artery, and 6 cm in the right lower quadrant (). Tumor markers were found to be normal. The patient was referred to the department of general surgery with the diagnosis of intraabdominal mass.\nThe patient was taken to operation after necessary preoperative arrangements were made.

Investigations had shown Chiari formation and syringomyelia. The first operation involved foramen magnum bone and dural decompression and C1 and C2 laminectomy. The patient did not improve following the surgery and had persistent disabling complaints. For these complaints, a right-sided ventriculoperitoneal shunt was performed 6 months following the initial surgery. However, the symptoms of the patients showed no respite and he started worsening. He was then subjected to repeat foramen magnum decompression and widening of the bone decompression and a syringo-subarachnoid shunt placement. Symptoms continued to progress. A syringo-subarachnoid shunt block was suspected, and a left-sided ventriculoperitoneal shunt was performed. However, the patient did not improve after the surgery and his clinical condition continued to deteriorate. He developed weakness and stiffness of all four limbs and was unable to stand or sit even with support. In addition, he developed change in his quality and tone of his voice. He developed symptoms of difficulty in swallowing with nasal regurgitation of food, more for liquids than for solids. He started experiencing apneic spells, which made him get up at night, and after some deep breaths, he was able to sleep again. When brought to us, the patient had marked spastic quadriparesis.

The patient complained of extensive gingival swelling along with a foul odor, bleeding and fetid discharge from gums. She also complained of continuous mild pain and a feeling of heaviness in both upper and lower jaws. Medical history revealed that the patient was taking treatment for hypertension and was on Amlodipine 10 mg, once a day for the past 2 years. There was no history of intake of any other drugs. The patient gave a history of progressive gingival enlargement since the commencement of amlodipine therapy.\nOn intra-oral examination, a generalized and firm overgrowth of the gingiva was found throughout the maxilla and mandible particularly at the buccal side.

Her chief complaint was a severe pain of the right elbow that was apparently swollen. Active and passive motion of the elbow was not possible due to pain, but no neurovascular deficits were observed in her left arm. She had a history of dwarfism and had been undergoing growth hormone replacement therapy since she was 7 years old at our hospital. She also had a history of developmental dysplasia of the left hip and a habitual patellar dislocation of the right knee.

She was a housewife and had no history of tobacco smoking or consuming alcohol. A physical examination at the time of presentation was not significant except for right costovertebral angle tenderness. Her heart rate was 96 beats per minute and blood pressure was 155/90 mmHg. The findings of laboratory tests, which were complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, and urine analysis, were within normal range and they did not help us find the etiology of her right flank pain. Abdominal screening with computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass on her right kidney, which was considered a primary renal cell carcinoma and she underwent a right nephrectomy. Unexpectedly, PTC metastasis was diagnosed from demonstrative histopathological findings, such as positive immunoperoxidase staining for thyroglobulin (Tg). After further examinations of her thyroid and neck with ultrasonography (USG), a total thyroidectomy was performed. Pathological examination of thyroid tissue revealed a 5 cm tumor with capsular invasion and a strong positive immunoperoxidase staining of cytokeratin-19, HBME-1, and galectin-3. She was diagnosed as having metastatic PTC. Orally administered levothyroxine 75 mcg daily was initiated in addition to the metformin 1000 mg twice daily and amlodipine 10 mg daily treatments she received prior to PTC diagnosis. Postoperative serum Tg was above 300 ng/ml and anti-Tg was negative. Afterward, she was screened with unenhanced thoracic CT and skeletal scintigraphy. They revealed bilateral multiple nodules in her lungs and bone metastasis on T10 vertebra and right sacroiliac joint.

    "original_text": "A 34-year-old man was referred for an evaluation of presumptive bladder cancer diagnosed on gross hematuria evaluation. The patient reported a sudden onset of lower urinary tract discomfort and burning associated with a mild end-stream discoloration of his urine. These symptoms progressed, and he was empirically treated for a bacterial urinary tract infection by his primary physician with two separate courses of antibiotics. His dysuria worsened and he noted the onset of severe urinary frequency associated with bloody urine and small clots. At this point, he was referred to a urologist who performed a standard hematuria workup including urinalysis, cystoscopy and CT of the abdomen and pelvis. Imaging was unremarkable for genitourinary pathology except for haziness of the perivesicular fat, which was suggestive of an inflammatory or infiltrative process. Urinalysis was positive for hemoglobin and a urine culture was negative.

She was admitted to the gynecology unit of a tertiary care hospital with a history of heavy menstrual periods. She was meticulously examined and evaluated by the attending physicians in the gynecology department, and no evidence of any gynecological abnormalities was found. She was enquired about the systemic bleeding disorder. Interestingly, the patient had a history of easy bruising and purpura on minor trauma since childhood. On examination, there was pallor, multiple petechiae, purpura throughout the body. For the next step of management, her clotting profile was ordered. She had a deranged clotting profile, i.e., prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) but normal bleeding time (Tables , ). Her platelets count was also normal.\nOur primary differential diagnosis was clotting factor disorder. Her clotting factors VIII and IX were normal that ruled out hemophilia A and B, respectively.

To the best of our knowledge, there is only one reported case of this on a male, which dates back to 1984. Physical examination revealed an irregular mass in the lateral upper quadrant of the right breast measuring approximately 2\u00d71 cm, but no mass was detectable in either axilla. There were no other associated symptoms bar a slight uncomfortable feeling on the right chest wall. Breast ultrasound showed an ill-defined mass (2.1\u00d71.3 cm) with non-uniform internal echo. No other abnormalities were found through general examinations including computed tomography scan of head and neck, and ultrasound scan of chest and abdomen. The patient had a prior smoking history of 50 packs a month.\nA preoperative biopsy of the mass was not considered. However, this parameter did not change management of the mass, because there was no evidence that the patient required neoadjuvant therapy, even though he was diagnosed with small-cell carcinoma (SMCC) of the breast before surgery. Considering the malignancy of the mass, we conducted a simple radical mastectomy and level I lymphadenectomy, without sentinel lymph node identification. The resection specimen consisted of a round fragment of skin and palpable mass, and underlying fatty soft tissue measuring 15 cm in total. Sectioning showed a firm white mass beneath the skin measuring approximately 2\u00d71 cm. Two of nine lymph nodes were metastatic. The tumor had invaded striated muscle. Histopathological examination demonstrated that the tumor was predominantly composed of small cells with hyperchromatic nuclei demonstrating chromatin diffusion and resembling \u201coat cell\u201d carcinoma of lung.

The patient's childhood and adolescent development was normal. He was a good student and an active soccer player in high school. His social skills were standard, and he had no family history of mental illness. When he was 23 years old and a fourth year university student, he became convinced that he was being observed and he withdrew from social activities. His parents brought him to a psychiatric hospital, and he was diagnosed with schizophrenia according to DSM-IV-TR (). The prescribed medication worked well and he was able to graduate from university at 27 years old. After graduating, he worked part time in a convenience store or at a nursery for several years. He then started to work at a distribution business under a handicapped employment program. His father committed suicide 3 years before he first presented at our hospital and a friend also died from a sickness. Because his auditory hallucinations repeatedly told him that he was responsible for their deaths, he could not stop blaming himself for their passing, in spite of his mother and brother telling him that he was not responsible. He was pessimistic about his future partly because he was able to earn only a meager income. In order to increase his income, he started a second part-time job at a supermarket in addition to his distribution job. He slept less and felt the accumulation of fatigue.

After the initial operation, he was prescribed 5-aminosalicylic acid and home parenteral nutrition. He did not accept a recommended colonoscopy examination, owing to anal pain.\nIn August 2008, the patient complained of difficulty in defecation and consulted a physician at our hospital. A colonoscopy examination showed a pedunculated rectal polyp, 4 cm in diameter (Figure ) and an anal stricture due to proctitis. Histological examination of the biopsy from the lesion showed an adenoma; no dysplasia was detected around the polyp. A transanal resection of the polyp was performed for treatment and final diagnosis (Figure ). The pathological findings revealed that the polyp was an adenoma with well-differentiated adenocarcinoma without lymphatic or vascular invasion with negative margin of cut end, and that no dysplasia or inflammation was present around the polyp; thus, the polyp was diagnosed as a sporadic adenocarcinoma in an adenoma, rather than a colitis-associated adenocarcinoma (Figure ). Consistent with the results of the biopsy, an endoscopic exploration showed no dysplasia in the rectal mucosa, and immunohistochemistry showed no p53-staining of the crypt base. These findings were not consistent with colitis-associated CRC (Figure ).

She had poor oral hygiene and a low socioeconomic status. Her medical history was unremarkable. On examination, she presented with fever and sweating, along with marked conjunctival pallor. There was a continuous murmur with thrill over the pulmonary area and a diastolic murmur over the aortic area. Chest radiography showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and mild cardiomegaly (). On a chest computed tomography (CT), pulmonary edema and multiple cavitary lesions, which were surrounded by ground-glass opacity suspecting septic emboli, were observed (). Splenic infarction was detected on the abdominal CT (). No brain lesion of septic emboli was described in the brain magnetic resonance imaging. Laboratory investigations were remarkable for anemia and leukocytosis. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed severe aortic valve regurgitation, with highly mobile masses on the right and the left coronary cusps, which were irregularly thickened and prolapsed. Continuous shunt flow, from the descending aorta to the pulmonary artery, was noted (). The defect size was 6 mm, and the amount of shunt flow was too small to measure. Pulmonary hypertension was not suspected because the pressure and the morphology of the right ventricle remained normal. Other cardiac valves, including the pulmonary valve, were normal, and no other vegetation was observed on the chambers and the great vessels.\nEmergency operation was carried out due to highly mobile vegetation and severe aortic regurgitation. The patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was isolated and identified primarily. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was commenced with aortic and bicaval cannulation.

Upon further questioning, he recalled that he fell from a tractor while working in his farm 2 months earlier and sustained blunt trauma to his abdomen for which his initial evaluation revealed no serious injury except some bruises.\nOn physical examination, the patient was alert and responsive, his vital signs were stable, and dry mucous membranes were noted. Abdominal examination revealed distended abdomen, increased bowel sounds, and generalized tenderness without rebound tenderness, guarding, or any other significant findings. Fluid resuscitation and nasogastric (NG) tube insertion were initiated for a patient with a suspected diagnosis of intestinal obstruction. His initial lab tests on admission were normal except a mild increase in amylase level (Table ).\nThe patient underwent an upright abdominal X-ray and chest X-ray. On the abdominal X-ray, multiple air-fluid levels were observed (Fig. ). Both chest and abdominal X-rays revealed the niveau formation of the small intestine on the right side above the liver and right hemidiaphragm (Fig. ). Abdominal sonography reported the presence of dilated intestinal loops. Further evaluation with CT scan confirmed the presence of a few small intestinal loops behind the liver and also in the chest through a rupture in the right hemidiaphragm (Fig. ).\nThe patient opted for the surgery and exploratory laparotomy was performed.

Urinalysis revealed leukocyturia (133/HP) and hematuria (25/HP). The patient was sexually active and was initially diagnosed with uncomplicated urinary infection. The patient received norfloxacin for 1 week. However, the symptoms remained unrelieved, and she was consulted for further examinations in the local hospital. As urinary ultrasound indicated thickening of the bladder anterior wall, further an abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was carried out, through which more lesions were found, and malignant changes were highly suspicious (Fig. a). The cystoscopy from the primary hospital identified extensive basal mass in the bladder walls and the histological results of tissue biopsy revealed non-invasive urothelial carcinoma. Radical cystectomy was recommended by the provincial hospital owing to the extensive involvement of the bladder.\nThe patient considered the possibility of radical cystectomy to be devastating and presented at our hospital for consultation. A review of the patient's medical history revealed that the patient had undergone a Chinese IUD (Copper-bearing) placement 11 years ago after the birth of her first child. However, she became pregnant and underwent a painless induced abortion 3 months later, and the routine gynecological sonography revealed no IUD. After the following 2 accidental pregnancies, she underwent another IUD placement which worked well. Considering the above-mentioned history, our CT scanning revealed that a portion of one of the two implanted IUDs had migrated beyond the right uterus wall and was adjacent to the bladder (Fig. b). To verify the pathological diagnosis, diagnostic transurethral resection was performed (Fig. c, d), including the right, top, and trigone bladder wall, whereas histological examinations reported granuloma of the bladder right and top wall and glandular cystitis of the triangle wall. The result of the pathological analysis at the local hospital was sent to our pathology department for final confirmation, while result",

She reported clomiphene citrate use and was 8 weeks 6 days pregnant by last menstrual period. She had a benign pelvic examination. Her beta hCG level was 39,745 mIU/mL. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed an eccentrically located gestational sac with 3 mm of myometrium in the left posterior cornu. A yolk sac and embryo with a crown-rump length (CRL) of 6.2 mm were also seen but no fetal cardiac activity was demonstrated. The diagnoses of probable early pregnancy loss (EPL) and interstitial location of the pregnancy were explained to the patient. As this was a highly desired pregnancy, she declined intervention and elected for expectant out-patient management. Subsequent follow-up ultrasound 48 hours later demonstrated a CRL of 7 mm without cardiac activity and 3 mm of myometrium in the thickness area, posterior to the sac. The diagnosis of EPL of an interstitial pregnancy based on CRL >7 mm without fetal cardiac activity was discussed with her. She was counseled on all available management options including expectant and medical management. She elected to proceed with surgical management and gave consent for the following potential procedures: examination under anesthesia, dilation and curettage (D&C), diagnostic laparoscopy, possible operative laparoscopy, possible exploratory laparotomy, possible cornual wedge resection with salpingectomy, and possible hysterectomy. She was informed that D&C is not the standard treatment modality for interstitial pregnancies. However, after a family planning specialist and a radiologist reviewed her images, it was felt that the inferior aspect of the sac might be accessible with a cannula angled towards the cornua. Since this was an EPL, pre-procedure methotrexate was not offered because there was no evidence indicating that it would facilitate removal.\nLaparoscopic confirmation of her interstitial pregnancy was performed first",

Pain was assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS) at 8/10 and was much increased with walking, which was limited to a short distance and required the use of a crutch. CT revealed extensive osteolytic metastasis involving almost all the right iliac wing and acetabulum together with the right sacral wing (\n). Bone scintigraphy and 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed multiple other skeletal lesions. Biopsy of the pelvic bone revealed an epidermoid carcinoma. A vesical biopsy gave negative results, but because the prostate was clinically enlarged and the prostate-specific antigen level was increased (5 ng/mL), a prostate biopsy was performed and revealed epidermoid urothelial tumoral infiltration. The patient received a first course of systemic chemotherapy with carboplatine (AUC 5) and paclitaxel (80 mg/m2), a first infusion of bisphosphonates (4 mg acid zoledronic), and analgesics.\nGiven the pending risk of fracture and severe pain, the decision was taken in a multidisciplinary consultation to stabilize the pelvis before continuing systemic treatment and to attempt percutaneous osteosynthesis rather than open surgery because of the comorbidities and risk of complications with extensive surgery. Extension of the bone destruction to the sacral wing and anterior acetabulum precluded the use of the locked and perforated nail recently described to reinforce the arcuateiliac line []. Therefore, a combination of double screwing and cementoplasty was planned to restore weight-bearing force transmission from the spine to the hip.\nThe first step of the procedure consisted of percutaneous double osteosynthesis with two perpendicular screws. The optimal position and dimensions of the screws were determined from 3D CT-scan reformations of the pelvis. The percutaneous osteosynthesis procedure was performed under CT guidance with the patient in the prone position under general anesthesia. Skin incisions were made below the posterior superior iliac spine and laterally",
