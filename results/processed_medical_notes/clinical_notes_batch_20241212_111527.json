She reported two recent ischemic stroke hospitalizations over the preceding 3 months and that she was fully compliant with her ongoing post-stroke medical management. Initial non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head was negative for hemorrhage or evidence of acute ischemia, but did demonstrate regions consistent with her prior infarcts in the right fronto-parietal regions. Intravenous thrombolytic therapy was not administered secondary to timing and improving symptoms. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 8 with left-sided hemiparesis and paresthesias involving face, arm, and leg.\nFurther review of her prior history revealed that approximately 3 months before her current presentation she had experienced acute onset of left lower extremity weakness with imaging demonstrating scattered ischemic infarcts in the right frontal lobe. At that time, aspirin and statin therapy was initiated and she was transferred to a rehabilitation facility. Two weeks later, while at the rehabilitation facility, she experienced acute left facial droop and left upper extremity weakness with no sensory loss or neglect with imaging demonstrating new scattered ischemic infarcts involving the right fronto-parietal region and corona radiata. Computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the head demonstrated marked irregularity of the right A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA). There was also calcification in various bilateral cerebral vessels without flow-limiting stenosis. Intracranial atherosclerosis was hypothesized as the likely culprit of her recurrent strokes and dual anti-platelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel was initiated; she continued on her statin. After a short course of rehabilitation she was discharged home. She then presented to our facility approximately three months after the initial stroke.\nDuring her hospitalization in our facility, work-up revealed a hemoglobin A1C of 4.7% and a LDL",

Two years ago, she was diagnosed to have congenital heart disease because of heart failure which occurred at her fist pregnancy. As a result, she had to have an abortion at 20 weeks\u2019 gestation. But she refused to receive any treatment. She said that she was asymptomatic except for mild cyanosis before getting pregnant. This was her second pregnancy. She said she was uncomfortable on the left lateral position during late pregnancy this time. Physical examination indicated cyanosis, orthopnea and acropachy. Temperature was 36.6 centigrade, blood pressure was 115/60 mmHg, heart rate was 99 per minute, and pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 75 % when she inhaled air. Electrocardiogram showed incomplete right bundle branch block. Chest radiograph revealed bilateral patch shadows, cardiac enlargement and bulging of pulmonary artery segment. Echocardiography of the mother showed: The diameter of the right atria and right ventricular were 55 cm and 30 cm separately; the diameter of the left atria and left ventricular were normal; the aorta and pulmonary artery were parallel without enlargement; the aorta ridded on ventricular septum, 80 % of the aorta was from right ventricular; there was a 26 mm ventricular septum defect under aorta; there was a left to right shunt between left and right ventricles was detected, the max velocity was 1.6 m/s; there was absence of fibrous joint between anterior mitral valve leaflet and posterior wall of aorta; the ejection fraction of the left ventricle was 58 %. The diagnosis of the echocardiography was DORV (subaortic ventricular septal defect),mild reflux of pulmonary valve and contraction function of left ventricle was normal (Fig. ).

On slit lamp examination, there was no conjunctival infection, the anterior chamber was normal, and there was mild cataract without significant refractive error in both eyes. There were trace cells visible in the anterior vitreous of both eyes. Optic disc was pink bilaterally with no atrophic changes. Foveal reflex was significantly reduced bilaterally.

He complained of continuous dull aching pain. There was no history of referred pain, dysuria, or hematuria. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a right renal mass in favor of hydronephrosis. Intravenous urography showed a right nonvisualized kidney with a staghorn stone and multiple secondary calculi. Computed tomography scan showed gross hydronephrosis of the right kidney, two calculi and the ureter was dilated up to the level of iliac vessels. With the provisional diagnosis of hydronephrosis secondary to urolithiasis, the patient was subjected to right nephrectomy. Peroperatively, the right kidney appeared like a cystic mass, from which 4 l of mucoid material was drained. Staghorn calculi measuring 7 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 cm was found in the pelvis. Multiple calculi were also removed along with the mucoid substance.\nGrossly, the kidney was markedly enlarged and measured 16 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 10 cm. The capsule could easily be peeled out. The entire kidney was replaced by a cystic mass consisting of multiple cysts filled with mucoid material and gelatinous solid areas. Papillary excrescences were seen in some of the cysts. The cortex was markedly thinned out []. The ureter measured 1.5 cm in length. The lumen appeared dilated and filled with mucus. However, no growth or papillary excrescences were seen in the entire length of the ureter.\nHistological examination of the tumor showed glands, cysts, and papillae lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelium with hyperchromatic nuclei and vacuolated cytoplasm.

He had undergone a routine CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis for disease progression two days prior to admission, which revealed a massive pneumoperitoneum (Figures , ). The ominous imaging prompted his admission to the hospital. On presentation to the emergency department, he was in no distress with a blood pressure of 126/85 mm Hg, pulse rate of 93 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 36.9\u00b0 C. Physical examination was significant for marked abdominal distension with a benign non-peritonitic exam and mild tenderness on palpation. Laboratory tests were unremarkable, except for a white blood cell count of 10.5 x 103/uL with neutrophil predominance (83%). A repeat CT scan showed patent biliary and duodenal stents without a definite source of perforation; however, three suspicious locations were noted by the radiologist containing small foci of free air adjacent to the bowel.\nGiven the initial concern for perforated viscus, the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals. He was managed conservatively with intravenous hydration and strict bowel rest. He remained hemodynamically stable and non-septic throughout his hospitalization and continued to have flatus and intact gastrointestinal function. General surgery recommended no acute surgical intervention. In a few days, he was started on a clear liquid diet which he tolerated well.

He also complained of constipation, malaise, and body weight loss of 10 kg in 1.5 years. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a tumor measuring 80 mm in maximum diameter on the anterior wall of the lower rectum and several enlarged regional nodes (Fig. ). No distant metastases were found. Colonoscopic examination revealed a large submucosal tumor on the anterior wall of the rectum just above the dentate line (Fig. ). Core needle biopsy of the tumor revealed bundles of spindle cells with positive immunohistochemical staining for c-kit antigen (CD117) and CD34, but negative for other differentiation markers such as desmin and S-100 protein (Fig. , ). The immunohistochemical findings led to the diagnosis of a rectal GIST. Neoadjuvant imatinib treatment (400 mg/day) was introduced, and soon after initiation, anal pain was relieved. MRI after 1 month of treatment showed marked shrinkage of the tumor to 52 mm, as well as the lymph nodes. After treatment for 3 and 6 months, the tumor decreased to 44 and 37 mm, respectively (Fig. ). CT examination revealed no distant metastases. As a result of the dramatic tumor shrinkage with neoadjuvant treatment and almost maximum tumor response, we decided to operate at this point. The adverse effect of imatinib was fatigue.\nAfter 7 months treatment with imatinib, the patient underwent laparoscopic low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision, coloanal anastomosis, and diverting ileostomy.

    "cleaned_text": "a 46-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of a 2-month history of anal pain and hematochezia. he also complained of constipation, malaise, and body weight loss of 10 kg in 1.5 years. computed tomography (ct) and magnetic resonance imaging (mri) demonstrated a tumor measuring 80 mm in maximum diameter on the anterior wall of the lower rectum and several enlarged regional nodes (fig. ). no distant metastases were found. colonoscopic examination revealed a large submucosal tumor on the anterior wall of the rectum just above the dentate line (fig. ). core needle biopsy of the tumor revealed bundles of spindle cells with positive immunohistochemical staining for c-kit antigen (cd117) and cd34, but negative for other differentiation markers such as desmin and s-100 protein (fig. , ). the immunohistochemical findings led to the diagnosis of a rectal gist. neoadjuvant imatinib treatment (400 mg/day) was introduced, and soon after initiation, anal pain was relieved. mri after 1 month of treatment showed marked shrinkage of the tumor to 52 mm, as well as the lymph nodes. after treatment for 3 and 6 months, the tumor decreased to 44 and 37 mm, respectively (fig. ). ct examination revealed no distant metastases. as a result of the dramatic tumor shrinkage with neoadjuvant treatment and almost maximum tumor response, we decided to operate at this point. the adverse effect of imatinib was fatigue.\nafter 7 months treatment with imatinib, the patient underwent laparoscopic low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision, coloanal anastomosis, and diverting ileostomy. imatinib treatment was stopped 3 days before surgery. gross appearance of the specimen showed a submucosal tumor measuring 43 \u00d7 35 mm, with a 10-mm distal resection margin (fig. , ). histological examinations revealed that the tumor spread within muscularis propria and protruded into submucosal layer in its anal side, with negative resection margins, and demonstrated an excellent response to imatinib with almost complete tumor",

    "original_text": "A 28-month-old boy was transferred to our emergency department from a local hospital in assisted ventilation for a respiratory insufficiency in June 2009. MRI performed during diagnostic work up revealed a bulky mass with cystic component extending from medulla into cervical spinal cord to C5 and dislocating the pons, the floor of the IV ventricle, the cerebellar vermis and tonsils (Figure A). As gross total resection (GTR) was not considered feasible, surgical decompression and a biopsy of the exophitic portion of the lesion were performed revealing a LGG with features compatible with PA. Polysomnographic exam revealed a relevant number of episodes of oxygen desaturation >4% of central origin. Tracheotomy was performed and chemotherapy according to the SIOP LGG 2004 protocol started. Unfortunately, the tumour did not respond to treatment showing a gradual clinical and radiological progression with worsening of the nocturnal episodes of desaturation and progressive increase of size of both a cystic portion of the lesion and the solid component (Figure B). A second surgery was performed in 2012 in order to reduce the cystic component of the lesion. The histological examination of the residual lesion showed the presence, in addition to the glial component, of mature ganglion cells, leading to a diagnosis of ganglioglioma (GG) (Figure ) with classical morphology, i.e. neoplastic astrocytes and ganglion cells with dysplastic, binucleated neuron, embedded in tissue with eosinhophilic granular body and lymphocytic intratumoral infiltrate. MRI 3 months after surgery revealed a new disease progression with evidence of multicystic component in the brainstem and cervical spine, which appeared to be related to syringobulbia and syringomyelia secondary to cerebrospinal fluid outflow impairment (Figure C). In order to improve local control of the cystic component, a new attempt of debulking was performed; intraoperative brainstem monitoring showed functional responses in the context of the solid component of the tumour and further resection was then abandoned.

She noted that her visual disturbances were associated with a unilateral temporal headache and nausea without emesis. These symptoms worsened with bending and straining (Valsalva). On initial exam by an ophthalmologist, bilateral optic disc edema was found and was confirmed by optical coherence tomography of the retinal nerve fiber layer.\nA lumbar puncture (LP) was performed which showed an elevated opening pressure of 37 mmH2O, confirming the presence of intracranial hypertension. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed mildly prominent fluid within the optic sheaths, suggestive of reverse cupping of the optic discs. Additionally, the MRI showed globular hyperintense lesions on T2 and FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) within the juxtacortical white matter, without periventricular lesions (Figure ). These findings are consistent with elevated intracranial pressure, possibly in the setting of a concomitant demyelinating process. Magnetic resonance venography showed no evidence of occlusion or thrombosis. CSF analysis from the lumbar puncture revealed the presence of 15 oligoclonal bands and lymphocytosis. The MRI findings in conjunction with the oligoclonal bands would be suggestive of a demyelinating process such as MS in addition to IIH.\nShe was started on acetazolamide to help with her intracranial hypertension and referred to neurology for further evaluation of demyelinating disease. On follow up with ophthalmology one week later, her headaches and visual symptoms were much improved. Optical coherence tomography of the retinal nerve fiber layer showed improvement in optic disc edema, with remaining edema of moderate severity and gliosis of surrounding vessels with no hemorrhages. The following month, her headaches and vision remained stable, with headaches occurring about once per week with no visual field defects",

The patient has suffered with idiopathic epilepsy with generalised seizures since childhood.

However, still she continued to have tonic-clonic seizures at a frequency of approximately six-eight per month and lasted up to 15 minutes. Her epilepsy had previously been managed by her learning disability psychiatry team; however, due to the resistance of her seizures to medication she was referred to the neuropsychiatry team. An important factor in her epilepsy management was that her seizures had been so severe and prolonged that she had lost the vision in one eye, due to traumatic injury. Therefore, both specialists were keen to avoid any potential visual side effects noted with some antiepileptics (e.g., vigabatrin). It was concluded that perampanel would be an appropriate choice.\nIn April 2013 she presented with verbal and physical aggression towards her parents and self-injurious behaviours such as throwing herself against walls. Her parents reported that this change in her behaviour had occurred since her perampanel was increased to 8 mg daily. Her seizure significantly decreased in both frequency and duration.

Symptoms of the autism spectrum comprising difficulties in social interaction and communication are reported since childhood. Additionally, he suffers from auto-aggressive tics in terms of beating himself with objects against his head and lower jaw, head movement tics and simple vocal tics. Striking dysmorphic features are not evident.\nExcept a one-time bleeding in week 20 of gestation, pregnancy had been without any complications.

A premature ossification of the sagittal fissure could not be detected.\nThe patient showed psychomotor retardation: he walked alone only by 26 months and was not able to sit alone falling over to one side without shoring up even at the age of 2. Furthermore, tics in terms of eye blinking as well as a muscular hypotonia were described. The patient\u2019s parents reported early autistic features such as difficulties in social communication and interaction with avoiding eye contact and poor interest in social interaction. Development of speech was delayed (first words with 18 months). He refused body contact and demonstrated stereotypic patterns of behaviour such as filling bowls without showing any variations.\nWhen examined at the age of 27 months, the patient presented some special facial features such as synophrys, epicanthus, modelled ears, a deep joined thumb and microcephaly.

He presented to the General Surgery Clinic with recurrent episodes of severe \"piercing\" epigastric abdominal pain for six months. These episodes were associated with non-projectile vomiting followed by lethargy or loss of consciousness which lasted for a \"few minutes\" after each episode. They were neither associated with food intake nor had any aggravating or relieving factors. Each episode of abdominal pain lasted for 8-12 minutes and occurred three to five times per day. They were sudden in onset and resolved spontaneously. His birth, developmental, and past medical histories were unremarkable.\nGeneral and local examinations of the abdomen and nervous system did not reveal any significant findings. He was prescribed analgesics and proton pump inhibitors and he was reviewed after one week. He did not report any significant improvement in his symptoms. His complete blood picture, stool for ova and parasites, 24 hr Holter ECG, ultrasound abdomen and CECT abdomen were unremarkable.\nFollowing this visit, he was put in for a gastroenterology referral; upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and barium swallow studies were found to be normal after which he was referred to the psychiatrist in view of psychogenic abdominal pain. There was no psychiatric intervention and he was referred to the neurology department for a second opinion.\nMRI brain was found to be normal. At this point, an epileptic aetiology was suspected.

He reported confusion one week prior lasting three days as well. Other complaints included difficultly initiating urination, chronic arthralgia, and an intermittent headache. Initial examination was notable for an exquisitely tender prostate, yet urinalysis showed no signs of infection. A complete blood count (CBC) at this time was within normal limits except for mild anemia, noted to be chronic, and for increased absolute eosinophils, which were attributed to seasonal allergies and were not a new finding. Ceftriaxone and acetaminophen were started while awaiting results of urine and blood cultures.\nThe following day, the patient was afebrile and his AMS had resolved. Additionally, neurology was consulted and had no concerns. The plan was to continue ceftriaxone while awaiting urine and blood cultures and to de-escalate antibiotic treatment if no further signs of infection arose.\nOn day three, the patient reported acute on chronic back pain and examination was notable for diffuse tenderness of the lower thoracic spine. A lumbar and thoracic MRI revealed meningeal enhancement of the mid to lower thoracic spine (Figure ) and question of focal contrast enhancement in contact with the catheter tip (Figure ). With concern for intrathecal pump catheter infection or chemical meningitis, a lumbar puncture was ordered, ceftriaxone was continued, and vancomycin and ampicillin were started. CSF results are shown in Table .\nThe CSF studies were most significant for eosinophilia and elevated CSF protein, making chemical meningitis caused by the hydromorphone via the intrathecal pump the most likely cause.

Seven years after surgery, computed tomography (CT) revealed lymph node recurrence at the splenic hilum, which was treated with four courses of cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil. Treatment reduced the size of the lymph node, although 1 year later, lymph node metastasis was detected again at the pancreatic tail and splenic hilum (Fig. ). Chemoradiotherapy (50 Gy in 28 fractions) resulted in a complete response at the lymph nodes. However, 11 years after surgery, a cystic solid tumour was detected at the pancreatic tail using CT (Fig. a\u2013b) and endoscopic ultrasonography (Fig. a). A change in the main pancreatic duct was also detected using endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (Fig. b). No other metastases were seen on evaluation with positron emission tomography/CT (Fig. ), which strongly suggested primary pancreatic tail cancer with lymph node metastasis. Intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma was one of the differential diagnoses that were considered. Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with lymphadenectomy were performed to treat the tumour, which had a diameter of 30 mm and appeared to invade the artery of the gastric tube that had been reconstructed during the oesophagectomy. Thus, the artery was also resected to achieve curative resection. Operative time was 190 min and blood loss was 30 mL. The resected specimen from the pancreatic tail measured 29 \u00d7 22 \u00d7 30 mm (Fig. ). Pathological examination revealed that the tumour was a squamous cell carcinoma, which was compatible with the detection of the previous OSCC. The final diagnosis was pancreatic metastasis from OSCC (Fig. ). The resected metastatic lymph nodes at the splenic hilum also exhibited squamous cell carcinoma cells. The patient was discharged after an uneventful recovery. She is continuing clinical follow-up without adjuvant",

However, the tumor increased in size and was accompanied by pain and claudication. Before RFA, she had been unable to sit due to complaints of pain and claudication in her left leg.

A 13-gauge needle was inserted in the cortex of the sacrum with CT guidance under local anesthesia. A LeVeen electrode was inserted coaxially in the tumor via a 13-gauge needle, and retractable hooks were opened (Figure ). Ablation was performed four times, shifting the position of the electrode for every ablation. The starting output was 10 W, which was increased 10 W every 2 minutes. Ablation continued until the generator automatically stopped upon reaching the maximum resistance due to increased impedance (i.g. roll off). Ablation was started with the low output and if a sharp pain of her legs appeared, ablation was stopped in order to avoid the damage of nervous by heat.

Abdominal ultrasonography (US) was performed and revealed a tumorous lesion in the upper abdomen giving the indication for referral to our department.\nUpon clinical examination of the patient (body height = 163 cm, body weight = 51 kg), there was slight tenderness in the left upper quadrant without a palpable mass. US was repeated and showed a complex, spherical mass of 4.4 cm \u00d7 3.6 cm \u00d7 4 cm in diameter with partly complex cystic and solid components. The mass was located between the abdominal wall, the medial margin of the spleen, and the anterior margin of the kidney. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a well encapsulated mass at the tail of the pancreas which presented with partially cystic and partially solid areas with contrast enhancement at the periphery of the mass but not in the central cystic part. The lesion was in close relation to the splenic vein superiorly, the medial surface of the spleen laterally, the transverse colon and mesocolon anteriorly, and in front of the left kidney and suprarenal gland. Neither vascular invasions nor lymphadenopathy were detected (\n). Routine laboratory investigations and tumor markers (alpha fetoprotein [AFP], cancer antigen 125 [CA125], CA 19\u20139, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], and adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]) were within normal ranges.\nDue to the radiological findings and the negative tumor markers, a solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas was suspected. The decision was taken to proceed with laparoscopy. With the patient in supine position, one 10 mm umbilical trocar and two additional 5 mm trocars in the left- and right-upper abdomen were placed. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with preservation of the spleen was done using a 30-degree camera (\n).

The fetal echocardiogram revealed discordant atrioventricular connections with pulmonary atresia and a small ventricular septal defect. Delivery at a cardiac center was recommended. The baby was born by normal vaginal delivery at term and weighed 2.46 kg. The perinatal period was uneventful. The saturation of oxygen in room air was 86%. The cardiac impulse was palpable in the right hemithorax, the second heart sound was single, and a continuous murmur was heard in the infraclavicular region. On the frontal chest radiograph, the heart was noted to occupy the right hemithorax []. The stomach bubble was visible on the left, with the liver shadow on the right side. The electrocardiogram was consistent with usual atrial arrangement.\nA detailed echocardiogram was obtained postnatally. The abdominal aorta was present to the left of the spine, with the inferior caval vein to the right. The heart was right sided, with the apex pointing to the right. The systemic veins drained into the right-sided atrium, while all four pulmonary veins drained into the left-sided atrium. The atrioventricular connections were discordant. The left-sided tricuspid valve was morphologically normal and competent, and the left-sided morphologically right ventricle showed normal systolic function. It gave rise to both arterial roots, but with pulmonary atresia []. Thus, the aorta arose anteriorly and to the left of the atretic pulmonary trunk, which was aligned with the cavity of the morphologically right ventricle. The pulmonary root was small but well formed. The aortic outflow tract was unobstructed. Confluent but mildly hypoplastic pulmonary arteries were supplied by a vertical and tortuous persistent arterial duct, which originated from the underside of the aortic arch.

His chief complaints were described as a diffuse rash over the body, swelling of the head and bulging of both eyes as well as swelling of the gums. These symptoms were progressive and relapsing, with the rash being present since the past 18 months and having extended to a breakout over the head, neck, back, chest and perineum over the last month and the swelling and bulging having progressed over the past year.\nAccording to his mother, the child had been in absolute good health until the age of two years, when he developed a spontaneous fracture of his right clavicle. The family was counseled and told the fracture would heal without any intervention. At two-and-a-half-years of age, the family sought a dental consult for a spontaneously broken tooth which was described to them as a developmental problem of the mandible. Further on, at three years of age, the child developed an infected oral ulcer, a severe swelling of his gums and had two episodes of a yellowish ear discharge for which he underwent drainage. His bodily rash made its first appearance six months after that, at 3.5 years of age, presenting as yellow lesions with pus filled discharge over the head, palms, soles and genital area - albeit, healing afterwards. The swelling of the right side of the head and bulging of both eyes started at the age of four years, with the proptosis gradually progressing to its current state upon presentation and associated with dimness of vision in the right eye. The child had previously been misdiagnosed as a case of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (rare ectodermal dysplasia characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma associated with early onset periodontitis) two years ago and prescribed fluconazole, but to no avail.

The patient signed an informed consent form for immediate implant placement after extracting the root rest. A 4.1\u00d712 mm SLActive surfaced implant (ITI TE, Straumann, Basel, Switzerland) was placed immediately after extraction. After 4 months healing, the implant was in a semi submerged position (). For an esthetic implant restoration, the margin of the crown needs to be 1 to 2 mm below the gingiva [,].\nIn this case, the top of the fixture for the crown margin was placed 1 mm subgingivally. A 4 mm solid abutment was connected to use as a final abutment and make a provisional implant restoration (). The difference in size between the cervical diameter of the natural tooth and implant fixture can result in a steep profile of the crown (). If the profile is undercontoured, there will be no contralateral pressure or support for the gingiva, and food particles will be retained.\nThe provisional restoration was fabricated on the soft tissue cast to create the same contours as the buccal aspect of the adjacent teeth. After the cured provisional restoration was removed from the cast, the flash was trimmed. At this time, a definite discontinuity existed between the contour of the provisional restoration at the gingival aspect of the crown and the width of the fixture margin (). With the \"add on\" technique, composite resin was added to create a smooth emergence profile ().\nThe finish was polished to a high luster using an aluminum oxide rubber cup allowing undisturbed soft tissue healing.

Gradual enlargement of the mass eventually made her decide to see a doctor. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed large retroperitoneal tumors. Mini-laparotomy and tumor biopsy confirmed her diagnosis as dedifferentiated liposarcoma, then she was referred to us for further examination and treatment. A multidetector CT scan revealed a hypodense mass in the retroperitoneum, with a size of ~30 \u00d7 20 cm2. The tumor appeared to invade the duodenum, head of the pancreas, right kidney, IVC and abdominal aorta (Fig. ). The IVC was almost occluded by the tumor, but venous return from the lower extremities beyond the tumor was observed through collateral veins around the tumor (Fig. ). The tumor invaded the abdominal aorta just below the left renal artery to the common iliac artery bifurcation, although the root and entire length of SMA appeared to be free from the tumor (Fig. ). She underwent en bloc resection of the RL with resection of the right kidney, duodenum, head of the pancreas, a portion of the inferior IVC and abdominal aorta. Ax-F & F-F bypass was performed for vascular reconstruction using poly-tertrafluoroethylene (PTFE) to maintain the blood flow to the both lower extremities (Fig. ). The lower abdominal aorta and both sides of common iliac arteries were resected with the tumor. The proximal stump of the abdominal aorta was closed with a running suture and covered by the omentum. The IVC was resected from just below the left renal vein to the common iliac veins. Reconstruction of the venous system including IVC and common iliac veins was not performed because venous collateral pathways had already developed sufficiently. Child\u2019s reconstruction was performed after pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy. The duration of the surgery was 19 h 22 min, and blood loss",
