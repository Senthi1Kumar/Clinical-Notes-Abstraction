She was suspected of having a malignant tumor.\nAnterior rhinoscopy showed a mass lesion extending to the anterior nares in the right nostril (Fig. ). Visualization of the posterior nasal cavity was difficult due to the obstruction of the mass (Fig. ). There were no eye symptoms such as diplopia or ocular motility disorder. CT imaging showed that the soft tissue concentration shadow that filled the nasal cavity extended from the nostrils to the maxillary sinus and nasopharynx, and that some of lamella of orbital of ethmoid bone may have osteolytic changes secondary to the malignancy (Fig. ). MRI was performed to evaluate the shape and extension of the mass. T2-weighted axial and coronal MRI showed a mixture of high and low signals (Fig. ). The mass was a stage equivalent to T4 using the inverted papilloma staging system proposed by Krouse []. Positron emission tomography (PET) examination showed no suspected metastasis. Preoperatively, inverted papilloma was suspected based on the neoplastic lesion filling the right nasal cavity and the results on CT/MRI. A complication of SCC based on the rate of tumor growth was suspected.\nSurgery with biopsy was scheduled under general anesthesia to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Piecemeal resection of the tumor protruding from the external right nostril was performed first.\nThe area was packed by cotton with 4% lidocaine and epinephrine.

Both eyes anterior segment examination findings were normal. Grade 1 vitritis was noted in the right eye.

PIDD screening showed low T cell, very low B cell counts, and low immunoglobulin levels (). Her systemic therapy consisted of 3 weekly intravenous immunoglobulin, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim prophylaxis as well as empirical therapy for fungal infection which include syrup fluconazole 6mg/kg/day and syrup nystatin 1ml QID.

She gave history of recurrent pulling out of her hair resulting in noticeable hair loss since the age of 8 years. She used to develop an urge and a sense of tension immediately before pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the behavior which got relieved on pulling out the hair. Hair pulling was only from the scalp, but never from any other site of the body. She always checked the roots of the hair before discarding it. There was no history of biting or swallowing of the hair. Due to the baldness arising due to her hair pulling, the patient started using a scarf which she would wear throughout the day. She developed decreased self-confidence due to her problems and started avoiding social gatherings. She did not take up a job despite being called for many interviews due to hesitation in facing anyone due to her growing baldness. A diagnosis of Trichotillomania was made as per International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision criteria.[]\nTreatment history revealed visit to multiple dermatologists and then referral to psychiatrists for treatment. She was treated with various antidepressants including fluvoxamine, sertraline, clomipramine, and antipsychotics like haloperidol, risperidone, and quetiapine, with no significant improvement over 8 years underlying the drug resistance in this case. There was no relevant family history of any psychiatric illness. Physical examination revealed patchy baldness all over the scalp. No hair loss was present at any other site.

At 1.5 years of age, bone marrow aspirate showed \u201cmaturation arrest\u201d at the promyelocyte or myelocyte stage of neutrophil formation, and she was diagnosed with CyN. From this point forward, the patient had continuously experienced recurrent fevers due to tonsillitis, stomatitis, herpetic stomatitis, and perianal abscesses once a month. Therefore, she had to be hospitalized once or twice per year until she was 15 years of age. Although the recurrence of fever gradually ceased, stomatitis and gingivitis continued to occur, and she developed mobility of the mandibular anterior teeth at 16 years of age.\nThe patient underwent oral hygiene preventive therapy from early childhood, which was managed by her general dentist. Severe stomatitis frequently interfered with the patient's ability to brush her teeth after meals. At 16 years of age, her general dentist made a fixed bridge on her mandibular anterior teeth due to the congenital deficiency of her mandibular central incisors, and the patient underwent pulpectomy of her mandibular lateral incisors at this time. At 17 years of age, the patient presented to the Department of Periodontology and Endodontology at Tokushima University Hospital because the mobility of her mandibular lateral incisors became severe. The patient's mother also had a history of CyN; however, her father and 2 older brothers were healthy.\nAn intraoral examination revealed redness and swelling of the marginal and attached gingiva (Fig. ), a panoramic radiograph showed extreme resorption of the alveolar bone (Fig. A), and dental radiographs indicated apical lesions in the mandibular lateral incisors (Fig. B).

A subsequent brain CT showed a right frontal brain mass; additional CT imaging of the chest, the abdomen and the pelvis was unremarkable. The patient was then transferred to our institution for further workup and management.\nUpon presentation, the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs (in room air).

    "original_text": "Our first case is a young 22-year-old male with chronic sinus inflammatory disease who presented with seizures at an outside hospital. He underwent workup with an MRI scan, which showed a small peripherally enhancing lesion in the right frontal lobe with central contents showing restricted diffusion suggestive of brain abscess. He was evaluated by neurosurgery and no surgical intervention was recommended based on its small size and lack of surrounding edema. Ear, nose, and throat specialist was consulted and ethmoidectomy performed due to concern for contiguous spread from a sinus infection. Cultures from his sinuses were reportedly positive for grampositive cocci in clusters. Patient was started on antibiotics including intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone (2 gm, q12h) and IV metronidazole (500 mg q8h) as well as prophylactic anti-epileptic with levetiracetam (500 mg oral tablet). He was discharged on these medications after one week. Patient was on these medications for around four months when he started developing lethargy, weakness, gait abnormality and pain in lower extremities. His symptoms had progressively worsening over the past two weeks. Patient was admitted to our University hospital. Coordination tests including finger-to-nose exam revealed mild dysmetria in both arms and the patient was falling in all directions during gait assessment. Patient was diagnosed with drug-induced neuropathy. Repeat MRI of the brain was performed which showed near-complete resolution of the right frontal brain abscess.

He was brought to the emergency department at a local university hospital with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12. An initial neurological examination revealed a moderate aphasia, right-sided hemiparesis, and a positive Babinski sign on the right. Urgent head CT showed a left-sided frontotemporal ICH with a midline shift of 9 mm (Figures , ). The patient underwent an emergency pterional craniotomy and hematoma evacuation. There was no evidence of tumor during the intraoperative period. Next day, postoperative CT scan showed a diminished midline shift to 4 mm and the remnants of hematoma (Figures , ). The postoperative period was uneventful. The patient gradually improved and was discharged for further rehabilitation after 12 days with a GCS score of 15, mild motor aphasia, and slight right-sided hemiparesis. The patient showed up for the follow-up after two years in 2016. The clinical condition was satisfactory, no focal neurological signs were observed, and the patient complained only of easy fatigability and mild intermittent head pains in the region of craniotomy. No need for an additional neuroimaging was indicated at that moment as the patient did not show any signs of neurological deficits.\nIn 2018, the patient was brought to the emergency department at the same institution due to a sudden onset of severe headache, right-sided weakness, and altered mental status. The patient had a GCS score of 12. Neurological examination was significant for severe aphasia, right-sided hemiplegia, and a positive Babinski sign on the right. An urgent CT scan was performed, revealing a vague spontaneous ICH in the left temporoparietal region (Figures , ).

Routine urinalysis showed 102 WBC/ul and 21 RBC/ul), but the result of urine culture was negative. Ultrasound of the urinary system revealed bladder stones attached to the anterior bladder wall and further abdominal CT-scan showed the existence of bladder stones and calcified tissues around the right inguinal region (Fig. ). Subsequent cystoscopy demonstrated bladder stones and part of the eroded mesh on the right anterior wall (Fig. ). The patient received open mesh repair for right inguinal hernia in September 2014, which recurred 9 months after the previous surgery, for which a TAPP repair was performed in May 2015. According to the second operation, a hernial orifice about 3 cm was identified on the right inguinal region, for which a 6 cm \u00d7 13 cm polypropylene mesh (COOK, USA) was applied and fixed with four non-absorbable metallic tacks on the dorsal side of the Cooper\u2019s ligament and the pubic bone.

The patient also reported that he could not feel his left hand, which was severely injured. On presentation to the ER (trauma level 1 institution), he was stable and conversant with a GCS of 15 with minimal residual bleeding from his face and a profusely bruised and swollen right orbit []. His left hand was partially amputated []. The patient subsequently underwent primary and secondary surveys according to ATLS protocol and was sent for imaging studies. An ophthalmology consult was obtained in the ER, which revealed gross destruction of the right eye with globe rupture and no residual vision. His contralateral left globe was fully intact the only neurological abnormality was progressive drowsiness, which led to expeditious imaging work-up.\nInitially a noncontrast CT scan of the head was performed emergently and revealed an intracranial irregularly shaped metal fragment measuring approximately 5 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 0.2 cm as seen on the tomogram scout films [].

CT showed pancreatic tail atrophy from prior necrosis, a new area of necrosis measuring 7.1 \u00d7 4.9 \u00d7 4.9 cm at the superior aspect of the pancreas body and a new 2.3 \u00d7 2.2 \u00d7 2.8 cm fluid collection inferior-posterior to the uncinate process. (The latter fluid collection communicated with the second portion of the duodenum on CT and would later be identified as the IPDA pseudoaneurysm.) There was extravasation of contrast within this latter fluid collection, suggestive of active bleeding (). During this time, the patient responded well to volume resuscitation and remained hemodynamically stable. It was felt that this bleeding was likely the result of inflammatory erosion into an artery. Given the patient's stability, the decision was made to attempt angiography with embolization. Surgical correction was considered at this time but ultimately would be more morbid and challenging given the degree of inflammation with his necrotizing pancreatitis.\nA superior mesenteric arteriogram showed a pseudoaneurysm arising from the IPDA with intermittent hemorrhage (). The microcatheter and wire could not be advanced past the pseudoaneurysm or into the pseudoaneurysm without buckling and displacing the microcatheter from the IPDA. In addition, the feeding artery from the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery could not be seen from celiac catheterization. Placing a microcoil in the proximal IPDA would have blocked the access to the pseudoaneurysm for definitive treatment. Thus, the decision was made to embolize the pseudoaneurysm with liquid N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA). Follow-up digital subtraction arteriography confirmed successful occlusion of the pseudoaneurysm and IPDA.\nThereafter, the patient was initially admitted to the surgical intensive care unit for close monitoring.

(the latter fluid collection communicated with the second portion of the duodenum on ct and would later be identified as the ipda pseudoaneurysm.) there was extravasation of contrast within this latter fluid collection, suggestive of active bleeding (). during this time, the patient responded well to volume resuscitation and remained hemodynamically stable. it was felt that this bleeding was likely the result of inflammatory erosion into an artery. given the patient's stability, the decision was made to attempt angiography with embolization. surgical correction was considered at this time but ultimately would be more morbid and challenging given the degree of inflammation with his necrotizing pancreatitis.\na superior mesenteric arteriogram showed a pseudoaneurysm arising from the ipda with intermittent hemorrhage (). the microcatheter and wire could not be advanced past the pseudoaneurysm or into the pseudoaneurysm without buckling and displacing the microcatheter from the ipda. in addition, the feeding artery from the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery could not be seen from celiac catheterization. placing a microcoil in the proximal ipda would have blocked the access to the pseudoaneurysm for definitive treatment. thus, the decision was made to embolize the pseudoaneurysm with liquid n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (nbca). follow-up digital subtraction arteriography confirmed successful occlusion of the pseudoaneurysm and ipda.\nthereafter, the patient was initially admitted to the surgical intensive care unit for close monitoring. he did",

At 10 months of age, he required early corrective cardiac surgery due to deteriorating cardiopulmonary function, and the repair of sternal, diaphragmatic, and abdominal wall defects was planned at the same time. He had partial herniation of the heart through a lower sternal defect (ectopia cordis), which was only covered by thin skin, allowing the cardiac pulse to be seen (). Although autologous tissue was preferred over alloplastic material, the patient's native tissue was not adequate for a reliable reconstruction at that time. A staged procedure was planned, and a resorbable PLLA-PGA plate was implanted as a temporary shield over his heart in the first stage []. This provided a stable soft tissue cover over his heart for 3 years. We carried out the second stage of rigid sternal reconstruction at 4 years of age, when the patient's thoracic skeleton had grown.\nOur technique for reconstruction of the inferior sternal defect is as follows: the patient is placed in a supine position. A sagittal incision is made over the previous midline scar. Skin and pectoralis major muscle flaps are raised using fine needle diathermy, exposing the sternal bar and proximal costal cartilages (). The superior rectus attachments are dissected from the lower border of the sternal bar and ribs. Further, the cartilaginous sternal bars are bisected using a scalpel, along their length, from lateral to medial, leaving the medial perichondrium intact (). This allows the anterior half of the bisected sternal bars to be turned over medially to cover the inferior sternal defect. The cartilaginous flaps are sutured together in the midline using polypropylene sutures, constituting a complete thoracic skeletal ring (). After suture apposition of the divaricated superior rectus muscles with polyglactin sutures, the rectus muscles are re-attached to the reconstructed lower sternum using polypropylene sutures.

There was no significant past medical or surgical illnesses. The patient had been taking oral analgesics for his pain that reduced his pain to some extent. Examination revealed straight leg raising (SLR) of 45 degrees on his left leg. Left ankle reflex was absent. The power of the extensor hallusus longus (EHL) on his left leg was 4/5. Pain sensation was diminished on his left first dorsal web space and the lateral part of the foot dorsum. However his bilateral EDB muscles were wasted (\n,\n) and so, clinical diagnosis of L4/L5 disc with canal stenosis was made. MRI lumbar spine revealed L4/L5 left paramedian disc with a canal diameter of 9mm. Dynamic X-ray of the lumbar spine did not show any instability. Because of the presence of bilateral EDB wasting, we opted for laminectomy in the patient rather than minimal access discectomy. Removing only the disc might result in failed back syndrome in such a patient.

The lesion in the surgical pathology specimen was identified as high-grade UC (pT2 with lymphovascular invasion) but there was no metastasis to the surrounding LNs (0/7). Eight months after the surgery, follow-up cystoscopy revealed recurrence within the bladder, which was confirmed as UC upon biopsy analysis.

Two months later, CT showed an increase in the size of the paraaortic LN consistent with PD, and the treatment was switched to ICI therapy with pembrolizumab. However, subsequent CT scans revealed not only paraaortic LN enlargement but also left subclavian LN and right renal hilum LN enlargement at 3 and 4 months after the initiation of pembrolizumab, respectively, which also satisfied the criteria for PD. Pembrolizumab was discontinued, and after discussing the risks and benefits of each third-line chemotherapy regimen with the patient, we decided to start GD which resulted in continuous overall tumor growth.

Therefore, conservative medical care was continuously implemented. At 4:30 am on the fifth day, the three fetal heartbeats stopped and fetal movement ceased.

In his past psychiatric history, he reported experiencing bullying at the beginning of the secondary school while showing very good marks at school. He started the use of substances (alcohol and tetrahydrocannabinoids on social occasions) at the age of 20 years old and rapidly moved to cocaine use, showing a fast progression, from a weekly use to a multiday use in less than a month. Cocaine use had been going on for six months without detrimental effect on social adaptation and stopped when the patient was uncovered by his parents. Subsequently, right after the interruption of the use of cocaine, he undertook gambling behaviors (scratch and win) with substantial loss of money. In that period he also presented a dysmorphic attitude and assumed anabolic steroids (testosterone, nandrolone). These episodes occurred during a period of six months predominantly characterized by elevated mood, which was followed, a few months later, by a clinical picture of internal tension and increased anxiety levels.

His past ophthalmological and other medical history was unremarkable except for hypertension.\nOn examination, the best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/200 in the left eye. On slit-lamp examination, the cornea and conjunctiva were unremarkable, and there was no evidence of active inflammation in the anterior chamber or neovascularization in the iris. Fundus photography and fluorescein angiography showed BRVO in the left eye (Fig. ). Optical coherence tomography showed ME in the left eye (Fig. ). We performed intravitreal dexamethasone implantation and scatter laser photocoagulation in the left eye. The intravitreal dexamethasone implant injection was performed inferotemporally, 3.5 mm from the limbus. The implant was properly positioned in the vitreous chamber after the injection. One month after the intravitreal dexamethasone implantation, a decrease in the ME and an improvement of the BCVA to 20/40 was observed on left eye examination. Three months after the intravitreal dexamethasone implantation, recurrence of the ME and deterioration of the BCVA to 20/200 was observed on left eye examination. Therefore, we performed the second intravitreal dexamethasone implantation in the left eye in the same manner. One month after the second intravitreal dexamethasone implantation, the ME improved and the BCVA was 20/60 in the left eye. The ME recurred and the BCVA was 20/200 about four months after the second intravitreal injection. Therefore, we performed the third intravitreal dexamethasone implantation in the left eye in the same manner.

On the first examination, all wounds were deeply contaminated by mess and foreign bodies and also involved significant volume of devitalized tissue. Moreover, the patient was dehydrated and pyrexic (38.9\u00b0C). Injuries involving left arm and lumbar area had affected almost entire skin and subcutaneous tissue resulting in soft tissue defect, but perineal injury had not only caused a large skin defect but also penetrated into the rectum leading to perforation, so the wound and its adjacent area were quite contaminated and infected by rectal contents.\nAfter improving his general condition with medical treatment including fluid replacement, intravenous antibiotics, analgesics, and antipyretics, he underwent an immediate operation in which first a colostomy was performed to stop constant contamination of the perineal wound by the rectal content, and then perineal wound was lavaged with about 2-L sterile saline solution using jet irrigation, and cleansed with antiseptic solutions. Later, the wound tract placed between perineum and rectum was sharply and extensively debrided to viable-appearing bleeding tissue with meticulous hemostasis to remove the whole necrotic tissues, foreign bodies, cloths, and debris. At the end of the intervention, a negative pressure dressing consisting of a black polyurethane foam with 400- to 600-\u00b5m pores and transparent adhesive drape was used to cover the complex perineal wound and set to 125 mm Hg continuous pressure (Fig ).

Her pregnancy had been asymptomatic. An initial ultrasound reported to show a single foetus in breech position and a complete placenta previa. There were no other signs that made us suspect distorted anatomy. Ultrasound measurements further showed intra-uterine growth restriction (5th percentile) with a normal amniotic fluid index. Doppler examination of the umbilical artery revealed a PI from 1.028 which is within normal range. A primary caesarean section was planned at 38 weeks of gestation.\nAt 37+6 weeks of gestation, the patient was admitted to the hospital with spontaneous rupture of membranes and loss of amniotic fluid. A caesarean section was performed. During the caesarean section a Pfannenstiel incision was made and the bladder and uterovesical peritoneum were deflected inferiorly. What appeared to be the lower segment was then incised but instead of entering the uterine cavity a second apparent uterine surface was encountered. Although the foetal breech could be felt within the underlying uterine surface, the anatomy was unclear. Therefore, a second transverse incision was made revealing a third uterine surface. After a third transverse incision was made, the uterine cavity was entered, presenting the breech. A live male infant, birth weight 2570 grams (5-10 percentile), was born.

There was no significant family history or previously infectious disease such as pulmonary tuberculosis, mediastinitis, hilar lymphadenitis and tumors. Physical examination disclosed that breath sounds of both lungs were thick, and there are obvious wet rales in the right lung, cardiac rhythm and heart sound were normal. The results of laboratory examination indicated that neutrophil count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were all higher than normal values. No obvious abnormalities were found in the laboratory indexes of tumors. Due to limited medical conditions in primary hospitals, fever symptoms in patients are often thought to be caused by common influenza or upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Coincidentally, the cephalosporin anti-infective treatment was effective for his symptoms. However, symptoms were easy to flare up again two to three days after taking the drug. Later, the patient suffered from fever again during the COVID-19 epidemic and was sent to our hospital for isolation and treatment. Timely nucleic acid testing of SARS-CoV-2 was negative. Computed tomography scan of the chest showed a 7cm large pouch of the right esophageal wall below the level of the carina, filled with retained food, demonstrating giant mid-esophageal diverticula (). Due to concerns about the risk of perforation caused by persistent infection within the giant diverticulum, upper gastrointestinal imaging and gastrointestinal decompression within the diverticulum were performed simultaneously ().

Abdominal ultrasonography identified a visceral artery aneurysm as an incidental finding. Angiotomography revealed that it was a saccular aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal artery, with a diameter of 40 mm, and showed subocclusive stenosis of the celiac trunk compatible with extrinsic compression ( ).\nThe patient underwent laparoscopic relief of celiac trunk compression ( ), thereby averting the possibility of mesenteric ischemia, as the pancreaticoduodenal artery is an important collateral route between the celiac trunk and the superior mesenteric artery and an undiscovered occlusion of this artery can cause visceral ischemia. The laparoscopic procedure was performed using a 10 mm trocar for the camera, in an umbilical position, and a further four trocars; in the right and left hypochondrium, the left flank, and a subxiphoid position. The gastrohepatic ligament, phrenoesophageal membrane, esophagus, and crura of the diaphragmatic were dissected, with inferior sectioning of the crura to enable the arcuate ligament to be viewed. Relief of celiac trunk compression was achieved by sectioning the arcuate ligament by electrocautery and the crura were drawn back together to prevent gastroesophageal reflux.
