There was no significant family or psychosocial history. He did not take any medications. He was a computer engineer and his job scope was mainly office work. He lived with his wife and one child in a small flat in Istanbul. He was an active tobacco smoker with a 10 pack year smoking history. Currently, he smoked five cigarettes a day. He did not consume alcohol. His physical examination revealed tenderness and swelling in the sacral region. His vital signs were stable with blood pressure 125/65, pulse rate 70/minute, and temperature 36.2 \u00b0C. A systemic examination was normal and no neurological abnormality was detected. Vertebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a pathological fracture in L5. After a Tru-Cut biopsy, he was diagnosed as having chondroid chordoma. He was treated with preoperative stereotactic radiotherapy to L5 vertebra at a total dose of 15 Gray in two fractions with CyberKnife followed by surgery in May 2012. We aimed to reduce surgical complications by preoperative stereotactic radiotherapy. Two years later, in May 2014, he presented with lumbosacral region pain and MRI suggested recurrent tumor involving L4, L5, and S1 vertebrae. He was not eligible for surgery and was treated with definitive radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) mainly for palliative intent. Between 7 July 2014 and 8 August 2014, he received 40 Gray to L4, L5, and S1 vertebrae in 20 fractions 5 days a week for 4 weeks. In January 2016, he presented with paraplegia. Control imaging showed local recurrence, multiple lung nodules, and sternal metastasis.

    "original_text": "A 12-year-old male was admitted to the hospital following sudden syncope after strenuous activity. The echocardiography showed the color in the left coronary artery. ECG revealed that the sinus rhythm was missing the ST segment and alterations in the T wave were indicative of ischemia. The lab analyses revealed that troponin, BNP, and fasting blood glucose levels were within normal levels. Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed that both the anomalous left coronary artery (LCA) and the normal right coronary artery (RCA) arose from a more posterior and leftward location on the right sinus of Valsalva and coursed intramurally along the anterior aortic wall (arrows) between the aorta (Ao) and the pulmonary artery (PA) (Fig. ). Computed tomography (CT) confirmed the diagnosis and demonstrated the intramural course of the anomalous LCA with normal RCA, along with normal left anterior descending artery (LAD) and normal left circumflex artery (LCx) (Fig. ).\nDue to the AAOCA diagnosis, we next evaluated the patient for myocardial ischemia, disease progression, and surgical risk. To correct the malformation, we performed a novel surgery wherein a neo-ostium was created on the left coronary sinus while maintaining the abnormal opening. Additionally, we introduced a lateral translocation of the pulmonary artery to improve coronary flow.\nThe surgery was performed with a median sternotomy. Cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated through aortic and bicaval cannulation. Antegrade cardioplegia was administrated to induce cardiac arrest. Crosswise incisions were made distal to the narrow segment of the left coronary artery and to the corresponding position of the left coronary sinuses respectively. Both locations were then anastomosed (Fig. ). The pulmonary artery translocation was performed by introducing an approximately 1 cm long and 0.5 cm wide autologous blood vessel patch of the right pulmonary artery and inserting this patch in the lateral aspect of the main pulmonary artery (Fig. ).

As a result of her JRA treatment, she had steroid-induced osteonecrosis of both hips, which had required bilateral hip replacements many years prior to presentation. She had undergone left total hip revision some 20 years prior at another institution. She was a former smoker and weighed 68 kg with a body mass index (BMI) of 25. Preoperatively, she denied any numbness, weakness, or any other neurologic findings in any of her extremities. She underwent preoperative placement of a left posterior quadratus lumborum block (QLB) using 30 cc of 0.5% ropivacaine with 2 mg of dexamethasone added with general endotracheal anesthesia for her surgery. As a result of her body habitus, ultrasound imaging proceeded without ambiguity, and the local anesthetic was injected into the fascial plane along the posterior border of the quadratus lumborum. On her first postoperative day, the patient complained of pain and dysesthesias in the left knee; she had 0/5 strength in left hip flexion and knee extension with substantially decreased sensation to her distal anterior/anteromedial thigh and knee.

Visual acuities were 6/20 OD and 8/20 OS with a normal intraocular pressure (IOP). Slit-lamp examination revealed mild cortical cataract OU. Fundus findings showed nothing of note. The initial ophthalmologist planned to perform cataract surgery for his right eye. His medical history was prostate hypertrophy, while he had no history of dementia. Viscoelastic materials with high-level cohesion were injected into the anterior chamber to dilate the pupil due to miosis following hydrodissection OD. Severe thermal corneoscleral injury occurred soon after beginning the phacoemulsification. The wound was tightly sutured by pedunculated conjunctiva; however, viscoelastic materials were injected again since the leakage was not suppressed. The next day, he was referred to our hospital. Visual acuity was hand motion and IOP was 3 mm Hg OD. There was marked corneal stromal opacity (Fig. ) with intraocular fluid leakage. The scleral wound was found to be opening following conjunctival incision (Fig. ). Since mobility of the sclera was markedly involved, it was impossible to conduct direct suture of the injured sclera. Therefore, the patient underwent transplantation of a donor scleral graft using 10-0 nylon to the burn site (Fig. ). After the transplantation and confirmation of the absence of intraocular fluid leakage, the lens nucleus was extracted from the newly formed wound on the temporal side of the scald. Histologically, the injured sclera showed coagulation necrosis with eosinophilic materials (Fig. ). Attachment of the transplanted sclera was favorable and IOP recovered to normal. Three months after the surgery, macular edema occurred due to intraocular inflammation caused by the remaining lens cortex. Therefore, anterior vitrectomy was conducted leading to the resolution of macular edema, and an intraocular lens was eventually fixed in the ciliary sulcus 7 months later.

Concomitant bilateral distal medial femoral 8-plate hardware removal and extensor tendon releases to the lesser toes were performed.\nPostoperatively, the patient was immobilized in a cast.

The patient was treated with prolonged cast immobilization for the subsequent 4 months followed by continued immobilization in a walking boot for another 2 months, activity restriction, and the use of a bone stimulator. The patient was managed conservatively for a total of 10 months postoperatively, at which point, a computed tomography scan was obtained showing persistent hypertrophic nonunion at the tibial osteotomy site.\nThe patient was taken back for revision open reduction and internal fixation with correction of the apex anterior and valgus deformity.

On examination, her pulse was regular at 76 bpm, blood pressure was 150/70 mmHg and auscultation revealed a continuous murmur heard over the precordium. She had no signs of heart failure. Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) was within normal limits, and the chest X-ray showed prominent pulmonary arteries on the left side, but normal heart size and clear lung fields. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular systolic function with normal ejection fraction at 65%. There was impaired relaxation with Grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular structure and function were normal and there were no significant valvular lesions, with only trivial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. 24-h Holter monitoring demonstrated a normal heart rate profile, with frequent isolated ventricular and supraventricular ectopic beats, and one episode of broad complex tachycardia of 4 beats. She had blunted heart rate response to exercise and the maximum heart rate was 102 bpm despite completing Stage 3 of the normal Bruce protocol. At peak exercise, the blood pressure dropped from 150/94 mmHg to 90/68 mmHg, and this was associated with presyncope.\nCoronary angiography showed a large communication between the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and the main pulmonary artery. In addition, there was another smaller communication that appeared to run from the right coronary artery (RCA) to the pulmonary artery. She was subsequently referred for CT coronary angiography (CTCA), which was performed using a 64-slice multidetector CT scanner using prospective ECG-gated acquisition. This confirmed the presence of a large complex fistula, between the main pulmonary conus and both the LAD and proximal RCA, with cavernous malformation of the fistula segment to the LAD (\u2013).

While riding his motorcycle, he lost control of his bike and fell on his left hip. Immediately, he felt severe pain in the left hip and was unable to bear weight over the left hip. On arrival to the ED, the patient was managed according to the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol. The left lower limb was grossly shortened and externally rotated (Figure ). Swelling was noted in the left hip and thigh region. Tenderness was present near the hip joint and movements were painful. An abrasion of approximately 10 cm x 15 cm was present over the medial aspect of the left thigh. The neurovascular status was normal. Standard radiographs showed an anterior dislocation of the hip with an intra-articular bone fragment (Figure ). After stabilizing the vitals, the patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the pelvis, with both hips, which showed an anteriorly dislocated femoral head lying externally rotated in relation to the superolateral aspect of the acetabulum. In addition, a displaced posterior wall fracture fragment was found within the acetabulum and a separate anterior wall fracture was noted (Figure ). The patient was immediately rushed to the operation theater after consenting for both closed and open reduction. After general anesthesia, closed reduction was attempted by the Allis method under image guidance. The femoral head could not be displaced from its position despite three attempts and a decision was made to proceed with open reduction using the Smith-Peterson approach. It was found that the head was trapped in the iliopsoas muscle and the detached fragment was found to be the posterior acetabular wall (Figure ). The capsule was found to be torn. Open reduction was performed and the position of the posterior wall was restored (Figure",

The patient was seen at another hospital 5 days earlier with similar complaints. Initial work up at the outside hospital included negative troponins, an electrocardiogram showing sinus bradycardia with a rate of 39 beats per minute (bpm), and leukocytosis with anemia (). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis at that time showed an increased number of small retroperitoneal lymph nodes and a small pericardial effusion. He underwent a barium swallow study that revealed normal swallowing with tertiary contractions and mid-esophageal spasms. The patient experienced relief of his retrosternal chest pain with antacid treatment. He was diagnosed at the outside hospital with esophageal spasms and discharged on pantoprazole. He developed postdischarge symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath that were worse while supine and relieved when leaning forward. A syncopal episode prompted him to present to our hospital.\nThe patient had a history of CLL Rai Stage 0 that was initially diagnosed in 2013 after routine laboratory studies revealed a white blood count (WBC) of 17 \u00d7 109/L with 70% lymphocytes. Flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy at that time were consistent with CLL. Further work up included normal chromosomal studies and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) studies negative for 17p deletion. He was initially managed conservatively without treatment until 2015 when his WBC increased to 93 \u00d7 109/L. He was then started on obinutuzumab and chlorambucil, but due to medication intolerance chlorambucil had to be discontinued. He completed the course of obinutuzumab in 2016.

Symptoms started 3 days before he presented to the hospital, and he had engaged in strenuous exercise and jogging for 7 hours the day before admission to the hospital. He thought initially that he had sprained his groin muscles while exercising and decided to defer coming to the hospital. There was no other significant past medical history of any illnesses, although the patient reported having had an extraction of a wisdom tooth 2 weeks prior to this presentation.\nOn examination in the emergency department, he was a fit-looking man who appeared very anxious. He was brought into the emergency department in a wheelchair.

He was born to nonconsanguineous parents, mother aged 36 years and father aged 38 years, with three normal elder daughters. The fourth baby was a male, who died 6 h after birth. He had dysmorphism, and the parents were told that the baby had some genetic disorder. However, no documentation of dysmorphic features or karyotype was available. The fifth pregnancy, 1-year later, was a spontaneous abortion at 3 months gestation.\nThe proband was conceived as the sixth pregnancy. The family came to medical attention at 23 weeks 3 days of pregnancy when an ultrasound had detected bilateral club feet, thickened nuchal skin fold, cerebral ventriculomegaly, hypoplastic cerebellum, unilateral right renal pelviectasis. The findings suggested chromosomal anomaly and amniocentesis was done for fluorescent in-situ hybridization for chromosome 21 and karyotype analysis. The fluorescent in-situ hybridization for chromosome 21 showed two signals in each cell. Karyotype showed an \u201cextra genetic material\u201d on a long arm of chromosome 6 [].

    "original_text": "A 28-year-old female who smoked half a pack of cigarettes a day with no significant medical history was being investigated for abdominal pain. A CT scan was ordered, which revealed a large left adrenal mass adherent to the kidney. Preoperative investigations including hormonal studies to evaluate catecholamine excess by the assessment of plasma metanephrines, urinary catecholamines and a MIBG scintiscan were negative, ruling out pheochromocytoma. Urinary free cortisol and demonstration of a normal diurinal rhythm of cortisol secretion by the administration of the dexamethasone suppression test were also negative ruling out subclinical cortical functional tumors. The larger size of the mass was highly suspicious for malignancy; therefore an open surgical intervention was planned. At surgery, via a left thoracoabdominal incision an en-bloc resection of the left adrenal mass was carried out including left nephrectomy, partial diaphragmatic resection with reconstruction and placement of a left thoracostomy. Postoperatively, the only significant complication was an asymptomatic left-sided pneumothorax that resolved spontaneously upon removal of the chest tube. She was discharged with an outpatient referral to the Cancer Center in 6 weeks. No further postoperative information is available for review in the current health record system.\nThe gross specimen weighing 1,492 g consisted of the left kidney and adrenal gland, with portions of the diaphragm. A large 16.5 \u00d7 13.5 \u00d7 12.5 cm ragged, irregular, pale-tan rubbery multinodular mass with hemorrhage and necrosis was seen completely replacing the left adrenal gland with no residual normal tissue being identified.

She also took tab misoprostol 800 ug prescribed by a local practitioner in suspicion of retained products of conception but the bleeding continued. There was no past history of a bleeding disorder or a family history of any gynecologic cancer. On examination, she was in a state of hemodynamic shock, with cold clammy skin, blood pressure 90/40 mmHg, and a weak, low-volume pulse of 140/min. The chest was clear, with a respiratory rate of 20/min. Pelvic examination showed a bulky uterus with closed os and normal adnexa. On investigations, her hemoglobin was 5 gms/dl while platelets were normal. Red cell indices showed iron deficiency anemia. Electrolytes, clotting profile, and renal function tests were normal. The histopathology report of the previous evacuation revealed chorionic villi with no evidence of trophoblastic disease. Her beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) was less than 25 IU/L. She was resuscitated with two liters of intravenous (IV) normal saline. Bleeding was controlled with inj. tranexamic acid 1 gm stat and then eight hourly. Four pints of packed cells were transfused. Ultrasound Doppler was done, which showed a bulky uterus with irregular and thickened endometrium with some debris and blood clots. Vascularity on color flow suspected uterine arteriovenous malformation (Figure ).

The tumor was 5.0 \u00d7 6.0 cm, and it was pathologically diagnosed as malignant meningioma (Fig. A). As metastasis from a primary site was suspected, imaging examinations, including head and neck magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) examination, were carried out, but since all were negative, it was diagnosed as ectopic malignant meningioma of the primary axillary soft tissue. After surgery, 50 Gy radiation was locally administered, and she received follow-up outpatient observation. In June 2016, chest radiography showed a nodular shadow in the right lung, so she was referred to our department. There were no notable findings in the laboratory blood test results. Chest radiography indicated a similar circular nodule shadow, 1.1 \u00d7 1.0 cm in size, in the right lower lung field. Chest CT showed the 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 cm nodule shadow in the right S4; mediastinal and hilar lymph node enlargement was not observed (Fig. B). PET-CT demonstrated slight uptake in the nodule, with a maximal standardized uptake value of 2.94 (Fig. C). There was no evidence of distant metastasis. After the initial examination, it was considered to be a metastatic lung tumor, and we decided to perform surgery as there were no abnormal findings in other organs. Surgery was performed in the left lateral decubitus under differential lung ventilation and 3-port thoracoscopy. There were no adhesions or pleural changes, and the tumor was directly under the right S4 pleura. Thoracoscopic right middle lobe partial resection was performed and the tumor was resected.

The patient had a medical history significant for cerebrovascular accident 2 years prior to presentation. The laboratory results, including complete blood counts, serum electrolytes, liver and renal function parameters, and urinalysis, were within the normal range. During the evaluation for this left flank pain, left-sided pleural effusion was found on the chest X-ray and the computed tomography (CT) scan (). The lesion was suspicious for tuberculosis pleural effusion, and thoracentesis was performed; 280 mL of the effusion was drained. However, laboratory studies of the pleural fluid did not reveal any evidence of malignancy or tuberculosis. Upon further evaluation, an abdominal CT revealed an enlarged left kidney surrounded by multilocular cystic lesions in the perinephric space. The CT study also showed mild pelvicalyceal dilatation, decreased contrast enhancement, and irregular contour of the left kidney, which implied decreased kidney function (). Upon magnetic resonance imaging, the cystic lesions exhibited high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and low signal intensity on T2-weighted images (). A majority of the cystic lesions were located in the perirenal space, with focal cystic dilations in the renal parenchyma.\nA left radical nephrectomy was indicated because of the flank pain and pleural effusion with a left kidney, which appeared to have decreased renal function on radiologic studies. Intraoperative findings revealed the left kidney to be encircled by multiple thin-walled cystic lesions with severe inflammation, which caused the rupture of some cystic lesions (). The renal parenchyma was grossly unremarkable except for hydronephrosis with a focal thrombus. The renal capsule and the renal parenchyma were involved by the foci of dilated cystic lesions.

Radiographic views of the cervical spine showed osteophytosis at C4-C5, C5-C6 and at the narrow disc space from C4-C7. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed and revealed a compressed dural sac from C3-C5 with spinal stenosis.

Pain was the throbbing type and continuous in nature, and it aggravates on opening the mouth, during mastication, and while brushing teeth.\nGeneral clinical examination revealed normal mouth opening. Multiple tender lymph nodes were noted on the right side of the face and neck region. On palpation, submandibular and cervical lymph nodes were tender and palpable (2 cm in diameter) and were firm and fixed to the skin.\nThe intraoral examination revealed desquamative changes in relation to the 43, 44, 45, and 46 regions (). Grade 2 mobility in relation to the 44, 46, and 47 regions and grade 3 mobility in relation to 45. No associated paraesthesia was reported. An ulceroproliferative lesion extending from the 44 to 47 regions with mixed keratotic and erythematous area with granular appearance was noted (). On palpation, the lesion was tender with mild induration. Desquamative lesion was noted in relation to 13 extending to 15 regions (). Periodontal probing resulted in profuse bleeding in relation to 45 and 46 regions.

He was treated with low molecular weight heparin and eventually received a tracheostomy because of respiratory weakness, likely from critical illness polymyoneuropathy. While out of the ICU, he underwent placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, for which anticoagulation was held for one day.

His arterial blood gas was notable for a pH of 7.05 and pCO2 77 mmHg. He required 20 mcg/min of norepinephrine, 2.4 mL/hr of vasopressin, 300 mcg/min of phenylephrine, 5 mcg/kg/min of dobutamine, and 40 ppm inhaled nitric oxide. TTE demonstrated severe decreased RV function with bulging of the interventricular septum into left ventricle.

The headache was described as sudden in onset, constant in nature, and bitemporal in location. This was associated with development of vision loss 1 day characterized by darkening of his vision, progressing from the superior to the inferior visual fields that lasted approximately 30 minutes with subsequent persistence of blurry vision. Without resolution of his symptoms, he presented to the emergency department.\nOn questioning, there was no prior history of seizure activity or of precocious puberty, or of genital abnormalities at birth. He had undergone corrective surgery for polydactyly of the left hand at 9 months of age. Polydactyly was also reported in his mother and elder brother.\nHis neurological examination was benign without abnormalities of extraocular movements, pupillary reflexes, facial motor strength, or sensation; he did not have papilledema. His genitourinary examination was normal and appropriate for age. Inspection of the left hand revealed webbing between the 3rd and 4th digits, with a well-healed scar on the ulnar aspect over the 5th metacarpophalangeal joint.\nCT scan of the head without contrast identified a 30 mm mass in the suprasellar region. Follow-up MRI of the brain with and without contrast confirmed this, identifying a nonenhancing, 30 x 27 x 30 mm mass along the midline of the posterior aspect of the suprasellar cistern contiguous with the posterior floor of the hypothalamus and tuber cinereum ().

    "original_text": "A 25 year old man presented with a one week history of rapidly progressive simple and complex motor (e.g. nodding, pointing, head shaking and turning, looking, blinking, hitting) and vocal (e.g. shouting, humming) tics including motor and vocal echo and possible blocking phenomena, all of which he attributed to the cessation of his recreational use of cannabis a few weeks ago. For at least one year he had consumed daily to relief the \ufffd\ufffdurge to move the legs in the evening\u201d that started two years ago. Back then he first noticed short twitching, disturbing movements in his legs at night, later during the daytime as well. For several years before that, he had experienced episodes of diffuse urgency to move his legs but had never had any tics or other visible unconsciuos movements. Suppressing the movement had become more difficult in the last weeks, making leaving his home or usage of public transport increasingly stigmatizing, resulting in self isolation. At the time of presentation he had continuous tics, consisting mainly of head and upper extremity movements, which he could suppress for up to 10 seconds. Exacerbating factors included emotional distress and being exposed to repetitive sounds or movements.
