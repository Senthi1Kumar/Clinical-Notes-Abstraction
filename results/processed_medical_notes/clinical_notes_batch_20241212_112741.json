A brain CT scan and further MRI showed three tumors surrounded by cerebral edema. A left kidney tumor and two lung nodules were identified by CT scan and, finally, clinical examination found some hypervascularized lesions of his scalp. The cutaneous tumors were surgically removed and the pathological report identified metastases of a type 2 papillary renal tumor. This patient was classified in the favorable risk group according to the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) []. Brain metastases were all treated by stereotaxic radiation. Pazopanib another TKI directed to VEGFr was initiated at 800 mg/day. This treatment induced a partial response in lung metastases and in the primary renal tumor; the three brain metastases were also reduced. The disease remained stable for 2.5 years under pazopanib, except in his brain. In fact, two new brain metastases appeared 12 months later and three others after 24 months. Stereotaxic radiation was performed on each new brain tumor and pazopanib at 800 mg per day was resumed. Some neurological symptoms appeared with several transient episodes of aphasia together with some degree of mental confusion, 4 months after the last radiation treatment. Pazopanib treatment was completed and brain MRI indicated a radionecrosis with surrounding cerebral edema in one of the recently irradiated brain metastases. Two months after pazopanib completion, a CT scan showed significant progression in all other metastatic sites including previously irradiated brain metastases. Cabozantinib was started after our patient gave consent. Neurological symptoms rapidly resolved and a brain MRI at 2.5 months evidenced tumor regression of the different brain metastases (Fig. ). Cabozantinib was ongoing for 6 months but had to be reduced to 40 mg/day due to grade 3 diarrhea. Sequencing was performed on",

The orthopedic examination revealed lameness in the lower right hind limb and a bony thickening at the level of the metatarsophalangeal joint between the II and III digit phalanges, covered with normal skin. The complete blood count, serum chemical and electrolyte analyses were within normal limits, apart from elevated levels of calcium and phosphorus, which were attributed to the young age (5 month) of the animal (Table ). The dog underwent a radiographic examination. Two well-defined lesions within the right II and IV phalanges of the right pelvic limb were found (Fig. a), in the shape of well circumscribed, mineralized new bone formation with a trabecular pattern. The dog underwent surgery to remove the lesion on the II phalange, and the excised tissue was sent for a histopathological examination. This revealed well-differentiated bone tissue, hyaline cartilage, and fibrous tissue in addition to hematopoietic tissue and connective tissue. Based on the histopathological findings, multiple cartilaginous exostoses (ostechondromatosis) were diagnosed. In the 1 month follow-up examination, the dog showed progressive ataxia of hind limb, a stiff gait and hyperesthesia in the thoracolumbar vertebral column. Radiographs of the hips and vertebral column exposed similar lesions to those in the pelvic limb. They were located in the distal part of the femur, on the tail and on the thoracic spinous processes of the lumbar vertebral bodies (Fig. b, c) and on the ribs (Fig. b).\nAt the age of 8 months, the dog was presented to the Wroc\u0142aw University of Environmental and Life Sciences at the Department of Internal Medicine with Clinic of Horses, Dogs and Cats for neurological assessment.

    "original_text": "Our patient was a 66-year-old male in whom a giant cell tumor of the right femur had been excised 20 years earlier, with intraoperative cryotherapy and adjuvant radiotherapy. He presented with a 3-year history of right knee pain due to severe tri-compartmental osteoarthritis and underwent total knee arthroplasty. However, 9 months later, the patient developed chronic osteomyelitis in the medial half of the right tibial metaphysis with fistulation to the antero-medial aspect of the lower leg.\nOn initial debridement, the arthroplasty components were found to be well fixed, with no evidence of loosening. The post-debridement defect was 4\u00d72 cm with an exposed patellar tendon. Intraoperative tissue and bone cultures grew multi-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. A right medial gastrocnemius flap was raised to cover the patellar tendon. However, dehiscence of the flap occurred on the fourth postoperative day due to infection.\nThe patient then underwent staged revision with exchange to a dynamic spacer. Soft tissue reconstruction was delayed for a month due to initial patient instability resulting from sepsis, and negative-pressure dressings were applied as a temporizing measure. After final debridement, a defect of 15\u00d75 cm over the anterior knee, with an exposed spacer, was reconstructed with a left latissimus dorsi (LD) flap. This was anastomosed end-to-end with the descending genicular artery and great saphenous vein. The patient recovered well and was discharged after 3 weeks.\nFollowing 5 months of antibiotic therapy, the second stage of arthroplasty revision, with exchange of the spacer to a rotating hinge knee implant, was performed. Due to extensive synovectomy, scar release, and the size differential between the spacer and the implant, there was a defect measuring 20\u00d75 cm () with implant exposure following the exchange. With the patient supine, a right thoracodorsal artery perforator flap was raised to reconstruct the defect.

The injury occurred after falling from a Withaak tree, and he sustained no other injuries. On presentation, two small lacerations and a subcutaneous pulsatile mass of 2 cm diameter at his cardiac apex were noted. A foreign object was apparent in one of the lacerations. The boy had no medical history of note, was not taking any medication. He was haemodynamically stable, not in pain, but reluctant to allow any close palpation. The wound was dressed, and he was referred to a paediatric surgeon at a tertiary hospital in East London (South Africa), then transferred by air ambulance to the Red Cross War Memorial Children\u2019s Hospital (RCCH) in Cape Town. On admission, his vital signs were all normal, and besides the puncture wound, no abnormal clinical signs were detectable. A chest radiograph showed nothing of note, and an urgent echocardiogram excluded a pericardial effusion. All blood tests were within normal limits. However, formal echocardiography revealed a foreign body penetrating from the apex into the cardiac mass. A fistula with a continuous Doppler blood flow pattern between the cardiac chambers and the pulsatile mass at the apex was noted. Unusually, the Doppler blood flow pattern of the fistula crossed anatomical planes: it arose from immediately below the skin at the apex, crossed the pericardium, and seemed to cross through the anterior right ventricle (RV) and the interventricular septum and enter the left ventricle (LV). The foreign body created an obvious filling defect within the fistula (Figure ).\nDiscomfort on echocardiography precluded certainty of the position of the tip of the thorn within the heart.

A small cystic lesion had first been noted at the age of 2 years. While this had initially been an asymptomatic, small lump that grew in size over time, it first became symptomatic when the patient was 4 years old. The lesion developed surrounding induration and erythema, as well as purulent drainage and tenderness. Over the next 1-year period, she went on to develop 3 such episodes of cellulitis. This was treated with a 10-day course of cephalexin by the patient's family physician, and it was due to these recurrent episodes of infection that we saw the patient in consultation.\nPhysical examination revealed a playful and well-appearing 5-year-old female, weighing 24.8 kg and measuring 114.5 cm in height. Review of systems and cardiorespiratory examinations were unremarkable. On inspection of the left scapular region, approximately 7 \u00d7 5 cm area of cellulitis was noted, with a small opening and associated purulent drainage. The surrounding skin was tender to palpation, but there was no appreciable fluctuance. Thus, the initial working diagnosis was infected epidermoid cyst. An ultrasound of the affected area showed a complex cystic mass measuring 3.9 \u00d7 2.9 \u00d7 3.7 cm within the subcutaneous fat (). Deeper margins of the mass were poorly demarcated due to the degree of inflammation, and the lesion appeared to abut the underlying musculature. Since these findings were nonspecific, an MRI was obtained to further characterize the lesion. The MRI revealed the presence of a subcutaneous cystic lesion just superior to the scapula measuring 1.6 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 2.8 cm. While the mass abutted underlying muscular fascia, there was no extension into the underlying trapezius muscle itself (Figures and ).

The day of the admission, he has been out the whole day and had not eaten or taken the usual amount of liquids; the initiating event took place at a funeral, where he felt nauseous and dizzy.

Surface ECG showed a sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with a left bundle branch block pattern and an inferior QRS axis (). After tachycardia, which causes hemodynamic compromise, was terminated with a 200-joule DC shock, sinus rhythm was restored.

    "original_text": "Case 1 was a 70-year-old female who presented with her right palpable breast mass. There were no abnormal findings on the overlying skin, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast revealed a 2.1 cm single enhancing mass on the deep portion of the right upper inner quadrant (). No hypermetabolic lesion suggesting distant metastasis was noted on positron emission tomography (PET) (). The differential diagnosis of malignant epithelioid neoplasms such as sarcomatoid carcinoma, sarcoma with epithelioid features or malignant melanoma was considered by core needle biopsy. The patient underwent right breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy uneventfully. Gross examination showed a 2.1 cm solid gray-white mass with an expanding border within the breast parenchyma (). No discernable lesion was noted on the overlying skin. On microscopic examination, the tumor showed a solid growth pattern with partial peripheral rimming of lymphoid cells (). It also contained some scattered lymphoid cells in the central portion with focal tumor necrosis (). The tumor consisted of polygonal epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and oval eccentric nuclei ().

The patient had not undergo any previous external radiation therapy. Blood pressure was normal. His serum levels of calcium, thyroid stimulating hormone and free thyroxine were normal. The baseline serum calcitonin level was 294 pg/ml (normal < 100 pg/ml). There were no antithyroid autoantibodies. On physical examination a rough nodule, about 4 cm in size, was palpated on the right side of the neck. The ultrasonography (US) showed a heterogeneous nodule, 4 cm in size, in the right lobe of the thyroid and multiple nodules with accompanying calcifications in the left lobe. A single fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the right lobe nodule revealed giant cells with enlarged nuclei and metachromatic cytoplasmic granules. Abdominal US was negative for adrenal nodules as well as urinary catecholamines and metanephrine levels were within normal limits. Total thyroidectomy plus central compartment lymph node neck dissection were performed. Macroscopically the right thyroid lobe measured 7 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3.5 cm, left lobe of the thyroid measured 4.3 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 2 cm. There was a right solitary white well-circumscribed nodule of 4 cm in size, associated with a small nodule of 0.4 in the isthmus and a nodule (diameter 0.5 cm) with fine calcification in the left lobe. Microscopic examination of the right nodule confirmed medullary carcinoma of the thyroid with neoplastic spindle-shaped cells forming nests with pale, abundant granular cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical stain was positive for calcitonin and synaptophysin, and was negative for thyroglobulin and p53.

She did not have a history of thrombosis or hemorrhage. Although her pregnancy had been uncomplicated until 28 weeks of gestation, she noticed prominent right vulvovaginal varicosities and new varicosities in the right lower abdomen.\nOn hospital admission at 35 weeks of gestation for planned delivery, physical examination showed prominent hypertrophy and multiple venous varicosities of the right leg as well as massive (15 \u00d7 10 cm) vulvovaginal varicosities ().

    "original_text": "A 26-year-old healthy man without any medical history complained of dysphagia. Routine chest radiography showed enlargement of the upper mediastinum at the sternal angle, indicating the presence of an arch anomaly. A barium swallow revealed an indentation of the esophagus on its right aspect. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) scan showed the presence of a right-sided aortic arch, with the left common carotid artery originating first, right common carotid artery second, followed by the right subclavian artery (RSA) and LSA arising from a Kommerell diverticulum that compressed the esophagus (\n).\nThe patient presented with dysphagia because of esophageal compression, so endovascular treatment was contraindicated and the patient underwent open repair.\nThe patient was taken to the operating room. Selective lung ventilation was used. Cerebrospinal fluid drainage (LiquoGuard, M\u00f6ller Medical GmbH) was applied to prevent paraplegia.\nA right thoracotomy was performed in the third intercostal space. The distal aortic arch and the RSA were identified and dissected. A careful dissection of the posterior wall of the Kommerell diverticulum adjacent to the vertebral body was undertaken in the left hemithorax until the LSA was of normal diameter. The vessel was surrounded with a silicone tape (\n). That posterior approach prevented any injuries from the Kommerell dissection adjacent to the esophagus. A strategy of simple side-biting division of the aberrant subclavian at the junction with the aorta was considered unsafe, because of posterior location of the diverticulum (in the left hemithorax), and the necessity to evert the aorta for clamping.

    "original_text": "A healthy 54-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of a large smooth plaque on the scalp with associated alopecia (Fig. ). The lesion was tender, had slowly increased in size and had not been treated prior to the visit. She had no other symptoms, organomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Excisional biopsy was performed, which revealed a lobular infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes (Fig. ) predominantly expressing CD8 and displaying rimming of adipocytes (Fig. ). The immunoperoxidase workup also showed moderately dense dermal and subcutaneous lymphocytes expressing CD4, a minority of lymphocytes expressing CD56 and an elevated Ki-67 labeling rate with rimming around adipocytes. There were associated necrosis and sclerosis of fatty lobules and increased dermal and subcutaneous mucin. Bacterial and fungal cultures and stains were negative. There also was superficial perivascular and perifollicular mixed lymphocytic infiltrate with vacuolar alteration of the basal layer of the epidermis and follicular epithelium. A diagnosis of SPTCL was made by the dermatopathology unit at a large, academic medical center, based upon the clinical, histologic and immunohistochemical studies.

    "original_text": "A 26-year-old healthy man without any medical history complained of dysphagia. Routine chest radiography showed enlargement of the upper mediastinum at the sternal angle, indicating the presence of an arch anomaly. A barium swallow revealed an indentation of the esophagus on its right aspect. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) scan showed the presence of a right-sided aortic arch, with the left common carotid artery originating first, right common carotid artery second, followed by the right subclavian artery (RSA) and LSA arising from a Kommerell diverticulum that compressed the esophagus (\n).\nThe patient presented with dysphagia because of esophageal compression, so endovascular treatment was contraindicated and the patient underwent open repair.\nThe patient was taken to the operating room. Selective lung ventilation was used. Cerebrospinal fluid drainage (LiquoGuard, M\u00f6ller Medical GmbH) was applied to prevent paraplegia.\nA right thoracotomy was performed in the third intercostal space. The distal aortic arch and the RSA were identified and dissected. A careful dissection of the posterior wall of the Kommerell diverticulum adjacent to the vertebral body was undertaken in the left hemithorax until the LSA was of normal diameter. The vessel was surrounded with a silicone tape (\n). That posterior approach prevented any injuries from the Kommerell dissection adjacent to the esophagus.

His medical history was significant for essential hypertension, coronary artery disease status post-percutaneous coronary intervention twice with a total of three stent placements (one in right coronary artery in August 2014, two in left anterior descending artery, and obtuse marginal artery in October 2014). Family history was unremarkable for any cancers. His social history was also insignificant. He was found to have ischemic cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20% with global hypokinesis on echocardiography in October 2018.

    "original_text": "A 41-year-old female patient visited the Department of Plastic Surgery for delayed breast reconstruction. She had received a modified radical mastectomy and postoperative radiotherapy 12 years previously for left breast cancer. Four years after surgery, lymphedema developed in her left hand, which was also identified by objective measurement of volumetry (Perometer type 350s, Nambuk Surgical, Seoul, Korea) (). A perometer is an electromechanical device used to calculate the limb volume with the data gathered electronically from the limb inserted into a vertically- or horizontally-oriented frame that emits infra-red light beams at right angles to each other. Despite conservative treatment, including manual lymph drainage and compressive garments, the symptoms worsened and the patient's entire left arm was affected. She requested delayed breast reconstruction with autologous tissue. Because she did not have a large volume of breast material on the contralateral side and did not have excessive abdominal tissue, the patient underwent breast reconstruction with an extended latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap.

    "original_text": "A 38-year-old man presented with an asymptomatic mandibular mass. He had been slightly punched in his face 2 days before visiting the Department of Oral Surgery, Faculty of Dentistry, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. His chief complaint was pain and swelling in the jaw. The patient had no complaints before, except some degree of paresthesia in the region. The medical history of the patient revealed no systemic, endocrine or metabolic disorders. On extraoral examination, no abnormality was detected except slight asymmetry of the face. On palpation, crepitation was found in the inferior border of the left mandible. Intraoral examination revealed missing lower left second premolar, and hard swelling and some degree of erythema in the left posterior mandible area. The patient declared that the lower left first molar had been extracted about five years previously. However, some degree of erythema was observed on the edentulous mucosa between the lower left first premolar and lower left second molar.\nRadiographically, a well-defined radiolucency was identified in the body of the mandible on the left side. The radiolucency extended from the first premolar region to the second molar area. It seemed to have destroyed bone almost from the edentulous alveolar crest to the inferior border of the mandible. A small ill-defined area was observed in the anterior border of the lesion. The lesion was associated with an obvious bony fracture in the inferior border of the mandible. The relatively large size of the lesion had pushed the lower left second premolar to the inferior border of the mandible ().\nThe differential diagnoses of odontogenic keratocyst, dentigerous cyst, ameloblastoma and calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor were considered for the relatively large and well-defined pericoronal radiolucency.

During the immediate postoperative period, the patient had typical recovery with postoperative sonographic interrogation demonstrating expected perioperative edema. Increased velocities were reported near the inferior vena and portal veins which resolved with improving perioperative edema. No additional vascular compromise was identified in the immediate postoperative period.\nThe patient presented 4 weeks following OLT with shortness of breath and was found to have bilateral pleural effusions, recurrent ascites, and acute renal insufficiency. The findings were all assumed to be related to OLT vascular compromise. Thoracentesis and paracentesis (3 liters of ascitic fluid drained) were performed, and the following day ultrasound and Doppler imaging were performed to evaluate the hepatic vasculature. This revealed mild ascites without evidence of hepatic vascular compromise. Clinically, the patient demonstrated no improvement and had additional paracentesis 3 days following admission in which 5 liters of ascitic fluid was drained. On the 10th day following admission, laparoscopic exploration of the abdomen with liver biopsy and lysis of adhesions was performed. The liver biopsy revealed sinusoidal congestion without evidence of hepatic graft rejection or malignancy. On the 13th day following admission, repeat ultrasound with Doppler imaging demonstrated severe stenosis of the intrahepatic vena cava, portal hypertension, and perihepatic ascites. The stenosis was shown to be worse in the supine position.\nThe following day, inferior vena cavagram was performed demonstrating high grade intrahepatic IVC stenosis with extensive collateral flow through the azygous system and thoracolumbar venous plexus ().\nThe pressure gradient across the stenosis measured 11 mm Hg.

A physical examination revealed multiple palpable painless abdominal masses that were mainly confined to the lower abdomen and around the omphalic region. He had a history of acute abdominal pain and anaphylactic reaction with urticaria rash 2 months previously, but this had regressed without medical therapy.\nAn ultrasound and computed tomography examination revealed a cyst containing a \u201cfloating membrane\u201d in the spleen and numerous unilocular cysts in the peritoneal cavity, measuring from a few millimeters to 3 cm ( and ) Floating membrane in the splenic cyst and multiple cysts in the peritoneal cavity). Laboratory data were within normal limits except for the eosinophil count (12%) and antibodies against Echinococcus granulosus (1/4096). The diagnosis of multiple hydatid disease was established based on imaging findings and positivity for anti-echinococcal antibodies.\nWe applied chemotherapy (albendazole, 10 mg/Kgr/day) for 6 months, since the spread of the disease into the peritoneal cavity and the multiplicity of lesions were strong contraindications for a radical surgical approach. At around 3 months the cysts in the peritoneal cavity had disappeared and the splenic cyst had reduced in size.

Staging MRI and CT scans showed a large tumor measuring 5 \u00d7 3 cm occupying the roof and the posterior wall of the nasopharynx which invaded the inferior part of the clivus. Cross sectional images also revealed bilaterally enlarged lymph nodes in the upper neck. According to the 2002 AJCC staging system [], she was diagnosed as a NPC patient of stage cT3N2M0. She was treated with 2-phase lateral opposed facial-cervical fields at a 2 Gy daily fraction (Figure ), 5 times a week to a total dose of 70 Gy with concurrent cisplatin from November 10th to December 31st, 2010. Complete response was achieved after concurrent chemo-radiotherapy. 3 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of Cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil was given following concurrent chemo-radiotherapy.\nHowever, 1 year after radiation therapy the patient developed moderate to severe headache and dizziness. She returned to the local hospital to seek medical intervention for her symptoms on March 2nd, 2010. There was no associated history of fever, blurring of vision, nausea or vomiting. Physical examination was unremarkable. No abnormal neurological signs were noted. Her hematological and biochemical profile as well as her liver function test results were normal. However, Brain MRI scan showed abnormalities in the white matter of bilateral inferior portions of the temporal lobes.

The physical examination revealed the patient to be pale with a hemoglobin of 4.9 g/dL. She was then referred to a hematologist-oncologist. Immunofixation (IFE) studies of serum and urine were positive for monoclonal serum proteins (M-proteins). Bone marrow biopsy submitted in formalin revealed 100% involvement by monoclonal plasma cells. No cytogenetic or FISH studies were routinely performed at that time. A metastatic bone survey showed no osseous abnormality. She was staged as Durie-Salmon Stage II, International Staging System II. Induction therapy consisted of 2 cycles of standard VAD (vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone) regimen. After the first cycle, the serum and urine remained positive for M-proteins. A second cycle was given and there was no adequate response. Given the unsatisfactory response and the young patient age, she underwent an allograft from her sister in December 1998, after a conditioning with total marrow irradiation, busulfan and cyclophosphamide. The posttransplant course was rather uneventful except for a hepatitis B reactivation syndrome (after immunosuppressant therapy) successfully treated with lamivudine. Two years after the allograft, the bone marrow evaluation showed complete remission with less than 1% polyclonal plasma cells. Monoclonal proteins were not detected in serum or urine by IFE, and the 24 hour urine total protein was too low for quantification ().\nThe patient continued to do well and pursued a full-time job during the eleven year interval after the allograft. She remained free of myeloma (normal bone marrow, no evidence of discrete lytic or blastic lesions, negative for monoclonal proteins in serum and urine from IFE studies, and urine total protein too low for quantification) until she complained about a right breast mass located towards the axilla during a follow-up exam in 2009.

Abdominal ultrasonography on February 2019 detected a well-defined nodular lesion on the tail of the pancreas, approximately 2 cm in diameter and without compromising adjacent structures. Other imaging tests were not performed due to a significant allergy to radiological contrast. She underwent endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) which confirmed the finding of abdominal US but detected two more hypoechoic, homogeneous, round areas, with well-defined limits, of soft consistency to elastography, two located in the uncinate process and one in the pancreatic tail, measuring 7 \u00d7 8 mm, 11 \u00d7 10 mm, and 19 \u00d7 12 mm, respectively (Figures and ). They did not invade or compress the main pancreatic duct or vascular structures. EUS-FNA core biopsy was performed on all lesions with a ProCore 20G needle (Cook Medical) (). An additional finding of the exam was the presence of gallbladder stones.\nThe histological results of the punctures revealed that the lesion located on the tail of the pancreas and the largest in the uncinate process were secondary microduct or small cell-associated epithelial neoplasia isolated (metastatic ductal carcinoma). The smallest located in the uncinate process was negative for neoplasia. The immunohistochemistry of the material was positive for the GATA3 marker, which concluded that it was an invasive carcinoma of mammary origin in the form of triple negative discesa cells (estrogen negative, progesterone negative, and HER2 negative receptors) (). The patient was diagnosed with late metastases of breast cancer to the pancreas and resumed follow-up with the oncology team.",

She suffered from major coronal destruction and needed to have her first molar restored. The medical history was noncontributory. Radiographic and clinical examinations were performed initially, and an extensive glass ionomer cement restoration of a nonvital tooth (46) was identified (Figures and ). The tooth was treated endodontically. The patient had an acceptable oral hygiene and a favorable occlusion. After removing the restoration, an endocrown restoration was recommended because of the amount of remaining tooth structure and the thickness of the walls (). The prosthetic decision was to restore tooth (46) with an endocrown fabricated from lithium disilicate ceramic (IPS e.Max CAD). The preparation for the endocrown is different from the conventional complete crown. This monolithic, ceramic adhesive restoration requires specific preparation techniques to be suitable for especial biomechanical needs.\nThis is aimed at achieving achieve an overall reduction in the height of the occlusal surface of at least 2 mm in the axial direction and to get a cervical margin or \u201ccervical sidewalk\u201d in the form of a butt joint. The cervical margin has to be supragingival and enamel walls less than 2 mm have to be eliminated.\nDifferences in levels between the various parts of the cervical margin should be linked by a slope of no more than 60\u00b0 to escape a staircase effect. We used a cylindrical-conical diamond bur held parallel to the occlusal plane, to reduce the occlusal surface.

Physical examination showed tenderness on palpation over the upper pole of the patella and absence of active movement of the knee accompanied by swelling and joint effusion. A plain radiograph showed an avulsed fragment of the superior pole of the patella (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a superior pole patellar avulsion fracture and dysfunction of the knee extensor mechanism (Fig. ). There were no signs of damage to the articular cartilage, meniscus, and cruciate ligament caused by previous dislocation.\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient underwent open surgery for reduction of the patellar fracture and reconstruction of the knee extension apparatus through an anterior approach. All of the above-mentioned imaging findings were further confirmed during surgery. Through a midline incision above the quadriceps tendon, careful dissection was performed to expose the injury site. Intraoperatively, a sleeve-like piece of bone was detected above the patella, and the proximal quadriceps tendon was attached to the bone piece (Fig. ).
