Detailed smoking history revealed that he had been smoking one pack a day since 1971 but had quit a few weeks before his presentation because of persistent cough. Clinical examination and laboratory studies did not show evidence of airway obstruction, gastroesophageal reflux, postnasal drip, or respiratory infection. Chest radiographs were reported to show left lower lung field opacity (Chest radiographs obtained in 1992, 1993, and 1997 films were archived and could not be reviewed by the authors. Information in the text is from radiology reports.) which remained unchanged on multiple films in 1992 and 1993. Cough subsided and this opacity was thought to be clinically insignificant. In 1997, during a routine visit, chest radiographs were repeated and showed, along with the left lower lobe opacity, right lower lobe opacity. Since the patient was asymptomatic, it was decided to follow him clinically. In 2001, the patient developed symptoms of pneumonia, and a computed chest tomography (CT) revealed nonspecific opacities in all lobes suggestive of bilateral consolidative process (The films from this CT were archived and could not be reviewed by the authors). No bullae were described. The patient also developed thrombocytopenia and was diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP). His pulmonary symptoms were controlled with antibiotics and bronchodilators. The patient was discharged on bronchodilators, Danazol and systemic corticosteroids for the diagnoses of COPD and ITP. From 2001 to 2007 the patient had multiple episodes of fever, cough and dyspnea which were treated as pneumonias or COPD exacerbations, and he became oxygen dependent. In 2007, he presented with hemoptysis. Bronchoscopy with a BAL and a transbronchial biopsy showed mature lymphocytes. A lung biopsy through a video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) procedure was performed and the results showed MALT lymphoma ().\nSections of intraparenchymal lymph nodes revealed complete effacement of normal nodular architecture by monotonous proliferation",

On experiencing serious right parotid pain, he visited our affiliated hospital. Physical examination revealed a painful mass in his right parotid gland of approximately 30 mm in diameter and ipsilateral facial nerve palsy of House\u2013Brackmann (HB) grade III. Laboratory findings showed a leukocyte count of 12,190/\u03bcL and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 0.18 mg/dL. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an enhanced irregularly shaped mass in the right parotid gland (). T1-weighted SE MR imaging of the mass showed lower intensity than that of the native parotid tissue (). T2-weighted SE MR imaging also showed intermediate signal intensity and partial hyperintensity (). At this stage, a malignant neoplasm of the parotid gland was suspected.\nNine days after the appearance of symptoms, he was referred to our hospital. On physical examination, the mass was found to be still present but the pain had eased. In addition, the facial nerve palsy showed some improvement to HB grade II. Ultrasound examination revealed an inhomogeneous, lobulated mass (approximately 30 \u00d7 25 mm) in the right parotid gland.

The patient had neither fever nor abdominal pain. He denied previous digestive tract related medical history as well as taking any of current medicine history, like nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug. On admission the patient had an acute ill looking appearance and no altered mental status. Resting tachycardia was observed, but his blood pressure was in a normal range. In the second day of admission, he was referred to the endoscopic center where we gauzed the systolic blood pressure just less than 100 mm Hg and he complained dizziness. There were no other specific abnormalities, such as abnormal bowel sound, tender abdomen, or hepatosplenomegaly. The initial hemoglobin level was 12.3 g/dL which subsequently dropped to 9.9 g/dL the next day. Other laboratory exams, like hematologic profiles, were within normal range. The patient was first resuscitated with intravenous saline solution and followed by digestive endoscopies accordingly. An emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy did not claim any specific lesion, but the colonoscopy disclosed fresh blood at the appendiceal orifice (). Interestingly, after we performed a large amount of water irrigation and removed blood contained liquids, we could not see any fresh blood, implying that the bleeding source did not seem to be around the cecum. Further, following ileoscopy illustrated that the terminal ileum was not evident for any current bleeding episode from the upper level of the tract. However, getting back to the cecum, as the scope entered the appendiceal orifice and after irrigating a small amount of water, it allowed us to corroborate appendiceal intraluminal bleeding in real-time image ().

The needle was then carefully advanced 0.5 cm each time till the patient reported paresthesia over mandibular region. After negative aspiration of blood, diagnostic block with 3 ml of 2% lignocaine was given. Five minutes after eliciting hypoesthesia in mandibular distribution, 1 ml of absolute alcohol (AA) was given for the neurolytic block.

She has been a pious adherent of Buddhism for more than 15 years.\nIn June 2015, she was sent to the emergency department due to irritable mood, decreased need for sleep, hypertalkativity, flight of ideas, grandiose delusion and auditory hallucination for 1 week. Serial examinations including brain computed tomography and thyroid function tests showed no abnormal findings. Under the impression of bipolar I disorder, manic episode with psychotic features, admission was suggested by the consulting psychiatrist but patient refused due to poor insight. Compulsive admission was not indicated due to no obvious risks of self-harm or violence at that time.\nShe was discharged against advice from the emergency department but soon admitted to another hospital due to persistent manic symptoms. However, due to poor insight, she was discharged against medical advice after only 5 days of treatment and with minimal improvement. She discontinued all medication and refused to visit the outpatient clinic after discharge.\nThis manic episode eventually resolved 3 months later. Unfortunately, she was found to have elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, hypertalkativity, flight of ideas, grandiose delusion and some disturbing behavior during religious practice for more than 2 weeks in May 2016. She was sent to our hospital again and admission was arranged under the impression of bipolar I disorder, manic episode with psychotic features.\nSerial examinations including thyroid function tests were done and no abnormal finding was noted on day 1. We delivered quetiapine 400 mg/day and valproic acid 1,000 mg/day for controlling her manic and psychotic symptoms.

On examination her weight was 5.5 kgs and her abdomen was hugely distended. On palpation, a firm mass occupying all of the left lumb of the abdomen was palpable, which was tender, moving with respiration and the margins were irregular. Both the renal and liver functions as well as the findings of hematological studies were within the normal limits. A chest x-ray showed no abnormality. Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated a pelvic left kidney measuring 18 cms in diameter with an important expansion of the excretory cavities and internal cystic and solid changes. Computed tomography showed a mass containing low-density areas of the left kidney. The right kidney was normal. The patient did not found any more tumors in the other organs. Because the most frequent tumor of the kidney occurring in newborns is congenital mesoblastic nephroma and patients with ectopic kidneys have a high risk for Wilms\u2019 tumor, a diagnosis of either mesoblastic nephroma or Wilms\u2019 tumor arising from ectopic kidney was tentatively made, and she was thus considered to be indicated for surgery.\nPatient was operated upon; laparotomy was done through a median underumblical incision. A large partly cystic and partly solid mass with extensive areas of haemorrhage in the cystic areas was present in the left pelvic region. It was roughly spherical in shape. Postoperative recovery of the patient was uneventful and she was discharged on 10th postoperative day. The specimen was sent for histopathological examination.\nGrossly a large mass was received measuring 18\u00d712\u00d78 cms in maximum dimensions.

She experienced the first attack 3 years ago during a transatlantic flight. The headache started during take-off and increased gradually to an intense jabbing pain located in the left retro-orbital and frontotemporal area of the skull. The episode lasted 15\u201320 min and was accompanied by mild ipsilateral tearing. The attack recurred, this time with a milder intensity, during landing. After residing 5 months abroad, she again experienced two attacks on the return flight during take-off and landing. Apart from a slightly shorter duration, she did not notice any differences to the previous episodes. She presented to our headache out-patient clinic because of the regularly occurring headache attacks during her frequent airplane flights over the last months. She had a history of typical tension-type headaches with a frequency of approximately one every 2 months and an average intensity of four on a visual analog scale. She could relate these episodes to stressful periods and the pain is always promptly responding to low doses of common analgesics (acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen or paracetamol, mefenamic acid). On the age of 17, after the appearance of hirsutism, acne and menstrual cycle abnormalities, she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome. She was subsequently put on ethinylestradiol combined with cyproterone acetate which proved effective in suppressing her acne. She stopped taking the drug after 3 years on her own initiative.

The patient's past medical history was significant for hypertension, with a smoking history of 50 pack-years. Physical examination and routine laboratory tests revealed no significant findings. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 2.1 \u00d7 1.7 cm sized mass in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe (RUL), along with a 3 \u00d7 2.3 cm sized mass in the superior segment of the right lower lobe (RLL)(Fig a). The nodule in the RUL was suspected to be primary lung cancer, while the nodule in the RLL was suspected to be a benign neoplasm or double primary lung cancer. Therefore, we performed a staging workup for suspected lung cancer. Positron emission tomography showed increased uptake only in the RUL and RLL (Fig b). Bronchoscopy showed no endobronchial involvement. As the pulmonary function test indicated no contraindication, we recommended surgery because of the possibility of malignancy in each nodule. Thoracoscopic wedge resection was performed with a frozen section for each nodule. The intraoperative frozen section revealed adenocarcinoma with poor differentiation in the RUL and non-small cell lung cancer with very poor differentiation in the RLL.

The visual acuity in both eyes was revealed 25/60 with normal intraocular pressure. Slit lamp exam revealed 2+ inflammatory cells and flare in anterior chamber in both eyes. The vitreous cavity was clear, and there was no retinal vascular sheathing. Fundus examination disclosed serous retinal detachment and retinal folds, and also optic disc edema in both eyes (, ). Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) OU revealed irregular patches of fluorescence and numerous hyper fluorescent points of leakage at the level of the retina pigment epithelium. The leaking points gradually enlarged and dye accumulated in the sub retinal space. The late-phases FFA showed to diffuse pooling of dye in sub retinal spaces and late optic disc staining in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans showed serous macular detachment with several subretinal septas in the right eye and a giant serous macular detachment in the left eye (, ). In this case, a diagnosis of probable VKH disease according to Diagnostic Criteria for Vogt-Koyanagi- Harada [] was made based on the ocular examination and the typical FFA findings.

There was no history of trauma, fever, other joints pain, and abnormalities. He experienced pain walking and playing sports, with limping at the end of the day. Clinically, the ankle joint was painful at the medial edge from the anterior to the posterior aspect. Both dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were reduced of 10\u00b0, with local swelling and mild warmth.\nX-rays examination showed a protuberance of bony-like nature starting from the medial articular portion of the talus and with lobulated appearance and a large intra-articular cauliflower fashioned loose body (). The 3D reconstruction CT scan demonstrated an expansion of the bone arising from the anteromedial aspect of the talus associated with an irregularity of the distal third of the tibia (); MRI described a pedicled oval bone tumor arising from the talus ().\nBecause of the symptoms described and the imaging evidences, the first choice of treatment was the surgical arthroscopic removal by a posterior two-portal approach. The arthroscopy showed a flush reactive synovitis that was removed using the motorized tool. The intra-articular loose body was completely removed. The large pedicled prominence was arthroscopically detected but because of the need to perform the histological examination, the removal was performed by an open anteromedial approach. The rehabilitation program was the same as the previous case described. The histological examination showed a cartilaginous and bony-like mass without any evidence of neoplastic cells; then the clinical and pathological diagnosis was DEH of the ankle.

Computed tomography (CT) aortography revealed an ARSA originating from the distal aortic arch, distal to the left subclavian artery and crossing the mediastinum between esophagus and trachea, and a thoracic aortic aneurysm with a diameter of 67 mm and a thrombus extending from the left subclavian artery origin to the proximal descending aorta involving the right subclavian artery origin ().

    "original_text": "A 21-year-old woman visited an outside hospital with the chief complaint of intermittent chest discomfort and respiratory difficulty for 2 months. In the medical history, the patient had taken medication for schizophrenia for several years. On the chest computed tomography (CT) scan, the patient had a 13-cm heterogeneous enhancing mass with multifocal calcification in the anterior mediastinum that invaded the pericardium and was associated with massive left pleural effusion. The mass encased the aortic arch and branch along with the left and main pulmonary arteries, but did not appear to be originating from the osteocartilaginous structures of the thoracic region (). The patient then underwent a CT-guided needle biopsy, for which a diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor was suggested on a biopsy. Then, the patient was referred to the Dong-A University Medical Center to confirm the diagnosis and undergo further treatment. Although the tumor could not be resected completely due to the extensive invasion into the main vessels, a surgical excision of the mass along with wedge resection of the left upper lung and partial resection of the pericardium was performed. The tumor at the time of surgery was found to invade the pericardium and to be tightly adhered to the left upper lung. However, it could be easily separated from the adjacent ribs.

There was not any correlation with feeding and almost having discomfort at night times. She had periods of constipation and diarrhea and symptoms of leg pains. She also used to take Propranolol for early morning headaches mostly in the frontal region for 2 years. The patient with a probable diagnosis of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) was referred to the pediatric rheumatology clinic for further surveys when 0.5 milligram daily colchicine was taken without considerable clinical response. She also had both an intussusception experiment and a history of negative appendectomy since she was 2 years old and the initiation of abdominal pain since that time. She was never febrile during abdominal pains. General examination revealed a thin hemodynamically stable girl with no signs of acute abdomen; the weight and the length were 15 kg and 105 cm [body mass index (BMI): 14.5 kg/m2].\nShe had second admission within previous 15 days with similar complaints. The grey scale and color Doppler abdominal ultrasonography showed normal portal and splenic veins and there were no evidences of thrombosis. Stool calprotectin test was also requested for a probable inflammatory condition in the gastrointestinal tract.

He had recently been found to have a mood disorder in which he was referred for psychotherapy and started on extended-release bupropion 150 mg daily approximately three weeks ago; he had not associated the relationship between the new medication and the appearance of his rash.\nInitial assessment showed that his vital signs were within normal limits and he was in no acute distress. Cutaneous examination revealed diffuse, scattered erythematous wheals on his abdomen, bilateral flanks, and upper extremities (Figure ). Intraoral and cardiopulmonary examination revealed no airway involvement concerning angioedema, and the remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nCorrelation of the history and clinical features raised suspicion of delayed onset bupropion-associated urticaria; the patient deferred biopsy. He was instructed to discontinue bupropion and was symptomatically managed with oral cetirizine 10 mg daily and diphenhydramine 50 mg in the evening. The skin lesions and associated pruritus significantly improved the following day after treatment initiation and complete resolution of his symptoms and skin lesions was achieved over the following week and antihistamines were discontinued.\nFollowing discontinuation of bupropion and resolution of his skin rash, the patient followed up in the clinic where a care plan for his mood disorder was discussed.

He had no medical history of asthma or food-related allergies. His family history and social history were otherwise unremarkable. He was allergic to phenobarbital medication with no clear details available about the allergic reaction. Physical examination including vital signs and abdominal and cardiorespiratory examination was within normal limits. His neurologic examination was notable for his inability to communicate, follow commands, or ambulate. The basic laboratory investigations including complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and coagulation profile were within normal limits except mild chronic microcytosis. There was no laboratory evidence of peripheral eosinophilia. The IgE-mediated allergic test was unremarkable. He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with upper and distal esophagus biopsy. He had an increased eosinophilic count of >15/hpf () in both biopsies and was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis. He was initially managed with the proton pump inhibitor with persistent esophageal eosinophilia on repeat endoscopy. He was managed with oral 1 mg of budesonide (0.5 mg per ml repulse) two times a day for 6 weeks. The viscous solution was mixed with Splenda\u00ae. The patient's mother reported the compliance to the regimen, and he swallowed the viscous solution with no nausea or vomiting. He continued to have elevated eosinophils on repeat endoscopy despite steroid and elimination diet though the eosinophilic count was significantly decreased compared to previous esophageal biopsy (). He was on oral budesonide during the index presentation to ER and had impaction of a respule. In recent hospital admission, he presented to the emergency department with esophageal foreign body impaction and underwent emergent endoscopy with retrieval of foreign bodies.

    "original_text": "A 20-year-old male presented following a motor vehicle accident. His physical findings included a right-sided tension pneumothorax which was treated with a chest tube, subcutaneous emphysema, and left clavicle fracture. CT of the thoracic spine revealed a longitudinal defect in the posterior membranous wall of his trachea extending into the carina (). With an impending respiratory failure and the possibility of mediastinitis and subsequent sepsis with nonoperative management, it was decided to operate upon the tracheal tear. His past medical history included reflux disease, smoking, and alcohol consumption but no major cardiopulmonary problems. His vital signs were stable so far. The airway was anesthetized in preparation for an awake oral fiberoptic bronchoscopy and a radial arterial line was placed preoperatively. He was then transferred to the operating room and midazolam was titrated for sedation and anxiolysis. With the patient still awake, flexible bronchoscopy was performed to evaluate the posterior pharynx and arytenoids and to remove blood and debris from the airway. The bronchoscope was advanced into the left main-stem bronchus and a reinforced 7.5 size endotracheal tube was placed.

He had decreased appetite, projectile vomiting, no dyspepsia, no history of fever and bowel habits were normal. On examination, a large mass of 10 \u00d7 8 cm was palpated in the left hypochondrium, left lumbar, and umblical region. It was mobile, not moving with respiration and firm in consistency. On palpation of neck, the thyroid gland was found to be enlarged with palpable right lobe. Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy was normal.\nContrast enhanced computed tomography (cect) abdomen showed large lobulated, heterogenously enhancing mass with internal necrosis and calcifications in the left hypochondrium in the region of distal body and tail of pancreas (). There were no other foci of metastasis in abdomen or chest. Chest X-ray of patient was normal. Ultrasound of neck revealed a suspicious nodule in right lobe of thyroid measuring 1*1 cm with no nodal enlargement. Pre-operative ultrasound guided biopsy showed features suggested of poorly differentiated malignancy (that was negative for gastro intestinal stromal tumor markers). His CEA and Ca 19-9 were normal. Fine needle aspiration cytology of thyroid nodule was done under image guidance which was suggestive of papillary carcinoma thyroid.\nAs image guided biopsy of abdominal tumour could not be done patient was planned for laparotomy. At laparotomy, patient was found to have a bilobed tumor arising from the lesser sac adherent to the pancreas and abutting the stomach, transverse colon, and left adrenal and splenic hilum ().

More than a month earlier, she had received a one-week course of clindamycin for a dental abscess, which she took just prior to the onset of facial swelling, redness, and itching. It was thought that these symptoms were due to an allergic reaction to the clindamycin. She was seen in an ED and was given diphenhydramine and prednisone with subjective improvement of the symptoms (follow-up visit one). Since that first ED visit for signs of an allergic reaction, she had four additional visits to different EDs with the same symptoms and was prescribed hydroxyzine during the second visit (follow-up visit two), loratadine during the third visit (follow-up visit three), and additional courses of prednisone in the last two of the five visits (follow-up visits four and five).\nAfter the fifth follow-up visit for symptoms of a presumed allergic reaction, she presented for the same facial swelling this time to our ED. Her facial swelling was worse at night but did not fully resolve during the day. She denied any additional exacerbating or alleviating factors. Of note, the patient denied having a primary care physician or any physician who knew her medical history. At the previous ED visits, she stated that she thought labs had been drawn but was not certain and could not recall the specific dates she had visited each ED.

The patient had regular antenatal visits and was diagnosed to have preeclampsia at 32 weeks of gestation. She was not on any medication. A target scan done at 19 weeks was said to be normal. On examination, her blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg. Systemic examination was normal. Obstetric examination revealed a single live fetus corresponding to thirty-six weeks in breech presentation. On ultrasound examination (Toshiba Nemio 10, curvilinear, 5 MHz probe), there was a fetus corresponding to 36 weeks in breech presentation with an amniotic fluid index of 14. There were two echogenic masses of 4 cm \u00d7 5 cm and 3 cm \u00d7 4 cm, arising from the placenta in close proximity with the occiput of the fetus (). One was cystic, and the other showed lobulation/septation. As there was no defect in the skull, encephalocele was considered to be less likely. Their attachment to other structures could not be traced. Gross fetal intracranial anatomy was normal. On Doppler ultrasound examination, there was minimal vascularity on the surface of the mass. Although magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) is the investigation of choice when an encephalocele is suspected, this investigation could not be done due to patients financial constraints. At thirty-eight weeks of gestation, the patient was posted for cesarean section for breech presentation, and a live male baby of 2.8 kg was delivered. There were no gross external deformities or anomalies in the neonate. The placenta measured 15 cm \u00d7 12 cm \u00d7 4 cm and weighed 250 grams.

Prior to presentation to our hospital, he had bilateral double J stent (DJS) insertion and left extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy followed by FURS and laser stone fragmentation of the left renal stones. Subsequently, he sought medical advice in our facility. Non-contrast CT scan showed multiple bilateral renal stones. In the left kidney, there were 3 stones distributed to middle and lower pole calyces with a stone burden of approximately 3.0 cm as measured using the CT scan. In the right kidney there were also three stones, two in middle calyces and one in the pelvis with a total stone burden of 3.2 cm. After stopping the aspirin for seven days, he underwent simultaneous bilateral FURS and holmium laser lithotripsy and insertion of bilateral DJS under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The surgical procedure took 125 min (65 min for the left side followed by 60 min for the right one) and the procedure was similar in both sides. Following insertion of a hydrophilic tip guidewire (Sensor, 0.038 in), a ureteral access sheath (Inner diameter: 12 Fr, Length: 55 cm) was inserted and the tip was located approximated at the level of ureteropelvic junction.

After discharge from the military, frequency of these episodes was sustained with simple lateral rotation of the head outside the context of trauma for six months with spontaneous abatement.\nAt the age of twenty-one, the first time the patient came to medical attention for the above complaint, the patient's physical and neurologic examinations were completely normal, including cranial nerve exam.

Her initial blood pressure was 172/85, and cranial nerves II through XII were intact except for some mildly decreased sensation to light touch on the left side of her face.

On cardiac examination, the patient had an extra diastolic heart sound, interpreted as a splitting of S2, without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.

    "original_text": "A 63-year-old female presented in 2016 with pain in her left clavicle while out walking her dog. She had a history of grade I, node negative, triple receptor negative ACC of the left breast, which was treated with mastectomy in 2003. Eight years later she was diagnosed with a new primary tumour in the contralateral (right) breast. This was a grade III, 3/17 node positive, ER positive/HER2 negative invasive ductal carcinoma, which was treated with mastectomy, axillary node clearance, chemoradiotherapy and letrozole (Femara, Novartis, UK). The patient had been disease free up to the latest presentation in 2016. The clavicular pain initially settled spontaneously but recurred and prompted further investigations. Clinical examination revealed a mass involving the left clavicle measuring 5 cm in transverse diameter. A radiograph of the left clavicle showed evidence of an expansile destructive lesion at its medial end (). This finding, in addition to the soft tissue invasion, was confirmed on CT (), bone scintigraphy () and PET-CT (). Given the atypical nature of this lesion on a background of breast cancer, a bone biopsy was performed.

She underwent a right brachiocephalic fistula angioplasty in May 2016, but the fistula thrombosed after 5 months and no further efforts were made to rescue it. In February 2017, she underwent a right brachial artery-axillary vein prosthetic graft procedure with a 6 mm \u00d7 30 cm standard wall polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft. The graft was cannulated after 2 weeks and she had uneventful thrice-weekly hemodialysis till October 2017, when the graft flow abruptly ceased and she was referred to our department for further management. A duplex ultrasound examination showed thrombosis of the graft, with a patent brachial artery and axillary vein. She was taken up for a graft thrombectomy, but post thrombectomy poor back bleed was noted indicating an outflow obstruction to be the cause for the thrombosis. A 6-French (F) sheath was placed in the graft and a check venogram was taken which showed a tight stenosis at the venous outflow of approximately 95% []. A 0.035-inch hydrophilic guide wire and a 4-F diagnostic catheter were used to cross the lesion. After successful crossing, a 6 \u00d7 60 balloon catheter was used to dilate the stenosis.
