She described the pain in the epigastric region, which was constant and was radiating to the left the shoulder and was associated with multiple episodes of vomiting without blood. She also revealed that she had fever, cough and shortness of breath for past 1 week for which she self-isolated thinking that she had a coronavirus infection. However, test for coronavirus infection was not performed. Regarding her past medical history, she was diabetic and hypertensive for which she was on medication but had a poor compliance. Upon surgical records, an emergency open appendectomy was done 10 years back. She was non-alcoholic and non-moker. At presentation, she appeared pale, diaphoretic and was in respiratory distress. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 36.3\u00b0C, with a heart rate of 130 beats/min, a blood pressure of 130/80 mm of Hg, a respiratory rate of 24 breath/minute and body mass index 29.2 kg/m2. There was no sign of jaundice. On abdominal examination, abdomen was overtly distended with generalized tenderness with no signs of peritonitis. On rectal examination, tone was normal with stool stained in the finger without palpable mass. The remainder of her systemic examination findings was unremarkable. Laboratory findings consistent with acute severe pancreatitis include an elevated amylase, triglyceride and bilirubin. In addition, an increased in white blood cell count with neutrophila, low hemoglobin level and low albumin were noted (). An arterial blood gas analysis was normal except for mildly raised a lactate level of 2.0.\nRegarding her management at emergency, an aggressive fluid resuscitation with compound sodium lactate 3 litres over half an hour was started. A foley\u2019s catheterization followed by nasogastric tube (NGT) was inserted for gastric decompression. An immediate collection of 900 ml of non-bilious clear fluid was drained.",

He had no habit of drinking alcohol or smoking tobacco. He was diagnosed as having a right renal tumor and underwent right nephrectomy laparoscopically. The pathological diagnosis was right renal cell carcinoma (RCC), clear cell carcinoma, pT1bN0M0, v1 (Fig. ). One and half years later, lymph node swelling was detected at hepatic portal region and he underwent lymphadenectomy. The pathological diagnosis was a metastasis from RCC. Two years after diagnosis, he was suspected of lung metastases and started treatment with interferon \u03b1. Three years later, the multiple lung metastases grew larger and were determined as progression despite interferon \u03b1 therapy. At this point, he was referred to our hospital in October 2016. There were no abnormalities on physical examination and his vital signs were normal. He started treatment with sunitinib 50 mg/day on a schedule of 4 weeks on treatment and 2 weeks off; however, adverse events including grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 49,000/\u03bcL), gum swelling, and hoarseness became intolerable 2 weeks after starting sunitinib. Four weeks after cessation of sunitinib 50 mg/day, he was started on a dose of sunitinib 25 mg/day on a schedule of 2 weeks on and 1 week off. Computed tomography (CT) findings in January 2017 revealed that his lung metastases had shrunk; however, he continued to experience the same adverse events. Therefore, the dose of sunitinib was further reduced to 12.5 mg/day on a schedule of 2 weeks on and 1 week off. CT findings in May 2017 revealed new metastases in the pleura, diaphragm, and the right paracolic gutter (Fig. a, b). As a result, the treatment was changed from sunitinib to axitinib and he started treatment with axitinib at 10 mg/day; however, adverse events including gum swelling",

Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) chemotherapy had been performed on the patient for liver cancer for one year. Five months before visiting the cancer pain unit at our hospital, metastasis to the right chest fifth rib had been discovered, and the patient had received radiation therapy. In the subsequent MRI and bone scan of the thoracic vertebrae, right fifth rib metastasis with extraosseous mass formation had been observed. The patient had the underlying diseases of hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis and, at the time of referral, had been using Ultracet Tab\u2122 (acetaminophen 325 mg tramadol hydrochloride 37.5 mg, Janssen Korea LTD, Korea) 2 tab tid for pain control. However, the right chest pain had gradually worsened and been causing sleep disturbance. Hence, a thoracic epidural injection had been performed during hospitalization, but 3 days after the procedure, the pain had worsened, with the NRS score increasing again to 6/10 from 2/10; thus scrambler therapy (MC5-A Calmare\u00ae) was planned for the patient. The patient complained of chest pain in the right fifth rib area, so the scrambler electrodes were attached to 2 normal sensory areas to the left and right of the right fifth rib pain area for treatment. As the 10 sessions of treatment progressed, it was clear that the pain area was gradually contracting, and the location of the electrodes was adjusted accordingly for treatment. After 2 sessions of scrambler therapy, the NRS score decreased to 2/10, and the treatment effect continued until the next morning. The administration of Ultracet Tab\u2122 was stopped accordingly.

She was 152 cm tall and 51.2 kg in weight. Laboratory examinations showed no signs of bacteria or viral infection. Complete blood cell count, prothrombin time and activated partial thrombin time tests showed normal results, and there were no abnormal results in the serologic tests (HBs Ag/Ab, HIV Ag/Ab, quantitive VDRL).\nAfter diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia, the patient received an epidural block once a week for a total of six weeks. We performed the epidural block with 8 ml of 0.8% mepivacaine with the paramedian approach to T10-T11 with the 'loss of resistance' method. Out of six total procedures, only the first procedure included 20 mg of triamcinolone with local anesthetics, and the rest were composed of local anesthetics only. Any signs or symptoms suggestive of dural puncture, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) aspiration through the block needle, headache, paresthesia or sensory impairment were not observed during each epidural block. Pregabalin 150 mg and amitriptyline 5 mg were also prescribed for twice a day. After each epidural block, a pain free period continued for two or three days but she felt numbness like prior to the procedure. Additionally",

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed that an IVC filter strut had penetrated the third portion of the duodenum (arrow, Fig. ), and this was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) (arrow, Fig. ). In order to retrieve the IVC filter, the patient was referred to our department. He had a history of testicular cancer with para-aorta lymph node metastasis. Left renal vein thrombosis developed because of neoadjuvant chemotherapy before RPLND, and anticoagulants were administered before RPLND. Three years previously, he had undergone left orchiectomy, retro-mediastinal lymph node dissection, and RPLND at the previous hospital. The left common iliac vein was intraoperatively damaged during RPLND. Because the previous surgeon was worried about the high incidence of postoperative DVT and PTE, anticoagulant therapy was continued after RPLND. However, because DVT developed in the left common iliac vein after the initial surgery, a retrievable IVC filter (ALN, France) was placed in the IVC caudal to the renal vein to prevent PTE, and the patient had been receiving anticoagulant therapy. Because follow-up CT after IVC filter placement showed that DVT persisted at the left common iliac vein despite anticoagulant therapy, the IVC filter could not be retrieved at the previous hospital.\nEnhanced CT also revealed that DVT remained in the left common iliac vein. Because ultrasound examination showed organized DVT, an IVC filter was considered unnecessary. An endovascular approach was considered unfeasible for retrieval because two of the filter struts had penetrated the duodenal wall. An extensive discussion with an internal medicine specialist was performed. Because DVT remained with no remarkable changes in CT images for 3 years and the incidence of PTE caused by DVT in the left common iliac vein would be low, we chose surgical treatment for this patient in order to prevent bleeding at the duodenum.\nThe IVC filter was retrieved",

According to the patient party, she was unable to perform normal daily activities with normal conversation five days ago. The weakness of the left half of the body first appeared in the left lower limb, followed by worsening of that of the left upper limb. The patient developed slurring of speech and global aphasia later. There was a history of fever for 20 days, which was intermittent; the maximum temperature recorded was 103 degrees F associated with chills, rigor and excessive sweating. The patient also complained of multiple episodes of vomiting. History of clenching of teeth, up rolling of eyes, and abnormal body movements was also present.\nThe chest examination was normal. Cardiac rhythm and rate were normal with no murmurs. The abdomen was flat, soft, and non-tender with normal liver and spleen.

After the detailed physical examination and reviewing of X-ray images, it was decided that UKR would be the most suitable option for the patient with anteromedial knee osteoarthritis. After spinal anesthesia application and sedation, the UKR surgery was performed with a standard minimal invasive midline vertical incision and a medial parapatellar approach; the patella was removed laterally but not dislocated or everted. The patient received a medial partial knee implant with a mobile-bearing insert (medium size with 4 mm thickness; Oxford\u00ae, Zimmer Biomet Inc., Warsaw, IN, USA). Following the UKR surgery (), weight bearing was allowed as tolerated by the patient and a standard postoperative physiotherapy was started on the first postoperative day. The patient was discharged at postop 2nd day when she met the following criteria: independent ability to get dressed, to get in and out of the bed, and to sit and rise from a chair/toilet; independence in personal care; and mobilization with crutches. After discharge, a home-based exercise program was given to the patient. At postoperative follow-up, our patient acquired a full knee RoM in the postop 1st month and returned to independent daily activities without any external support in the postop 3rd month.\nAt postoperative 1st year after first UKR application, the patient fell down while getting on a public bus; this caused that the right knee of the patient was exposed to the valgus force vector.

She had presented with central chest pain radiating down her left arm with ECG findings of 2 mm ST elevation in V2 and V3. There was no recent history of psychological stress although she had been on antidepressant drugs for two years. Four hours after thrombolysis she developed acute pulmonary oedema and a new systolic murmur. At this stage it was presumed she had acute mitral regurgitation secondary to a ruptured papillary muscle, ischaemic dysfunction or an acute ventricular septal defect.\nShe was transferred on heparin and glyceryl trinitrate infusion, in acute pulmonary oedema (confirmed by chest X-ray), with a systolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg, and heart rate of 130/minute. Urgent echocardiogram showed severe mitral regurgitation (see Figure ). Her mitral valve annulus was slightly widened at 3.2 cm and subvalvular structures were intact. She also had left ventricular apical ballooning (LVAB) and systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve leaflet with septal contact \u2013 left ventricular outflow tract gradient (LVOT) 60\u201370 mmHg (see Figures and ). Coronary angiography fourteen hours after her presentation showed no obstructive coronary lesions. Ventriculogram revealed akinesis of the anterolateral wall and apex of her left ventricle, more extensive than any single coronary territory, and grade 4/4 mitral regurgitation (see Figures and ).\nShe had an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) inserted and was transferred to theatre shortly thereafter. She was in cardiogenic shock, with severe MR and SAM still prominent, despite the IABP.

He had last been admitted to the hospital 2 weeks earlier for diarrhea and fever, diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and discharged 10 days prior with oral vancomycin. At the time of current presentation, his immunosuppression regimen included tacrolimus 1 mg twice daily, mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg twice daily, and prednisone 5 mg daily. He reported temporal insertion of indwelling urinary catheters during some of his previous hospital admissions for management of small bowel obstruction. Otherwise, he denied any intravenous (IV) drug use, history of urethral instrumentation, or chronic indwelling urinary catheters.

Physical examination showed synovitis of his metacarpophalangeal joints and wrists. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was >120 mm/hr, and rheumatoid factor was negative. He was diagnosed with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis, and prednisone was initiated at 10 mg daily in 1999.

A chest radiograph was normal, and computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen and pelvis were unremarkable. A bone marrow biopsy was normal and cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi were negative. Multiple blood cultures for bacteria were negative.

As topical therapy was ineffective, systemic therapy with cyclosporine was administered up to the end of 2016, but discontinued due to increased systolic blood pressure in the absence of noticeable clinical improvement. In Jan 2017, the patient was administered methotrexate (10 mg/week sc followed by folic acid 24 h later).\nAfter 17 weeks on methotrexate, there was no significant clinical improvement with significant and severe involvement of the dorsal surface of the hands (). Given this, and following appropriate screening exams, the patient was given adalimumab in April 2017 (initial dose of 80 mg, followed by 40 mg every other week starting 1 week after the initial dose).

His medical history was relevant for benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic renal insufficiency, arthritis and hypertension. His social history included tobacco use in the remote past. His vital signs and results of a review of systems were unremarkable. Results of a blood investigation showed a significant left shift with 82% segmented neutrophils. Urine analysis revealed cloudy urine, positive for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, small amount of blood and ketones. Microscopic examination of his urine showed 10 to 20 red blood cells (RBC) per high power field (HPF) and a field full of white blood cells (WBC) and bacteria. Our patient underwent cytoscopy after blood oozed out during initial catheter insertion. A complete investigation for hematuria including a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed that revealed a bladder mass. A TUR was undertaken, and histopathology confirmed the mass as being a high-grade bladder carcinoma. A follow-up metastatic investigation including a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, pelvis and bone were negative. Our patient developed increasing pelvic pain and significant hematuria. A radical cystoprostatectomy was subsequently performed revealing a multi-centric, ill-defined urothelial carcinoma (9 \u00d7 7 cm) infiltrating the right pericystic soft tissue and encompassing the right ureteral orifice. Our patient tolerated the surgical procedure well. His post-operative course was complicated by right deep venous thrombosis occluding the right common femoral vein. A histopathological examination of the bladder tumor revealed a high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma (Figure ) completely involving the dome and posterior wall, and partially involving the anterior and right lateral walls.

As part of the routine postoperative follow-up management, the recipient underwent DUS to assess the patency of the graft on postoperative day 1. The DUS finding was suspicious for an acute arterial thrombosis but did not reveal any focal irregularities. Consequently, a computed tomography (CT) scan was urgently obtained but it did not show any arterial complications. However, it serendipitously revealed a 2.4-cm lesion on the upper pole of the renal allograft which was not detected during the back-table or ultrasonography monitoring. A biopsy of the lesion was performed, and its histology revealed an epithelial proliferation of large cells with finely granular cytoplasm and medium round nucleus vesicular acidophilus, arranged tubules, and alveoli and cords immersed in a connective tissue stroma. This picture was consistent with oncocytoma. However, because the eosinophilic variant of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (RCC) may morphologically resemble renal oncocytoma, immunohistochemical staining was performed using Ki-67 antibodies and RCC antigens. The results were negative, ruling out chromophobe RCC. The therapeutic options and potential related outcomes were clearly discussed with the patient. Given the low risk of malignant transformation in an oncocytoma [], we found no reason for resection of the lesion or an allograft nephrectomy.

Computed tomography (CT) at a local hospital showed that there was an irregular mass in the upper lobe of her left lung, about 2.8 \u00d7 1.9 cm in size, with a clear boundary, peripheral spiculation, and stretched adjacent pleura. The patient had no symptoms such as cough, sputum, dyspnea, fever, and hemoptysis. One month ago, she underwent surgery for the left breast cancer in the local hospital. A second chest CT showed no significant changes in the mass. Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) revealed an irregular high-density mass in the left lung with increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake, no significant abnormal FDG metabolism in the rest of the body, multiple small lymph nodes in the left axilla, and slightly increased FDG uptake in some lymph nodes.\nFor further treatment, the patient was admitted to our department. There was no obvious abnormality on physical examination. The chest CT showed an irregular soft tissue mass in the anterior segment of the upper lobe of the left lung, and the border was not clear. The cross-sectional area was about 3.2 \u00d7 2.2 cm, and the spiculation sign could be seen. The plain CT value was 30 HU. Calcification of the patch was obvious after enhanced scanning, and the CT value was 98 HU. The mediastinal structure was clear, and no obvious enlarged lymph nodes were seen (Fig. ).

The pain has been episodic for the last 4 years and had significantly affected his work and family life. He was seen and admitted to multiple hospitals across Abu Dhabi, including our own, attended different specialists, and underwent a wide range of investigations including blood tests (CBC and differential count, liver and renal profiles and CRP), gastroscopies, colonoscopies, and CT scans and a laparoscopy. The results of all his clinical assessments and investigations did not show any sign.\nOn one of his acute admissions to CCAD, the immunologist was asked to review the patient. Detailed examination of the patient's medical history starting from the onset of symptoms reveled that he used to get 2 swelling episodes every week affecting his face, hands, feet or scrotum and severe abdominal pain twice a week. These swelling episodes and abdominal pain appeared suddenly without any obvious triggering factor, developed over 36 hours and resolved spontaneously in 5-7 days without any medication including analgesics. He reported no laryngeal swellings or respiratory compromise. He denied any fevers, night sweats, weight loss, change in bowel habits or blood in his stools. His swelling episodes were occasionally associated with non-pruritic red skin rash that was mistaken for chronic urticaria for which he was treated with Omalizumab (300mg every 4 weeks) for 9 months without any benefit. Moreover, his response to different types of analgesia, high dose antihistamines, antibiotics and corticosteroids was unsatisfactory. He is a thalassemia carrier; otherwise he is fit and healthy and has no past medical history of note. He has no family history of immunodeficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmunity or FMF.

There was no history of cholecystitis, gallstones, pancreatitis, or abdominal surgeries in the past. He denied any fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation at the time of admission. He was an active smoker (1 pack of cigarettes daily) but denied use of alcohol or illicit drugs. On neurological exam, there was contralateral hemiplegia and hemiparesis of left face, arm, and leg. Power was 0/5 in left upper and lower extremity, and reflexes were absent bilaterally. His speech was slurred, and he failed swallowing evaluation in the emergency department. He was not a tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) candidate as the time of onset of stroke was unknown. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain without contrast showed subacute to acute infarct in the right middle cerebral artery territory. Magnetic resonance angiography of the brain showed acute occlusion of middle cerebral artery in the proximal M1 segment. Carotid Doppler showed mild stenosis of internal carotid arteries bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram was done to rule out embolic source of stroke, which revealed ejection fraction of 45% with no valvular abnormalities and shunting. His chest X-ray was unremarkable. Two days later, he suffered septic shock with a fever of 39\u00b0C and hypotension. Blood, urine, and respiratory cultures were obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn) were started empirically. Two blood cultures were positive for Klebsiella oxytoca, which was sensitive to ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and gentamycin and resistant to ampicillin and cefazolin. Urine and respiratory cultures did not grow any bacteria. Antibiotics were tailored to ceftriaxone based on the sensitivity results. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen, as part of workup for septic shock, showed dilated common bile duct. Right",

Edges of the wound reached the ulnar and radial digital neurovascular bundle. The patient reported decreased sensibility of the end phalanx including painful range of motion (ROM) but without loss of function of all tendons. We found a restricted finger blood flow detected by nail bed compression in comparison with the uninjured fingers. An X-ray showed an undislocated transverse fracture of the middle phalanx (Figure ). The patient was immediately transferred to the operating room (OR) where the wound was examined. Severe damage of the surrounding soft tissue was seen. Microscopic examination revealed no defect of the crushed vessels, the radial digital nerve was intact, but an epineural lesion was apparent for the ulnar digital nerve. A minimal osteosynthesis with two Kirschner-wires (K-wires) was performed. X-ray imaging showed an anatomical retention and fixation of the fracture (Figure ). The dorsal wound of the ring finger was cut out and sutured. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the fourth day without any sign of wound healing disturbance. The ring finger was immobilized with a finger splint including the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) and distal interphalangeal joint (DIP).\nThe patient was seen five months after initial treatment in our Out-Patient Clinic and reported painful moving of the right ring finger.

The patient was euthyroid with normal serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and free thyroxine (FT4) during replacement therapy with L-T4. At physical examination, a palpable nodule of ~2 cm in size was detected in the isthmus of the thyroid. There were no palpable cervical lymph-nodes. An US evaluation confirmed an isolated lesion located in the isthmus, showing an isoechoic solid nodule with smooth margins; its size was 18 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 6 mm with intra and perilesional vascularity (Figure ). Therefore, a FNA was performed and cytological results revealed a TIR3A lesion. The cytological specimen showed an increased cellularity with some microfollicular structures in the background of scant colloid (Figure ). Thus, we assessed the risk factors associated with the isolated TIR 3A nodule of our patient. According to the ATA guidelines we repeated the FNA which confirmed the same result (TIR3A). The second US (after 6 months) showed that there were no clear signs suggesting malignancy such as microcalcifications or taller than wide-shaped nodules. However, we found a small hypoechoic cranial component in the nodule with blurred margins and elastography revealed an increased stiffness in this cranial component.

Initially, the symptoms were characterized by headaches and difficulty in concentrating. One week later, she experienced a right cervical sore throat with radiation to the ear. She presented to her primary care physician, who performed an ultrasound on the neck and detected, in addition to thyroid nodules in the left lobe, a newly appeared, large, hypoechoic, and indistinct structure in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. Furthermore, the patient was seen by an otolaryngologist, which revealed no findings other than the sonographic abnormality in the thyroid gland. Therefore, the patient was presented to our thyroid outpatient clinic for further diagnostics and clarification of a possible fast-growing malignant nodule.\nThe patient did not have any past medical history for autoimmune thyroid diseases or recent upper respiratory tract infections. Family history included benign thyroid nodules on the paternal side. The patient's medication consists of a birth control pill and Gynokadin (estrogen for hormone replacement therapy).\nThe thyroid gland presented with mild pressure pain. Sonography showed a normal-sized thyroid (10 ml) with land-map-shaped, hypoechoic, confluent areas with decreased vascularity almost filling the right thyroid lobe ().

In addition, in 2001, a right-sided localised ductal breast cancer in situ was identified and was treated surgically with a partial mastectomy. Secondary to her lymph node dissection, she developed lymphoedema of her left arm, which had been continuously treated with compression stockings. The patient was on treatment with an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker due to hypertension, and in addition, she had a known systolic murmur, characterized as physiological, as transthoracic echocardiographs in 2011 and 2017 were normal. Since her surgery in 1999, on a total of six occasions prior to her last and seventh visit, of which the first episode occurred in 2008, she had been treated for erysipelas in her left upper arm.

    "original_text": "The patient, a 69-year-old male office worker, was incidentally found to have esophageal candidiasis at an annual medical checkup and referred to our hospital 3 years previously. He was an ex-smoker and had a history of moderate alcohol intake. He complained of neither dysphagia nor any other gastrointestinal symptoms. Radiological and endoscopic examinations demonstrated diffuse EIPD involving almost the entire length of the esophagus (Fig. ), esophageal candidiasis, mild GERD, and atrophic gastritis. The orifices of EIPD periodically repeated active opening and closing movements and excreted turbid mucinous material onto the mucosal surface. The esophageal lumen showed mild narrowing, especially in the upper and lower portions, most likely due to submucosal chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Administration of antifungal drugs and proton pump inhibitors was started, and antibiotics for eradication of Helicobacter pylori were also given.\nThereafter, the patient was followed by periodic endoscopic examinations at 3- or 6-month intervals, and candidiasis showed repeated relapses and remissions for about 2 years. When candidiasis relapsed, movements of the orifices of EIPD tended to be reduced, and some of the orifices were covered by white coatings that represented exudates produced by Candida infection. The esophageal mucosa showed diffuse and mild redness and edema. The patient remained almost asymptomatic throughout the clinical course.\nOn endoscopy performed 2 and a half years after the first visit, multiple, small, whitish, scaly flecks were noted on the mucosal surface (Fig. ). They were longitudinally aligned and mainly found along the orifices of EIPD from the middle to lower esophagus.

She had no additional medical history or familial medical history. Transvaginal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figures and ) revealed two pelvic cysts. The left-sided unilocular cyst was 9 cm in diameter. The right-sided multilocular cyst was 5 cm in diameter. We diagnosed this condition as bilateral ovarian cysts.\nAlthough the serum levels of tumor markers (CA125, CA19-9, and CEA) were normal for a pregnant woman, considering the large size of the cyst, cyst resection was attempted at 14 weeks; however, it was converted to probe laparotomy. Marked adhesion around the cysts, posterior uterus, and Douglas' pouch made cyst resection impossible as extensive adhesiolysis may cause uterine damage and also uterine contractions after surgery. Gross examinations revealed no metastatic lesions or lymph node swelling. Abdominal fluid cytology revealed no malignant cells.\nAt 32 weeks of gestation, MRI revealed that the left-sided cyst size had increased to 27 cm in diameter (Figures and ), although she was asymptomatic. As shown in , the right-sided multilocular cyst became very close to the left monocytic cyst. At this stage, the left large monocytic cyst appeared to merge with the smaller right multilocular cyst, forming a large cyst occupying the entire pelvic cavity, which was later confirmed by laparoscopic findings.\nThis large cyst showed no solid-part or papillary growth. The serum levels of tumor markers remained normal. Malignant ovarian tumor could not be ruled out but was considered less likely.

On arrival to the emergency room, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated extensive acute pancreatitis, complicated by extensive necrosis, and a multiloculated fluid collection replacing most of the body and proximal tail of the pancreas, measuring 20 cm by 3.2 cm. Initial laboratory testing was notable for lactic acidosis. During the hospitalization, the patient was found to have P. anaerobius bacteremia, developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient subsequently required multiple hospitalizations for endoscopic drainage of the fluid collection and pancreatic stent placement.\nPrior to the development of acute necrotizing pancreatitis, the patient had longstanding and complicated history of psychopharmacology for the treatment of schizophrenia. His psychotic illness was refractory to the treatment with multiple typical and atypical antipsychotics, including a trial of clozapine that was ceased due to the development of neutropenia. After a series of failed antipsychotic trials, the patient was eventually stabilized for twelve years on a regimen of haloperidol 10 mg daily, haloperidol decanoate 100 mg every four weeks, and olanzapine 20 mg daily. The patient developed hypertriglyceridemia eight years prior to the development of pancreatitis and was treated with 500 mg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 500 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) with subsequent improvement in his triglyceride levels. Of note, eight months prior to the development of pancreatitis, the patient's triglyceride level was 162 mg/dL (greater than 200 mg/dL is considered high).

The pain was dull in nature, was more severe on the right side, and was progressively increasing in intensity resulting in a limping gait. Pain worsened with walking, bending, and minor activity and was partially relieved with rest. Patient self-prescribed analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which used to relief pain transiently.\nThe patient is otherwise healthy with no history of metabolic bone disease, menstrual irregularities, previous fractures, eating disorders, or strenuous athletic activity. No family history of osteoporosis was reported. The course of pregnancy was smooth with no remarkable back, hip, or buttocks pain reported. The total weight gained during pregnancy was 14 kg. She was maintained on supplemental iron, calcium (1000 mg daily), and vitamin D (800 international units (IU)) daily as of the second trimester. At term, she presented in labor and received epidural anesthesia. The first stage of labor was 7 h and second stage was 100 min. She had an uneventful, spontaneous, normal vaginal delivery without the need for forceps or vacuum application. The baby was healthy and weighed 3350 g.\nTwo weeks after onset of her symptoms, the patient sought medical attention because of persisting pain and abnormal gait. On physical exam, the patient was of average body habitus with height 164 cm and weight 60 kg. Mobility of the lumbosacral spine was within normal limits. Tenderness around the upper gluteal region and sacrum was noted bilaterally; more evident on the right side.\nPelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed to rule out soft tissue lesions, demonstrated moderate-to-severe bone marrow edema involving the right sacrum along its entire length with a non-displaced fracture line. Mild edema was also seen involving the left sacrum. Results of the MRI are displayed in Fig. and .\nD",

He had a history of a blunt trauma injury to his right eye that occurred 49 years ago, and he subsequently experienced hyphema, vitreous hemorrhages, and traumatic cataract. Over the past 10 years, he experienced episodes of ocular pain phthisis bulbi associated with trigeminal neuralgia. A slit lamp examination of his right eye showed band keratopathy and seclusion pupillae, with a brunescent traumatic cataract. A funduscopic examination of his right eye was not executable due to media opacity. His left eye was normal without any kind of lesions and had an uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of 20/20. A right eye ultrasound B-scan examination showed a phthisic eye, with complete retinal detachment, and hyperechogenic tissues with an acoustic shadowing due to calcification projected into the orbital tissue. For that reason, the clinicians decided to perform the enucleation of his right eye. His past medical history was positive for asymptomatic lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma associated with immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal peak diagnosed 12 years before enucleation. At the onset, neither lymphadenopathies nor hepatosplenomegaly were described, and 20% bone marrow infiltration was documented. Our patient was periodically followed up without any treatment with evidence of a slow progressive disease, which did not require treatment up until now. Prior to the enucleation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain was performed to study a possible trigeminal neuralgia and was normal without any cerebral lesions.\nThe eyeball was removed and marked fibrosis with places of osseous metamorphism was noticed macroscopically.

Blood biochemistry, tumor biomarkers, other blood tests as well as urine analysis were normal. Electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were also normal.\nWhen the patient presented in our hospital, two units of blood were transfused. The gastroduodenoscopy was performed again. A sealed ulcer without any signs of bleeding sign were found in the antrum. We then performed a CE. Bleeding was found in the jejunum after running the capsule for 97 min. The total running time in the small bowel was about 300 min. The CE cannot determine the cause of bleeding due to the short stay around the lesion and the influence of the blood. An anterograde BAE was performed, and a protruded lesion was revealed in the jejunum at about 150 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. It filled half of the intestinal cavity. The tumor was lobulated with white patches on the mucosal surface with blood oozing in the fundus (Figure ).
