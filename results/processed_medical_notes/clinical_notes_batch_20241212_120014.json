    "original_text": "A 53-year-old man presented with subcutaneous hydrops and abdominal distension on the 3rd postoperative day after exploratory laparotomy for intestinal obstruction due to an abdominal cocoon in another hospital. He was transferred to our department on the 7th day because of incision exudation similar to intestinal contents and progressive abdominal distension. Abdominal CT showed dehiscence of a fraction of the linea alba and subcutaneous hydrops. To verify the characteristics of subcutaneous hydrops, a skin suture was removed, and the intestinal contents flowed out of the subcutaneous cavity. When several other sutures were removed sequentially, an approximately 1-cm defect on the small intestine was identified with exposure to the air. Re-suturing of the intestinal defect and linea alba was initially attempted but failed because of the friability of the bowel wall and the severe adhesions surrounding the incision. However, severe adhesions also prevented the spread of infection. Thus, conservative treatment was the only option. Under local anesthesia, a new fistula tract measuring approximately 6 cm was constructed with embedding of the triple-cavity tube in subcutaneous tissues (Fig. ). Continuous negative pressure at \u221280 mm Hg was applied, and the net output exceeded 500 ml/day in the first few days. Because of the mild infection, an antibiotic was administered according to a bacterial culture sensitivity test. Octreotide and TPN were administered until controlled fistula tract formation was identified by fistulography 7 days later.

    "cleaned_text": "a 53-year-old man presented with subcutaneous hydrops and abdominal distension on the 3rd postoperative day after exploratory laparotomy for intestinal obstruction due to an abdominal cocoon in another hospital. he was transferred to our department on the 7th day because of incision exudation similar to intestinal contents and progressive abdominal distension. abdominal ct showed dehiscence of a fraction of the linea alba and subcutaneous hydrops. to verify the characteristics of subcutaneous hydrops, a skin suture was removed, and the intestinal contents flowed out of the subcutaneous cavity. when several other sutures were removed sequentially, an approximately 1-cm defect on the small intestine was identified with exposure to the air. re-suturing of the intestinal defect and linea alba was initially attempted but failed because of the friability of the bowel wall and the severe adhesions surrounding the incision. however, severe adhesions also prevented the spread of infection. thus, conservative treatment was the only option. under local anesthesia, a new fistula tract measuring approximately 6 cm was constructed with embedding of the triple-cavity tube in subcutaneous tissues (fig. ). continuous negative pressure at \u221280 mm hg was applied, and the net output exceeded 500 ml/day in the first few days. because of the mild infection, an antibiotic was administered according to a bacterial culture sensitivity test. octreotide and tpn were administered until controlled fistula tract formation was identified by fistulography 7 days later. after anus exhaust, an elemental diet was given, and recombinant human growth hormone was administered at a dosage of 8 u/day instead of octreotide. oral loperamide hydrochloride capsules were administered to reduce the intestinal output. however, no apparent signs of tract growth were found when recombinant human growth hormone was administered for 3 weeks. thus, to avoid the side effects of long-term use, recombinant human growth hormone administration was stopped. the fistula finally healed on the 48th day after tract construction. no fistula recurrence and other relevant complication appeared during follow-up at",

In view of no improvement, a repeat dose of IVIg 2 g/kg over 5 days was given. The patient required prolonged ventilation; therefore, tracheostomy was done. After 14 days of the second course of IVIg, no improvement was observed, so seven cycles of plasmapheresis were done. Following which, the child showed improvement in the power of respiratory muscle, and slowly, the patient was weaned off from a ventilator. There was an improvement in power of the upper limb muscle, followed by lower limb muscle. Gradually, the patient continued to improve; hence, the patient was weaned off from oxygen, and tracheostomy tube was removed.\nAfter 1\u00bd months of admission and almost 1 month after IVIg therapy and 15 days after the last plasmapheresis cycle, the child had five episodes of convulsions generalized in nature. Following which, the patient had altered sensorium, inappropriate talks, and complete loss of vision. Blood pressure was normal.

His past surgical history included having undergone left parietal tumor resection in May 2016, the postoperative pathology of which indicated glial sarcoma (World Health Organization grade IV). In July 2017, the patient presented with paroxysmal headache with weakness of the right limb.

The results of the patient\u2019s cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examinations were all unremarkable. His baseline blood pressure was in the range of 120\u2013140 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and 65\u201385 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. He denied any current medication, tobacco, or alcohol use, and a family history of NF was also excluded.\nThe results of the patient\u2019s preoperative laboratory examination were unremarkable, including blood and urine analysis. His electrocardiographic examination showed normal sinus rhythm. His chest x-ray revealed multiple nodules in the two lung fields, the largest being located in the upper right quadrant of the lung field and having a diameter of about 29 mm. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed the recurrence of glioma. The patient was scheduled for resection of the recurrent gliomas.\nDuring the preoperative examination, it was thought that general anesthesia application would be more appropriate for the patient.

Significant medical history included diabetes mellitus type 2, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diastolic heart failure.

The patient did not have any neurosurgical signs, loss of consciousness (LOC), dizziness or vomiting. The Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of the patient was 15 when he was referred to our department.\nThe main complaints of the patient were pain on the right side of the neck and lower jaw during chewing and swallowing. Although the patient experienced pain during mandibular movements and yawning, no limitation of jaw movements was observed. The nature of the pain was sharp and intermittent and lasted a few seconds every time the patient turned his head or upon chewing. The maximum mouth opening (MMO) was about 46 millimeters and there was no deviation in mandibular movements. On clinical examination, there was neither extra-oral swelling nor tenderness of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) or masticatory muscles. Intra-oral examination did not show any occlusal problems or premature contact. The patient did not mention any surgical history or tonsillectomy. He did not complain of symptoms mimicking glossopharyngeal neuralgia.\nA panoramic radiograph was obtained from the patient (). The radiographic view of the jaws showed elongated SP in the left side whereas the right SP was normal in size but displaced. The right displaced SP on panoramic view suggested fracture of this process without mandibular condyle fracture. Computed tomography (CT) was obtained for more evaluation and to detect other possible fractures. The CT views confirmed right SP fracture ().\nThe treatment plan for the patient was conservative treatment and follow-up. He was instructed to restrict neck movements.

She was a healthy woman without any neurological dysfunction or any other medical history. She had no important bleeding risk factors, including medical treatment for anticoagulation, and no history of heavy lifting or trauma. In another hospital, she underwent a normal cesarean section under spinal epidural anesthesia and the whole procedure had no specific complications. However, one day after delivery, paraplegia and sensory loss below D7 dermatome did not recover. In addition, she could not feel any sense of defecation and urination. Anal tone was impaired and fecal compaction was discovered. Other symptoms included a mild fever and neck stiffness as well. She was admitted to our neurosurgical department and spine magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan was performed. Her initial spine MRI scan showed an abnormal spinal cord lesion from C2 level to D5, which was suspicious of a spinal cord swelling with a proximal syrinx or a hemorrhage formation. The lesion showed heterogeneous high signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI. On T1-weighted image, the lesion showed irregular rim enhancement (). In our case, the margin of enhancing lesion was poorly demarcated. Considering the patient's history, namely, the lack of symptoms prior to delivery and then the occurrence of acute neurological symptom immediately after delivery under spinal anesthesia, acute bleeding of intramedullary tumor or infection, or other autoimmune diseases were suspicious as a differential diagnosis. The patient had a mild fever with neck stiffness, however Kernig sign and Bruzinski sign were both negative in this patient. For exclusion of central nervous system infection, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study and laboratory study were undertaken. On CSF study, the value of white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell, protein, and glucose was 2, 0, 37, and 82, respectively. This result was within the normal range. Additionally, CSF culture was done, however it showed no growth of bacteria. On",

Since both his past medical history and an abdominal ultrasound performed on admission were unremarkable he was discharged with the indication to see a Nephrologist. At the Nephrology outpatient clinic, because of the reduced eGFR and of the presence of proteinuria (300 mg/24 h), an hospitalization for further investigations was planned.\nWhile waiting for the admission, a couple of weeks later, the patient was admitted to the emergency room in another hospital for abdominal pain and dyspnea. On admittance the ECG tracing performed showed sinus rhythm with diffuse repolarization abnormalities. Further exams revealed an increase of troponin (54 ng/ml) and transaminases levels (GOT 50 U/L; GPT 125 U/L) and a cardiac ultrasound showed a severe left ventricular dysfunction with right heart failure. Patient was thus admitted to the coronary intensive care unit. During his hospital stay the possibility of acute myocarditis was excluded because of the absence of a recent viral syndrome and the negativity of IgM antibodies against the viruses most commonly affecting the cardiovascular system and because of the low inflammatory indexes. An abdominal ultrasound demonstrated abdominal and pleural effusions, regular size and morphology of spleen and liver, no pancreatic changes; both kidneys had normal size but showed irregular margins and a reduced thickness of the cortex, no hydronephrosis nor stones were observed.

His planned chemotherapy for myelodysplastic syndrome had been stopped a month before due to fungal infection of the orbit. The initial absolute neutrophil count was only 130/mm3, and antibiotic therapy was initiated under the possibility of pneumonia or aggravation of orbital infection. Even after 7 days of antibiotic therapy, the fever persisted and no evidence of infection was found. We performed transthoracic echocardiography under suspicion of infective endocarditis; a 13 mm echogenic mass was found on the atrial side of the tricuspid valve (). Similar findings were also revealed by transesophageal echocardiography. Fortunately, no functional abnormalities of the valve were seen on echocardiography.\nBased on the clinical symptoms and the echocardiographic findings, the patient was highly suspected of having infective endocarditis of the tricuspid valve. He was scheduled for emergency surgical removal due to the possibility of fungal endocarditis and the poor clinical course of infective endocarditis in immunocompromised patients. With a cardiopulmonary bypass, the right atrium was opened after aortic cross-clamping and cardioplegic arrest. On the exploration, a solitary polypoid gelatinous mass 13\u00d716 mm in size infiltrating the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve was found in the surgical field (). Although the tumor had a stalk, simple resection without making a defect in the septal leaflet appeared to be impossible, because the leaflet was too thin. Therefore, the mass was excised with part of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve using the quadrangular resection technique, followed by reconstruction with autologous pericardium. After successful weaning from the cardiopulmonary bypass, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was performed, showing no residual tumors. The tricuspid valve was found to be competent without any functional deficits after operation. Papillary fibroelastoma was pathologically confirmed, and no evidence of infective endocarditis was found (). Follow-up transthoracic echocardiography showed no residual or recurrent tumor, with uneventful postoperative recovery.",

Since both his past medical history and an abdominal ultrasound performed on admission were unremarkable he was discharged with the indication to see a Nephrologist. At the Nephrology outpatient clinic, because of the reduced eGFR and of the presence of proteinuria (300 mg/24 h), an hospitalization for further investigations was planned.\nWhile waiting for the admission, a couple of weeks later, the patient was admitted to the emergency room in another hospital for abdominal pain and dyspnea. On admittance the ECG tracing performed showed sinus rhythm with diffuse repolarization abnormalities. Further exams revealed an increase of troponin (54 ng/ml) and transaminases levels (GOT 50 U/L; GPT 125 U/L) and a cardiac ultrasound showed a severe left ventricular dysfunction with right heart failure. Patient was thus admitted to the coronary intensive care unit. During his hospital stay the possibility of acute myocarditis was excluded because of the absence of a recent viral syndrome and the negativity of IgM antibodies against the viruses most commonly affecting the cardiovascular system and because of the low inflammatory indexes. An abdominal ultrasound demonstrated abdominal and pleural effusions, regular size and morphology of spleen and liver, no pancreatic changes; both kidneys had normal size but showed irregular margins and a reduced thickness of the cortex, no hydronephrosis nor stones were observed. A magnetic resonance demonstrated an increased volume of the cardiac chambers with a severe reduction of the function of both ventricles (EF20%), however no signs of reduced myocardial perfusion, valvular defects or other tissue changes such as inflammation, fibrosis or edema could be demonstrated. A chest CT scan confirmed the presence of pleural effusion and showed parenchymal atelectasias mainly involving the lower lobes of the lungs.

Significant medical history included diabetes mellitus type 2, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diastolic heart failure. The patient's last dose of apixaban was 48 hours prior to surgery. Other than moderate anemia (hemoglobin 8.8 g/dL), all laboratory studies, including a coagulation profile, were normal.\nPrior to surgery, the patient was offered a sciatic nerve catheter and an adductor canal block as part of a multimodal postoperative analgesia strategy. Because of her many, serious medical conditions, we concluded that a peripheral nerve block offered the best opportunity to provide satisfactory postoperative analgesia. Specifically, we were concerned that the postoperative pain management primarily with opioid medications would pose increased cardiopulmonary risk to the patient. We were careful to explain the risks associated with peripheral nerve blocks, including the risk of bleeding and hematoma formation, and verbal consent was obtained.\nThe surgery was performed under general anesthesia and her intraoperative course was uncomplicated. Upon arrival to the recovery room, our acute pain service was contacted to evaluate her for peripheral nerve blockade.

In her first attack, the patient suddenly experienced an aura with visual disturbances which she described as increasing scotomata in the bilateral visual field. After a few seconds, the patient developed a serious headache, mainly located on the left side. After a few minutes, she presented a paralysis of the right side and speech difficulties accompanied by dizziness and vomiting. These symptoms resolved after about 2 h. After this initial onset, she had an attack nearly every 4\u20135 years, and the clinical presentations of her attacks were always similar to the first one. The duration of the aura symptoms and the migraine was typically 1\u20132 h but sometimes the migraine could last up to 4 days. Sometimes headaches occurred before the hemiplegia and aphasia. Each headache was accompanied by dizziness and vomiting but without loss of consciousness. In most attacks, this patient experienced additionally a flushing of the neck and face and felt that the skin temperature of this affected area was increased, but the temperature was never measured. These symptoms may be related to an extracranial vasodilation when a migraine attack occurred. She did not undergo regular treatment except for simple analgesics as a symptomatic therapy. Recently, her condition aggravated as the frequency of attacks increased from once every 4\u20135 years to once every 1\u20132 weeks which had a serious impact on her everyday life.

She also had generalised vague abdominal pain, loss of appetite and lower back pain. She had no significant medical, family or psychosocial history. Clinical examination revealed multiple, bilateral enlarged cervical lymph nodes which were firm to hard in consistency. Thyroid examination revealed a 2 \u00d7 2 cm firm lump on the lower pole of the left thyroid lobe. Examination of other lymph node groups revealed enlarged right inguinal lymph nodes. Abdominal examination and rectal examination were normal. Vaginal examination revealed a hard, unhealthy uterine cervix. Breast and axillary examination were unremarkable. She had spinal tenderness, but the neurological examination of the lower limbs was normal.\nHer basic blood investigations, liver profile and renal functions were within the normal limits. Ultrasound scan of the abdomen revealed no abnormalities. Ultrasound scan of the neck revealed multiple nodules in the thyroid, with increased vascularity, and multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes with obliterated fatty hila suggestive of malignant deposits.

He had a history of acute low back pain in the region of the lumbar spine in the last 4 days before his admission to the hospital. Two days before his admission he experienced lower leg weakness and fever (oral temperature 38.5\u00b0C). Clinical examination showed neck stiffness. After initial evaluation and brain CT scan \u2013 which revealed no damage \u2013 he had a lumbar puncture. The patient hospitalized with the diagnosis of meningitis (CSF: 765 white cells per cubic millimeter, elevated protein level: 70 mg per deciliter, decreased CSF glucose levels: 35% of serum glucose). Staph. aureus was cultured from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample.\nThe neurologic condition of the patient impaired very quickly and at the end of the third day, after his admission, he developed paraplegia. Deep tendon reflexes were absent in the lower limbs and severely diminished in the upper limbs. After neurosurgical consultation an emergency magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) of the brain and the whole spinal spine was performed, five days after the admission of the patient to the hospital. It revealed a contrast-enhancing subdural mass collection posterior and left lateral to the spinal cord at the level L2 \u2013 L4 which was compressing the spinal cord. It also revealed arachnoiditis in the whole thoracic and lumbar vertebral body of the spinal cord. After intravenous contrast administration there was an intense enhancement on the boundaries of the collection and widespread meningeal enhancement (figures and ).

He reported abdominal pain since one day. On examination, he was pale and had a pulse rate of 64/min, a blood pressure of 70/50 mmHg, a body temperature of 36\u00b0C, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min. He had abdominal tenderness with muscular rigidity, especially in the upper abdominal region. A full blood count showed a haemoglobin level of 6,4 mmol/L, while all other laboratory tests were within the normal range. A chest X-ray showed normal lung fields and no pneumoperitoneum. As a vascular incident was feared, an abdominal ultrasound revealed free abdominal fluid around the liver and spleen without an aortic aneurysm. An abdominal computed tomographic (CT) demonstrated fluids in the omental bursa with a normal aspect of the pancreas but was unable to point to the origin of the free fluid. After resuscitation using standard techniques, the patient was transferred to the operating room under the diagnosis of intra-abdominal haemorrhage of unknown origin. During laparotomy, three litres of blood were obtained from the abdominal cavity but no active bleeding was found. Inspection of the omental bursa revealed a hematoma surrounding the pancreas. The patient was packed using several large volume gauzes and admitted to the intensive care unit. The next day, these gauzes were removed and again no active bleeding was seen. The next four days were uneventful. However, on the fifth day, the patient developed acute severe abdominal pain. An abdominal computed tomographic angiography (CTA) revealed a 14 mm splenic artery aneurysm () as well as a 12 mm aneurysm of the coeliac trunk.

In her first attack, the patient suddenly experienced an aura with visual disturbances which she described as increasing scotomata in the bilateral visual field. After a few seconds, the patient developed a serious headache, mainly located on the left side. After a few minutes, she presented a paralysis of the right side and speech difficulties accompanied by dizziness and vomiting. These symptoms resolved after about 2 h. After this initial onset, she had an attack nearly every 4\u20135 years, and the clinical presentations of her attacks were always similar to the first one. The duration of the aura symptoms and the migraine was typically 1\u20132 h but sometimes the migraine could last up to 4 days. Sometimes headaches occurred before the hemiplegia and aphasia. Each headache was accompanied by dizziness and vomiting but without loss of consciousness. In most attacks, this patient experienced additionally a flushing of the neck and face and felt that the skin temperature of this affected area was increased, but the temperature was never measured. These symptoms may be related to an extracranial vasodilation when a migraine attack occurred. She did not undergo regular treatment except for simple analgesics as a symptomatic therapy. Recently, her condition aggravated as the frequency of attacks increased from once every 4\u20135 years to once every 1\u20132 weeks which had a serious impact on her everyday life.

While he initially noticed the mass about 2 months earlier, he presented for evaluation now because of acute onset of pain, weakness and paresthesias in the right arm. He was admitted to the general medicine service for pain management and underwent an initial work up for his right shoulder mass, including advanced imaging and a core biopsy. Physiatry was consulted due to his functional deterioration that precluded him from returning to his previous independent living arrangement. He demonstrated diffuse, mild weakness throughout the right arm that was variable and seemed to be correlated with his reported pain level, but his most consistent and weakest movement patterns were his grade 4/5 weakness in finger abduction and distal interphalangeal joint flexion. He had reduced pin prick sensation over the volar surface of digits 3\u20135, palm and forearm of the right arm and hand. He was not able to perform transfers to or from his manual wheelchair due to his level of pain. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a heterogeneously enhancing mass with a maximum diameter of 6.9 cm (Fig. ) that involved the right deltoid and pectoralis major muscles.

MRI of left knee showed grade II-III patellar chondromalacia and mild osteoarthritic changes. Her left knee pain was uncontrolled with conservative measures including NSAIDs and narcotics. Steroid injections were provided once with no pain relief. Subsequently, over a period of five years, she received multiple courses of sodium hyaluronate injections to the left knee without complications, waiting at least six months between each series of five injections. The skin was thoroughly examined prior to each injection and was noted to be in a good condition, with no breaks, rashes, or bruises evident.

Clean technique was employed prior to each of these injections, including use of betadine, alcohol, and gloves.\nPertinent past medical history included treatment for invasive ductal left breast cancer with lumpectomy and radiation five years prior to this hospital presentation. She had been in remission until four months prior to hospitalization, when she was diagnosed with recurrent left breast ductal carcinoma. She then underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection and received one round of chemotherapy treatment, with Taxotere, Carboplatin, and Herceptin, 11 days prior to hospital admission.

During the 6 months after the operation, the patient complained repeatedly of recurrent swelling of the affected regions. To alleviate the symptoms, the plastic surgery clinic where she underwent the augmentation attempted to squeeze out the filler material through a 5 cm coronal incision in the scalp. The volumes of PAAG originally injected and then later removed are both unknown. After the operation to remove the PAAG, the patient's symptoms did not improve.\nWhen the patient came to our department 15 years after the first operation, she complained of recurrent swelling of the temporal region, forehead, and eyelids as well as pain at the temporal regions that became even more intense with cold ambient temperature or with large facial expressions. Firm palpation of the temporal region of the scalp over the injected PAAG revealed persistent indention resembling pitting edema, which disappeared after about a minute. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2 images showed extensive migration of the PAAG as a hyperintense mass. The PAAG had spread from the temple regions to the cheek and neck regions () and from the forehead to both the upper and lower eyelids ().

We performed an operation to remove the PAAG under general anesthesia with bilateral temporal incisions in the scalp. When we reached the epicranial aponeurosis, we found it was impossible to separate the PAAG from the patient's tissues because the PAAG had permeated the tissues ().

In her first attack, the patient suddenly experienced an aura with visual disturbances which she described as increasing scotomata in the bilateral visual field. After a few seconds, the patient developed a serious headache, mainly located on the left side. After a few minutes, she presented a paralysis of the right side and speech difficulties accompanied by dizziness and vomiting. These symptoms resolved after about 2 h. After this initial onset, she had an attack nearly every 4\u20135 years, and the clinical presentations of her attacks were always similar to the first one. The duration of the aura symptoms and the migraine was typically 1\u20132 h but sometimes the migraine could last up to 4 days. Sometimes headaches occurred before the hemiplegia and aphasia. Each headache was accompanied by dizziness and vomiting but without loss of consciousness. In most attacks, this patient experienced additionally a flushing of the neck and face and felt that the skin temperature of this affected area was increased, but the temperature was never measured. These symptoms may be related to an extracranial vasodilation when a migraine attack occurred. She did not undergo regular treatment except for simple analgesics as a symptomatic therapy. Recently, her condition aggravated as the frequency of attacks increased from once every 4\u20135 years to once every 1\u20132 weeks which had a serious impact on her everyday life.

She was referred to gynecologic oncology for evaluation of possible gynecologic malignancy. Dilatation and curettage of endometrium did not reveal malignancy. Left inguinal lymph node biopsy revealed FL with kappa-restricted B-cells, CD10 and CD19 positive, comprising 50% to 65% of total cellularity.

There were also areas of fluid and gas in the inguinal area and in subcutaneous fat in the left thigh. She was designated stage IIA. As a result of the infection following the nodal biopsy and the continued lymphatic obstruction, the wound required placement of a continuous drain and she received prolonged antibiotics. It was apparent that the wound could not heal until there was significant reduction in lymphadenopathy. She was, therefore, referred for treatment of her newly diagnosed lymphoma.\nBecause of the ongoing wound drainage and recent infection, she was initially started on therapy with R alone, 375 mg/m2 weekly \u00d7 4 weeks, with the plan to add cytotoxic chemotherapy after significant wound healing. However, although she demonstrated response, the wound remained open, so R was continued weekly with dose escalation. She continued this with excellent response and eventual wound healing. Chemotherapy was never administered due to resolution of lymphadenopathy with R alone. From January through June 2010, she received monthly maintenance R \u00d7 6 doses, escalating to 1500 mg/m2.

Past medical history included a RYGB for morbid obesity 7 years before presentation, and ischemic heart disease. Conservative therapy did not alleviate his symptoms. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed marked ascending colon dilatation () without an identifiable lesion indicative of CPO. The differential diagnosis for CPO included functional causes such as cardiac disease, metabolic or electrolyte imbalances, renal insufficiency, medications, and anatomic causes like inflammatory processes and malignancy. Over the course of 2 months several diagnostic procedures were done. Three colonoscopies with multiple biopsies of the right colon showed submucosal mucin extravasation without mucosal abnormalities. On workup for elevated liver enzymes, a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography demonstrated intrahepatic biliary dilation with a dilated common hepatic duct and could not rule out a lesion in the bile duct as the cause. A laparoscopically assisted endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) through the remnant stomach showed dilated intrahepatic ducts; a fine needle aspiration of the liver, performed to assess for a possible hilar lesion observed during the EUS, did not show abnormalities. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was unsuccessful due to distorted anatomy. After the ERCP attempt the patient developed shock and was found to have a perforation of the duodenum during emergent exploratory laparotomy. The perforation was closed and the dilated right colon excised. Shortly thereafter, additional procedures were necessary for intestinal infarction secondary to the perforation induced shock, emergent surgery, and poor cardiac function. He continued deteriorating, opted for comfort measures only and expired a week later. Pathologic examination of the colon showed prominent segmental dilatation but no discrete lesions (). Microscopically pyloric-type glands with minimal cytologic atypia were present in the muscularis propria and subserosa (). The tumor did not elicit a desmoplastic response.

Approximately five months prior to this visit, the patient was diagnosed with a central lung mass in the left hilar area based on a chest radiograph obtained during a health check. However, the patient refused further evaluation at the time. We performed computed tomography (CT) imaging, which revealed a huge central lung mass obstructing the left main bronchus and the proximal portion of the left upper and lower lobar bronchi. This mass invaded the carina, adjacent esophagus and left main pulmonary artery surrounding the descending thoracic aorta. A bronchoscopic biopsy was performed and the mass was finally confirmed as non-small cell lung cancer, specifically a squamous cell carcinoma. After a 12 cm covered esophageal stent was inserted to relieve dysphagia, chemotherapy was started. About one month later, the patient revisited the emergency department with sudden aggravation of dyspnea and coughing. Respiration rates were initially 36/min and increased to 44/min for one hour after hospitalization. The patient was intubated for mechanical ventilator support and was managed in the intensive care unit. Blood-tinged sputum developed during the first day of admission. Three days after admission, a chest radiography showed the left lung had totally collapsed and bloody secretions were aggravated with no evidence of coagulopathy. The hemoglobin level had dropped from 10.7 g/dL to 8.8 g/dL during the course of one day. At this time, a bronchoscopic examination demonstrated the presence of an endoluminal protruding mass with extrinsic compression from the distal trachea to the left main bronchus. The orifice of the left main bronchus was completely obstructed by the mass and was coated by bloody and fibrinous clots.

    "original_text": "A 49-year-old African American woman presented with shortness of breath, who was discharged from the other hospital one week earlier with the diagnosis of acute exacerbation of CHF. Patient was given oral furosemide and carvedilol at discharge, however, she admitted to losing her prescription for carvedilol resulting in her not taking it since discharge. She exhibited bilateral leg edema on examination without crackles or jugular venous distention. Brain natriuretic peptide was elevated to 1330 pg/mL. Chest radiograph demonstrated cardiomegaly with minimal interstitial edema. Echocardiography from the other hospital showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 50%, pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of 56 mmHg, and normal left ventricular diastolic filling. Recurrent exacerbation of CHF secondary to idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) triggered by medication noncompliance was initially diagnosed, and the patient was started on intravenous furosemide. However, no clinical improvement was noted with no reasonable urine output. The medical team doubted the diagnosis of CHF exacerbation and started to do more thorough history taking and a comprehensive physical examination.\nThe patient had a history of breast cancer and underwent left lumpectomy followed by 4 cycles of chemotherapy using docetaxel/cyclophosphamide and radiation therapy about a year ago. She was given 134 mg of docetaxel and 1,074 mg of cyclophosphamide on a monthly basis. On repeat examination, she demonstrated diffuse thickening/sclerosis of bilateral hands that crossed metacarpophalangeal joints extending up to bilateral proximal upper extremities (). Extensive sclerosis of skin and subcutaneous tissue of anterior chest wall and the left breast were also noted. Patient endorsed that she started to have pain and stiffness of both hands right after she finished the last cycle of chemotherapy. Echocardiography before the chemotherapy showed EF of 55%, PAP of 26 mmHg, and normal left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling. LV size has been normal without change before and after the chemotherapy. Therefore, her estimated systolic PAP has increased by more than 2-fold after the chemotherapy with newly developing skin sclerosis. Docetaxel-related",

She underwent a colonoscopy that showed a 4 cm stenosis of the sigmoid colon, covered with pale mucosa that could not be passed by a conventional colonscope (13.2 mm) but could be passed with an enteroscope (9.2 mm) with which the cecum could be reached; the mucosa of the other colonic tract, as well as the mucosa of the terminal ileum, were unremarkable. Random ileal and colonic biopsies were obtained, which were unremarkable as well. Histology of the stenosis showed mild inflammation, mild stromal fibrosis, and architectural disruption. Subsequently, she underwent a computed tomography scan, which showed a mild thickening of the terminal ileum and sigmoid colon. The finding of thickened terminal ileum was further confirmed by a subsequent magnetic resonance imaging enterography, suggestive for Crohn disease (CD) localized at the terminal ileum. Due to the discrepancy of the radiological findings with the initial endoscopic examination, a further colonscopy with retrograde ileoscopy was performed, showing no visible endoscopic signs of inflammation and confirming the sigmoid stenosis. The repeated ileal and colonic biopsy sampling was again not diagnostic, showing a nonspecific pattern of inflammation affecting the sigmoid colonic specimens.\nThe physician in charge of the patient, in view of her clinical history and the radiologic finding of intestinal thickening, reckoned that the patient was affected by CD with terminal ileum and sigmoid colon localization and proposed a therapy immunomodulators: corticosteroids 1 mg/kg for 12 weeks together with antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) infliximab 5 mg at weeks 0, 2, and 6, followed by infliximab alone.
