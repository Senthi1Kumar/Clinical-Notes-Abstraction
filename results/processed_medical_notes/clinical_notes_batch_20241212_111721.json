The baby was admitted to the NICU for respiratory distress where he received surfactant therapy for prematurity related hyaline membrane disease. He was also given IV antibiotics and needed parenteral nutrition during his hospital stay. Post discharge, the baby remained asymptomatic for eight weeks. At the beginning of the 9th week mother noticed episodes of transient, loss of consciousness lasting a few seconds with spontaneous recovery. In between the episodes, the baby was active and feeding well. Beginning with three to four episodes in a day, the frequency increased and the mother noticed transient bluish discolouration of the whole body during these episodes. At this point the baby was referred to us for further evaluation and treatment. On clinical examination, the baby had mild tachypnea and tachycardia with no evidence of respiratory distress. The cardiovascular system examination was normal. Laboratory investigations revealed pancytopenia with Hb of 9.6 gm%, total white blood cell count of 1300/cu mm and platelet count of 60,000/cu mm. Serum electrolytes, blood urea, serum creatinine, serum transaminases and bilirubin were normal. In view of mild tachypnea and tachycardia, a transthoracic two dimensional echocardiography was done which revealed a large, echogenic mass with irregular borders in the right ventricle (RV). It was attached to the undersurface of the tricuspid valve and was moving across the valve into the right atrium [].\nThe baby was started on antibiotics to cover the broad spectrum of organisms along with antifungal agents.

The pain was dull, increased progressively and was relieved by simple analgesics. His appetite was good with no appreciable changes in his weight. There was no rectal bleeding, melena, mucoid stool, dyspoea or palpitations. His past medical and surgical histories were insignificant. He was generally unwell, not pale, not febrile or jaundiced and with stable vital signs. There were no stigmata of chronic liver or kidney diseases. Abdominal examination revealed minor tenderness over the right iliac fossa (RIF) without localized guarding or rigidity. There was a palpable cystic mass measuring 6 \u00d7 4 cm2 over the RIF, with a smooth surface and well-defined margins. Digital rectal examination was normal. His blood counts, glucose, liver and renal profiles were normal. Tumor markers (CEA, CA 19.9) levels were within normal ranges.

She also had anorexia with significant weight loss. She complained of progressively worsening shortness of breath (from Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) Grade I to Grade III) over last 2 months. There was no other respiratory complaint. She denied any history of fever or night sweats. Patient was occupied in the beedi-rolling industry and used to smoke beedis (a hand-rolled Indian cigarette). There was no history of alcohol intake. She did not have any family history of breast or ovarian cancer. She had been postmenopausal since the last 8 years and did not give history of oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use. On examination, a polypoid mass measuring approximately 6 cm \u00d7 4 cm was seen over the right upper quadrant of the breast (). The mass was hard in consistency, nontender, and freely mobile over the chest wall with fixity to the skin above. The skin overlying the lump was ulcerated at places with serosanguineous discharge. There was no nipple or areolar discharge. Supraclavicular lymph nodes were palpable bilaterally along with palpable anterior axillary lymph nodes. Respiratory system auscultation revealed reduced breath sounds over the left hemithorax with a monophonic wheeze. Basic blood investigations were normal except for an elevated ESR (105 mm/1st hour). A chest radiograph showed a left upper lobe collapse with mild left pleural effusion.

The pain was steadily increasing over 6 h which prompted urgent travel to an emergency room. The pain was treated with intravenous morphine. A CT with intravenous contrast was performed. It showed a \u201cwhirling\u201d of the small bowel mesentery with edematous changes concerning for volvulus (). A CT with oral contrast followed. Although a large amount of oral contrast was given, it remained sequestered in the stomach and did not pass into the duodenum.\nThe patient\u2019s vital signs were stable, yet due to unrelenting pain, he was taken urgently to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy. Upon opening the abdomen, the small bowel was profoundly discolored from venous congestion. The bowel was twisted on its mesentery causing obstruction of venous outflow. There was marked fibrin deposition throughout the abdomen with a large amount of inflammatory exudate. A large solitary jejunal diverticulum measuring approximately 5 cm in length was evident approximately 45 cm from the duodenojejunal junction. The apex of the diverticulum was adherent to the abdominal wall. Pictures of the solitary jejunal diverticulum in-situ were taken (). The diverticulum appeared to be inflamed with possible impending perforation. No enteric material was noted in the area of the jejunal diverticulum.\nAfter derotation of the bowel, the abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm saline. Impending infarction resolved after approximately twenty minutes. The normal color returned to the small bowel and fully restored after forty minutes. A generous resection of the diverticulum including an approximate 30 cm segment of the jejunum was performed (). A stapled side-to-side anastomosis was completed.

After she has transferred to our hospital, a routine follow-up has been provided to put the lesion under surveillance. Six years after the first diagnosis, she started to suffer from intermittent epigastralgia and back pain usually at night, lasting for 2 to 3 h. The tumor grew in size from 3.3 to 5.1 cm in diameter for 6 years (0.3 cm per year). Particularly, it rapidly grew up to 6.3 cm in the last 3 months in concurrence with the emergence of epigastralgia (Fig. ). A CT scan detected a solitary, irregularly formed, multilocular cystic tumor with thin septum and calcification. Its septum and capsule are not enhanced, and both splenic artery and vein are not invaded by the tumor (Fig. ). In findings of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the tumor showed low intensity in T1 and high intensity in a T2 weighted image (Fig. ). Endoscopic ultrasound sonography (EUS) identified a multilocular cystic lesion with calcification, but no nodules on the septal walls were detected. There were no communications between the cystic tumor and the main pancreatic duct (MPD) or any mucinous discharge from the papilla during endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP). The distal portion of the MPD was clearly displaced by the tumor. Furthermore, small branches of the pancreatic duct around the tumor were detected (Fig. ).

Ultrasonography (US) was performed at 20 weeks (normal malformation scan) and again at 23 weeks showing intrauterine growth restriction of both twins. A normal fetal echocardiography was performed at week 28. At 31 weeks, the fetal US still showed intrauterine growth restriction (twin A 26% and twin B 31%). It also revealed mild dilation of the gut in twin A.\nThe mother developed severe preeclampsia around week 28 and was hospitalized. Antenatal corticosteroids were administered to aid fetal lung maturation. Her preeclampsia progressed, and the mother developed hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP syndrome). Caesarean section was performed at a gestational age of 32 weeks and 0 days because of HELLP syndrome. Two live female neonates were delivered.

The CT-scan revealed a suspicious superficial hypodense lesion of 34 \u00d7 44 mm in segment VIII and a 4 \u00d7 5 mm suspicious lesion in segment VI. In segments V and VIII two preexistent calcifications were found, thought to originate from intraoperative spillage of bile stones during previous cholecystectomy. There was no sign of recurrence of the primary tumor, and no lymph nodes or other distant metastases were found. The primary tumor was a \u2018wild-type\u2019 GIST and therefore neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not indicated []. She was planned for open resection of the metastasis in segment VIII and RFA for the lesion in segment VI.\nIntraoperative NIRF-imaging clearly revealed the lesion in segment VIII (). The lesion in segment VI was not visualized using NIRF-imaging, due to its deeper location in the liver parenchyma. In addition, one suspected lesion in segment V was found. This lesion showed a specific rim feature (a, b), similar to what is seen around other secondary liver tumors. IOUS was able to detect the two known tumors in segments VIII and VI, and the previously described calcifications. The newly found lesion was not observed on IOUS. First, ultrasound-guided RFA was performed of the lesion in segment VI, followed by resection of the newly found lesion in segment V and the metastasis in segment VIII.\nAfter completion of the resection, all resected specimens were cut into 5 mm bread loaves by the pathologist, followed by consecutive NIRF bread loaf imaging.

Concomitant diseases included depression and type two diabetes mellitus on peroral therapy.\nA nasal endoscopy and computed tomography (CT) showed a huge pathologic cavity resulting from communication between the oral cavity, right maxillary sinus, and nasal cavity, with a minor communication with the right orbit (Figures -).\nDue to the past medical history and the severity of the case biopsy specimens were obtained under general anesthesia. The tissues were fixated in 10% buffered formaldehyde solution and later embedded in paraffin (FFPE) for staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Azan.\nThe sections showed severe but unspecific changes of the nasal epithelium with areas of minimal remaining preserved respiratory epithelium (Figure ). These changes included zones of reserve cell hyperplasia, epithelial erosions, and ulcers, squamous cell metaplasia with acanthosis and zones of abundant keratinization (Figure ). Evident unspecific changes were also present in the submucosa with squamous cell metaplasia of the submucosal glands in some cases leading to complete replacement of the glandular epithelia and resulting in submucosal squamous cell nests, without signs of cellular atypia (Figure ). The interstitium was also severely affected by abundant zones of granulation tissue, fibrosis, and signs of chronic inflammatory infiltrate with lymphocytes and plasma cells, however giant cells were absent (Figure ).

The pain exacerbated after eating and was accompanied with abdominal distension, belching, and reduced flatus. The patient referred was taking traditional Chinese medicine that temporarily relieved the symptoms. She had previous history of hypertension with a poor control. She underwent colonoscopy examination in a local hospital and verbally reported no pathologic findings. The positive findings at the physical examination were the mesogastric tenderness and an enlarged spleen.\nThe blood laboratory examination reported only mild hypokalemia; the urinary and stool reports were normal. The enhanced computerized tomography showed splenomegaly, the jejunal wall with edema and a narrowed lumen, enlarged lymph nodes, mesenteric edema; the liver cleft was widened with atrophy of the right liver lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes; calcification and periportal fibrosis signs were compatible with hepatic schistosomiasis (Figures \u2013).\nAt the moment of the double balloon enteroscopy, the patient's blood pressure was not stable and we could not reexamine the colon. The upper enteroscopy showed at 150 cm distal to the Treitz ligament a 3.0 x 2.0 cm size ulcer with bottom white coating, peripheral mucosal hyperemia, and edema occupying 2/3 of the lumen so that the endoscope could not pass through. Four biopsies were taken from the ulcer (Figures \u2013).

He showed body image distortion and obsessive fears of being fat, but he did not exhibit depressive mood, hallucinations, or delusions. Physical examination was normal with the exception of emaciation. Laboratory investigations, echocardiography, head computed tomography (CT), chest CT, and abdominal CT demonstrated no abnormality. In September 2009, he was hospitalized because he was refusing all meals and his weight had fallen from 26 kg to 22.8 kg (71% of ideal body weight [IBW] for his height of 134.2 cm).

We started olanzapine for the body image distortion and agitation during meals but discontinued it in December 2009 because of over-sedation.\nIn April 2010, we started risperidone 1 mg/day. Thereafter, the agitation during enteral feeding and his complaints based on body image distortion diminished. After 1 month (6 months after hospitalization), he resumed meals. No side effects of risperidone were observed and his growth was good in the month after it was started. However, we stopped risperidone in June 2010 at his mother's request. One month after doing so, the patient's abnormal eating behaviors deteriorated and he stopped eating meals. In July 2010, we resumed risperidone 1 mg/day and his abnormal eating behaviors diminished. One month later, he resumed meals. No side effects were observed and his growth was good during the next two months. However, after this period he refused risperidone because he believed it was making him fat. His abnormal eating behaviors deteriorated again, and after one month he again stopped eating. In October 2010, we started RLAI 12.5 mg/2 weeks, as he refused to take risperidone orally but accepted the injection",

The patient has no history of any cancer and no family history of neurofibromatosis. Lab tests results including blood routine, urine routine, serum chemistry, as well as examinations of several serum tumor markers such as Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), \u03b1-fetoprotin (AFP) and Carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19.9) were all within normal ranges. Computed tomography scan confirmed a 15.0 \u00d7 12.3 \u00d7 10.0-cm enhancing heterogeneous mass with left kidney invasion arising from retroperitoneal space (Fig. ). As shown in the CT scan, we could identify several smaller nodular lesions around the main tumor, locating in the soft tissues of the pelvic wall and sigmoid colon (Fig. and Fig. ). A presumptive diagnosis of retroperitoneal sarcoma or possible pancreatic neoplasm was suspected. The patient underwent surgical excision of the masses. The largest retroperitoneal mass was speculated to be the original site upon examinations during the operation. The nodules found on the sigmoid colon were most likely \"satellite\" lesions, for it was confined in the colon wall but did not protrude into the colon cavity, which may due to direct spread of tumor cells from the primary tumor. However, the pelvic masses rooted from the pelvic wall but not from pelvic peritoneum indicated they may have independent origins. The left kidney and sigmoid flexure were extirpated together with the tumors for the negative soft tissue margins. No further anti-tumor therapy was administrated after the surgery, and CT scan of the abdomen and pelvic cavity was performed every three months as follow-up.

    "original_text": "A 72-year old male with hypertension presented to emergency room with light headedness and hypotension. Initial blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg and heart rate was 70 beats/minute. Electrocardiogram revealed evidence of tall R waves in lead V1-2 []. Troponin I level was 11.9 ng/mL. An emergent echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion with fibrinous material []. Patient denied any other complaints including chest pain or dyspnea and wished to be discharged home. He did mention that he had an episode of chest pain 1 week earlier that resolved spontaneously and he did not seek medical care. Based on electrocardiogram and echocardiogram findings, we suspected patient suffered a posterior myocardial infarction which was complicated by contained free wall rupture and pericardial effusion. Based on the high index of suspicion, patient was taken for emergent coronary angiography which revealed 100% circumflex occlusion and right heart catheterization was consistent with tamponade physiology. Left ventriculogram showed an ejection fraction of 40% with staining of postero-basal wall suggestive of possible cardiac rupture. Patient underwent emergent percutaneous coronary intervention to the left circumflex along with placement of an intraaortic balloon pump, and emergent pericardiocentesis with removal of 50cc of hemorrhagic fluid. This led to hemodynamic stabilization. Limited pericardiocentesis was done to prevent dislodgement of the clot which may be tamponading the ruptured site. Patient was then taken to operating room immediately. Intraoperative a large amount of hemorrhagic fluid with clot was removed. The infarcted posterior myocardium showed necrosis and hemorrhage with multiple puncture sites leaking/oozing blood. A large patch was created with combination of Bio Glue and patient's own pericardium.

There was a history of generalized weakness, weight loss, and loss of appetite during this period. On examination, the patient was poorly nourished with the presence of a palpable left-sided abdominal mass.\nUltrasonography (USG) of the abdomen showed the presence of right ectopic kidney and left-sided hydronephrosis. A heterogeneous mass was noted in the left kidney. Another polypoidal mass was also seen in the lumen of the urinary bladder, attached to its posterolateral wall.\nContrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CECT) of the abdomen helped in the renal anatomy and characterization of the mass, which revealed L-shaped crossed fused renal ectopia. The right kidney was not present in the right renal fossa and was in the midline, anterior to the aortic bifurcation at the L4-L5 level. It was malrotated and fused with the lower pole of the left kidney. The left kidney was enlarged, with a large soft heterogeneous tissue density mass involving the interpolar and lower pole regions that exhibited heterogeneous enhancement with central non-enhancing areas. Few calcified foci were seen in the mass, along with moderate hydronephrosis. In the delayed phase (15 minutes), no contrast excretion from the left kidney was recorded. The interpolar region of the right kidney was contiguously infiltrated by the left lower pole renal mass. Small tumor thrombi were present in the segmental right renal veins draining the interpolar region. Aortocaval, para-aortic and left renal hilar lymphadenopathy were also noted.\nAlong with these findings, a well-defined polypoidal mass was seen in the left posterolateral wall of the urinary bladder, infiltrating the left vesicoureteral junction.

He was diagnosed with Carney complex after presenting with a thyroid nodule, adrenal gland tumor, and sertoli cell tumor in the testicular gland. He also underwent left orchiectomy and left adrenalectomy two years ago. Afterwards, he had been under ambulatory follow-up monitoring for the thyroid nodule, pituitary adenoma, and Cushing's syndrome.\nPre-operative echocardiography confirmed a 34 \u00d7 24 mm sized myxoma in the posterior mitral valve leaflet of the left atrial posterior side, which is a rare location for myxomas to occur ( and ).

Computed tomography (CT) chest was carried out on the 16th of March, 2009 and showed a large partially lobulated soft-tissue mass in the right axillary area measuring 86 \u00d7 61 \u00d7 57 mm in maximum diameters and showing irregular thick marginal enhancement with surrounding lymph nodes and right supraclavicular involvement. The mass was suspicious of malignancy and hence a needle core biopsy was taken 10 days later. The biopsy [], suggested that the mass is most likely metastatic rather than a primary lesion and that the degree of neuroendocrine differentiation shown may suggest primary lung or gastrointestinal (GI) origin.

    "original_text": "A 57-year-old HIV-negative aboriginal male was initially admitted with community-acquired pneumonia, which progressively worsened. A subsequent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage revealed acid-fast bacilli on ziehl-neelsen staining. A subsequent CT chest demonstrated bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and cavitating lesions consistent with active pulmonary tuberculosis infection. His treatment was initiated with the standard 4-drug regimen: pyrazinamide, rifampin, ethambutol, and isoniazid (INH). Sputum mycobacterial TB culture demonstrated susceptibility to the 4-drug regimen.\nDuring his admission to hospital, he developed diffuse abdominal pain with peritonitis on examination. He also developed tachycardia and hypotension, and an abdominal X-ray revealed free air under the diaphragm. Arrangements were made for emergent exploratory laparotomy in the operating room. Intraoperatively a single contiguous inflammatory mass was found in the left upper quadrant, which revealed a gangrenous necrotic splenic colon. A left hemicolectomy was preformed. This revealed a region of necrotic-appearing pancreatic tissue which was likely associated with the necrosis of the adjacent splenic colon. Further exploration of this inflammatory mass demonstrated particulate matter and peritoneal fluid and a large perforation in the posterior wall of the stomach, which was the initial insult.

The patient had the symptoms for a few months, but because of increased pain and dyspnea she decided to consult. Upon arrival, the electrocardiogram showed a de novo atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. The resulting chest X-ray revealed a poorly defined retrocardiac opacity suggestive of a giant mass [Fig. ]. The transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a non-obstructive concentric hypertrophic left ventricle with moderate systolic disfunction \u2013 left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35\u201340%, sclerosis of the mitral and aortic valve without hemodynamic compromise, mild tricuspid insufficiency, and moderate pericardial fluid. However, due to a very poor acoustic window, a transesophageal echocardiogram was suggested, with the coronary arteriography ruling out coronary disease. The transesophageal echocardiogram showed a LVEF of 51% with mild tricuspid insufficiency, moderate pulmonary hypertension, a moderate pericardial effusion, and multiple pericardial masses. She was started on diuretics (furosemide) and beta blockers that failed to control the heart rate. Consequently, administration of intravenous amiodarone was required.\nThe pericardial masses were further studied with a contrasted CT scan that showed a 10 cm compressive mass in the posteromedial mediastinum very suggestive of a pericardial cyst. A cardiac magnetic resonance image (MRI) defined a 96 \u00d7 88 \u00d7 77 mm mass in its transverse, anteroposterior and cephalo-caudal diameters, respectively.

She underwent left tonsillectomy via transoral robotic surgery and left neck dissection, revealing 2/21 involved lymph nodes (largest measuring 1.3 cm) without extracapsular extension. Lymphovascular invasion was indeterminate and perineural invasion was not identified. All deep and peripheral margins were free of invasive carcinoma. The closest margin from the left tonsil resection was 0.5 mm and was associated with a deep soft tissue margin on the lateral aspect. She was staged as pT2N2bM0.\nThe patient received adjuvant radiation therapy of 60 Gy to the tumor bed and ipsilateral neck and 54 Gy to the contralateral neck (Figure ). Subsequently, she experienced four sequential recurrences, including three endotracheal and one lung.

The phenomenology was similar in appearance to jaw tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, but the dopamine transporter scan (DAT) showed no abnormalities. A laryngoscopic evaluation also revealed a palatal tremor. These tremors were similarly irregular in amplitude and frequency (3\u20136Hz), and considered to be a series of symptoms of a movement disorder. She was, therefore, diagnosed with tremor associated with craniofacial dystonia by movement disorders trained specialists. The tremor was refractory to maximally tolerated dosages of anti-parkinsonian medications, a beta blocker, and a benzodiazepine, so a surgical intervention was indicated. Following a multidisciplinary evaluation she underwent DBS surgery.\nBilateral Vim thalamic nuclei were selected for the initial DBS targets to address the midline tremulous movements, and the trajectory was planned to include the medial area of the Vim based on somatotopy (Morishita et al., ). A large anterior commissure (AC)-posterior commissure (PC) insertion angle was selected as previously suggested in the literature for this type of case (Moscovich et al., ). The patient visited clinic for DBS programing once a month or two, and stimulation intensity was increased to the near threshold level of stimulation-induced side effects. However, DBS therapy was ineffective for more than 2 years although there were no serious adverse events. Since she was suffering from severe social embarrassment due to tremor, she elected to undergo a revision DBS surgery. Based on phenomenology of her dystonic tremor manifesting as similar to PD and in an attempt to address her dystonia, we planned to explant the preexisting Vim DBS leads, and implant new GPi DBS leads bilaterally through the preexisting burr holes. Following DBS surgery, she visited the clinic once a month for DBS programming. The positive clinical effect manifested 2 months after surgery as the facial and palatal tremor nearly resolved. The",
