We performed EEG four times from 2 to 4 years old, and none revealed epileptic discharges. Developmental history was normal. Her mother had a history of febrile seizure, but all other family members were reportedly free from seizure disorders.\nAt 5 years and 6 months old, she was transported by ambulance and admitted to our hospital due to impairment of consciousness. Her parents reported sudden vomiting that started during a nap while traveling in a car, and repeating several times. She woke from the nap, and was initially able to speak, but gradually became unconscious. Her eyes then deviated to the right, her complexion became pale, and her limbs became flaccid. When the patient arrived at our hospital 70 min after seizure onset, she was still lethargic, but her eyes were closed without deviation. The emergency room doctor decided that the seizure had already stopped and she was in a state of post-ictal drowsiness. EEG revealed epileptic spikes in the left occipital region, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no abnormalities. PS was then diagnosed. After observing the course without treatment, the patient experienced another seizure 9 months later. This time, the seizure evolved to left hemiconvulsions with eyes deviating to the left. Medication started with valproic acid (VPA), with later addition of clobazam, but neither achieved resolution of seizures. In total, she experienced nine seizure events equivalent to PS by 7 years and 4 months old, most of which were lengthy seizures lasting >5 min or SE >30 min. The longest seizure lasted 60 min before stopping on intravenous injection of diazepam.

He had been receiving care for over 10 years at our ambulatory psychiatric center while on a monthly intramuscular injection of 50 mg of haloperidol decanoate. He had a past history of muscle stiffness from the haloperidol injection and this extrapyramidal symptom had been controlled with oral benztropine at 0.5 mg two times a day on an as-needed basis. During the course of his treatment, he developed hematochezia along with lower abdominal pain, constipation, and difficulty with urination, which was initially attributed to his enlarged prostate. However, a careful history by his psychiatrist subsequently revealed that he had been using Benztropine more than he was being prescribed. He admitted to taking more than double his prescribed dose per day as well as increasing doses over a period of months, as he had also been receiving this prescription from his gastroenterologist (up to a total of 5-8 mg per day in divided doses). He did not give any clear reason for taking higher doses of the benztropine and only stated that he was just taking his \"side effect medication\" as needed. The psychiatrist contacted his outpatient gastroenterologist and urologist, coordinating his care with these specialists. Extensive psychoeducation, over a period of multiple clinic visits, was provided to him focusing on his increased susceptibility to the anticholinergic effects of benztropine. It was explained that his advanced age and history of benign prostatic hyperplasia placed him at an elevated risk of anticholinergic complications. The benztropine dose was reduced and shorter duration prescriptions were provided to allow for increased monitoring and he began to use the medication as prescribed. His gastroenterologist and urologist had both ruled out a malignant neoplasm as the etiology of his presentation. These symptoms gradually resolved and he continued to receive psychiatric care regularly at our clinic without any further incidents.",

He was athletic, self-reliant and had no cognitive impairment. During the last 28 years, he had experienced 8-10 heterogeneous episodes of acute neurological symptoms, such as central facial palsy, hemiparesis, and non-fluent aphasia, lasting from seconds to 3-4 hours. Precerebral duplex and electrocardiography (ECG) were performed several times with normal results, and EEG registration and 24-hour Holter monitoring had been normal. Previous MRI scans showed no abnormal restricted diffusion, as seen in acute cerebral infarcts, but infarct sequelae in the left temporal lobe and both thalami. Several years later, three additional infarct sequelae were detected in the cerebellum. The patient was treated with platelet inhibitors, and medications and dosages were adjusted after new episodes.

She remained up and ambulatory with no further complaints. Ten hours after her injury the patient presented to the Emergency Department with stridorous and agonal respirations with a profoundly decreased level of consciousness. She was noted to have developed extensive ecchymosis on the anterior portion of her neck and chest. Her symptoms had begun rapidly shortly prior to arrival while lying in bed. Family reported that she had been in the constant company of her husband with no further falls or injuries that had occurred since her fall.

Abdominal ultrasonography did not revealed any organomegaly. Routine blood investigations were within normal limits. Serum cortisol levels were within normal levels. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy did not revealed any abnormality. Bronchial washings, bronchial brush biopsy and transbronchial needle aspiration biopsy of the mass were inconclusive. Trans-thoracic tru-cut biopsy of the mass revealed small round tumor cells, but the exact histological diagnosis remained uncertain. As the diagnosis was inconclusive, the patient was taken up for thoracotomy with excision of the tumor.

The child showed normal diffusion properties along the uncinate fasciculus, a tract that is spatially separated from the ventricles. The child has thinning of the corpus callosum and low FA along the full trajectory of the forceps major. This finding is consistent with other studies of children born prematurely. To test whether the reduced FA could be accounted for by partial voluming with CSF in this patient with enlarged ventricles we examined the patient's Tract Mean Diffusivity (MD) Profile. MD values were elevated at node 20, but otherwise MD values were within the normal range indicating that there was not a substantial change in the water content of forceps major voxels. Hence, we demonstrated that partial voluming with CSF could not explain the FA reduction.\nBy contrast, the left cortical-spinal tract had substantially increased FA throughout its trajectory compare to the control group. We interpret this increased FA as due to two major factors. The first relates to the tract itself. Ventricular dilatation may lead to stretching, displacement, and resulting increased coherence of the axons in the CST leading to increased FA . The second relates to crossing fibers. A distinctive feature of the left and right CST Tract FA Profiles of this patient is that FA increases near the superior portion where FA decreases for the healthy controls. In the typical subjects, this decrease in FA is the result of crossing fibers from the corpus callosum.

She had undergone previous 3 cesarean sections and an evacuation of retained products of conception by curettage in 2013 for partial hydatidiform mole. At 27 weeks 5 days, she was admitted for vaginal bleeding. On further evaluation by ultrasound (), the diagnosis of placenta percreta was made (later confirmed by MRI). At 29 weeks, she had constipation with 2 episodes of urinary retention and she was put on continuous bladder drainage. She developed urinary tract infection and treated with appropriate antibiotics based on culture sensitivity. She continued to have repeated bouts of vaginal bleeding of varying amounts and severe constipation from 31 weeks of gestation.\nAt 32 weeks 4 days, patient underwent cystoscopy, which had shown signs of cystitis with no definite infiltration. She underwent classical cesarean section under combined anesthesia (Epidural + General). The umbilical cord was tied near insertion and the placenta was left in situ because there was no spontaneous separation. Then, the uterus was closed. Prophylactic temporary bilateral internal iliac artery balloons were inserted and inflated earlier. Uterine artery embolization was performed post cesarean section and selective angiograms confirmed adequate positioning.

Since the tumor and abdominal lymphadenopathy were the only manifestation of sarcoidosis and no other signs of organ involvement were present, he received no immunosuppressive treatment. The abdominal lymphadenopathy had been stable over time. Nine years before presentation, he was referred to our nephrology clinic to determine the cause of chronic kidney disease. His serum creatinine level was 1.2 mg/dL and he had proteinuria of 0.4 g per day. Hematuria was not present.

He was observed to have rolling up of the eyes with frothy salivations and trauma to the tongue. The patient complained of severe arthralgia and pain on minimal movement of any joint. On examination he was noted to have petechiae all over his body, no signs of meningeal irritation and there was a lesion over the scapula which was diagnosed as a snake bite. Blood investigations were normal and computerized tomography of the brain was normal. Patient was loaded with phenytoin 25 mg/Kg body weight. In the ward he developed echymotic lesions on the skin and upper extremities, with recurrent vomiting, distended abdomen, paralytic ileus, and deteriorating renal and liver function tests. In the intensive care unit the patient was treated by antivenom and supportive therapy. At the end of the 7th day the general condition improved and patient started to complain of painful hips and shoulders. On further inquiry, patient gave a history of using 15 mg prednisolone daily for aplastic anemia for two years. No supplement or antiresorptive therapy was given to him. Clinical examination showed that both the shoulder joints were dislocated and any attempt to move the hips and right wrist caused tremendous amount of pain.

On presentation, the patient was in septic shock requiring fluid boluses and inotropic agents to stabilize him. Further history was obtained from the family as follows:On November 2016, he underwent an elective right TKA complicated by an early MRSA PJI associated with bacteremia On May 0f 2017, he underwent resection of the hardware in the knee, incision and drainage, followed by 12 weeks of daptomycin therapy Five months later, on October of 2017, due to relapse, he had a second debridement of the right knee for source control as well as left ankle incision and debridement followed by another 8 weeks of daptomycin for this relapse of infection A daptomycin-susceptible, vancomycin-susceptible MRSA was isolated from blood and both surgical sites, knee and ankle, on both occasions He had ongoing thoracic back pain since 2016 which was monitored radiographically by his local providers, until the development of spinal epidural abscess with upper extremity weakness, which prompted his current hospitalization in January of 2018\nReview of systems on presenting to our institution was significant for general weakness and malaise, right shoulder and thoracic back pain, and constipation from narcotics. He was hemodynamically unstable requiring inotropic support. He was awake and oriented, following commands with intact speech. There were no cranial nerve deficits. On motor testing, he had normal muscle bulk with generalized hypotonia. There was no movement of his left upper extremity.

He underwent laparoscopic biopsy of his abdominal mass and the mass was finally diagnosed as an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma in the retroperitoneum. The size of the mass was 18 cm\u00d716 cm\u00d77 cm, and after 4 cycles of chemotherapy for 5 months, the mass size was reduced to 5 cm\u00d72 cm\u00d73 cm. Surgical resection of the mass was then performed and the patient was followed up for 2 years. Abdominal computed tomography showed no remnant mass of the tumor. We found no evidence of recurrence of the tumor for 1 year after surgery. After 1 year, however, follow-up computed tomography showed a newly developed mass (3.3 cm\u00d73.0 cm in size) surrounding the right lower ureter along the right iliac artery, resulting in hydronephrosis of the right ureter (). We diagnosed the mass as a recurrent retroperitoneal rhabdomyosarcoma and we decided to perform surgical resection.

The mass had severe adhesions with the surrounding tissues and it completely encircled the right lower ureter along the right iliac artery. After resection of the mass, direct end-to-end anastomosis of the ureter was not possible owing to the length of the resected segment (). Therefore, we decided to perform ureteral substitution by using the appendix to repair the ureteral defect. The cecum and the right colon were mobilized. The vermiform appendix was assessed. It was 6 cm in length from the base to the tip and no macroscopic abnormalities were noted. The appendix was divided at its base and the stump was ligated and conventionally inverted. Care was taken to preserve the appendicular artery, which was identified as running in the short triangular mesoappendix. The isolated appendix was mobilized to the retroperitoneum and positioned in an antiperistaltic manner to avoid strangulation",

She described experiencing intermittent anal spasms lasting around 15 minutes. These episodes were worse when sitting down for longer than 45 minutes or when lying in bed. The frequency of these anal spasms was increasing with time and occurring every hour at night at the time of presentation. Her constipation symptoms constituted experiencing difficulty in defecation and a sensation of incomplete evacuation. She had no response to amitriptyline or topical diltiazem. Her past medical history was unremarkable apart from four normal vaginal deliveries. Her sister had colorectal cancer diagnosed at the age of 49 and had previously been treated for an undiagnosed anal sphincter problem. There was no other relevant history of note.\nShe initially underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her perineum. The endoscopy was reported as normal, whereas the MRI showed edema of the IAS. She subsequently had an endoanal ultrasound which confirmed that her IAS was abnormally thick and greater than 5 mm (Fig. ). Anal manometry revealed that although resting and squeeze pressures were within normal limits there were periods of a significant increase in anal resting pressure lasting longer than 2 minutes (Fig. ). Pressures during this period were in excess of 200 mmHg which settled spontaneously. These pressures were even higher than the maximum recorded squeeze pressure (Fig. ).\nShe had an examination of the anal canal under anesthetic which showed a very prominent sphincter complex. She also received Botox injections (Dysport\u2122) at the 3 and 9 o\u2019clock positions of the IAS which led to no subsequent resolution of her symptoms.

On cine images no regional wall motion abnormalities and on late gadolinium enhancement images no delayed myocardial enhancement were observed.\nSignal time curve analyses at stress and rest perfusion MR were performed at three different regions: normal myocardium at the mid-lateral wall and two perfusion defects at the mid-anterior and mid-inferior walls ().

Co-management with maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) was established due to advanced maternal age and a history of prior cesarean section. A transvaginal ultrasound performed by MFM during the twenty-third week of gestation revealed an area with increased vascularity near the prior cesarean section scar. A T2 MRI performed at 24 weeks gestation revealed an anterior and right lateral placenta with the anterior left inferior portion having a focal area of outpouching with secondary loss of the T2 low signal intensity. The MRI further confirmed increased vascularity in the region of the prior C-section scar tissue. The estimated placenta volume was 466.6 cc with 12.76 cc being abnormal placenta implantation (approximately 2.66% of the total placenta volume).\nAfter reviewing the imaging results and discussing with the patient, cesarean delivery with the desire of uterine preservation was mutually agreed upon. Due to the precision and minimal energy spread, a helium plasma focused RF energy device was utilized to obtain hemostasis without damaging the healthy layers beneath the level of placental invasion.

Subsequently, she was accepted to our clinic for surgery and open complex cyst removal was done under general anesthesia. The kidney was sutured watertight. However, in the postoperative period, a ureteral double j stent was placed because the drainage did not stop in the following 3-week duration. Because drainage of 250cc daily continued without any decrease the week following the double j stent placement, intravenous pyelography (IVP) was applied and urinary leakage was found (Figure\n). Urinary drainage was more prominent at night than during the day (250 versus 50cc). Subsequently, oral desmopressin was started at a dosage of 0.2mg/day in order to decrease the nocturnal urinary drainage; no abnormal situation was observed in serum electrolytes (specifically hyponatremia). The patient\u2019s drainage decreased dramatically to a daily total of 50cc and she was discharged on the fifth day of the medical treatment after the drainage had stopped. After 1 week when the patient came for follow-up, the desmopressin treatment was ended.

His operation was uneventful with no significant major intraoperative complications or use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. He was extubated within 24 hours posttransplant after an airway and anastomosis inspection via flexible bronchoscopy was unremarkable. The patient was treated with antibiotics for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus of the donor lung; other cultures were negative. The patient was to receive tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone for immunosuppression and nebulized amphotericin and intravenous valganciclovir for fungal and cytomegalovirus prophylaxis. No primary graft dysfunction was reported in the first 72 hours after surgery. CT without contrast was obtained on postoperative day 5 to evaluate a right lung basilar opacity, which showed extensive ground-glass opacities in the transplanted right lung, concerning reperfusion edema versus acute rejection. The patient was given diuretics, and glucocorticoid dosing was increased from prednisone 5 mg daily to methylprednisolone 40 mg intravenously twice a day. His postoperative course was further complicated by hypoxemia, for which a CT angiography was performed and showed a small distal pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe, decreased ground-glass opacities in the right lung, and increased patchy basilar platelike peribronchial opacities for which rejection could not be ruled out. The patient received three days of pulse glucocorticoid dosing of methylprednisolone 250 mg IV daily, which was subsequently decreased. Persistent abnormalities on chest radiography and continued hypoxemia led to additional imaging. CT of the thorax on postoperative day 15 showed right allograft opacities, for which glucocorticoids were continued out of concern for rejection.

The CT scan showed a subcutaneous tumor in the left lateral abdominal wall and multiple giant bilobar liver metastases which consisted in a 13.5 cm tumor in segment VII and a 9.5 cm tumor in segment IVb (Fig. ). The only related clinical record was the resection of a lipoma in that same area (left lateral abdominal wall) 12 years ago. An ultrasound-guided core-biopsy was performed on the subcutaneous lesion located in the left lumbar region and also on one of the focal lesions of the right hepatic lobe. Histologically, both samples were practically identical, which confirmed that the liver lesions were metastatic. The pathology showed a fusocellular proliferation of highly cellular mesenchymal lineage, with eosinophilic cytoplasm cells and ovoid nucleus with finely granular chromatin, without evident mitotic images. The Ki67 proliferative index was 20%. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for STATS6. After a multidisciplinary discussion, the preferred strategy proposed was an upfront resection of the primary tumor and liver metastases, without neoadjuvant chemo or radiotherapy due to lack of evidence as do its usefulness. The extend of the liver involvement precluded a complete resection in one procedure, so we designed a two stage strategy consisting in resection of the primary tumor and left hepatic metastases, followed by portal vein embolization and subsequent right hepatectomy. The liver function test prior to the surgery included a direct measure of the portal systemic gradient via transjugular catheter, and indocyanine green clearance (IGC) test, both favorable to perform a major resection (4 mmHg gradient; PDR 25; R15: 2).

On further questioning after being recovered from seizure, he complained of suffering from generalized headache for a duration of 10 days prior to the presentation. He denied having any weakness or numbness and denied any complains of speech or swallowing difficulties. On arrival, he was hypertensive up to 170/101 mm Hg and was hemodynamically stable otherwise. Neurological examination did not reveal any cranial nerve or cerebellar deficits and had no focal deficits, with normal symmetrical reflexes overall. Other system examinations were within normal limits.\nOn further investigation, initial CT brain was done, which did not reveal any abnormalities, and so he was admitted to the neurology critical care unit for further management. As a workup for seizure, MRI brain was performed, which revealed a right cerebellar small acute ischemic infarct (Figures \u2013). Subsequently, an MR angiography of the brain and neck was performed, which revealed filling defects causing focal narrowing in the origin of the internal carotid artery bilaterally. Routine brain EEG did not reveal any seizure activities.\nUpon admission to the neurology unit, he was started on aspirin and atorvastatin for treatment of stroke. Carbamazepine was introduced in view of seizure due to focal organic cause. He was worked up thoroughly for his stroke considering his young age with complete collagen vascular disease and thrombophilia workup. He was initially found to have thrombocytopenia as low as 50,000 platelets per microliter. A transthoracic echocardiography revealed a pedunculated and lobular left atrial mass (Figures -), which was measuring around 1 \u00d7 1.5 cm and was freely mobile across the mitral valve, oscillating across the left ventricular inflow. This finding was subsequently confirmed by a transesophageal echocardiography, with differential diagnosis of atrial myxoma at the top of the list.

In addition to these symptoms, she also felt unbalanced when walking fast. The symptoms were particularly severe when she moved her head from right to left. She experienced nausea and even vomiting when looking out the window while riding public transportation. She participated in a vestibular rehabilitation program for 3 weeks approximately 11 months prior to the start of this study. Her symptoms improved slightly, and she returned to work immediately. However, she was still unable to tolerate her workload and therefore volunteered to participate in this study. The caloric test showed 37% left-sided canal paresis on initial examination.\nAt the beginning of the training program, she was only able to perform training while seated in a completely steady position. She started feeling nauseous and the urge to vomit whenever her head movement speed exceeded 90o/s after approximately 30 seconds. After the second week, she gradually became able to perform training with speeds of 100-120o/s while seated.

However, significant upper body movement was still observed. On the 4th week of training, the patient was able to maintain her training performance with head movement speeds of 120o/s in a tandem stance.

    "original_text": "A 23-year-old French man of African origin, an elite football player, sustained a midshaft anterior cortex tibial stress fracture 2.5 years ago. Initially, he was treated with cast immobilization, no weight bearing for 3 months, ultrasound stimulation, and electromagnetic field therapy. The fracture did not heal; he had pain during gait, so he continued no weight bearing for 3 additional months. After that period, the fracture site still was not healed, so he underwent an operation performed by his team doctor. In this operation, the medullary canal of his tibia was reamed and an im nail was inserted.\nUnfortunately, the fracture site did not consolidate again, even 18-months postoperatively, so he presented to our clinic for counseling. It was obvious from the X-ray (Fig. ) that a nonunion of the fracture had occurred.\nHe did not smoke tobacco and he had a free medical history. When he presented to our clinic, the area at the fracture site was swollen and painful when palpated. The pain got worse when he attempted to walk with full weight bearing, so he had to use crutches. An examination of the peripheral nervous system of his lower extremities did not provide us with any pathologic findings. In addition, the laboratory examinations for possible endocrine or metabolic disorders were negative (Table ), so he was advised to have a reoperation to address this nonunion. The treatment options for such cases include nail exchange, drilling of the fracture site, bone grafting, or removal of the nail and internal fixation with a plate.

    "cleaned_text": "a 23-year-old french man of african origin, an elite football player, sustained a midshaft anterior cortex tibial stress fracture 2.5 years ago. initially, he was treated with cast immobilization, no weight bearing for 3 months, ultrasound stimulation, and electromagnetic field therapy. the fracture did not heal; he had pain during gait, so he continued no weight bearing for 3 additional months. after that period, the fracture site still was not healed, so he underwent an operation performed by his team doctor. in this operation, the medullary canal of his tibia was reamed and an im nail was inserted.\nunfortunately, the fracture site did not consolidate again, even 18-months postoperatively, so he presented to our clinic for counseling. it was obvious from the x-ray (fig. ) that a nonunion of the fracture had occurred.\nhe did not smoke tobacco and he had a free medical history. when he presented to our clinic, the area at the fracture site was swollen and painful when palpated. the pain got worse when he attempted to walk with full weight bearing, so he had to use crutches. an examination of the peripheral nervous system of his lower extremities did not provide us with any pathologic findings. in addition, the laboratory examinations for possible endocrine or metabolic disorders were negative (table ), so he was advised to have a reoperation to address this nonunion. the treatment options for such cases include nail exchange, drilling of the fracture site, bone grafting, or removal of the nail and internal fixation with a plate. we performed a tension band plate fixation, which is a technique already described for the treatment of anterior tibial stress fractures that failed non-operative treatment [], with bone grafting and without removing the nail.\na longitudinal incision was made just lateral to the anterior tibial crest centered over the fracture site. the fascia over the tibialis anterior was divided, the muscle lifted off and the fracture site was visualized. the necrotic bone and",

He reported that he had visited the emergency room at that time and was diagnosed as having a left thigh abscess which was incised and drained. No cultures were obtained during that visit. He was seen in follow-up at the HIV clinic where cultures of the drainage were obtained and he was given a prescription for minocycline. He had resolution of the drainage but relapsed 1 month later with pain and drainage from the left hip while still taking minocycline. He presented to the hospital in a \"desperate attempt to seek medical attention\" secondary to the persistent pain, swelling, yellowish drainage and difficulty with ambulation requiring the use of crutches.\nOn review of symptoms, the patient reported severe pain of the left lower extremity and hip which had gradually worsened to a severity scale of 10 out of 10. He denied any trauma to the site, associated fevers, or chills. No other acute symptoms were reported by the patient.\nPatient denied any significant past medical history except HIV which was initially diagnosed in 2000. His nadir CD4 was 247 cells/mm3 and he was started on antiretroviral therapy in 2001. At his last clinic visit less than 3 months prior, he had an absolute CD4 count of 540 cells/uL and a HIV RNA viral load of < 50 copies on his current regimen of zidovudine/lamivudine and lopinavir/ritonavir He reported no known drug allergies.

As part of our ongoing study \u201cVaginal delivery after caesarean section\u201d, she underwent saline contrast sonohysterography 6 months after the caesarean section. The caesarean scar had a small indentation and the remaining myometrium over the defect was 7.5 mm (Fig. ).\nIn the current pregnancy, she had a dating scan at around 11 weeks with no remarks. She came for a transvaginal ultrasound examination at around 13 weeks as part of our study. This scan revealed a duplex pregnancy with one viable intrauterine fetus with normal anatomy and placenta located high on the anterior wall and a small gestational sac (8 mm) with a yolk sac without embryo was located in the caesarean scar (Fig. ). There was no extensive vascularity surrounding the sac. One corpus luteum was found in each of the two ovaries. She was asymptomatic.\nShe was informed that not enough evidence existed to advise a specific management of this condition. After discussion with her and her husband, expectant management was chosen with a new ultrasound examination after 5 weeks.\nShe came to our ultrasound department at 18 weeks, 22 weeks, and 30 weeks of gestation. She remained asymptomatic. The ectopic gestational sac was not visualized with transvaginal or transabdominal scans at the 18 weeks examination (Fig. ). The niche in the scar and the thickness of the thinnest part of the remaining myometrium appeared unchanged at all visits. The intrauterine pregnancy developed normally with no signs of abnormal placentation. At 30 weeks of gestation the ultrasound appearance of the scar area did not indicate any contraindications for vaginal delivery. The thickness of the lower uterine segment (LUS) was 4.9 mm (Fig. ).
