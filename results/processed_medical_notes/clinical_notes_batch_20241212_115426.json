A huge abdominal mass was palpated, and she was referred to the gynecology department to search for a tumor of uterine origin. She was premenopausal and had no significant past medical history. Physical findings revealed a large elastic hard mass extending from the xiphoid to the pubic bone. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed a huge tumor on the uterine corpus, and a number of dilated vessels were observed between the tumor and the myometrium. Therefore, the tumor was suspected to derive from the uterus. The tumor showed an uneven signal on T2-weighted sagittal section (), and the enhanced MRI study showed that the tumor edge but not the center was enhanced (). As such, necrosis was suspected to have occurred in the center of the tumor. Uterine sarcoma was primarily suspected due to the large size, degeneration, and necrosis on MRI imaging. Computed tomography (CT) examination showed no lymph node swelling or distant metastasis. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed anemia (hemoglobin level, 5.6g/dl). We transfused 18 units of RCC before surgery. CT examination and ultrasonography on lower extremities indicated an absence of thrombosis. Preoperative serum levels of CEA, CA 19-9, CA 125, and LDH were within normal limits. A biopsy of the endometrium was not collected as the sounding examination of the endometrium was unsuccessful due to a deviated uterine cervix.

    "original_text": "A 9-month-old female infant with a bodyweight of 8.3 kg was admitted to our cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) due to failure to wean from invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. The patient was the second child of a young couple, without a history of consanguinity or a family history of vascular abnormalities. The fetal ultrasound at 35 weeks and 2 days of gestation revealed LPA arising from the RPA resulting in a PAS. Prenatal laboratory investigations were unremarkable including a normal amniotic fluid genetic microarray. Due to the prenatal diagnosis of PAS, the baby was delivered by cesarean section at 39 weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 3,000 g and normal Apgar scores.\nA neonatal transthoracic echocardiogram further confirmed the diagnosis of PAS without additional intracardiac anomalies. Since the baby was initially asymptomatic with normal clinical examination, no imaging modalities were performed, merely periodic outpatient follow-up being arranged in the local hospital. The patient was referred to our hospital for developing recurrent wheezing and progressive respiratory distress following acute respiratory infections since 7 months of age. There was no vomiting, feeding issues, and recurrent respiratory infections. To better delineate the anatomy of the PAS and to evaluate the airway, a computed tomography angiography (CTA) was undergone at 8 months of age, demonstrating that the LPA had its origin from RPA and coursed between the esophagus and trachea to the left lung hilum (shown in ). Despite segmental stenosis of proximal LPA was observed with the smallest inner diameter of 1.7 mm, no marked tracheal stenosis and complete tracheal cartilage rings were identified. Subsequently, the patient was hospitalized. Physical examination revealed moderate distress (nasal flaring and subcostal retractions) and tachypnea with respiratory rates of 56 breaths/min in the absence of dysmorphic features, heart murmurs, or extremity edema. Given the poor response to medical therapy, the patient was finally referred for surgical correction of the PAS by reimplantation of the reconstructed LPA to the left side",

He had a significant past history of a radical cystectomy ten years prior for a large multi-focal non-invasive, low-grade papillary (Ta) transitional cell carcinoma. The stated indications for cystectomy were large size of the mass and the anticipated inability to perform a complete resection. The pathological specimen which was reviewed at our institution was described as a low-grade non invasive papillary multifocal transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). The margins were clear and fourteen uninvolved lymph nodes were submitted. Postoperatively the patient recovered well and was under surveillance without any disease till above mentioned complaint.

He presented with no face swelling and superficial varicose veins. He was a former smoker, and medical history included hypertension and diabetes mellitus. At bronchoscopy, the tumor was found occluding the right upper lobar bronchus and infiltrating the bronchus intermedius. It was diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma by transbronchial tumor biopsy. Chest contrast computed tomography (CT) revealed that the mass of 80 mm in the maximum diameter located in the right upper lobe. The tumor directly invaded the arch of the right PA and a wide range of SVC. It was discovered that the left brachiocephalic vein (BCV) along the left margin of mediastinum walking down the line directly into the coronary sinus (). A venous flow was detected in the anterolateral descending aorta with dilatation of the coronary sinus (diameter of 21 mm) without other heart abnormalities by transthoracic echocardiography. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of PLSVC was made. There were no detectable metastases in other organs through brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), upper abdomen CT scan and bone nuclear scan.\nThe right posterolateral thoracotomy was performed on October 31, 2006.

His previous history was uneventful; however, he was only 149 cm in height () and had suffered from coxalgia for a long time. Radiography revealed osseous projections at the knee and shoulder joints (). On radiographs and multidirectional computed tomography imaging of the hip joint a gigantic femoral head was observed, as well as increased shaft angle and large diameter of the femoral neck (). The patient had also developed coxarthrosis and severe pain of the right hip joint. The range of motion of the right hip joint was limited in flexion and abduction. His Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) hip joint function score was 45. Radiographs showed stage 4 arthritis based on the JOA hip score, with no ectopic ossification.\nRight total hip arthroplasty was performed using the direct lateral approach.

Since then, she have been performed the aortic graft replacements for dissected aortic aneurysm total five times. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a highly tortuous left axillary aortic aneurysm (maximum diameter, 22 mm) (). We attributed the numbness to the compression of the brachial plexus due to the aneurysm. Accordingly, we performed an elective graft replacement with resection of the aneurysm to prevent aneurysmal rupture and thromboembolic events.\nDuring the operation, the aneurysm was exposed through two skin incisions (). The first skin incision was 4 cm on the supraclavicular area along the left clavicle. We carefully dissected the surrounding tissues and approached the aneurysm by avoiding any injury to the brachial plexus and internal jugular vein. In addition, we performed taping of the proximal anastomotic site. The second incision was 8 cm on the infraclavicular area from the sternoclavicular joint to the anterior axillary line. The major and minor pectoral muscles were not transected, but were separated along the length of the muscle fibers. The taping of three sites of the aneurysm was performed for segmental aortic clamping (). After intravenously injecting 5,000 IU heparin, we performed graft replacement using an expanded 6-mm polyester vascular prosthesis with external ring support after clamping of the proximal and distal arterial segments ( and ). We carefully located the vascular graft through the clavicle without touching the brachial plexus. Complete aneurysmal resection was performed after the ligation of branches from the aneurysm that were detected on a preoperative CT scan ().

He had a history of several diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for low back pain. At last, an abdominal computed tomography revealed a solid lesion (5 \u00d7 3.5 cm) at the pancreatic corpus and tail, which had indistinguishable fatty interplains with superior mesenteric artery (). Right hepatic artery was observed to be originating from proximal portion of the superior mesenteric artery (). The patient and his relatives were informed that optimum clarification of the tumor whether it was resectable or not could be done only during surgical exploration due to the close relationship of the tumor and the main abdominal branches of the aorta. The patient was operated with his relatives' consent. During exploration it was noted that the mass had invaded transvers mesocolon on the splenic flexure site and at the level of Treitz ligament. The mass was in close contact with superior mesenteric vein as well. Following division of the gastrocolic ligament, it was noted that the mass was adherent to the celiac axis and invaded the left renal vein, but it was completely released from the superior mesenteric artery. In this state (situation), distal pancreatectomy (pancreatic tissue on the left portion of portal vein), splenectomy, celiac axis resection, partial gastrectomy, left nephrectomy, left adrenalectomy, and left hemicolectomy with end colostomy by closure of the distal stump were performed (). Before deciding on celiac axis resection, we occluded the celiac axis with a vascular clamp and checked and felt the hepatic arterial pulsation at the hepatic hilum. Tumor adhesions to the celiac axis were not divided and en-bloc resection of the celiac axis was done (along) with the tumor. For gastric wall invasion, at first, we only performed a localized posterior gastric wall resection, but this procedure was completed to near-total gastrectomy due to ischemia of the remaining part of stomach. Gastric continuity was obtained by a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy. Duration",

While chemotherapy dramatically reduces the size of enlarged lymph nodes and the spleen, bodily damage also increases with dosage escalation. For the first few months, the patient recuperated at home, but this gradually decreased to one month, then to one week, and after about one year, he could not be discharged from the hospital.

When the effects finally began to wane, and it became difficult to predict whether bodily damage or the curative effects would be greater, he was told that he had about one month to live if therapy was discontinued. To the patient, choosing to discontinue chemotherapy was tantamount to giving into death, and thus he desired, as a last resort, to undergo aggressive treatment in a sterile room. Although the attending physician and I doubted the wisdom in carrying out chemotherapy, the disease specialist suggested that the choice be left to the patient.

Her history included locally advanced bladder cancer for which she had undergone pelvic exenteration and ileal conduit formation in November 2015. At that time, she had a known primary lung adenocarcinoma as well, but had no known liver metastases or other liver disease. Intravenous contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed in January 2016 raised the possibility of cirrhosis; however this was not biopsy-proven. In April 2016, she began to notice intermittent bleeding from her stoma which was initially thought to be mechanical tissue breakdown from the stomal flange. Concern for hepatic encephalopathy was raised when she had her first episode of confusion in December 2016. At that time CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated strong radiographic suspicion for cirrhosis together with prominent vessels surrounding the urinary diversion site suspicious for portal hypertension. Despite not having a tissue biopsy, she was diagnosed clinically with cryptogenic cirrhosis in May 2017 during a hospitalization for fatigue, anasarca, and altered mental status. An upper endoscopy performed in June 2017 demonstrated portal hypertensive gastropathy but no esophageal varices.\nUpon presentation to the Emergency Department in July 2017 she had significant hemorrhage from her stoma resulting in hemodynamic instability.

    "original_text": "This 55-year-old man was admitted for a several-month history of personality change and more recently had been becoming increasingly drowsy and was noted to be dragging his left foot. A CT scan of the head revealed a large cystic mass in the right frontal lobe with compression of the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle and right-to-left shift. Decreased signal was seen extending throughout the white matter of the frontal lobe across the genu of the corpus callosum into the left frontal lobe. An MRI of the head confirmed the large complex mass with contrast enhancement of the solid component, as well as a portion of the rim of the cystic component. However, the enhancing component did not extend into the corpus callosum. The differential diagnosis was glioblastoma or possibly a metastatic deposit. While in the hospital, his condition deteriorated and he was given dexamethasone with some improvement. A CT scan of the head revealed a new large intratumoral hemorrhage. An emergent craniotomy was performed with drainage of the cyst and a subtotal resection of the tumor, which appeared to extend into the temporal lobe. The patient received adjuvant external beam radiotherapy with a total dose of 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions. MRI studies performed 6 months post-operatively revealed a new focus of contrast enhancement suspicious for recurrence, which decreased in size on the most recent imaging 2 months later. However, the extent of the surrounding non-enhancing T2/FLAIR signal abnormality had increased.

She had a significant family history of premature coronary artery disease. Her father had a coronary artery disease diagnosed in his 40\u2019s, her mother had a pacemaker inserted, and she had two first degree relatives diagnosed with an early cardiac disease. She is a nonsmoker, nonalcoholic drinker and denied recreational drug use. She was in her usual state of health and functionally active until her husband noticed her moaning and eventually unresponsive in the middle of the night. Prior to this, the patient did not complain of any chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, lightheadedness or any other constitutional symptoms. Her husband started cardiopulmonary resuscitation and was taken over by the emergency medical staff (EMS). She was intubated and defibrillated five times by EMS for ventricular fibrillation then was given a bolus of amiodarone. She eventually had a return of spontaneous circulation and was transported to the hospital in which she was noted to have decorticate posturing with no purposeful movements. Electrocardiogram (ECG) during this time showed sinus rhythm (Figure ). She was admitted to the coronary care unit and was placed on targeted temperature management and was maintained on amiodarone drip. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed no valvular abnormalities, normal left atrium and left ventricular cavity size but with borderline concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 56% and note of subtle regional wall motion abnormalities. About 12 hours after initiating the targeted temperature management, the patient was in severe bradycardia in the mid 30\u2019s and a decision was made to hold the amiodarone at that point. The patient completed the targeted temperature management protocol and eventually had a full neurologic recovery thereafter.\nShe was extubated and subsequently transferred to the floor.

He gave a history of multiple failed ear wax removal in his left ear that had been performed at several ENT clinics, despite the use of alkaline ear drops.\nOn examination, the patient was comfortable and afebrile, and his vital signs were stable. Otoscopic examination of the left ear revealed impacted left ear wax covering the tympanic membrane, which could not be assessed. Otoscopic examination of the right ear also demonstrated mild ear wax, and the tympanic membrane was unremarkable. Oropharynx examination was unremarkable, the lymph nodes of the neck were not palpable, and all cranial nerves were intact upon examination. Nasal endoscopy revealed no pathologies. Ear wax removal under suction was attempted and failed. Another trial of removal after using alkaline ear drops for several days was also attempted but was unsuccessful. However, the surgeon became suspicious that the patient had KO rather than impacted ear wax because the wax was thick, had the appearance of keratin plugs, and was hard to remove after several attempts, despite the use of ear alkaline drops.\nBlood test results of the patient were within normal limits. The patient was planned for microscope-guided examination of the ears under general anesthesia. The examination revealed that the left ear was full of wax that was accumulating in the skin and contained a thick keratinous plug that had dilated the external auditory canal (EAC) with pockets and bone remodeling.

    "original_text": "Presentation\nA 60-year-old female with a history of gastrointestinal malignancy had previously undergone a pancreaticoduoduodenectomy after 12 cycles of FOLFOX therapy. Follow-up PET-CT was concerning for a metastatic left pulmonary nodule. This was further evaluated with a chest CT as shown in Figure . She was started on FOLFIRI and SRS of both lung nodules. Despite these therapies, there was progression of the nodule in the left lower lobe of the lung. Additionally, there was new thickening of the distal transverse colon. After discussion at the multidisciplinary tumor board one year after her completion of SRS the decision was made to proceed with staged metastectomy of the abdominal and left pulmonary lesions. The patient noted several months of left-sided chest-wall pain treated with lidocaine patches and no identifiable musculoskeletal abnormalities on preoperative imaging. Seven days after undergoing open left colectomy with lymphadenectomy, she did proceed to the operating room with the thoracic surgery team.\nIntervention\nThe patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the right decubitus position. Thoracoscopic evaluation was begun and there was bulging of the pleura noted adjacent to the lung lesion. Upon incision of the pleura there was a rush of necrotic material with an incidentally noted rib fracture. This was debrided and sent for both cultures and pathology. Frozen sections were performed but negative for evidence of malignancy. The standard wedge resection was then completed with lymphadenectomy. A chest tube was left in place and the patient was taken to the critical care unit for postoperative monitoring.\nHospital Course and Follow Up\nThe patient was noted to have an air leak postoperatively. The preoperatively placed epidural was removed on postoperative day two due to inadequate analgesia.

He had decreased visual acuity in the left eye from a previous gunshot wound to the face. The patient was diagnosed at initial presentation with a giant, fusiform left PCA aneurysm which was partially thrombosed. It was decided at the time of diagnosis that the risk of morbidity associated with either endovascular or microsurgical treatment of the aneurysm exceeded that of conservative management. Over time, the patient's headaches progressively worsened to an average visual analog scale (VAS) score of 7/10 despite maximal medical management, and the aneurysm gradually enlarged over serial angiographic imaging. The decision was made at this time to treat the lesion via an endovascular approach with the PED (). The aneurysm was successfully treated with two telescoping PEDs, 2.5\u00d720 mm and 3.0\u00d730 mm in size. The patient was discharged on standard oral dual antiplatelet therapy, clopidogrel 75 mg daily and aspirin 325 mg daily, without any change in neurological function. The severity of the patient's headache remained unchanged after PED treatment.\nThe patient presented three months post-PED with progressively worsening headaches to an average VAS score of 9/10, new gait ataxia, and new temporal hemianopsia of the right eye. While the stents remained patent at six weeks, by the follow-up angiography at three months, the diseased segment of the left PCA had progressed to complete occlusion at the origin of the proximal PED (). The patient's new temporal hemianopsia of the right eye was attributed to the left PCA occlusion. However, despite occlusion of the parent vessel, the aneurysm had continued to enlarge, resulting in local mass effect and cerebral edema as well as obstructive hydrocephalus. Therefore, the decision was made to surgically resect the aneurysm. The patient was taken to the operating room for an endoscopic third ventriculostomy, which was performed in a standard fashion through a right frontal burr hole",

Her past surgical history included fixation of a reverse obliquity intertrochanteric hip fracture with a sliding hip screw in 2008. She was asymptomatic on the right side.\nRadiographs obtained in the emergency department revealed a left-sided femoral shaft fracture at the distal aspect of the five-hole lateral plate and screw fixation of the previously applied five-hole side plate. Of note, the periprosthetic fracture demonstrated cortical thickening at the fracture site of the lateral femoral cortex, lack of comminution as well as a transverse appearance (Figs. and ).\nThe patient was taken to the operating room the next day for retrograde placement of an intramedullary nail of the left femur with revision of left intertrochanteric femur fracture fixation.

Pulmonary thromboembolism was initially suspected; however, chest computed tomography angiography ruled out this diagnostic hypothesis.\nThe patient had undergone a hysterectomy 2 years earlier due to leiomyoma. She had been experiencing pelvic pain during the past 6 months. An abdominal ultrasound performed 2 months prior to presentation showed an apparently vascularized left periovarian solid mass with an approximate volume of 90 mL. Surgery for resection of the mass was scheduled but could not be performed because of abrupt onset of the current symptoms suggestive of heart failure.\nThe patient was transferred to our hospital for further evaluation. On admission, her vital signs were within normal limits. On physical examination, we disclosed a regular cardiac rhythm, hypophonic first heart sound, and a regurgitation murmur at the left inferior sternal border associated with an increased v wave venous pulse on internal jugular vein compatible with tricuspid regurgitation. A transthoracic echocardiography performed in the emergency room revealed a mobile and well-defined mass measuring \u223c3.0 \u00d7 1.6 cm located in the right ventricular cavity, apparently adhered to the interventricular septum, and a probable thickening of the tricuspid subvalvar apparatus and severe tricuspid regurgitation (Figure ). The right ventricle (RV) was enlarged with depressed systolic function. Left ventricle (LV) dimension and systolic function were normal. As it was not clear if the mass was a thrombus or a tumour, the patient underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging which revealed two large and independent masses in the right ventricular cavity (Figure ). Both lesions were iso-intense to the signal of myocardial tissue on T1 and T2-weighted imaging. The first-pass gadolinium-enhanced perfusion imaging showed heterogeneous nature of flow of contrast suggesting vascularity within the masses and both showed heterogeneous late gadolinium enhancement. These characteristics suggested the tumoural nature of the masses and ruled out the hypothesis of thrombus (Fig",

The patient was never smoker, without family history of cancer and without comorbidity. The cytological diagnosis was made using a CT-guided fine needle aspiration of the primary tumor and revealed an adenocarcinoma of the lung (TTF1+, CK7+) with the EGFR ex19del mutation. A PET-CT demonstrated the presence of liver and bone metastases and a nodule in the right breast, confirmed as a metastasis by fine needle aspiration. The patient received zoledronic acid 4 mg every 28 days and gefitinib 250 mg daily since November 2012 obtaining a partial response (PR). In August 2013, a disease progression (PD) was documented, with an increase in size of the primary tumor and size and number of liver metastases. A brain MRI revealed the presence of two cortical nodules, which were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy. The patient was enrolled in the IMPRESS trial and received 6 cycles of cisplatin and pemetrexed plus gefitinib obtaining again a PR that lasted until June 2014. Thereafter, a new lung metastasis appeared in the superior lobe of the left lung and the mammary nodule increased in dimensions. From June 2014 to December 2014 the patient received erlotinib 150 mg daily obtaining an initial stabilization of the disease (SD); however, within 6 months, she experienced again a PD with the increase of the mammary nodule and the appearance of a new bone metastasis in the sacrum. In December 2014, EGFR ex19del and T790M mutations were detectable in a new needle biopsy of the primary tumor; only at this time a digital PCR-based method was available for the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Briefly, the method was optimized in order to recover a suitable amount of ctDNA for molecular analysis from 3 ml of plasma using the QIAmp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit",

In the course of index hospitalization, the patient self-reported his coprophagic behavior during his initial psychiatric assessment. The patient stated that he believed that the consumption of feces was preventing him from going to jail and facing the death penalty for a murder that he claimed he committed in the past. He was unable to describe any specifics for his murder but felt that he deserved unusually cruel and harsh punishment from law enforcement that could only be prevented by consuming feces. This feeling of guilt and continued belief that he was deserving of cruel and harsh punishment induced his coprophagic behavior. He did not report any associated command auditory hallucinations but expressed depressed mood as he discussed his reasons for feeling guilty. His affect was however incongruent with his stated depressed mood. He was oriented to person, place, and time.

Labs showed transaminitis as well as elevated bilirubin concerning biliary obstruction. The patient was also noted to have gram-negative rod bacteremia. Computerized Tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen pelvis revealed significant intra and extrahepatic ductal dilation and intra and extrahepatic pneumobilia (). He underwent an ERCP and found to have thick sludge and stone debris from the ampullary orifice. Due to a concern for a possible filling defect in the distal common bile duct versus possible stricture, distal common bile duct brushings were performed in addition to biopsies and stenting with a 10 French 5\u202fcm biliary stent. Pathology from the brushing and biopsies were negative for dysplasia or malignancy.\nDuring his hospitalization, the patient was found to have elevated troponins and electrocardiogram (EKG) changes consistent with NSTEMI. He underwent a pharmacological stress test followed by coronary angiography. He was found to have chronic occlusion of his Right Coronary Artery (RCA). Given these findings and acute coronary events, surgical intervention for cholecystectomy was delayed. The patient was brought back for robotic cholecystectomy after subsequent follow-up and clearance with his cardiologist and surgery clinic. Intraoperative findings revealed dense adhesions to the gallbladder involving the omentum and colon. A dense adhesion was present between the gallbladder and the transverse colon, and a provisional diagnosis of cholecystocolonic fistula was made on further dissection. The case was continued robotically, and the diagnosis of cholecystocolonic fistula was confirmed with the finding of a fistula between the fundus of the gallbladder and the transverse colon ().

When she arrived at the emergency room, she experienced severe pain in the right knee, which was swollen and had functional limitation. Lateral radiograph and CT better revealed comminuted fracture of the distal posterolateral femoral condyle and rotational dislocation of the knee joint (Fig. ). Physical examination showed the pulse of dorsalis pedis arteria and posterior tibial artery could be detected, with no abnormal sensation over the affected limb. The dorsal and plantar flexion function of the ankle joint was normal. In order to avoid the damage of peripheral vessels and nerves caused by dislocation of the knee joint, we first applied manual reduction on the dislocated knee joint (Fig. ). Furthermore, MRI results clearly reported a complete rupture of bilateral collateral ligaments, anteroposterior cruciate ligaments and avulsion of lateral meniscus (Fig. ). We did not perform the Lachman tests and Bohler sign due to the drastic pain in the right knee. In order to prevent arthrofibrosis of knee joint caused by hematoma in the future, the patient underwent knee joint puncture under ultrasound guidance and had 100 ml of bloody fluid drained. Then, we used elastic bandages to compress the affected knee joint in order to prevent the formation of hematoma. After five days, the swelling subsided and we were able to operate.
