Her bowel habit was mildly altered but there was no history of passing blood per rectally. She denied any loss of weight or appetite. Interestingly she gave a history of eating a large amount of Chinese mushroom a few days prior to her presentation. Medically she was being treated for hypertension and congestive cardiac failure. Her past surgical history consists of a laparotomy performed 26 years ago and a right nephrectomy for renal stone performed 20 years ago. She was however unable to ascertain the reason for the laparotomy.\nOn admission, her vital signs were stable with BP of 200/90 and HR of 100/m. Chest auscultation revealed reduced air entry and crepitation at the right lower lobe. Her abdomen was soft but slightly distended. A mobile vague mass was palpable at the left iliac fossa. Bowel sound was sluggish and per-rectal examination revealed an empty rectum with no palpable mass. Her hernia orifice were normal.\nChest radiograph was done and showed right lower lobe consolidation with evidence of chronic obstructive airway disease and cor pulmonale. Echocardiogram showed evidence of cor pulmonale with no acute ischaemic changes. Her blood investigation results were unremarkable. Blood culture was positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus. Urine culture and sputum AFB were negative. Her amylase level was normal.\nPrior to admission to our hospital, the patient had a barium meal and follow-through examination and CT scan of the abdomen done at the referring hospital.

His chest radiograph raised suspicion of AN of the thoracic aorta. Computed tomographic angiogram then confirmed the presence of two large anastomotic PANs at both ends of the graft (\n) as well as an occluded right SCA, stenosis of the left vertebral artery, and bovine origin of the carotid arteries (\n).\nIn view of this complex anatomy, the decision was made to use a hybrid approach to address these findings. In a first stage, a right carotid artery to right SCA bypass was done using a short segment of Goretex graft (\n). Next, using single lung ventilation, a right posterolateral thoracotomy was performed and the chest entered through the fifth intercostal space. With the diaphragm retracted inferiorly, the pericardium, posterior to the phrenic nerve, was gently lifted with a long clamp, thus allowing exposure of the distal most portion of the thoracic aorta, medial to the inferior vena cava (IVC). After heparinization, the aorta was partially clamped and a 22 mm Hemashield graft anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion to an appropriate aortotomy using a continuous suture of 5\u20130 Prolene (\n). The graft was then brought posteriorly to the IVC and anteriorly to the right hilum, then anastomosed in an end-to-side similar fashion to the partially occluded ascending aorta through a vertical pericardial opening (\n,\n).\nThe immediate postoperative course was uneventful, and 5 days later, the patient was brought to the hybrid operating room for completion angiogram.

Her family also reported mild confusion. There was no known family history of neurological disease, and she had not reported any recent diarrheal illness preceding her symptoms. She was admitted to the hospital with initial diagnosis of possible MS. The patient also had dysuria and urinalysis was consistent with urinary tract infection on admission. She was started on intravenous antibiotics and IV fluid resuscitation for the urinary tract infection.\nWhile on the floors, a detailed history and physical examination was done. The patient had a history of a gastric sleeve surgery 2 months prior and was taking her supplements (including vitamins) as prescribed.

    "original_text": "We describe the case of a 54 year old, non-smoker, Caucasian woman, a computer programmer, who was admitted to the General Hospital in June 2003, following an episode of overdose with Citalopram and alcohol. At the time of her admission, she gave a history of depression and suicidal ideation for six months. She was not known to the local psychiatric service.\nThe patient was discovered by her twin sister soon after the overdose. Initially, she had disclosed to the medical doctor admitting her that she had taken approximately 14 tablets of 20 mgs of Citalopram along with 2 bottles of red wine. However, later on she informed us that she might have taken up to 30 tablets of 20 mgs Citalopram. The actual amount ingested remains unclear.\nSoon after her admission, she complained of painful left eye with blurred vision, and was seen by the Ophthalmologist, who found that our patient had an intra-ocular pressure of 23 mmHg in the right eye and 60 mmHg of mercury in the left eye (Normal IOP-10\u201320 mm Hg), with left corneal edema, and fixed dilated pupils.

A diagnosis of left angle-closure glaucoma was made and medications were commenced to reduce the elevated IOP. Further investigations including routine blood investigations revealed no abnormalities.

The blood tests did not show any abnormalities, and the CT showed the presence of three, similarly sized spleens, but no other abnormalities. As the patient did not have any other symptoms, she was sent home with a prescription for an analgesic. However, the abdominal pain did not improve and she returned to the hospital 2 days later. Her inflammatory markers were somewhat elevated, and an enhanced CT showed that one of the multiple spleens did not pick up the contrast (Fig. a). We diagnosed her with splenic infarction; however, the cause of the infarction was unclear, and torsion or embolism was considered possibilities. The patient was admitted and began conservative therapy, including fasting and antibiotic administration. However, neither her abdominal pain nor inflammatory marker levels improved (Fig. b). Hence, we performed a follow-up enhanced-CT scan, 2 days after admission, which showed that the splenic infarction had not improved and that ascitic fluid was present around the spleen and in the pelvic space (Fig. ). At this point, we decided to surgically remove the infarcted spleen. Considering that the patient was a young woman, we elected to perform a laparoscopic splenectomy after receiving informed consent.\nThe surgery was performed under general anesthesia, with the patient in a supine position and her legs spread apart. We created an umbilical incision and inserted three operating ports along the left subcostal margin (5 mm, 12 mm, and 5 mm in size), and a 5-mm operating port on the left side of the abdomen (Fig. ).

On past history, she underwent total thyroidectomy for nodular hyperplasia, and mass excision with skin flap operation for a huge sacral ulcerative neurofibroma. The plain chest X-ray showed a well-defined, huge cystic mass and compression of the right whole lung (Fig. ), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed 14 x 11.5 x 11 cm, and 9.2 x 9.1 X 8.6 cm double cystic masses connected with T4-5 and T5-6 neural foramens in the right posterior mediastinum (Fig. ). We decided to do a surgical resection due to a symptomatic huge mediastinal mass. However, because this case had compression symptoms by a huge neurosurgical lesion, which could result in neurological problems or difficult manipulations during thoracic surgery, we performed a neurosurgical collaborative management. As for a preliminary treatment, the patient underwent the CP shunt procedure under general anesthesia by a neurosurgeon. A percutaneous catheter was inserted into the meningocele by transthoracic puncture with a needle at the T3-4 level under the fluoroscopy guidance, and a peritoneal catheter was placed through a limited abdominal incision. At postoperative 12 days, the CP shunt revision was performed due to accidental break of a cystic catheter. But the symptoms continued and the size of cystic mass and the amount of newly developed pleural effusion did not change significantly. We expected initial CP shunt would to perform functions to the patient, however, it was not sufficiently effective due to the thick wall of meningocele. Thus, surgical correction was decided and thoracotomy was the only choice since meningocele was extremely large to fill hemithorax. The CP shunt catheter was preoperatively removed at operative room, and then posterolateral thoracotomy was performed through the 5th intercostal space in the left down decubitus position. Two large meningoceles were compressing the whole lung out to collapse. After a dissection was conducted on the meningoceles",

He had no history of trauma to his left upper limb and no significant past medical history. He did not take any medications. He was an army officer and had been an army officer for 16 years. Two years prior to the current accident, he was transferred to the administration unit of the Ministry of Defense. His job scope was mainly office work.

He did not consume alcohol.\nIn our Emergency Department, his vital signs were stable with blood pressure 132/80, pulse rate 79/minute, and temperature 37 \u00b0C. A physical examination of his left upper limb revealed a tender, fluctuant swelling over the left antecubital fossa with slight limitation in his left elbow range of motion due to pain. There was ecchymosis over the lateral aspect of his left elbow joint but his left elbow was not deformed. His left radial pulse was feeble and his left ulnar pulse was not palpable. Capillary refill times of all fingers were more than 2 seconds. Sensation over left upper limb was normal. Doppler signal of brachial artery proximal to cubital fossa was triphasic, radial artery was monophasic, and ulnar artery was absent.

The patient denied a history of trauma, infection, and neoplasm. Physical examination showed that his right upper extremity displayed extensive swelling, hyperpigmentation, and subcutaneous palpable varicosities. The motor and sensory functions were normal. Ultrasonography and computed tomographic angiography (CTA) showed that the right subclavian vein was occluded due to compression of the stent in the subclavian artery and there were multiple arteriovenous communications between the right subclavian artery and the adjacent veins (Fig. A and B). A diagnosis of VTOS with recurrent AVM was suspected.\nThe patient was scheduled for endovascular therapy following extensive deliberation. An angiogram of the artery showed that multiple feeding arteries arising from the right subclavian artery formed connections with the adjacent veins, and the subclavian vein emerged in advance (Fig. A). We positioned a 10 mm \u00d7 80 mm fluency stent in the subclavian artery to block the feeding arteries and successfully embolized the remaining branches with coils (Fig. B). Next, an angiogram of the vein demonstrated complete occlusion of the right subclavian vein near the previous arterial stent and a mass of enlarged veins (Fig. C). During the procedure, when the balloon was inflated in the subclavian vein, a sharp incisura emerged from the narrowest vein segment (Fig. D). We performed successful dilation three times (lasting 2 minutes each time), followed by the positioning of another 10 mm \u00d7 60 mm Fluency stent in the right subclavian vein. The last confirmatory angiogram demonstrated that both the stents as well as the subclavian vessels, were patent and in normal condition, and most of AVM nidus had completely disappeared (Fig. E and F).",

She had a medical history of arterial hypertension and in 2015 she underwent a laparotomic left nephrectomy for hydroureteronephrosis caused by recurrent kidney stones.\nIn March 2017, she had a neck ultrasound showing a nodule with a size of 9 \u00d7 5 mm in the lower third of the left thyroid lobe, consistent with left parathyroid. Subsequent T99m single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT scans did not show any uptake of the radioactive tracer at the level of the lower left thyroid gland different from the surrounding glandular tissue. A left parathyroidectomy was scheduled and preoperative laboratory tests showed elevated PTH at 453 pg/ml, low Vitamin D at 25.1 ng/ml, elevated serum calcium of 12.9 mg/dl, slightly reduced level of phosphorus. A neck CT was performed, not showing solid growing mass in the cervical district, in the absence of observable thyroid or parathyroid lesions.\nIntraoperative PTH at the beginning of surgery was 440 pg/ml. The intervention started with a Kocher cervicotomy and cervical exploration at the left lower thyroid lobe. Here, there was a voluminous lesion with adipose appearance and texture. After identification and preservation of recurrent laryngeal nerve, the lesion was completely excised.

He had been drinking approximately 4 liters of distilled spirits per week for a year. The patient lived alone, and consumed only various types of junk food instead of balanced meals or vegetables.\nPhysical examination revealed facial pallor and leg edema bilaterally. His body temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, pulse rate was 102 beats/min, blood pressure was 101/64 mm Hg, and respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min. Laboratory tests revealed that his hemoglobin level was 2.8 g/dL; he had macrocytic anemia with hemolysis and pancytopenia (Table ). A peripheral smear revealed that the anemia was megaloblastic. After admission, additional tests showed that his vitamin B12 level was within normal range but that his folic acid level was below the lower limit of normal. Other findings were otherwise normal. He was diagnosed as having folic acid deficiency anemia due to excessive alcohol consumption, and his hemoglobin level improved by administration of folic acid and cessation of alcohol.\nWe inquired why the patient never finished his vegetables during his meals. He responded that he had not felt the need to eat vegetables, although this did not mean that he disliked them. We discussed folic acid deficiency anemia due to excessive alcohol consumption with him, along with the cause of his symptoms, worsening fatigue, and admission. We also listened attentively to his narrative and expressed understanding toward his thoughts.

    "original_text": "Patient 1 was a 28-year-old Caucasian Irish woman in her first pregnancy. She presented to our Emergency Room (ER) in July 2012 with vaginal bleeding. Her last menstrual period (LMP) was 5 weeks and 3 days previously. An ultrasound scan showed an empty uterus and she was referred to our Early Pregnancy Unit for further assessment. A subsequent transvaginal ultrasound showed a left-sided adnexal mass with a background of serial serum beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) levels that were plateauing (94 to 108IU/L).\nShe initially refused any intervention and discharged herself against medical advice. She stated that she did not want any medical treatment and was advised fully of the risks of declining same, including death or severe maternal morbidity, by senior staff members. Our unit takes the issue of very ill patients self-discharging very seriously, given the obvious potential risks to their lives or well-being. On this occasion, we followed every protocol within the hospital, including having the most senior staff available to meet with her to advise her fully on the gravity of the situation. She was, however, found to be of sound mind and thus we could not force her to stay against her will. She left in the care of her partner and signed a form advising that she was taking her discharge against medical advice.

Treatment consisted of wound debridement, dressing changes and intravenous antibiotics until wound healing. She subsequently recovered from surgery with low grade back pain but increasing pain in her gluteal region and symphysis pubis region. Six months after her fusion an AP x-ray view of the pelvis was obtained revealing symphysis diastasis with significant rotation of the left hemipelvis (Fig. ).

The physical examination did not show any sign of external injury like abrasions, hematomas, etc. The neurological physical examination showed an oriented but aphasic patient with a preexisting high-grade right-sided hemiparesis (3/5). The aforementioned hemiparesis resulted from an earlier (around 1976) hemorrhage of an AVM on the left hemisphere with accompanied intraventricular bleeding.

Moreover, an exophthalmus of the left eye was revealed as well as a known strabismus divergens and a facial nerve paresis on the right side. Furthermore, signs of meningeal irritation in form of a stiff and painful neck were detected. A brain computed tomography (CT) imaging was conducted to investigate any intracranial pathology responsible for the headache symptoms as well as the hemiparesis. The results of the CT imaging were similar to those of 10 years ago, detecting no pathological findings. Thus, we proceeded with a cervical spine CT scan due to the accompanied cervical symptoms.

Because of persistent headaches, however, as well as nausea and vomiting, she underwent another CT scan less than a month later that showed a 6.2 \u00d7 3.5 cm right fronto-temporal mass with associated edema and a midline shift. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without intravenous gadolinium was then performed and demonstrated a 5.5 \u00d7 2.2 \u00d7 5.1 cm, apparently extra-axial mass, largely within the right Sylvian fissure (A). The interface of the brain was lobulated and irregular, raising the possibility of the invasion of the brain and subarachnoid space, but no definite intraparenchymal component was recognized. There was vasogenic edema in the subcortical white matter and a 5-mm midline shift towards the left side. Based on imaging, it was felt that the tumor was likely to be a hemangiopericytoma. Physical examination was notable for an intact neurological examination.\nThe patient underwent a right-sided craniotomy after a successful partial embolization of the tumor the day prior (B). A significant portion of the mass was visualized, deep to middle cerebral artery branches shown by intraoperative ultrasound to be coursing through the mass and providing blood supply to the temporal and frontal lobes. The attempted dissection of the tumor off the pial surface also led to devascularization of the underlying brain as the tumor had parasitized the pial vasculature. Therefore, further dissection following superficial excisional biopsy of the mass was not performed for safety reasons. A dural graft was placed. Because of significant brain swelling, the bone flap was not immediately replaced. The temporalis muscle was closed in apposition to the dural graft.

An exposed distal humeral shaft fracture at the level of the elbow with median and ulnar nerve transection was also identified.\nThe patient was treated in an emergency department with humeral fracture stabilization (Synthes locking compression plate; Synthes, West Chester, PA, USA) and revascularization of the left arm. In July 2006 he underwent surgery of the brachial plexus lesion, with nerve transfers of the distal spinal accessory to axillary nerve and the phrenic to musculocutaneous nerve. Unfortunately he did not show any sign of recovery of the motor function in the left upper limb, and in August 2008 a functional transfer of a gracilis free flap to brachial biceps and a wrist arthrodesis were performed. Over the last 6 years the patient has undergone surgery 3 times and has followed a rehabilitation program.\nFrom the outset, the patient has been treated by searching for symmetry in orthostatic posture. The Global Postural Rehabilitation technique has been used thus far in the course of rehabilitation. Three times per week the patient sustains passive mobilization of each upper limb joint to maintain articular suppleness and prevent stiffness. During the session, the physiotherapist also administers sensitive stimulation to maintain afferent channels.\nAt all times the patient wears splints to place the distal extremity in an intrinsic position for correct articular and muscle length. The whole upper limb is supported by a sling. Postural control, splinting, mobilization, and sensibility rehabilitation have all been included in the rehabilitation program.\nSince 2007 the patient has suffered from neuropathic pain (NP) involving the ulnar side of the forearm, the proximal third of the forearm, and the thumb in both radial (dorsal) and median (volar) regions.\nFrom the outset until December 2010, NP was successfully controlled with pregabalin, 600 mg/",

After the swelling subsided, he underwent right tibia fracture intramedullary internal fixation. Two weeks after the operation, the patient was able to walk with double crutches without load, and was able to walk without crutches and with some load 3 months after the operation. However, the patient complained of pain in his right lower extremity, especially when moving downhill or down stairs, and experienced a limping gait and obvious tenderness at the fracture end. Three years after originally presenting at Lhasa Hospital, the patient was experiencing persistent pain in the right lower extremity, and his daily activities were severely affected. Thus, he was re-diagnosed with nonunion of the right tibial fracture after internal fixation (Fig. ). The main causes of the nonunion of the fracture were considered to be the excessively thin intramedullary nails and unstable fixation of the fracture. The operation was repeated with replacement of the crude intramedullary nails and grafting of iliac bone (Fig. ). Three months after the operation, the tibial fracture had failed to heal, and further surgical treatment was performed. The proximal locking screw of the intramedullary nail was removed with an expectation to eliminate the stress shielding effect and to promote fracture healing by increasing the microdynamic force while retaining the static interlocking nail. Five months after the operation, the patient abandoned the crutches and was able to walk with a heavy load. Nevertheless, 2 years after the operation, active pain of the right leg persisted with some tenderness around the fracture, especially when moving downhill or down stairs. August 2018 the patient was admitted to our hospital.

She underwent electric ablation and placement of an ICD in her left shoulder. She had poor wound healing at a 5-month follow-up visit and she was admitted to the hospital on December 1, 2008 for management of a pocket infection. Exposure of the ICD generator and pacing lead were found on February 26, 2009, and the generator was removed, leaving the pacing lead in place. She had episodic pyrexia beginning in May 2009 and her blood cultures grew MRSA (isolate st01, positive in one of two sets blood cultures collected). ICD device-related endocarditis was highly suspected.

These episodes were never associated with fever but have had loss of appetite and infrequent vomiting. He had perianal discomfort both in the day and night. His mother had observed the passage of live worms with faeces on all these occasions, and she emphasized that it was more than 500 in number. During this period, no one else in the family had an illness similar to food poisoning, gastroenteritis, or worm infestation.\nHe was first seen by a general practitioner and treated for a common intestinal helminthiasis with mebendazole 100 mg twice daily for three days without obtaining laboratory evidence. After that, the child had been seen five times by general practitioners before the first author saw him. Stool investigations were done on two occasions and were reported as normal. It was not easy to get the treatment history due to retrograde exploration. The child had been treated with various anthelmintics and antibiotics. His mother could recall that he had been given both anthelmintics and antibiotics in a combination in few occasions. He had been treated with mebendazole 100 mg twice daily for three days in two occasions, albendazole 400 mg single dose in two occasions, and once treated by two tablets of pyrantel pamoate (250 mg). Whenever those episodes were predicted as food poisoning or infective gastroenteritis, the child had received either cephalexin or metronidazole along with zinc and probiotics for 3\u20135 days.

    "original_text": "A 23-year-old female was admitted to the emergency room because of abdominal pain with dyspnea. Last year, she presented a renal arterial embolism requiring a thrombectomy. The exploration of this renal infarction uncovered a dilated cardiomyopathy, initially presumed of viral origin, with heart failure requiring an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. When she was urgently readmitted, a computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed acute cholecystitis and an antibiotic therapy was begun. Given the cardiological history and the presence of dyspnea with elevated BNP, she was transferred to the cardiology ward. There, she presented a sudden right hemiparesis the next day with right hemianopsia and aphasia. Since implantable cardioverter defibrillators contraindicate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an emergency CT scan was performed and showed an acute left carotid T occlusion and a long-standing right internal carotid occlusion (Fig. ). The patient was transferred to the stroke unit for systemic thrombolysis and thrombectomy. Throughout the procedure, middle cerebral artery recanalization was obtained, but a clot was dislodged in the ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery during the procedure (Fig. ). After a short hospitalization in the intensive care unit for respiratory difficulties due to acute pulmonary edema, the patient was readdressed to the stroke unit where the neurological examination was normal.\nSupposing a cardioembolic origin of the stroke, due to dilated cardiomyopathy, a heparin treatment was started. The remainder of the exhaustive etiological assessment was not contributory. No biological thrombophilia was found.

    "cleaned_text": "a 23-year-old female was admitted to the emergency room because of abdominal pain with dyspnea. last year, she presented a renal arterial embolism requiring a thrombectomy. the exploration of this renal infarction uncovered a dilated cardiomyopathy, initially presumed of viral origin, with heart failure requiring an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. when she was urgently readmitted, a computerized tomography (ct) scan revealed acute cholecystitis and an antibiotic therapy was begun. given the cardiological history and the presence of dyspnea with elevated bnp, she was transferred to the cardiology ward. there, she presented a sudden right hemiparesis the next day with right hemianopsia and aphasia. since implantable cardioverter defibrillators contraindicate magnetic resonance imaging (mri), an emergency ct scan was performed and showed an acute left carotid t occlusion and a long-standing right internal carotid occlusion (fig. ). the patient was transferred to the stroke unit for systemic thrombolysis and thrombectomy. throughout the procedure, middle cerebral artery recanalization was obtained, but a clot was dislodged in the ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery during the procedure (fig. ). after a short hospitalization in the intensive care unit for respiratory difficulties due to acute pulmonary edema, the patient was readdressed to the stroke unit where the neurological examination was normal.\nsupposing a cardioembolic origin of the stroke, due to dilated cardiomyopathy, a heparin treatment was started. the remainder of the exhaustive etiological assessment was not contributory. no biological thrombophilia was found. despite an effective anticoagulation (unfractionated heparin with anti-xa activity in the target), the patient presented an embolic complication in the form of acute ischemia of the left lower limb which was successfully treated surgically. in addition, several episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia requiring two internal electric shocks by the implantable defibrillator were recorded.\nan echocardiographic evaluation showed a dilated left ventricular heart disease, high ventricular pressures with ejection fraction of 22%, an overall severe hypokinesia, and the presence of left ventricular crypts with a typical aspect of \"",

An informed consent was obtained from the patient for taking a detailed case history and treatment planning.\nThe patient had been a smoker (4\u20135 cigarettes per day) for the past 20 years. He was also using alcohol frequently. He was hypertensive and was under medication (nifedipine) for the past 5 years. He was also under the care of the Nephrology unit of a local hospital for interstitial nephritis for the past 5 years.\nHis dental history recorded periodic oral prophylaxis visits. He stated that he had noticed a small swelling on the gums on the inner surface of the lower anterior teeth for 3 months. He visited a local dentist who prescribed an antibiotic ointment (Metronidazole gel) for topical application. However, the swelling continued to increase in size and so he decided to consult a specialist and reported to our clinic. The patient did not have any pain which was the reason for the delay in asking for a second opinion about the swelling.\nPeriodontal evaluation showed that he had chronic generalized periodontitis. The lingual gingiva of mandibular anterior teeth revealed an exophytic growth of size 4 cm \u00d7 3 cm, firm in consistency and sessile. The surface of the lesion was irregular, with areas of ulceration []. Deep periodontal pockets of 6\u20138 mm [lingual aspect] and mobility of mandibular anterior teeth [incisors] were recorded.

In fact, he had suffered from fatigue after activity for more than 10 days and felt chest tightness and chest pain for 4 days before admission. The patient, a taekwondo trainee, had a healthy body, and his family history was unremarkable. Emergency aortic computed tomographic (CT) scan showed a thickened aortic wall, bilateral pleural effusion and pericardial effusion (Figs. a and b). Cardiac colour ultrasound suggested aortic hematoma or dissection (Fig. ). On the basis of the condition and the results of auxiliary examination, the formation of aortic dissection should be considered. The next day, after excluding surgical contraindications, the patient was performed an emergency operation. Cardiac surgeons underwent ascending aortic replacement and aortic arch replacement. They developed postoperative comprehensive treatment measures, including anti-infection, adjustment of cardiac function, nutritional nerve and symptomatic supportive treatment, and the patient recovered well and was discharged after 15 days. The cause of aortic dissection was unclear, although the surgeons extracted arterial tissues and pericardial tissues and sent them for pathological examination. In fact, postoperative pathology of the aortic wall tissue showed aortitis, such as visible necrosis, granulation tissue hyperplasia and a large number of acute and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration (Figs. b, c and d). However, the surgeons and the pathologist at the time did not consider the cause of aortitis or aortic dissection due to GPA because of a lack of understanding of GPA-induced aortitis or aortic dissection. This event is one of the starting points of our study. We want to attract the attention of clinicians.

Six months later her case was presented at the medical multi-disciplinary team meeting for planning of further surgical procedures.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of her chest revealed the progression of her disease via multiple lung metastases in March 2017. The patient had a history of deep vein thrombosis three months earlier (right calf) and received rivaroxaban with good clinical and ultrasound outcome. She was admitted to our hospital for TIVAP insertion and polychemotherapy initiation.\nSurgery was performed under local anesthesia (April 2017). Initially, the right subclavian blind cannulation by the surgeon was ineffective. An experienced anesthesiologist was invited into the operating room, but multiple ultrasound-guided cannulation attempts failed bilaterally. The patient was transferred to the radiology department, and a chest CT scan revealed subclavian vein hypoplasia (vessel diameter was up to 4 mm). We decided to use right common femoral venous entry and discussed the situation with the patient. The patient provided additional informed consent to proceed. A catheter was inserted via femoral access without complications. In the operating room, the venous catheter was replaced by tubing from the port system kit.\nCatheter tip positioning was performed using transabdominal ultrasound guidance (with a convex probe). The capsule was implanted subcutaneously on the front lateral side of the right hip. Postoperatively, a whole-body CT scan allowed us to assess the TIVAP position and identify possible complications. Technical success was confirmed, and the patient was discharged from the surgery department.

During a recent follow-up exam at 18 years of age, he was noted to have mild upper extremity hypertension, good femoral pulses, and a mild discrepancy in his blood pressures and pulses with right arm greater than the left. He was placed on enalapril for his hypertension. Cardiac catheterization showed findings consistent with previous repair of his TGA, dilated aortic root with aortic incompetence, and no residual coarctation. A year later, he developed gradual onset of dizziness that was exacerbated by the use of his left arm. The patient also developed headaches, blurring of vision, confusion, and an acute syncopal episode while walking to school, which prompted admission and work-up. On examination, a grade 2-3/6 diastolic murmur was noted. His blood pressure in the right arm (127/72) was higher than the left (113/69) and the right arm pulse was stronger than left arm. Neurologic exam at baseline was unremarkable. The patient reported that his dizziness improved when the left brachial artery was compressed.\nBrain MRI with angiography showed no acute changes. Chest CT angiogram [] demonstrated the patient's anatomy status post subclavian flap, with the proximal left subclavian artery dissected away from the aorta and the left vertebral arising distally from the subclavian. shows the patient's carotid artery Doppler ultrasound, which demonstrates retrograde flow in the left vertebral artery consistent with left subclavian steal and continued retrograde flow in the left vertebral artery with left arm exercise. The patient underwent a hyperemia test with no significant change in his systolic blood pressure (SBP) in right arm (119 mmHg to 118 mmHg). However, his SBP dropped from 107 mm Hg to 102 mmHg in the left arm. shows the patient's aortic angiogram demonstrating prograde flow across the right common carotid, right subclavian, right vertebral artery,",

At the age of 22, the patient had sustained C5\u20136 complex fracture/dislocation and complete cervical spinal cord injury at the C7 level due to a motor vehicle accident. No intracranial injury had been recorded. A halo traction was applied on the first day of his hospitalization as a temporary fixation, but definitive treatment was delayed due to severe respiratory distress, which required mechanical ventilation. He underwent anterior C5\u20136 corpectomy and fusion with iliac crest bone autograft without instrumentation 23 days after the admission. No bone morphologic protein was used. During the initial hospital stay, he underwent tracheostomy because of prolonged respiratory distress due to associated injuries. The tracheostomy site was complicated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, which was treated with antibiotics and repeated debridement. Since the time of injury, total non-oral nutrition had been continued for over 3 months, because of frequent aspiration and pain during swallowing due to inflammation of the tracheostomy site. No barium swallowing test was performed during the initial hospitalization. After swallowing rehabilitation, the patient could swallow liquid and solid food without aspiration. However, 12 years later, his dysphagia relapsed and gradually progressed. At the time of his 17-year visit, the patient aspirated frequently when he swallowed liquids or solids, to the extent that self-suctioning from the previous tracheostomy site was frequently required.\nComputed tomography (CT) scans of the cervical spine revealed almost complete resorption of the bone graft and a posterior shifted esophagus. The injured spinal columns were fused via the posterior and remaining anterior parts of the vertebrae. A bony bridge of heterotopic ossification was observed between the right posterior part of the cricoid cartilage and the right anterior tubercle of the C5 vertebra (Fig. ).
