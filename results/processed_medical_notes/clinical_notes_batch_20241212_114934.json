The patient was in favorable prognostic categories according to Motzer et al. The patient had no family history of malignant neoplasm and no history of chronic diseases. Due to metastatic disease (metastases in lungs), interferon immunotherapy was used as a first line therapy. The best response to treatment was partial regression according to RECIST criteria (version 1.0). After 11 months immunotherapy was stopped due to the disease progression \u2013 enlargement of existing lesions. In April 2010 the patient was qualified to 2nd line therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (sorafenib). The patient received a total of 8 chemotherapy courses. The response to treatment was stable disease according to RECIST criteria. In December 2010, due to the disease progression \u2013 appearance of new focal lesions in the liver, the patient was qualified to 3rd line therapy using a selective mTOR inhibitor (everolimus). Marked toxicity was observed during the therapy \u2013 anemia grade 3 according to CTC AE that required transfusion of packed red blood cells. The treatment was stopped after 13 courses in January 2012 due to the disease progression \u2013 appearance of new lesions in lungs, left adrenal gland and the skeletal system. The patient underwent palliative radiotherapy on the tumor site, 11th rib in January 2012, and then in June 2012 on central nervous system (CNS) area due to focal lesions located in the right parietal and temporal lobes and in the right cerebellar hemisphere. In May 2012 the patient started a 4th line therapy, axitinib at a dose of 5 mg twice daily. Partial response to treatment was achieved. The treatment was stopped in November 2012 due to the disease progression. The total time to progression was 37.5 months (). The patient died in December 2012.

She had the operations of total arch replacement 8 years ago and a Bentall 7 years ago for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection. Although dissections still remained on the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta from the previous two operations, the diameter of the aorta remained stable without its enlargement. Therefore, she underwent conservative treatments.\nHer initial abdominal pain with ischemic colitis occurred 1 year ago, and colonoscopy was performed. By the diagnosis of the colonoscopy, we found a white coating in the vicinity of the Bauhin valve and localized distorted ulcers in the ascending colon. However, mucosal necrosis was not found (Fig. ). Since her symptoms were slight and temporary, she remained on conservative treatments at that time. Her abdominal pain became worse; melena occurred often during the course of her conservative treatments, and these symptoms occurred when blood pressure became low under hemodialysis. Then, she was referred to our hospital for further evaluation of her recurrent ischemic colitis. Computed tomography (CT) scans showed chronic B-AD, which extended from the distal anastomotic part of the total arch graft to both common iliac arteries. The distal re-entry size was 26 mm. The expanded false lumen compressed the true lumen of most of the aorta, including the origin of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) (Fig. ).\nBased on these clinical findings, we considered that this recurrent ischemic colitis was a result of diminished blood flow to the SMA due to the compressed true lumen combined with hypotension due to hemodialysis. We then determined that therapeutic enlargement of the true lumen would improve blood flow to the SMA and reduce the risk of ischemic colitis.

Various soft tissue nodules had been present for multiple years; however, during the last few weeks prior to the initial evaluation, she developed an alarming increased number of widespread soft-tissue masses with significant tenderness in comparison. Her daily activities are often interrupted due to the menacing symptoms, causing significant attrition to her quality of life. Multiple attempts of over-the-counter trials of pain medications have failed to provide the patent with any relief and prescription pain medications are but a bandage for her illness. The patient has a significant past medical history including obesity (BMI 35), chronic atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, hypertension, and sick sinus syndrome status post atrial pacemaker placement.\nDuring the initial presentation, ultrasound examination revealed hyperechoic foci in the subcutaneous tissues that were circumscribed without any Doppler flow, consistent with lipomas. The patient then underwent excision of multiple back nodules to further characterize the lesions, revealing a gross pathology report of adipose tissue with nodularity. An interesting point to note is that the rate at which new palpable nodules developed was intriguing. She developed four new identifiable lesions in various parts of the body in the short interval between her office visit and the date of the operation. Histopathology reports one of four specimens demonstrating portions of mature adipose tissue consistent with lipoma, and three of four specimens with mature adipocytes and branching network of small vessels consistent with angiolipoma.\nShe was seen in the postoperative period with a continued manifestation of these subcutaneous nodules throughout her body. The pain along the sites of excised lesions had improved but she continues to have significant tenderness along the areas of new masses.

The mass was painless and gradually increasing in size. The family members of this patient brought her to a traditional healer. They did not seek any medical treatment until late 2017. By this time, the mass over the sacrum was extremely large. Family members claimed the mass was preventing the patient from lying down flat supine. The patient was also unable to ambulate for the past 2 years. Hence, she was bedbound most of the time. It was difficult for her to sit on the wheelchair. She also felt tired to move because the mass was quite heavy. The family members claimed when the patient was lying down flat, she had to flex her hips and knees to achieve a more comfortable position. In addition, she often slept either in prone position or in supine with multiple pillows below her body. The mother also claimed over the last 2 months, the patient\u2019s body had been getting thinner despite her physical weight was increasing due to the increase in size of the sacral mass. The patient had been passing stool and urine in pampers. There was no past medical history and no family history of cancer. Socially, the patient lived with her mother and siblings.

During elicitation of detailed history from the patient, it was revealed that patient was tobacco chewer since last 20 years and had leukoplakia patch on the right buccal mucosa. An incisional biopsy was advised for the leukoplakia at a private dental hospital.

She had a history of a prior cesarean delivery for arrest of active labor at 7 cm and after extensive counseling chose to undergo a TOLAC. The initial cervical exam was 2 cm dilation and 50% effacement. Her labor was induced with oxytocin and amniotomy was performed at 5 cm dilation with clear fluid noted. She progressed from 2 cm to 5 cm over the course of 10 hours; interval time to progression to 6 cm was 3.5 hours. The patient then began to have a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding with associated minimal fetal heart rate variability and variable decelerations that did not improve with intrauterine resuscitation. She was taken to the operating room for repeat cesarean delivery due to concern for a uterine rupture and/or a placental abruption. Upon entry into the abdomen, there was no uterine rupture or dehiscence, nor was there evidence of a significant placental abruption.

As it was not possible to remove the mandibular foreign body from the root canal at the referral dentist, she was admitted to get it removed using a surgical approach. During the intraoral clinical examination, there was an access cavity filled with a temporary filling material and the tooth was sensitive to pressure. There was tenderness in the apical portion of the tooth. A panoramic radiograph obtained at the initial visit after the patient referral revealed a well-defined fractured instrument lying in the mandible beyond the apical foramen of her right mandibular premolar tooth. Moreover, computed tomography (CT) images revealed that the fractured segment was located within the mandibular bone (Fig. ). A diagnosis of migration of a broken endodontic instrument beyond the apical foramen into the mandible was made, and surgery was considered necessary to eliminate the symptoms. The decision was made to proceed with the surgery because of increasing pain.\nSurgical intervention was required to find the apical root cutting-edge lesion and the broken dental instrument through a small bony window and to remove it from the oral cavity by pushing up in order to reliably preserve the tooth for restorative treatment. Therefore, we decided to use three-dimensional navigation-guided surgery for its minimally invasive nature and high surgical accuracy.

She had no abdominal pains and her weight was maintained. The patient had been born with bladder exstrophy and had multiple surgeries culminating in a cystectomy with ileal conduit formation at 5 years of age. She had suffered with recurrent urinary tract infections for most of her childhood and adult life but was otherwise well with no other major co-morbidities or risk factors for colorectal malignancy and had no family history of colorectal disease.\nColonoscopy revealed two large sessile polyps in the sigmoid colon in close proximity to each other and adjacent to a diverticulum-like structure (Fig. ). Each polyp was approximately 3 cm in size and both exhibited a type IV pit pattern with areas of irregularity suggestive of focally advanced disease. Histological examination confirmed both polyps were adenomas comprising both low and high grade dysplasia, without submucosal invasion (Fig. ). On closer inspection the mucosa around the diverticulum was also atypical but not adenomatous. The remainder of the colonoscopy was unremarkable with no other evidence of diverticular disease or polyps elsewhere.\nEndoscopic resection was considered as a therapeutic option however in view of the above characteristics as well as difficult endoscopic access surgery was preferred. Furthermore, radiological imaging had initially raised the possibility of invasive disease in view of sigmoid thickening. The patient underwent high anterior resection and an open approach was chosen because of suspected intra-abdominal adhesions following extensive pelvic surgery. An end colostomy was formed at the patient\u2019s pre-operative request. At laparotomy the right fallopian tube was adherent to the sigmoid colon and adjacent to this a blind ending tube was noted to emerge from the anti-mesenteric border of the colon.

At 7 and at 14 years of age surgical resection of the membrane was performed. As a young adult, she developed recurrent severe subvalvular stenosis which became symptomatic. When she was 21 years old, the membrane was radically resected through a Morrow procedure and the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract was widened with a Konno procedure. After this operation she was symptom-free and needed no medication. Her echocardiogram demonstrated septal akinesia with an LV diastolic diameter of 57 mm at the basal level but a normal midventricular diameter of 52 mm. LV ejection fraction was 50%. The aortic valve was abnormal with grade I regurgitation and valvular aortic stenosis with peak and mean gradients of 27 and 15 mmHg. It was concluded that she had a slightly elevated risk of heart failure and arrhythmias during pregnancy because of her mild aortic valve dysfunction and local wall motion abnormality of the LV. She was graded as pregnancy risk WHO class II [\u2013] (low-moderate risk). She became pregnant in 2007 and was followed in the cardiac service at 20, 26 and 34 weeks. Her LV diameters and ejection fraction as well as the aortic stenosis and regurgitation were stable. She developed dyspnoea on exertion during the second trimester without signs of heart failure, which was attributed to the pregnancy in combination with moderate overweight. During the last weeks of pregnancy she started to gain weight, a total of 8 kg in 2 weeks time, and she felt more dyspnoeic. The patient, a medical doctor herself, suggested that she had fluid retention due to heart failure, but the junior gynaecologist assured her that this weight gain was normal and the cardiologist was not consulted.

Two months after delivery she was admitted because of bradycardia due to 2nd degree AV block and a DDDR pacemaker was inserted.",

The woman had no significant medical records and no family history of breast cancer. Her menstrual cycles were regular and she had three children. The initial physical examination revealed a well circumscribed elastic mass measuring about 30 mm not adherent to the underlying tissues or to the skin and no skin or nipple retraction was visible. Besides, the clinical examination did not reveal ipsilateral, axillary, or supraclavicular palpable lymph nodes. Nipple discharge was not evident. Contralateral breast and axilla were normal. The left breast ultrasound showed a cyst measuring 26 mm with irregular and hypoechogenic vegetation growing on the inner wall. A mammographic exam was not performed mostly due to the cystic appearance of the mass. Besides that there are no characteristic findings on mammography specific for this kind of tumours. The patient was submitted to fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the cyst and of the inner vegetation (). The fluid obtained was yellowish and translucent and the size of the mass got reduced after the procedure. The smears were stained with Papanicolaou and May-Gr\u00fcnwald Giemsa stains. Microscopic evaluation revealed some foam cells and epithelial cells without atypia suggesting a benign cystic lesion. The biopsy was not performed since it was a cystic lesion, and, besides the inner vegetation, the whole ultrasonographic features and the FNAC results suggested a benign condition. One month later the breast ultrasound exam showed the persistence of the cyst, with increased volume, measuring about 44 mm maintaining the inner vegetation of 6 \u00d7 27 mm, which was irregular in shape and had continuity with the cyst wall (). A surgery was performed because of the cyst rapid growth and ultrasound characteristics.

These complaints evolved into a more worrisome pulmonary disease characterized by cough and progressive respiratory distress 2 days prior to the hospitalization. Chest CT scan on admission to an outside hospital showed diffuse bilateral alveolar and interstitial lung infiltrates. A diagnosis of atypical pneumonia and possible myocarditis was made and the patient was given antibiotic treatment and was discharged two weeks later. However, dyspnea persisted and he was admitted to our hospital for further workup. On admission, patient was found to have fever, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and irregular heartbeats with bouts of ventricular fibrillation. Upon hospitalization, additional diagnoses were made including acute renal failure, as well as possible liver disease marked by an elevation of liver function tests. A poorly defined pancreatic mass was noted on the CT scan. Head CT without contrast was performed which showed minimal mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus. There was opacification of several left ethmoid air cells with fluid levels in the left sphenoid and left maxillary sinuses. A nasoenteric tube was in place in nasal cavity. There was no mass lesion, erosion, or bone destruction. These finding were most consistent with mild inflammatory changes ().\nSepsis was suspected and he was given antibiotics without improvement of his clinical condition. His condition rapidly deteriorated with progressive dyspnea and pulmonary infiltrates which by X-ray examination involved all five lobes (). Extensive microbiological studies were performed with no positive bacteriologic, viral, or fungal isolates. The only positive test was a mildly increased DNA load of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in blood with 0.5 copies per microliter detected by a quantitative PCR assay.

A CT chest and upper abdomen demonstrated consolidation of the right lung base and he was treated for his pneumonia and atrial fibrillation. Shortly after admission he developed abdominal pain, diarrhoea and a low-grade pyrexia. His CT scan was reviewed and it was noted that there was a small amount of intra-abdominal fluid with several retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The right kidney had an atypical area of calcification within its upper pole and he was subsequently referred to the urologists for further evaluation (). As his condition failed to improve he underwent a further CT scan that demonstrated a large right psoas abscess (). This was drained under CT guidance and he was eventually discharged with a urology outpatient follow up as it was thought his renal problem was the cause of the abscess. Upon review the patient was symptomatically better, a diagnosis of an old calcified cyst in the right kidney was made and he was discharged to his GP.\nEight months later, after a permanent pacemaker had been fitted, an interval USS showed no residual psoas abscess. However, one month subsequently he was admitted under the general surgeons with a 3-week history of mild back pain, diarrhoea and rigors. He also had a discharging abscess in his right lumbar region which contained gas bubbles. A CT scan revealed sigmoid diverticulosis () with a recurrence of the extensive right-sided retroperitoneal abscess and a tract connecting it to the sigmoid colon ().\nAs an interim measure whilst being optimised for surgery, the abscess was drained with a 14F pigtail drain. At laparotomy the sigmoid colon was found frozen in the pelvis with perforated sigmoid diverticulosis noted to be the cause of the right sided retroperitoneal abscess.

    "original_text": "A 19-year-old male patient with trauma was admitted to our hospital when he was in a shock state due to a motor vehicle accident. The patient had been resuscitated initially by infusion of crystalloids at the emergency department and intra-abdominal complications had been ruled out by physical exam and ultrasound studies.\nAt the beginning of emergent operation due to bilateral epidural hematoma, the patient was tachycardic with acceptable blood pressure (110/65 mmHg). Premedication with 2 Mcg/Kg of fentanyl was implemented. Induction of anesthesia was carried out by sevoflurane via an endotracheal tube previously fixed at the emergency department and appropriate dose of cisatracurium was used for muscle relaxation.\nAfter an hour of cranial decompressive surgery, both large intravenous lines became malfunctioning. For this reason, preparation of another large bore peripheral intravenous line was planned yet multiple trials of our expert colleagues failed and the medical team was forced to plan for establishment of a centrally inserted intravenous catheter. Surgical conditions and patient dressing forced the selection of the right femoral vein for this purpose.

    "original_text": "A 50-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic cocaine abuse was found unresponsive in the field. He was given multiple doses of naloxone in the field without any improvement in mental status. On presentation in the emergency department (ED), the patient was found unresponsive to questions and unable to follow commands but withdrawing to painful stimuli, with a Glasgow Coma Score of 8, and tachypneic. Vital signs were significant for a respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 90% on 6 liters nasal cannula. Physical exam appreciated no tracheal deviation and no jugular venous distention but exhibited an uneven rise and fall of his chest on the right side compared to the left. On cardiopulmonary auscultation, absent breath sounds of the right lung fields were noted with normal cardiac heart sounds. The patient was emergently intubated for airway protection in the ED, and further evaluation was initiated. Immediate imaging with portable chest X-ray was obtained which showed extensive lucency in the right hemithorax suggestive of large pneumothorax or an air-filled cyst (). A CT scan of the chest was performed which suggested extensive pneumothorax of the right lung without a mediastinal shift ().\nFor this reason, an emergent 24 French chest tube was placed in the right 6th intercostal space but failed to expand the lung.

    "original_text": "A 28-year-old primigravida was referred to our hospital at 31 + 2 weeks of gestation for further evaluation as a result of abnormal findings on a fetal echocardiography. At 29 weeks of gestation, blindly ended vessels originating from the heart or transposition of the great arteries was first noticed. However, no comments were made regarding any abnormal findings of the fetal lung on a fetal ultrasonography. In addition, the medical and obstetric histories were unremarkable.\nAn ultrasound examination performed on the day of the first visit at our institute demonstrated an elevated diaphragm, raising the suspicion of associated lung abnormalities (). The thoracic cavities, especially on the right, were reduced in size. The left thoracic cavity was largely occupied by the heart with a severely left-deviated axis, resulting from the remarkable displacement of the diaphragm cephalad. However, it was not evident whether any lung tissue was present, or whether there were any lung abnormalities or pulmonary veins connecting to the left atrium as well as the right and left branches of the main pulmonary artery. As a result, no specific structural abnormalities of the heart were identified.\nFor further evaluation of the lung abnormalities, a fetal MRI study was performed. Similar to the results of the ultrasound examinations, a significantly decreased thoracic volume associated with a bilateral elevation of the diaphragm was identified, thus resulting in an upward migration of the heart and rotation of the cardiac axis. Moreover, no definite lung was identified and the trachea ended blindly near the level of the cricoid cartilage without bronchial branching ().

    "original_text": "A 40 year old man presented with a painful mass at the medial side of his arm. On clinical examination there was a painless solid mass 6\u20137 cm in length, little sensitive to pressure, firmly attached to deeper tissues. Percussion over the mass produced a Tinel\u2019s like sensation along the median nerve. The patient experienced mild numbness in the distribution of the median nerve in the palm but no motor weakness or muscle atrophy was detected. No cutaneous pigmented lesions were found. The patient reported he first palpated a nodule 10 years ago that grew up very slowly to the current size. No history of significant trauma was recalled.\nAn MRI examination revealed a 6 cm long, well circumscribed mass in close proximity to the neurovascular bundle of the arm. The lesion had a relatively homogenous low signal, slightly lower to the muscle, on T1 images. On T1 fat suppressed images, increased gadolinium enhancement was noticed at the periphery of the mass with a nonenhancing low signal central area (Fig. a). No peri-tumoral edema was present and a line of fat surrounded the tumor. Based on the long history of the patient, and the clinical and MRI features, the diagnosis of a nerve sheath tumor arising from the median nerve was supported and the patient was scheduled for excisional biopsy. A longitudinal incision centered over the tumor bulk was performed. The tumor had an eccentric position and was firmly attached to the median nerve, (Fig. b). An incisional biopsy was performed and tissue sample was taken from the proximal pole of the mass (where more viable tissue was seen on MRI). The sample was considered to be representative of the entire pathology macroscopically and was sent for frozen section. Intra-operative biopsy examination revealed nuclear atypia.

Significant past history included multiple episodes of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Coronary angiography demonstrated a single coronary artery arising from left coronary sinus (fig ) which divided into a normal sized left anterior descending artery (LAD) and a circumflex (Cx) artery. LAD had a 99% stenotic lesion beyond the first septal and was a good sized vessel going just beyond the left ventricular apex (Fig ). From its proximal segment, beyond the origin of first diagonal and prior to the origin of first septal artery, arose 3 right ventricular branches, the largest of which crossed the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), 2 centimetres below the pulmonary valve, to gain the anterior right atrioventricular groove (Fig , ), descended in the groove to anastomose with the distal right coronary artery (Fig ), which arose as a continuity of the circumflex artery (Fig ), as described below. The second right ventricular branch crossed the RVOT below the first but petered out well before it could gain the anterior right AV groove. The third branch supplied the right ventricle and followed a course close to the LAD (fig ). The diagonal artery was a large bifurcating artery with significant proximal stenosis. The circumflex artery had severe stenosis proximally after which it gave a large obtuse marginal branch and then the PDA in the posterior interventricular groove and thereafter continued in the AV groove as the right coronary artery (Fig ). This right coronary artery then gave off a ventricular branch to the inferior surface of the right ventricle and thereafter anastomosed with the proximal RCA arising anomalously from the LAD as described above (Fig ).

She had a history of minor trauma involving bruising of the finger in a door and was referred to a neighboring clinic 14 months before the visit to our hospital. Plain radiographs taken at the previous clinic had shown no sign of fracture, but instead revealed an abnormal calcifying lesion of the soft tissue of the left fifth finger. She had visited several clinics and hospitals and had been treated with analgesics and splinting for more than 2 months, but the pain in the finger had gradually worsened. Thus, she was referred to our hospital for definitive diagnosis and treatment.\nPhysical examination revealed tenderness around the PIP joint of the fifth finger with an apparent subcutaneous tumor, measuring around 1 cm in diameter (Figs. A and B). She experienced pain around the PIP joint of the fifth finger when the fist was tightly clenched and/or when the lesion contacted another object. There were no signs of infection or neurovascular disturbances, and no history of previous infection. The range of motion of the affected PIP joint was slightly more restricted than that of the contralateral side, but there was no functional impairment of the finger. Blood chemistry analysis showed no signs of inflammation or other abnormalities.\nPlain radiographs of the fifth finger taken 5 months before the initial visit to our hospital revealed a well-defined calcified soft tissue mass overlying the ulnar side of the proximal and middle phalanges that was well separated from the adjacent bone, with no periosteal reaction (Figs.

On the basis of history and previous records, it was known that the patient had sustained an open grade IIIA fracture of shaft femur and a closed ipsilateral femoral neck fracture of the left side following road traffic eight months prior to the above presentation. The femoral shaft fracture was managed with an external fixator application, and the femoral neck fracture management was delayed due to unhealthy soft tissue conditions around the proximal lateral aspect of the thigh. The treatment of both fractures was further delayed because the patient developed an infection of the open wound of the femoral shaft fracture. To add to the complications, he had developed pin site infection as well. Following that, open debridement of the femoral shaft wound site was performed, and the external fixator was removed at the primary treating institution. Thereafter, the limb was kept splinted on a Thomas splint. Subsequently, the wound and pin sites were healed and the patient was referred to our center, which is a tertiary care center and teaching medical institute, after a total duration of eight months following injury. Clinicoradiological examination confirmed the non-union of the left femoral shaft fracture and ipsilateral femoral neck fracture (Figure ). Blood investigations revealed raised serum inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)=25 mm/hr and C-reactive protein (CRP)=12 g/L).

Under general anesthesia, the nasal morphology was improved using cartilage of the nasal septum, and the lip deformity was improved by forming a tubercle of the upper lip using a lip switch flap with left inferior labial arterial and venous pedicles, the philtrum and bridge of the nose. The lower lip flap was designed to have a \u223c10-mm width and a \u223c17-mm length and transplanted to the upper lip. Its color immediately after surgery was favorable (), but marked swelling of the flap and surrounding tissue was noted 6 h after surgery, with which the flap developed venous congestion (). To release pressure due to the swelling on the vascular pedicle, sutures around the pedicle were removed, but blood circulation of the flap did not improve and congestion aggravated. Since flap necrosis was predicted, the flap that had been transplanted to the upper lip was returned to the lower lip 8 h after surgery to improve its blood circulation and prevent necrosis. Under venous sedation, the flap transplanted to the upper lip was released to a free state so that the mouth could be opened, oropharyngeal intubation was applied and sedation was switched to general anesthesia. Hematoma around the flap was removed by washing well with saline. After confirming blood flow from the flap stump, the flap was returned to the lower lip and fixed by sutures, and the transplantation site was simply sutured ().\nAfter surgery, the flap was covered with heparinized saline-soaked gauze to further reduce congestion. Congestion was improved 7 h after surgery (), and the flap returned to the donor site had almost completely recovered 1 week after surgery ().

A threatened premature labor was diagnosed. Ultrasound showed a female fetus with normal development and amniotic fluid volume. Small bowel appeared mildly dilated (14 mm) with thickened and hyperechogenic intestinal wall. There was a typical whirlpool configuration of the bowel (). First and second trimester ultrasounds were unremarkable. Screening for infectious diseases was negative. A molecular genetic testing of CFTR was realized in the parents who were tested for the 32 main mutations of CFTR during a genetic counseling. This testing was negative in both of the parents. So, the fetus was not screened for cystic fibrosis. The patient received atosiban for tocolysis and steroids for fetal lung maturation. Ultrasound follow-up one week later and every two weeks showed absence of significant modification in small bowel dilatation and normal fetal development and amniotic fluid volume up to 33 weeks and 1 day of gestation when a peritoneal calcification appeared leading to the suspicion of meconium peritonitis. Fetal biometry measures including the abdominal circumference and amniotic fluid volume were normal throughout the follow-up in antepartum period. Ultrasound follow-up at 36 weeks and 4 days of gestation revealed a significant aggravation of intestinal dilatation (30 mm) appearing more extensively with persistent intestinal peristalsis, and some parietal calcifications appeared with a meconium pseudocyst but there were no ascites (). Fetal vitality was good with a satisfying Manning's score; there were neither ascites nor significant increasing in abdominal circumference nor abnormality in fetal heart rate and the amniotic fluid volume was normal. So, the patient was hospitalized for close monitoring of fetal heart rate.

Her systolic blood pressure exceeded 200 mmHg in the office, and aggressive medical therapy was initiated in the outpatient setting. She returned to the emergency department the following day with headache and malaise and systolic blood pressure above 200 mmHg for which she was treated and discharged.\nShe returned to the emergency department again 5 days later, this time with complaints of word finding difficulty, blurred vision, and lower extremity tingling. Her blood pressure on presentation was 216/81 mmHg. She was admitted, and workup demonstrated no acute intracranial process or carotid stenosis. Echocardiography revealed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with a preserved ejection fraction. Her blood pressure continued to be refractory to medical therapy despite five antihypertensive agents and eventual initiation of an esmolol infusion. A renal artery ultrasound identified renal artery stenosis with flow at the arterial origin measuring 350 cm/s on the right and 208 cm/s on the left (); flow velocity in the supraceliac aorta was also noted to be elevated. She had no history of kidney disease and no elevation of her creatinine. Vascular surgery was consulted and a history of lower extremity claudication was elicited. On exam she had weak but palpable femoral pulses and an audible abdominal aortic bruit; ankle-brachial index measurements were deferred and the patient was scheduled for angiogram.\nThe patient underwent aortography the following day and on selective angiography the renal arteries were found to be widely patent. Significant stenosis was identified at the distal thoracic aorta extending into the abdominal aorta but terminating proximal to the celiac trunk.

    "original_text": "A 72-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of an abnormal pulmonary shadow found on a routine chest X-ray. Chest X-rays revealed a mass shadow in the left middle lung field and a positive silhouette sign for the left second arch (Fig. ). The aortic arch aneurysm was saccular aneurysm associated with a greater risk of rupture, and connected to the pulmonary mass in the left upper lobe with a possible risk of tumor adhesion or invasion to the aneurysm (Fig. ). Three-dimensional CT revealed that the aortic aneurysm was located in front of the arch near the left subclavian artery, and the brachiocephalic and left common carotid arteries branched from the aorta with a common duct (Fig. ). These findings led to the diagnosis of aortic arch aneurysm and lung carcinoma. There were no distant metastases of the lung carcinoma (clinical stage T2bN0M0 stage IIA). We decided to perform left upper lobectomy and patch angioplasty if the arch of aorta between the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery could be temporarily occluded. If not, we planned to perform aortic arch replacement under selective cerebral perfusion with systemic extracorporeal circulation through the groin.\nA fourth intercostal thoracotomy was performed. As the lung carcinoma adhered to the aortic arch aneurysm but did not invade it, we could detach the visceral pleura of the left upper lobe from the aortic arch aneurysm. We performed left upper lobectomy. After that, we confirmed that the aneurysm was proximal to the left subclavian artery. Because of the position of the TAA, it was difficult to perform patch angioplasty. We decided to perform aortic arch replacement for the aortic arch aneurysm with a 3-branched artificial vessel under selective cerebral perfusion with systemic extracorporeal circulation.

    "cleaned_text": "a 72-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of an abnormal pulmonary shadow found on a routine chest x-ray. chest x-rays revealed a mass shadow in the left middle lung field and a positive silhouette sign for the left second arch (fig. ). the aortic arch aneurysm was saccular aneurysm associated with a greater risk of rupture, and connected to the pulmonary mass in the left upper lobe with a possible risk of tumor adhesion or invasion to the aneurysm (fig. ). three-dimensional ct revealed that the aortic aneurysm was located in front of the arch near the left subclavian artery, and the brachiocephalic and left common carotid arteries branched from the aorta with a common duct (fig. ). these findings led to the diagnosis of aortic arch aneurysm and lung carcinoma. there were no distant metastases of the lung carcinoma (clinical stage t2bn0m0 stage iia). we decided to perform left upper lobectomy and patch angioplasty if the arch of aorta between the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery could be temporarily occluded. if not, we planned to perform aortic arch replacement under selective cerebral perfusion with systemic extracorporeal circulation through the groin.\na fourth intercostal thoracotomy was performed. as the lung carcinoma adhered to the aortic arch aneurysm but did not invade it, we could detach the visceral pleura of the left upper lobe from the aortic arch aneurysm. we performed left upper lobectomy. after that, we confirmed that the aneurysm was proximal to the left subclavian artery. because of the position of the taa, it was difficult to perform patch angioplasty. we decided to perform aortic arch replacement for the aortic arch aneurysm with a 3-branched artificial vessel under selective cerebral perfusion with systemic extracorporeal circulation. the thoracotomy was extended to the right with a transverse incision of the sternum.\na 30-mm intimal defect was observed in the aorta, and half of the aneurysm was filled with organized thrombus. it was morphologically diagnosed as pseudoaneurysm. under deep hypothermia, circulatory",

The pain was described as dull and gradually worsens. Although the location was near the thoracolumbar spine, he denied radiation of the pain to any parts of the body. Severity of pain using a numerical rating scale was 10/10 at the day of admission. The character and intensity of the pain were not affected by changes in physical movement or by rest. He denied any other symptoms such as fever, nausea, dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and leg numbness during his clinical course.\nHe had a past medical history of rectal cancer with liver metastasis and had undergone surgery and chemotherapy. At the time of diagnosis, rectal cancer was stage IV (TNM classification of malignant tumors; T3N2M1), grade 3, and was revealed to be adenocarcinoma during histopathology. Liver metastasis affected segments 3 and 6. He underwent low anterior resection of the rectum and resection of the affected liver segments. He then underwent chemotherapy using fluorouracil that was arterially infused through a catheter inserted into the femoral artery and implanted into the hepatic artery through the celiac artery. He initially had good response to treatment but 2 years after diagnosis, he had a recurrence of liver metastasis. He underwent partial resection of segment 6 of the liver and was followed by chemotherapy using FOLFOX6 + bevacizumab protocol instead of arterial infusion. After finishing chemotherapy, he achieved complete remission 11 years after initial diagnosis. As a result of the possibility of another recurrence, the catheter remained in place without being replaced. His other past medical history was hypertension and he remained on amlodipine 5 mg daily and imidapril 5 mg daily. Social history revealed that he had smoked approximately 10 cigarettes a day for 50 years and drank alcohol occasionally. Family and environmental history was unremarkable. His employment history was an office worker, but he retired at the age of 60 and has not worked since then.",

    "original_text": "A 62-year-old man was admitted to hospital with urinary infection 1 week after a surgical intervention for nephrolithiasis. He received ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day. Four days after the first intake of the antibiotic therapy, the patient started to present severe numbness in the feet gradually ascending towards the calves and sensory disturbances in the hands, but not flaccid paresis. During the examination of the patient, he had full strength in his extremities and only vibratory sensory distal deficit. Patellar and Achilles reflexes were absent. Cranial nerves were not involved, and no ataxic or autonomic features were reported. An electrodiagnostic test performed in the fourth week revealed that the peroneal and tibial nerves, as well as the sensory nerves in the lower limbs, were not excitable. In the upper limbs, the amplitudes of the compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) of the median and ulnar nerves were extremely low, less than 80% of the lower normal limit of motor amplitude, indicating axonal degeneration []. The sensory and motor nerve conduction velocity was severely diminished with temporal dispersion, especially at common entrapment sites, but no conduction blocks were registered (Table ). Distal CMAP latencies in the median and ulnar nerves were prolonged as electrophysiological evidence of demyelination features []. The H reflex recorded from the soleus muscle after the stimulation of the tibial nerve was bilaterally abolished. The electromyography revealed active denervation with increased temporal recruitment in the distal part of the lower limbs with no neurogenic pattern in the proximal muscles. One month later, it was discovered that the same clinical phenotype with lack of tendon reflexes was present in the lower limbs. The electrodiagnostic test reported more than 50% reduction of normal values of the sensory amplitudes in the median and ulnar nerves and inexcitability of the sural nerve (Table ).

    "cleaned_text": "a 62-year-old man was admitted to hospital with urinary infection 1 week after a surgical intervention for nephrolithiasis. he received ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day. four days after the first intake of the antibiotic therapy, the patient started to present severe numbness in the feet gradually ascending towards the calves and sensory disturbances in the hands, but not flaccid paresis. during the examination of the patient, he had full strength in his extremities and only vibratory sensory distal deficit. patellar and achilles reflexes were absent. cranial nerves were not involved, and no ataxic or autonomic features were reported. an electrodiagnostic test performed in the fourth week revealed that the peroneal and tibial nerves, as well as the sensory nerves in the lower limbs, were not excitable. in the upper limbs, the amplitudes of the compound motor action potentials (cmaps) of the median and ulnar nerves were extremely low, less than 80% of the lower normal limit of motor amplitude, indicating axonal degeneration []. the sensory and motor nerve conduction velocity was severely diminished with temporal dispersion, especially at common entrapment sites, but no conduction blocks were registered (table ). distal cmap latencies in the median and ulnar nerves were prolonged as electrophysiological evidence of demyelination features []. the h reflex recorded from the soleus muscle after the stimulation of the tibial nerve was bilaterally abolished. the electromyography revealed active denervation with increased temporal recruitment in the distal part of the lower limbs with no neurogenic pattern in the proximal muscles. one month later, it was discovered that the same clinical phenotype with lack of tendon reflexes was present in the lower limbs. the electrodiagnostic test reported more than 50% reduction of normal values of the sensory amplitudes in the median and ulnar nerves and inexcitability of the sural nerve (table ). in our case, the involvement of the upper limbs was also prominent, even if the length-dependent pattern was respected. the fibular and tibial nerves became electrically excitable late in the disorder, but the",

    "original_text": "A 40-year-old male patient was admitted to the Department of Urology, Calcutta National Medical College, with a complaint of clear fluid discharge from an intra-abdominal drain placed on the right side of his lower abdomen. He had a history of an open appendicectomy done at a primary health care center 3 weeks previously for clinically suspected acute appendicitis. According to the operating surgeon's brief, there was a mass in the right iliac fossa. The appendix was inflamed and was densely adhered to the mass. The surgeon was able to dissect out the appendix with difficulty. During the dissection, the mass sustained an injury that resulted in clear discharge through it. The surgeon suspected a ureteral injury but was unable to repair it; hence, he inserted a drain and referred the patient to us for further management.\nOn examination, the patient was anxious but his clinical parameters, hemogram, renal function tests, and serum biochemistry were normal. The patient had no significant medical or surgical history apart from the present episode. There was an output of approximately 500 to 600 mL per day from the abdominal drain. Analysis of the drain fluid revealed a high creatinine level, which suggested that the output was urine. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen could not delineate the left kidney. The right kidney and ureter were normal on the intravenous pyelogram (IVP) but the left kidney was not seen in its anatomical position. On careful examination of the IVP, a faint shadow with areas of contrast excretion could be seen on the right side, especially in late films at the level of the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae (). Considering the possibility of crossed renal ectopia, contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis (). The ectopic left kidney was small and showed excretion of contrast with evidence of hydronephrosis. The two renal units were not fused with each other.
