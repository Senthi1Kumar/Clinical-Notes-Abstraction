Five months later she presented with complaints of sinus symptoms and CT scan identified a \"large right nasal polyp\". Her primary care physician treated her for sinusitis, but three weeks later she presented again complaining of shortness of breath and difficulty moving air through her right nostril. She also reported a bloody nose of three weeks duration and the self discovery of a new nasal polyp one week prior to presentation. On physical exam a large polypoid lesion filled the right naris and MRI identified an extensive right nasal passage mass eroding through the cribriform plate of the right ethmoid sinus into the cranial cavity (Figure ). A tissue biopsy was obtained and two follow-up biopsies were collected at the request of the pathologist. Arrangements were made for radiation therapy, but one month later, prior to initiation of the therapy, the patient developed progressing neurologic symptoms and subsequently died from a massive intracranial hemorrhage. No autopsy was performed.\nReview of the biopsy materials showed an extensively necrotic tissue with scattered viable epithelial and mesenchymal elements.

In addition, in 2001, a right-sided localised ductal breast cancer in situ was identified and was treated surgically with a partial mastectomy. Secondary to her lymph node dissection, she developed lymphoedema of her left arm, which had been continuously treated with compression stockings. The patient was on treatment with an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker due to hypertension, and in addition, she had a known systolic murmur, characterized as physiological, as transthoracic echocardiographs in 2011 and 2017 were normal. Since her surgery in 1999, on a total of six occasions prior to her last and seventh visit, of which the first episode occurred in 2008, she had been treated for erysipelas in her left upper arm. The presentation had always been sudden with spiking fever and erythema spreading in approximately the same localisation. Interestingly, on all three out of the three occasions where a blood culture has been drawn on presentation with erysipelas, the cultures have shown growth of a bacterium belonging to the S. mitis group.

She remained disease-free and was discharged from follow-up ten years later.\nIn 2011, she was referred by her GP for a suspicious lesion on her right neck. This was diagnosed as a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and completely excised. She was discharged back to the care of her GP.\nBetween 2013 and 2015, she had been admitted on three occasions to a short-stay ward at a District General Hospital (). Of these, one was for presyncope and the others for urinary tract infections, anaemia, and general deterioration. She had been seen by geriatricians, general physicians, and rehabilitation staff. The patient declined investigation or intervention and was discharged with no follow-up.\nIn 2015, after being alerted to the patient's poor condition by her carers, the patient was visited at home by her GP. From there, the patient was referred to the Head and Neck MDT and to our hospital for admission. She presented to a long-stay care of the elderly ward with a bilobulated, fungating, 8 \u00d7 10 cm mass in the right neck (). This mass had grown over a two-year period. Her principle complaints were of pain and the inability to lie comfortably.\nShe appeared cachectic, and apart from the neck mass physical examination was unremarkable.

The patient\u2019s medical history was non-contributory. Intraoral examination identified a firm, non-fluctuant mass with no ulceration in the vestibular region between the right upper central incisor and canine (Figure ). The right upper central and lateral incisors were missing. A computed tomography (CT) showed severe bony resorption between the right upper second premolar and the left upper lateral incisor (Figure ). Incisional biopsy was performed via vestibular approach. The specimen of the tumor was extirpated with overlying mucosa. During the biopsy, an intact cortex was not observed. The histological diagnosis was moderately differentiated SCC. The connection between the tumor and the overlying mucosa was not observed. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) revealed a destructive tumor with no cystic lesion, >50 mm in diameter. The tumor pressed the skin around the nasal ala and the nostril of the right side, but no direct connection between the skin and tumor was observed. Although the maxillary sinus and nasal cavity were deformed by the tumor, no abnormal findings were seen for the mucosa of the nasal cavity and maxillary sinus (Figure ). One swollen and enhanced lymph node was recognized in the submandibular area of the right side. Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed the enhanced lesion in the maxilla and the right submandibular area. There was no evidence of metastatic disease on chest radiography, upper gastric endoscopy or PET.

Her blood pressure was 190/90 mm Hg and the heart rate 78 beats per minute without the use of inotropic drugs. The laboratory findings were as follows: hemoglobin 12.9 g/dL, white blood cell count 8.07 \u00d7 109/L, and C-reactive protein, 0.4 mg/L. The patient's medical history included deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with subsequent placement of Celect IVC filter (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana, USA) approximately eight years ago. The patient had undergone IVC filter implantation in another hospital, and the exact reason for the insertion could not be ascertained.\nComputed tomography (CT) revealed a perforation of the IVC wall by one of the filter's struts and penetration into the duodenum. We did not identify another cause of abdominal pain in our examination (Fig. ).\nOur first attempt to remove the IVC filter through cavography failed. The patient consecutively underwent median laparotomy. On retraction of the duodenum to the right, one strut of the filter could be seen protruding the vessel wall and penetrating into the duodenum (Fig. ). The strut was removed from the duodenum entirely, and the perforation site was sutured primarily with Vicryl (Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ). The IVC was dissected at the level of the left renal vein and the confluence of common iliac veins to permit safe clamping. An IVC clamp was then used to clamp the IVC proximally just below the renal vein. A second IVC clamp was placed above the iliac vein confluence.

After the surgery, her persistent urine leakage remained uncontrolled. The patient gained control over her urination approximately 2 to 3 years after the surgery, when her urine overflowed slowly without spray urination. Occasionally, the patient presented with spray urination during urinary urgencies; however, no involuntary urine overflow was noted. Since the patient's menarche at 17 years of age, the number of urinations had increased 4 to 5 days before and after menstruation. The urinary volume was small, and sometimes her urinations occurred as frequently as once per hour. Five years ago, the patient presented with repeated urinary tract infections that usually lasted for 6 months before they were resolved by anti-infection treatment. A year ago, when the patient started having sex with her boyfriend, the man's penis bled due to abrasion, and the patient palpated a hard lump in her vagina.

Physical examination revealed deep tendon hyper-reflexia of the upper and lower extremities. Motor palsy was not evident and no sensory disturbance was found in the upper or lower extremities or in the trunk. The plain lateral radiography did not show any abnormality. The antero-posterior radiography showed enlargement of the left C3-4 foramen (). Cervical magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a dumbbell type tumor compressing the spinal cord at the C3-4 levels (). The tumor was located on the left side of the spinal cord. The tumor showed low intensity on the T1-weighted image and iso-high or slightly high intensity on the T2-weighted image. Gadolinium enhancement was noted in the tumor ().\nThe patient underwent an operation in April 2006. Cervical laminectomy at C3-4 was carried out and total resection of the cervical tumor was performed. The tumor was encapsulated () and it involved the posterior ramus of the C4 spinal nerve, and so the nerve was resected. The dura mater was opened to identify the presence of any intradural tumor invasion, but no intradural invasion was observed. Thereafter, the dura matter was tightly sutured. The round-shaped dark red tumor mass was covered by a thin membrane. The size of the tumor was 2.6 \u00d7 2.4 \u00d7 1.3 cm. The histological examination revealed a schwanoma with both Antoni type A and type B areas. No malignant characteristics were found for the pathology.\nThe surgical drain was removed 2 days after surgery. The patient had a slight fever.

After observing electrocardiographic changes, he was hospitalized with suspected acute coronary syndrome. An angio-computed tomography (CT) was performed, resulting in a diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism, with no improvement after anticoagulant therapy. The patient was transferred to our hospital, where a repeat angio-CT was performed, revealing a filling defect in the pulmonary artery trunk, extending from the subvalvular area to the origin of the right pulmonary artery, with no change in size with respect to the previous angio-CT (Figure ). The patient was operated on for a suspected primary tumor of the pulmonary artery, resulting in with complete resection of the mass, whose pathological result was an intermediate-grade malignant tumor suggestive of PAIS (Figure ). Following an extension study, CT showed only a nonspecific pulmonary nodule of 4 mm in diameter in the right upper lobe. No adjuvant treatment was given. Three months later, a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) found that the previously mentioned nodule measured 6 mm, suggestive of metastasis. Another 4 mm de novo nodule was found and two more of 2-3 mm in size, possibly granulomas, all without an increase in metabolic activity. The patient underwent surgery where 4 bilateral pulmonary lesions, compatible with metastasis, were resected. Fifteen months later, a new PET-CT reveals a subpleural nodule in the left upper lobe, again suspicious of metastasis (Figure ), as well as several millimeter-size nodules reported in the previous CT, not metabolically characterizable.

T2-weighted images revealed hyperintense tumor with delayed enhancement on arterial phase and portal venous phase (Fig. b) followed by a delayed washout on the hepatocyte phase. Clinical evaluation and laboratory results were nonspecific, and serum tumor markers including carcinoembryonic antigen, cancer antigen (CA) 19-9, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen were within their normal ranges. The findings were consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) or another benign tumor originating from the liver or gallbladder. Accordingly, we planned firstly laparoscopic partial hepatectomy concomitant with gallbladder resection. Lymphadenectomy among the hepatoduodenal ligament were also planned under the situations where malignant tumor was suspected intraoperatively. Under the laparoscopic view, a soft tumor had expansively progressed behind the gallbladder, with dorsal compression of the liver (Fig. ). The tumor was easily separated from Laennec\u2019s capsule of the liver at the gallbladder neck and body without adhesion, which indicates the tumor is benign. Therefore, operative policy changed to tumor enucleation with cholecystectomy. Frozen sections including the surgical margin of the cystic duct were negative for tumor cells. As the tumor was moderately attached to the liver at the fundus of the gallbladder, the liver parenchyma was partially resected en bloc to ensure that the surgical margins were free of tumor tissue.\nThe resected specimen included soft and white tumor",

General hematological and biochemical tests were normal. To evaluate the source of emboli, Carotid Doppler measurements and transthoracic echocardiography was performed. Carotid Doppler measurements were normal.

Over the past several months, she started self-mutilating by cutting her arms and legs with a razor. She also had suicidal ideations with a plan to stab herself with a knife or get hit by a car. The precipitating event was being accused of cheating on a school test, and the fear of being expelled. The mother reported the patient was having increased sleep, decreased motivation, social isolation, and dropping school grades. Besides school stress, the patient reported conflict with her parents about the cultural differences. The patient stopped talking to her parents, siblings, and her teachers. She stopped doing homework or studying for tests; her grades dropped from A\u2019s & B\u2019s to C\u2019s & D\u2019s. She did admit to suicidal ideation for months, without a plan.

Some family members were diagnosed with carcinomas, all with adult-onset. At admission, her physical examination was remarkable for abdominal tenderness without any evident neurological deficits.

All symptoms began one day after she had received the first dose of the combination Infanrix-IPV+Hib vaccine (a combined vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, and Hib infections). Her parents reported that she had been perfectly healthy the day before vaccination.\nPast medical history revealed that the patient had been born at 31 weeks' gestation after premature rupture of the membranes; maternal fever was documented during delivery. She was hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit and treated with empiric antibiotics for 3 days pending blood culture results. The rest of her hospitalization was uneventful, and she was discharged at the age of 5 weeks in good medical condition.\nAt the present admission to the other hospital, bacterial meningitis was suspected on the basis of abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell count (2358/mm3, with neutrophil predominance 60%), protein, and glucose (235 mg/dL, 1 mg/dL, resp.) despite negative findings on direct microscopy of a CSF sample. Empiric treatment with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and dexamethasone was started. Two days later, both blood and CSF cultures grew Haemophilus influenzae, which was identified as type b using latex agglutination-based antigen detection test. The patient's clinical status gradually improved over the next 4 days, when a secondary fever was noted in addition to new-onset seizures. Treatment with phenobarbital was initiated, and the patient was transferred to our tertiary medical center.\nAt admission to our department, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study revealed subdural fluid collections in the posterior fossa and around the hemispheres.

He had suffered from mucosanguineous feces, abdominal pain, and an anal fistula for 6 mo. Colonoscopy, biopsy, and multi-slice computed tomography (CT) enterography were performed. Negative blood tests were observed and no opportunistic infections were found. He was prescribed mesalazine 3 g/d for 1 year without complications but primary symptoms were only partially relieved. One year later, his symptoms of abdominal pain and loose stool were aggravated, and gastroscopy showed involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract. He was treated with oral methylprednisolone 48 mg/d for 10 d. The dose was reduced by 4 mg every 2 wk without any improvement in symptoms. He continued to take mesalazine 2 g/d. In December 2018, reexamination with colonoscopy and biopsy showed stenosis of the sigmoid colon accompanied by numerous new ulcers. He was examined at another hospital and from then to the present, no extraintestinal manifestations occurred. The patient was advised by the doctor to undergo IFX therapy and he stopped taking mesalazine after excluding tuberculosis and other viral or bacterial infections. On December 3, 2018, he took the first dose of IFX 300 mg based on his weight (60 kg, dose 5 mg/kg). After 2 and 6 wk, he received the second and third IFX injection and a maintenance dose was planned every 8 wk thereafter.
