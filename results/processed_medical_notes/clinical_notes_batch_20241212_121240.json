The patient had been under the care of Dermatology since 2003 for an itchy rash on the legs, scalp and chest. A biopsy from a crusted lesion on the scalp (Fig. ) in 2003 revealed acantholysis of the keratinocytes in the upper part of the prickle cell layer (Fig. ), and direct immunofluorescence studies showed IgG positivity around the upper epidermal cells. These features were consistent with a diagnosis of PF. He was started on Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) 500 mg twice a day and Prednisolone 10 mg once a day by Dermatology in 2006, which had resulted in excellent control of his cutaneous lesions. Prior to this, Azathioprine alone had been introduced on two occasions by Dermatology, however the patient failed to tolerate it due to nausea and vomiting. Oral involvement only began in January 2008 which required hospital admission for a short period.\nHis only other relevant medical history was hypertension, for which he took Nifedipine. At initial presentation, he was also taking Ranitidine and Alendronic Acid for protection against osteoporosis with prolonged systemic corticosteroid use. He was a non-smoker and had low alcohol intake.\nAt initial appointment, MMF dose was increased to 1 g in the morning and 500 mg in the evening for 2 weeks, and thereafter 1 g twice a day. Full blood count, urea and electrolytes and liver function tests were normal, and regular blood monitoring was carried out appropriately.

At the hospital, he was found to have a huge, ulcerative and bleeding mass disfiguring the right side of his face (). The patient stated that he had the mass on the right side of his face for many years, had a biopsy on the mass showing cSCC three years ago at the other medical facility but declined surgery or any treatments at that time (data was not available). Subsequently, a surgery consultation was made for biopsy and to get a surgical opinion to manage this neglected facial lesion. Biopsy confirmed cSCC. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed an 11\u00d710\u00d73 cm soft tissue mass arising from the right side of his face and temporal area. The mass invaded the myofascial plane of the right temporalis muscle, but not the facial bone (). There were several enlarged right submandibular and upper cervical neck lymph nodes. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan demonstrated hypermetabolic masses involving the right face and frontotemporal scalp with maximum standardized uptake values (SUVs) of 18 () and right neck level I\u2013II lymph nodal station with maximum SUVs of 4.9 (). The patient again declined to receive extensive surgeries for this neglected cSCC on the right face.

The patient had a skin biopsy on the right leg about 2 weeks prior to presentation for a possible skin cancer. He had no immediate complications following the biopsy, and the pathology was negative for cancer. One week after the biopsy, he went on a planned vacation with his extended family to the Bahamas. During the vacation, he went swimming in chlorinated pools at the resort and \u201cswam with the pigs,\u201d an adventure activity in the ocean with wild pigs. The night before his scheduled departure, he developed pain and redness at the site of his prior skin biopsy. Overnight, the pain became more severe, and he developed associated significant edema and worsening discoloration of the leg. On the morning of departure, he was unable to walk due to pain and also reported malaise and subjective fever and chills.

Sokolov Memorial Hospital 122 due to an area of consolidation in the middle lobe that was found on a chest computed tomography (CT) scan. Two years ago, chest CT was performed due to increasing dyspnea, and revealed a middle lobe neoplasm (). The lesion was solid, centrally located, measuring 16\u00d715 mm, with smooth margins, and caused partial atelectasis of the middle lobe with no enlarged lymph nodes. During video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) exploration performed at another institution, the neoplasm in the middle lobe was visualized, as well as multiple small yellowish foci on the parietal pleura, upon which basis pleural dissemination was suspected. Thus, wedge resection of the middle lobe with the entire lesion and biopsy of the parietal pleura were performed. According to the morphologic examination, an atypical carcinoid was verified, the resection margins were clear, and pleural carcinomatosis was confirmed. The patient was treated with octreotide (20 mg once in 28 days) since she had mild symptoms of carcinoid syndrome (the recurrent feeling of blood rushing to the face). Twelve months after surgery, local recurrence was suspected based on follow-up CT (). Significant consolidation was seen in the suture line area, and several small lesions were noted on the parietal pleura. No other signs of distant metastasis or lymph node involvement were found on chest and abdominal CT.\nAt the time of admission to our hospital, the patient had mild dyspnea. Her Charlson comorbidity index was 3. The level of chromogranin A was elevated. The patient was scheduled for VATS re-exploration of the pleural space to prove the presence of recurrence and to evaluate the volume of dissemination and the extent of the previous operation.

It interfered with her movement, making her bed bound. She reported a 1-day history of subjective fever and diarrhea a week before the onset of symptoms, which subsided spontaneously. Weakness was not associated with double vision, shortness of breath, slurred speech, abnormal movement, or confusion. She did not have fever, diarrhea, or abdominal pain and did not have similar attacks previously.\nShe lost approximately 40 kg in 2 months; she did not receive any vitamin supplementation after surgery. The patient reported vomiting three to four times daily postoperatively until a month before her presentation.\nExamination showed that the cranial nerves were intact with no motor or sensory abnormalities. Her UL and LL tone was normal. There was a symmetrical decrease in power in her ULs both proximally and distally. LL power was also decreased. Her reflexes were diminished but elicitable, but her plantar response was mute with various maneuvers. The sensory examination was unremarkable and her coordination was intact.\nThe patient was admitted to hospital as a case of postbariatric surgery myeloneuropathy or GBS.

There were no history of fever, seizures, loss of consciousness, and loss of vision. On examination, the patient was conscious, oriented, and blood pressure was 140/100 mmHg with no tachycardia. Cranial nerve examination was normal. Power in the right and left upper limb was 1/5 while 3/5 in bilateral lower limb. Investigations including complete blood count, renal function tests, coagulation studies, thyroid function test, urinalysis, and chest radiograph were not suggestive of any abnormality. MRI brain revealed multifocal acute infarcts in multiple vascular territories, predominantly in bilateral anterior cerebral arteries territories. Magnetic resonance cerebral angiography showed multifocal multisegmental areas of stenosis involving large- and medium-sized intracranial arteries likely due to CNS vasculitis. Computerized tomography (CT) cerebral angiography of the brain and neck revealed multifocal parenchymal hemorrhages along with areas of hypodensity suggestive of ischemia in the centrum semiovale with narrowing of bilateral terminal internal carotid artery and middle cerebral arteries [].\nAfter identifying cerebral infarction as the cause of the weakness, she underwent detailed evaluation of connective tissue disorders and secondary vasculitis but was noncontributory. The patient was hence diagnosed and treated as primary CNS vasculitis. She was started on prednisolone pulse dosages and later continued on tapering dosages of prednisolone. Significant improvement in power and weakness was noted with steroid with near-normal recovery. She was further planned for cyclophosphamide monthly dosages but found to have grossly deranged liver enzymes.

Upon his arrival at the emergency department the patient scored a PedNIHSS of 5. He was sleepy but arousable, with stable blood pressure of 131/78 mmHg and pulse of 96' min. He had a mydriatic right pupil, minor drift of his right arm, and mildly reduced sensibility of the right side of his body. According to his mother, the boy had fallen on his upper chest while inline skating a day earlier without any further complaints until he dove into the swimming pool. Blood was drawn, an intravenous access was placed, and a CAT scan of the brain and cervical vessels and angioscan of the brain were performed without delay. The scans revealed acute dissection of the boy's left vertebral artery with partial occlusion and thrombosis of the basilar artery (Figures \u2013).\nThe patient was transferred to the nearest university hospital, where immediate systemic thrombolysis with Activase (alteplase) (4 mg bolus injection and 36 mg over the following hour) was administered within four hours of the onset of the symptoms. The concurrent lack of clinical improvement led the clinicians to perform a catheter angiography in order to administer intra-arterial thrombolysis and an attempt to remove the thrombus. The procedure was performed under sedation with midazolam (Dormicum). Through a 5F H1 Headhunter catheter, selectively placed in the right vertebral artery, a Rebar 18 catheter is installed under guidance of a Traxcess 14 microwire into the thrombus at the tip of the basilar artery.

She also used to take Propranolol for early morning headaches mostly in the frontal region for 2 years. The patient with a probable diagnosis of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) was referred to the pediatric rheumatology clinic for further surveys when 0.5 milligram daily colchicine was taken without considerable clinical response. She also had both an intussusception experiment and a history of negative appendectomy since she was 2 years old and the initiation of abdominal pain since that time. She was never febrile during abdominal pains. General examination revealed a thin hemodynamically stable girl with no signs of acute abdomen; the weight and the length were 15 kg and 105 cm [body mass index (BMI): 14.5 kg/m2].\nShe had second admission within previous 15 days with similar complaints. The grey scale and color Doppler abdominal ultrasonography showed normal portal and splenic veins and there were no evidences of thrombosis.

He had a history of chronic hepatitis C infection and cirrhosis. There was no history of abdominal trauma. The abdomen was soft, and no mass was palpable. The hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count, platelet count, and C-reactive protein level were within normal limits. The tumor marker levels were also within normal ranges, such as CEA 2.9 ng/mL and CA19-9 25 U/mL. Dynamic computed tomography (CT) showed a 40-mm solid pelvic mass anterior to the rectum. The mass was enhanced homogeneously with no infiltration into the organs surrounding the mass (Fig. ). The spleen was visualized in the left upper quadrant, and mild splenomegaly was present. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the pelvic mass measured 46 \u00d7 47 \u00d7 38 mm, and it had a low signal on T1-weighted imaging and a slightly high signal on T2-weighted imaging. MRI also showed a blood vessel that extended to the ventral side of the mass (Fig. ). Since the MRI was confined to the pelvis, the origin of the vascular pedicle could not be identified. We suspected that the feeding blood vessels were derived from the mesenteric vessels. Abnormal accumulation was not detected on positron emission tomography (PET)-CT. No abnormalities were found in the mucous membrane of the rectum, and no clear compressive lesion was detected on colonoscopy. Based on these findings, a preoperative diagnosis was difficult to make. Since the mass was near the rectum and had blood flow from the mesenteric vessels, we preoperatively suspected a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) or malignant lymphoma in the rectum.\nIntraoperative findings showed a spherical firm mass with a well-defined capsule, measuring approximately 4 cm in diameter. The mass had a long cord-like tissue arising from the great omentum (Fig. ) and was surgically removed after ligation of the cord-like tissue. Histopathologic",

All hematologic examinations including tumor makers were within the normal ranges. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography revealed an 18-mm mass in the pancreatic head that had invaded the right side of the SMV and a 32-mm mass in the pancreatic tail (). Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography showed the accumulation of FDG in both masses (). No metastatic lesion was found in these images. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed that both masses were adenocarcinoma. Of course, TP was appropriate procedure for these pancreatic carcinomas; however, parenchyma-preserving pancreatectomy was considered due to the patient\u2019s age and postoperative quality of life with a solitary existence. Preoperative computed tomography showed the dorsal pancreatic artery (DPA), which flowed into the pancreatic body (). If it was possible to preserve the DPA and confluence of the splenic vein (SpV), preservation of middle segment pancreas was considered possible.\nFirst, we started the pancreaticoduodenectomy procedure. The pancreas was divided at the left side of the SMV. The frozen specimen of the pancreatic stump was negative for cancer. The pancreatic head tumor had invaded the right wall of the SMV (), suggesting the need for SMV resection and reconstruction. The preservation of the SpV was necessary for MSPP. In order to determine the method of SMV resection and reconstruction about preserving the SpV, we had needed to perform distal pancreatectomy and evaluate the distal pancreatic stump. We then started distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy. The divided line of the distal pancreas was 2 cm on the proximal side of the pancreatic tail tumor. The frozen specimen of the pancreatic tail stump was negative for cancer. The splenic artery (SpA) and SpV were resected at the distal dividing line of the pancreas, preserving the DPA and the proximal side of the SpA and SpV. Lymphadenectomy around the SpA was performed sufficiently",

We planned osteotomy including the load surface of acetabulum assisted by a computer navigation system and reconstruction using a frozen bone autograft. The patient\u2019s tracker was placed on the iliac crest; the error after registration was within 1 mm. Subsequently, by pulling the lower limbs, a gap of approximately 2 cm was made in the joint space and osteotomy was performed without dislocation of the hip joint (Fig. ). In this case, navigation was particularly helpful in osteotomy of the acetabulum. Although osteotomy under direct view is possible via dislocation of the hip joint, it involves the risk of femoral head necrosis, and this cannot be confirmed from the cartilage surface. In addition, X-ray image alone cannot provide the orientation. Reconstruction was performed using plates and an artificial bone graft and autograft (normal iliac bone) to fill the cavity for the defect of the load surface of acetabulum after tumor curettage. The resection margins were free of tumor, and this was pathologically confirmed in a small sample collected from preserved host tissue. Pathological evaluation of curettage of cancellous bone indicated almost total necrosis of the tumor, which was classified as grade III/IV according to the Rosen and Huvos evaluation system []. After the completion of postoperative chemotherapy (three courses of ifosfamide + etoposide, 1 course of vincristine + doxorubicine + cyclophosphamide, and two courses of vincristine + cyclophosphamide), the patient was free of the disease. Her X-ray did not show osteoarthritis of the hip joint; she could walk normally with some claudication, and there were no limitations in the sitting posture (no limitation of the range of motion of the hip and knee joint)",

    "original_text": "A 70 year-old Caucasian male presented to our institution as a transfer for further evaluation and management of his presenting symptoms of dyspnea, chest pain, and a sensation of chest fullness. The patient had a complicated medical history including recurrent bilateral pleural effusions, treated by multiple prior thoracenteses that failed to provide long-term symptomatic relief. Furthermore, the patient also had recurrent pericardial effusions that required a pericardial window three years prior to his presentation to our institution. At the time of hospital admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable and his physical exam was only remarkable for pulsus paradoxus and bibasilar rhonchi. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a normal sinus rhythm and normal axis, but had low voltage throughout. Chest radiograph (figure ) demonstrated portions of the stomach and colon projecting over the heart. A transthoracic echocardiogram was then ordered for further assessment, but the heart could not be visualized. Review of a recent thoracic computed tomographic (CT) scan (figure ) demonstrated transdiaphragmatic herniation of portions of the stomach and transverse colon. However, because the CT scan was a routine nongated examination, image quality was not sufficient to differentiate between intrapericardial herniation versus intramediastinal herniation.

He was also experiencing low-grade fevers and fatigue. The boy had no significant past medical or family history. Physical examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory studies revealed anemia and renal insufficiency. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the abdomen showed a large mass in the upper pole of the right kidney that had extended through the renal capsule; these findings were radiologically interpreted as being consistent with Wilms tumor. There were multiple lobulated masses in the middle to inferior pole of the right kidney and throughout the left kidney, which we radiologically interpreted as being consistent with nephroblastomatosis. The patient was started on a course of emergent therapy with vincristine/actinomycin based on radiographic diagnosis and enrolled in study AREN0534 (radiographic diagnosis only; no biopsy per study). He developed significant tumor lysis. Children\u2019s Oncology Group Quality Assurance Review Center (COG QARC) imaging review confirmed the radiologic interpretation of innumerable bilateral lesions compatible with diffuse rests with superimposed tumor. An ultrasound performed 2 weeks into the course of therapy demonstrated significant response (7.0 x 6.2 x 5.0 cm compared with 14 x 11 x 11 cm in a previous study). The patient was readmitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and dehydration with week 3 of vincristine. Due to the unusual complication, the patient underwent a partial right nephrectomy and biopsy of the left kidney after 6 weeks of therapy. Pathologic analysis of the right nephrectomy specimen demonstrated Burkitt lymphoma with no evidence of Wilms tumor. The left kidney showed mild interstitial fibrosis and interstitial nephritis; no tumor was observed. The patient was treated with Burkitt lymphoma therapy, which included rituximab, and he had a complete response. The patient remains free of disease",

The history obtained revealed that the patient was followed up regularly by paediatric neurologists for her CP, and she had multiple botulinum injections when she was 8 years old. The physical examination based on the walking analysis illustrated limited range of motion in addition to 55\u00b0 of increased femoral anteversion in either hips. From the data of walking analysis, physical examination and radiological findings, the increased femoral anteversion and excessive soft tissue contractures due to CP were considered the primary reason for her walking difficulty. To improve her gait pattern, a combination of soft tissue procedure and distal femoral derotational osteotomy were planned.\nUnder general anaesthesia, the tendons of adductor longus, iliopsoas, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, gracilis, and gastrocnemius were released from the musculotendinous junction bilaterally. Bilateral distal femoral derotational osteotomy was then performed just above the metaphysis level with a lateral approach, and osteosynthesis was obtained by dynamic compression plate and screw fixation. Bilateral long leg casts were applied postoperatively to maintain osteosynthesis. The patient was discharged on the third post-operative day, casts were removed one month later and routine rehabilitative physiotherapy was instituted.\nAt one-year routine follow-up, there was complete union of the osteotomy. Although pre-operative radiographs of the right knee showed no evidence of any cystic or tumoral lesions around the distal femur (), the second-year follow-up radiographs revealed an asymptomatic large bone cyst in the distal part of the right femur. A computed tomography (CT) scan identified the lesion as a large cystic lesion located just above the lateral femoral condyle expanding from metaphysis to the femoral diaphysis involving the osteotomy site with cortical thinning (). The initial diagnosis was an aneurysmal bone cyst. To verify the diagnosis, an incisional biopsy was performed under general anaesthesia. Cortical bone was partially destroyed by the lesion",

His previous medical history included dementia, arterial hypertension, tobacco smoking, ischemic heart disease, and aortic insufficiency. He denied consuming alcohol. At home, he was stable and felt well. He was calm and performed his daily activities under medical supervision, despite early stage dementia. He had no motor deficit, only idle speed typical of the elderly. His blood pressure was controlled, with no clinical signs of heart failure. According to his family, he had a good quality of life. Three months earlier he had undergone vascular surgery to treat an aneurysm in his common iliac artery with endoprosthesis. The surgery had no complications and he was rehabilitated at home. However, 3 days prior to hospital admission he had a computed tomography scan. The result of imaging showed an increase in aneurysm size in his common iliac artery. Then a new surgery was indicated for the treatment of the aneurysm.\nThe present surgery was performed under general anesthesia, with hemodynamic instability throughout the procedure, which required norepinephrine. Iliac dissection technique was difficult; there was loss of blood and a need for suture and compressive dressing. Cefuroxime was administered intravenously in the operating room at 1.5 g intravenously and maintained every 8 hours postoperatively. In addition, 3500 ml of crystalloid, and 1 unit of RBC were administered. Our patient left the surgery without a distal pulse; 31 mL of contrast was needed.

Two years earlier, he experienced the first severe decompensation of right heart function. At that time PH was diagnosed on echocardiography. RV to left ventricle (LV) ratio exceeded one (RV:LV - 39/32 mm); peak systolic tricuspid regurgitation gradient (TRPG) was 75 mmHg, and decreased tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) 15 mm indicated significant pressure overload and RV systolic dysfunction. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed sarcoidosis progression, however no pulmonary thromboemboli were detected. After typical heart failure treatment with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and steroid dose increase the patient improved and he was discharged home in a good clinical condition in WHO functional class II, with the diagnosis of PH due to sarcoidosis stage IV. One year later, due to acute dyspnea, worsening of RV function and unilateral leg swelling he underwent another chest CT, which this time showed fresh thrombi in the left segmental upper lobe pulmonary artery. Moreover, acute deep vein thrombosis was detected with lower limb compression ultrasound. Long term oral anticoagulation with rivaroxaban was started. Two years later the patient was referred to our center due to progressive functional deterioration. On admission he was in WHO functional class IV, saturation on room air was 85%, blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, heart rate 90 beats per minute. Mild peripheral edema was present. Distance covered in 6 min walk test (6MWT) was 100 m with desaturation to 77%. Plasma natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) concentration was elevated to 6239 pg/ml (normal range < 125 pg/ml).

For this reason, a simple skull computed tomography (CT) is carried out and a neurosurgery concept is requested.\nDuring the initial evaluation, the patient is found in a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) as follows: GCS of 15, acceptable general condition, with vital signs within normal limits, with craniofacial trauma stigmas, bradypsychic, cranial nerves without alterations, preserved muscle strength in all 4 limbs, without sensory deficits and without the presence of pathological reflexes.\nSignificant vasogenic edema in the extension of the left frontal lobe with volume effect and deviation of the midline to the right is evidenced on the skull CT (). Findings highly suggestive of tumor lesion without clear limits in it were considered.\nThe study was extended with simple and contrasted brain nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in order to characterize the lesion. The initial diagnostic impression was a metastatic lesion; therefore, extension studies were requested in order to search for possible primary neoplasm, which were negative. Anti-edema management was started with intravenous 8 mg of dexamethasone every 8 h and anticonvulsant management was managed with 500 mg of levetiracetam every 12 h.\nThe simple and contrasted MRI () showed a lesion with well-defined intra-axial left frontal edges, isointense in T1 and T2 sequences, with homogeneous uptake of the contrast medium, without restriction to diffusion, associated with large perilesional edema, with deviation of the midline to the right and subfalcine herniation",

    "original_text": "A 64-year-old woman with a long history of ovarian cancer presented with recurrent diarrhea after a fifth cycle of carboplatin. She had recently completed a fourteen-day course of oral metronidazole for Clostridium difficile colitis which was diagnosed after her fourth cycle of carboplatin chemotherapy.\nThe patient was originally diagnosed with Stage IIIc grade 3 papillary serous carcinoma of the ovary. She was treated with a primary suboptimal debulking by a surgical oncologist and subsequently had received six cycles of combination carboplatin (AUC 5) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2). The ovarian carcinoma recurred within the first 12 months of completing this first-line therapy. She underwent a secondary suboptimal debulking by the same surgeon and was placed on daily \u00d75 topotecan followed by multiple other chemotherapy regimens including gemcitabine, capecitabine, weekly paclitaxel, and monthly liposomal doxorubicin. All of these chemotherapies were given in less than 12 months.\nAfter going through all of the above regimens, she was referred to the gynecologic oncology service. After long discussion, knowing that her platinum-free interval was just over 20 months, she underwent a tertiary debulking with complete cytoreduction, including diaphragm resection, liver wedge resection, partial gastrectomy, infragastric omentectomy, lymph node dissection, splenectomy, and ablation of disease. Molecular profiling of the tumor revealed lack of potential benefit for all of the above named chemotherapies except carboplatin.\nShe was started on carboplatin AUC 5 q 21 days. After her fourth cycle of carboplatin, despite a normalized CA 125, the patient presented with new onset ascites and diarrhea and was diagnosed with Clostridium difficile colitis. She was started on a 14-day course of oral metronidazole. She had resolution of her symptoms (ascites and diarrhea) and went on to get a fifth cycle of carboplatin with a 1-week delay. Two and a half weeks out from her fifth cycle of intravenous carboplatin she was admitted to the hospital with severe dehydration and diarrhea. She was mildly anemic (9.5 g/dL)",
