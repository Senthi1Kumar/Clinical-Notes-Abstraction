Patient has a long-standing history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and continues to smoke. He was referred for consideration of revascularization given his nonhealing wounds. Our institutional Review Board does not require informed consent or ethics approval for case reports.\nPatient underwent a peripheral angiogram from a right common femoral artery (CFA) access site. He was found to have a long occlusion from his mid to distal left external iliac artery into his CFA and proximal left superficial femoral artery (SFA). His right SFA also had a flush total occlusion. The right SFA occlusion extended to the distal portion of this vessel with reconstitution of the popliteal from the profunda femoris (PF). The right tibioperoneal artery was severely diseased and the posterior tibialis artery was totally occluded above the ankle. The right anterior tibialis was patent to the foot and had no significant disease. The proximal left external iliac artery underwent stenting from the contralateral approach at a site of severe 90% lesion at its origin. This vessel was feeding collaterals to his left stump. Patient returns in a few days for staged treatment of his right flush occluded SFA at its origin. Access site from the contralateral occluded left CFA was not possible. A dual access from the right radial artery and right dorsalis pedis (DP) artery was planned.

She also presented weakness in her upper extremities and difficulties with fine hand movements, particularly in the right hand. The right patellar and Achilles tendon reflexes were brisk. The plantar reflex was positive in the right foot. She presented impaired bladder control. No alterations in touch or pain sensitivity were present in the trunk and limbs. No concomitant signs of infection or inflammation were present, and no such signs had been reported in the previous weeks.

Clinical examination revealed a 3\u00d72-cm firm irregular mass in the upper inner quadrant of the left breast. There was no change in the appearance of the local skin, no discharge from, or retraction of, the nipple. A small number of lymph nodes were palpated in the left axilla.

The symptoms had started after a meal when the patient felt the sensation of a foreign body in the throat, which he reportedly swallowed with a bolus of food. As the initial evaluation with neck and chest X-rays was reported as normal, he did not receive any specific intervention. However, in the third week after ingestion, he developed chest pain and fever. On evaluation with a contrast-enhanced thorax, chest, and abdomen scan, he was diagnosed with a right-sided pleural effusion and a suspected foreign body in the periesophageal region of the lower thoracic esophagus close to the inferior vena cava (Figures , ).\nFrom the hiatus region, the foreign body was located at approximately 5 cm cephalad. An intercostal drain was placed under image guidance and approximately 750 mL of serosanguinous pleural effusion was drained. An upper gastrointestinal contrast study did not show any contrast extravasation from the esophageal lumen. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy also did not show any signs of recent perforation or a foreign body in the esophagus. An after adequate chest optimization, he underwent laparoscopic foreign body removal.\nThe procedure was done under general anesthesia in the supine split leg position. After initial access and the creation of a pneumoperitoneum through the left paramedian 12 mm port using an open method, five additional 5 mm ports were placed, including two midclavicular line ports on either side, a left subcostal port for assistance, and an epigastric port for liver retraction. The gastrohepatic ligament was divided to reach the right crus. The phrenoesophageal membrane was then opened to enter the mediastinum.

He underwent creation of a left superficial femoral artery to greater saphenous vein prosthetic AV graft 1 day prior to admission. Few hours after the procedure, he started having increased surgical site pain, erythema, and small vesicles at the margins of wound. On examination, the left thigh AV fistula site staples were intact. There was mild erythema, tenderness, and vesicles at margins. Serous discharge was noted from vesicles but no purulent drainage from wound area. Lab investigations showed creatinine level of 12.6 mg/dL and a potassium level of 6.4 mEq/L at the time of admission prompting hemodialysis. On admission, his vitals were normal and white blood cell (WBC) count was 10 000/cumm. The next day, his left thigh wound pain and swelling worsened concomitant with erythema, tenderness, and purulent discharge. Blood cultures were taken and drainage sample was sent for culture and sensitivity. His WBC count increased to 13 000 and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 45; therefore, on suspicion of AV graft infection he was started on vancomycin 1.25 g intravenously given after each hemodialysis session. The vancomycin trough level was therapeutic, and blood cultures and drainage culture were negative. Despite the antibiotic therapy, his symptoms worsened with each passing day. Repeat blood and drainage cultures were consistently negative. Computed tomography scan of pelvis showed extensive edema and congestion of the subcutaneous fat extending from the left external oblique musculature inferiorly along the lateral aspect of the pelvis into the left upper extremity ().

    "original_text": "A 60-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to our hospital because of severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding. An endoscopy was performed, revealing bleeding from gastric varices in the subcardial region. Due to the large variceal size, endoscopic therapy with variceal ligation could not be performed. She was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU).\nShe had a history of similar episode of massive gastrointestinal bleeding from gastric varices six years previously. Evaluation at that time with liver function tests, portal venous flow and magnetic resonance angiography did not reveal an identifiable cause.\nOn admission to the ICU our patient initially showed no signs of hypovolemic shock. Laboratory results again did not indicate impaired liver function. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy again revealed bleeding from subcardial gastric varices in the absence of evidence of esophageal varices (Figure ).\nEndoscopic treatment with histoacryl glue only resulted in a temporary reduction of the bleeding. To reduce the portal venous pressure the vasopressin analog terlipressin was administered. Despite this therapy, there was another severe episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with signs of shock. In all, 10 units of red blood cell concentrate and four units of fresh frozen plasma were transfused. Sufficient endoscopic therapy could not be achieved.

    "original_text": "A 28-year-old male presents with a past medical history significant for cerebral palsy, fully dependent in activities of daily living. He has had a lifelong history of intermittent abdominal distension and constipation. He had previously presented to an outside hospital due to low-grade fever with intractable nausea and vomiting. A computed tomography (CT) abdomen pelvis with contrast demonstrated findings consistent with pseudoobstruction vs. ileus, possibly due to cecal bascule or volvulus. Due to failure to improve with nonoperative measures, he underwent a decompressive colonoscopy to reduce the colonic distension. He was subsequently taken to the operating room where a cecal bascule was identified, per outside operative record, as well as a severely dilated small bowel and redundant colon. He underwent a diverting loop ileostomy, gastrostomy tube placement, and appendectomy. Reasons for this operative decision-making are not made known to the authors. His postoperative course was complicated by delayed return of bowel function requiring total parenteral nutrition.\nApproximately 6 weeks later, he presented to our emergency department with fever, leukocytosis, abdominal discomfort, and multiple episodes of emesis. He remained hemodynamically stable, but his stoma had prolapsed at least 25-30 cm and appeared edematous and dark red distally (). He was taken to the operating room where further examination of the stoma demonstrated approximately 40 cm of prolapse. The mucocutaneous junction of the prolapsed portion was dissected to delineate anatomy (). The mucosa was noted to be edematous and abnormal.

He had done well until October 2016 when he presented with a five day history of fevers, chills and abdominal pain. On physical examination, a new 2/6 early-mid peaking systolic murmur was appreciated at the right upper sternal border. Six of six blood culture bottles were positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis and he was treated with vancomycin, gentamicin and rifampin for endocarditis while undergoing further evaluation.\nCT scan of the abdomen and pelvis noted a large splenic infarct consistent with a septic embolus. Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated 1.8 \u00d7 0.9 cm2 vegetation on the prosthetic aortic valve with a large aortic root abscess. After confirming the diagnosis of endocarditis, surgery was scheduled for the next day given hemodynamic stability and the patients\u2019 strong personal preference to delay surgery in order for family to be present despite understanding the risks of continued septic embolization.\nOn the morning of surgery, the patient complained of acute, severe chest discomfort and was diaphoretic and pale. EKG demonstrated new ST depressions in V1\u2013V4 (Fig. ). CT coronary angiography was considered, however, given an evolving acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the decision was made to proceed for emergent coronary angiography, understanding the risks of possible iatrogenic embolization, but the benefit of rapid revascularization. The time to revascularization following lesion identification on CT and subsequent re-operative cardiac surgery was felt to be time prohibitive. Angiography revealed a 100% left circumflex ostial occlusion (Fig. ). The saphenous vein to the diagonal graft was widely patent and no additional lesions were identified.

She had tripped over her dog and landed on her left side. NF-1 had been diagnosed clinically in childhood. She had a histologically proven neurofibroma excised from her right forearm four years previously. She had a strong family history of NF-1, her mother and three second degree relatives exhibited clinical features.\nOn examination, we saw that her left leg was shortened, internally rotated, and adducted. There was decreased range of movement. She had diffuse swelling of her left lower limb with a distinct soft tissue mass above her right lateral malleolus. She had six caf\u03b2-au-lait patches on her trunk and bilateral axillary freckling. A radiograph of the pelvis revealed a superior dislocation of her left hip with an abnormal appearing femoral neck (Figure ).\nHer hip was relocated under general anaesthetic and this was maintained with skin traction. A computed tomography (CT) of her pelvis displayed a smooth erosion of the lateral margin of her left ileum and femoral neck, markedly increased femoral neck offset, a concave abnormality superior to the left acetabulum and thinning of the left inferior pubic ramus. These changes, which appeared to be long standing, were accepted to be a result of a local neurofibroma causing bone erosion. Eight days post-operatively she experienced a sudden onset of left hip pain on attempting to move in bed. A radiograph of her hip revealed repeat dislocation. Relocation of her hip was performed under general anaesthetic and balanced skeletal traction was maintained by inserting a pin to her left proximal tibia.

A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a right atrial mass close to the RA-IVC junction. A transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed the presence of a pedunculated right atrial mobile bilobular mass measuring 2.1 \u00d7 1.8 cm, not arising from the interatrial septum with extension into the inferior vena cava (Figures \u2013). A secundum atrial septal defect was also identified. The patient was referred to cardiac surgery for resection of a presumed right atrial myxoma given the possibility of embolization. The intraoperative TEE suggested the presence of one bilobulated mass arising low in the right atrium.\nUsing aortic and bicaval cannulation, a right atriotomy was performed and a discrete 2 \u00d7 3 cm mass was removed from the IVC-RA junction near the Eustachian valve. The right atrium was closed and the patient weaned from bypass. The specimen did not appear to be a myxoma, so it was sent for frozen section and interpreted as being ectopic liver tissue. In the interim, a repeat TEE showed an additional discrete 2 \u00d7 2 cm mass in the IVC near the hepatic veins. Femoral venous cannulation was then performed to allow for visualization of the IVC below the pericardial reflection. Through the same right atriotomy and using additional suction directly in the IVC, the IVC mass was visualized and resected.

    "original_text": "A 28 year-old male was found to have a slightly increased serum creatinine (1.7 mg/dl) during the admission to ER because of abdominal pain. Since both his past medical history and an abdominal ultrasound performed on admission were unremarkable he was discharged with the indication to see a Nephrologist. At the Nephrology outpatient clinic, because of the reduced eGFR and of the presence of proteinuria (300 mg/24 h), an hospitalization for further investigations was planned.\nWhile waiting for the admission, a couple of weeks later, the patient was admitted to the emergency room in another hospital for abdominal pain and dyspnea. On admittance the ECG tracing performed showed sinus rhythm with diffuse repolarization abnormalities. Further exams revealed an increase of troponin (54 ng/ml) and transaminases levels (GOT 50 U/L; GPT 125 U/L) and a cardiac ultrasound showed a severe left ventricular dysfunction with right heart failure.

His past medical history was unremarkable. On physical examination, a nontender, firm mass measuring 2 cm was palpable in the right inguinal area and the right ankle pulse was not palpable. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured as 0.57 on the right side and 1.13 on the left side. Duplex ultrasonography revealed a cystic lesion that was compressing the common femoral artery (). Computed tomography (CT) revealed a cystic lesion located superomedially to the right common femoral artery causing severe stenosis (). Magnetic resonance imaging also showed the cystic lesion and its communication with the right hip joint ().\nPreoperatively, a GC of the hip joint was suspected and an elective operation was performed. A longitudinal incision was made to the right groin, and the common femoral artery and surrounding tissue were dissected carefully. However, dissection of the arterial wall to the lesion was impossible, and we suspected ACD of the femoral artery at this point.

The entire length of the cyst (4 cm) was inspected through a longitudinal incision, the cyst was excised, and the connection to the hip joint was ligated. After excision of the cyst, we observed the medial layer of the femoral artery without any overlying adventitia, and we decided to insert an interposition graft with a prosthetic graft because of the friability of the remaining arterial wall and a small diameter of the saphenous vein.

She had noticed a lump in her left breast in 2011, which she ignored, which was later diagnosed as carcinoma of the breast in 2015. She opted for Siddha medicine for carcinoma of the breast, which she took for 12 months starting January 2016. She developed oral ulcerations and bilateral pedal edema 9 months after initiation of the treatment. On evaluation, she was detected to have proteinuria (dipstick 3+) and microscopic hematuria (6\u20138 red blood cells/high power field). The laboratory results at presentation are shown in . Renal biopsy showed 20 glomeruli that were enlarged and there was mild increase in mesangial cellularity with underlying patent capillaries and uniformly thickened capillary basement membrane (BM). Eight glomeruli showed segmental endothelial proliferation with infiltration by numerous neutrophils (). Few glomeruli showed segmental sclerosis and one showed partial fibroepithelial crescent (). Immunofluorescence staining showed peripheral fine granular deposits of IgG and C3c and minimal C1q in the glomeruli. Electron microscopy (EM) study showed uniformly thickened BM and subepithelial electron dense deposits () and no electron dense deposits elsewhere, which was consistent with MN.\nBased on our previous experience with the index case, we suspected mercury poisoning causing MN, which was confirmed by the presence of very high levels of mercury in the urine (). The patient received oral prednisolone, which was discontinued after 2 weeks in view of intolerance and uncertainty about the efficacy of steroid in mercury-induced MN. She was initiated on Dimaval at a dose of 300 mg/day and the dose was increased to 400 mg/day, which was well tolerated. She received a total of 12 g of Dimaval over 6 weeks.

Initial complete blood count (CBC) revealed a hemoglobin of 7 g/dL and he was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells prior to transfer to our institution. On arrival, CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis showed multiple dense, heterogeneous masses throughout the liver with associated perihepatic and intraperitoneal hemorrhage and areas of tumor blush were noted but no extravasation was seen to suggest active hemorrhage. There was also multiple enlarged periportal and upper mesenteric lymph nodes, likely representing metastatic adenopathy. There were no lesions present on the pancreas. CT chest was obtained and showed no evidence of intrathoracic metastatic disease. Initial blood work revealed normal liver function tests, appropriate response in hemoglobin to transfusion and negative viral hepatitis panel. Tumor markers revealed AFP elevation to 8705 ng/mL, normal Carcinoembryonic Antigen and Cancer Antigen 19-9. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis showed multiple lesions throughout the liver with targetoid appearance. There was no evidence of cirrhosis and these lesions did not have imaging characteristics of typical HCC (Figure ). It was suspected the multifocal liver lesions were HCC given the elevated AFP. However, the MRI was not consistent with HCC and a liver biopsy was obtained. Pathology results were consistent with poorly differentiated, large cell-type neuroendocrine carcinoma with metastatic disease to the liver (Figure ).

She started complaining of neck and shoulder pain at the age of 58 years and had been on physiotherapy and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs intake for pain control. However, at the age of 61 years, the pain worsened, and she became unable to lie down in a supine position. She had difficulty in gazing upwards at the age of 64 years. She could not keep a horizontal gaze and felt difficulty in opening her mouth because of her chin on chest position at the age of 65 years. At this point, she was diagnosed as AS at the municipal hospital and was referred to our institute for further treatment of the cervical deformity. She had no preexisting medical history, but her mother had been diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis.\nThe patient\u2019s neck was fixed on flexion position and was slightly rotated to the right. She could not look in front without extending her trunk. The range of mouth opening was severely restricted to approximately 2 cm because her chest was disturbing her jaw movement. She had difficulty in taking in solid food. Her upper and lower extremities had full muscle strength but had slightly restricted range of motion. She had no apparent neurologic symptoms, based on the normal deep tendon reflexes and the absence of sensory disturbances.\nA genetic test was positive for HLA-B52 and B62 but negative for HLA-B27, one of the representative genes for AS. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry showed osteoporosis with T score of -4.2 at L2\u20134 and -3.3 at the femoral neck.

When he fell, the horse lost balance and fell on him, crushing his groin. His past history showed he was diabetic. His heart rate (HR) was 90 beats/min and blood pressure (BP) was 50/0 mmHg. Bruising, swelling, and distention were seen in the right groin on inspection. A large pulsatile hematoma in the right groin was palpated. There was a right lower quadrant tenderness, and no rebound tenderness or guarding (). The ankle pulses were palpable and there were no edema and ischemic changes in the lower extremities. His hemoglobin level was 10.2 g/dL on admission but decreased 1 hour later to 6.7 g/dL. After rapid transfusion of five units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) and five units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) through a central venous catheter, his vital signs stabilized. His BP was 95/50 mmHg and his HR was 90 beats/min. An emergency computed tomography angiogram showed a hematoma in the right inguinal and femoral region, and active bleeding of the iliac or femoral artery was confirmed.

Therefore, we decided to perform an emergent endovascular procedure for rapid hemostasis under general anesthesia with C-arm. We directly punctured the left CFA and inserted a catheter to the right external iliac artery in a crossover approach. Active bleeding of the iliac artery was not seen on the intraoperative angiogram, but extravasation of the contrast media was confirmed in the femoral artery.

Nine years later, when she attended the clinic, a physical exam was undertaken that revealed a firm and rounded palpable mass at the left frontal bone ().\nOn neurological exam, the patient had no focal signs. She had normal mental status and vital signs. She was conscious, and her pupillary reflex to light was normal, as were the muscular force, the deep tendon reflexes, and her sensibility. The computed tomography (CT) scan of her head showed a left frontal bone a protrusion ().\nThe CT scan also showed an underlying hypoattenuating, supratentorial lesion in the left frontal lobe and interhemispheric space, which was oval in shape with regular and well-defined borders, suggesting an arachnoid cyst that did not cause a shift in the midline structures when the left frontal lobe was compressed ().\nThe patient was operated on under general anesthesia in the supine position with her head in a neutral position. After the cranium was shaved and cleaned of hair, a bi-temporal incision was made. The underlying tissues were cut in a normal fashion until the left frontal bone deformity was revealed, which had a lilac color (). Six burr holes were made surrounding the deformity (). The bone dust was collected and the bridges between the holes were eliminated with a Gigli saw. A concave\u2013convex bone flap was lifted, which revealed the arachnoid cyst (). The cyst membrane and 20 mL of the intracystic fluid (collected with a syringe) were sent for histological examination.

She also suffered from severe right foot pain because of limb ischemia related to systemic sclerosis. She had a history of systemic sclerosis that was diagnosed 30 years earlier and was classified as having limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis. Cutaneous fibrosis was limited to her hands without involvement of her head or neck. There was no family history of any neuromuscular disease. One month before visiting our hospital she developed right foot gangrene. Although she had Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon and ulcerations in her fingers, she had had no symptom in her foot before she had gangrene. Pain in her right foot was so severe that she used tramadol and NSAIDs as painkillers. She began to complain of DHS as her foot pain worsened. She had difficulty in keeping her head straight and her gaze forward. Clinical examination revealed severe weakness of her neck extensor muscles. Her neck deformity was flexible and easily corrected passively (Fig. a). There were no neurological abnormalities including sensory disturbance or muscle weakness in her extremities. Plain radiographs of her cervical spine revealed only mild degenerative changes and severe cervical kyphosis (Fig. ). Cervical magnetic resonance imaging showed no spinal canal stenosis and no abnormal signal change in the cervical paraspinal muscles. Computed tomographic angiography showed occlusion of bilateral anterior tibial arteries and peroneal arteries, and development of collaterals. Despite intensive conservative therapy including alprostadil, argatroban, and sarpogrelate, lower extremity ischemia progressed. Therefore, we decided to amputate her leg below the knee under general anesthesia. Her postoperative course was uneventful. Her severe foot pain was markedly resolved after the surgery. At the postoperative follow-up visit 3 weeks after surgery, her DHS was significantly attenuated (Fig. b). Her forward vision and neck pain were markedly improved.\nThe feature of the present patient was attenuation of her DHS after pain relief by amputation of her severely ischemic limb.",

She also reported the pain was worse before her monthly menstrual cycle but that sexual activity did not affect her discomfort. Sometimes, the discomfort was intense and would wake her from sleep causing severe discomfort and resulting in difficulty sitting; walking would relieve her symptoms partially. She was better in the morning, but the symptoms appeared again at end of the day. She had multiple gynecology and dermatology consults with no relief or clear diagnosis. She was prescribed antifungal creams, including fluconazole and ketoconazole, topical steroids (betamethasone and hydrocortisone), and mefenamic acid for pain relief. All failed to bring relief. She also consulted a homeopathy practitioner, who labeled her as suffering from a chronic skin disease and prescribed oral and topical medication. She took it for a few months but stopped it due to lack of relief. Ultimately, due to the distress and anguish associated with the condition, lack of response to various treatments, and social embarrassment, she stopped visiting doctors for some time.

    "original_text": "Our patient was a two-month-old male referred for evaluation of a left postauricular mass, present since birth. Workup by the patient's pediatrician including an ultrasound suggested a cystic mass prompting referral for surgical excision. The parents endorsed noticing the lesion at birth and that it had been painless and slowly progressive. Physical exam demonstrated a firm 2 \u00d7 2 cm subcutaneous lesion of the postauricular region. An MRI was obtained demonstrating a 2.3 \u00d7 1.4 \u00d7 2.2 cm well-defined solid mass involving the outer table of the right temporal bone and temporoparietal suture with intense peripheral enhancement and without restricted diffusion (). Initial resection in the operating room was undertaken, and a deep plane between the mass and skull was identified and followed reflecting the lesion off of the skull. Unfortunately, pathology demonstrated focal presence of tumor cells at the peripheral margin. The patient underwent a repeat resection, with a canal wall up mastoidectomy. The lesion was again resected en bloc, and the underlying cortical bone was drilled down to the inner table of the temporal bone with healthy appearing bone stock. Despite clinically normal-appearing bone, the pathology again demonstrated presence of tumor cells at the soft tissue margins, and clinically the patient demonstrated significant regrowth of the lesion. The patient returned to the operating room once more, with a fairly impressive progression of gross tumor, nearly 2.5 \u00d7 2.0 cm (). A revision mastoidectomy was performed, and neurosurgical consultation was obtained. The mass was excised en bloc resulting in a full-thickness craniectomy. The dura appeared healthy and unaffected by the tumor (). The wound was closed primarily, and the patient was observed overnight in the PICU before being discharged home postoperative day one in stable condition.

Abdominal CT revealed an 8 cm left renal growth suggestive of neoplasia, with the involvement of the tail of the pancreas, tumor thrombus in the left renal vein and multiple left para-aortic adenopathies (). A biopsy was performed and showed to be inconclusive regarding the possibility of renal cell carcinoma. Radical left nephrectomy with distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy was proposed.\nThe procedure (Video 1 in Supplementary data) started with an extensive Cattel-Braasch Maneuver, allowing exposure of the inferior vena cava and the aorta, and thus isolation of the left renal vessels. The tail of the pancreas and spleen were freed, and a no-touch approach [] was adopted to minimize the spread of tumor cells with proximal splenic vein ligation. Caudal splenopancreatectomy was performed with section of the pancreas with a GIA 80 (vascular load), followed by proximal ligation and section of the splenic artery and what was thought to be the left renal artery (). The junction of the left renal vein with the vena cava was opened, and the tumor thrombus was resected, followed by caval suture. The renal vessels were, at this point, presumably controlled. The nephrectomy was continued with the release of the kidney and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, during which only the stump of the left renal vein could be identified, lacking the previously ligated renal artery stump. The renal artery was located inside the mass of lymph node tissue in the left para-aortic space, and the stump belonged to the superior mesenteric artery, ligated flush with the aorta. There was no arterial pulse in the mesentery confirming the injury. After removing the specimen, the distal stump of the superior mesenteric artery was exposed, and a repair with a terminoterminal anastomosis was performed from the proximal stump of the splenic artery ().
