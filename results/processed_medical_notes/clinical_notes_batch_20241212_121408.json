He had been seizure-free for the past year with an enteric-coated delayed release formulation of VPA (375 mg every 8 hours). Thirty days prior to hospital admission, he was started on LTG 25 mg/day along with VPA, since his seizures were no longer under control with VPA. Two weeks later, the dose was increased (50 mg/day). His morning trough plasma VPA level was measured before LTG was added to the therapy yielding a concentration of 85 mg/L. On admission, he presented macular lesions on the front of the thorax that extend to the back, followed by bilateral eyelid edema and ulcerated lesions at the level of lips, jugal mucosa, and pharynx. He developed erythematosus conjunctivitis with ulcers. He presented skin rash with high fever (39\u00b0C) and respiratory failure type I. History revealed that no such lesions occurred earlier and that was the first time such rashes have occurred. Other personal and family history was not relevant. From a dermatologic point of view and based on the history and clinical presentation, a diagnosis of SJS was made. Since the presumptive cause was LTG, the drug was discontinued immediately. Soon after the patient admission, periofocal and ocular involvement worsened. Intravenous immunoglobulin was administered for 48 hours. Mouth care (oral washes with sodium borate) and eye care (tobramycin ophthalmic drops) were also indicated.\nFrom a hemodynamic point of view, four hours after admission, his condition deteriorated and he developed septic shock with peripheral circulatory failure. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with intravenous fluids and antibacterial therapy due to skin infection by Staphylococcus aureus. In addition to fluid resuscitation, dopamine was administered. Despite the inotropic treatment, the patient's condition did not improve, indicating a septic shock refractory to conventional vasopressor",

Both vertebral arteries were showed tortuous, looped medially each other on the posterolateral surface of the cord, and spinal cord was compressed by them. First, right side arachnoid membrane around VA was dissected and excised dentate ligament to release VA from spinal cord. And then anchoring suture from VA to the arachnoid membrane and dentate ligament was made using 6-0 nylon. And then Teflon sponge was inserted to the space between VA and the spinal cord for microvascular decompression. Same procedure was performed to left VA and enough decompression was achieved.

On immunohistochemical examination, the tumor was positive for estrogen receptor (ER) but was borderline (2+) for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that the tumor cells were negative for HER2 amplification. The patient was treated via neoadjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, followed by paclitaxel. After the chemotherapy, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the tumor was still present in patchy areas. Therefore, we performed modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection for the left breast cancer. Histological analysis revealed that most of the mammary tissue was hyalinized, due to the effect of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and only a few viable carcinoma cells were present. The postsurgical histological diagnosis was scirrhous carcinoma of the left breast that had metastasized to seven lymph nodes in the axillary region (). The cancer cells were positive for ER, partially positive for progesterone receptor (PgR), and negative for HER2 expression (1+). Therefore, we started tamoxifen therapy after the surgery, with radiation (50 Gy) of the entire affected area.\nAt 8 months after the surgery, the patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy for a general health check-up.

Postpartum, a pulmonary systolic murmur was detected during a routine clinical exam. An echocardiogram was performed and showed the presence of a tumor in the right ventricle. The baby was kept under supervision. Her hemodynamic parameters remained stable and presented no symptoms, hence, she was discharged. Nine days later, while the baby was being breastfed, she had a presyncopal episode, shortness of breath and grunting. All of which suddenly resolved after a few minutes. She was brought to the emergency room where she had a second episode.\nDuring examination, her oxygen saturation was 24% in room air. She was resuscitated with mask and balloon until she stabilized and was subsequently hospitalized. The intensivist decided to do a cardiac and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when a third presyncopal episode occurred on the table. She was resuscitated for a second time with success. An echocardiogram was performed and for the first time, it showed cyclic complete obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract. The recorded echocardiogram is shown in Additional file : Video S1.\nFurthermore, the MRI showed a mobile and large mass in the right ventricle which measured 13 mm \u00d7 9 mm. The mass was attached to the baso septum of the right ventricle and moved completely to the pulmonary trunk during systole. Pulmonary artery flow measurements showed the presence of pulmonary insufficiency. We observed a patent foramen oval (PFO) and a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), both of which had right to left shunts.

In his initial assessment, he was hemodynamically stable and no visceral or cerebral injuries were diagnosed. X-rays revealed an L2 vertebral fracture, a right scapula fracture, and a right acetabular posterior wall fracture. Since the scapular fracture was non-displaced, conservative treatment was considered. The L2 vertebral fracture was unstable, and thus surgical treatment was planned. On the other hand, the posterior acetabular wall fracture was minimally displaced and, based on the patient\u2019s multiple trauma and the morbidities of prolonged bed rest, arthroscopic fixation of the posterior wall was planned. The patient was informed, and consent was obtained for the surgery and scientific purposes.\nUnder general anesthesia, posterior short-segment instrumentation and fusion for the L2 vertebral fracture were performed and the patient was subsequently taken to the fracture table in the supine position. Traction was applied to distract the hip joint and to reduce the fracture fragment properly. After the establishment of the standard anterolateral (AL) portal, the anterior and the posterolateral (PL) portals were established under direct visualization. Hemarthrosis was drained and the joint was irrigated. After obtaining a clear view, small chondral free particles and labral small tears were observed and they were debrided from the joint (Figure ). The capsulotomy was only performed between the AL and PL portals to avoid extravasation and instability. Care was also taken to maintain low intra-articular pressure (30-35 mm Hg) in order to prevent fluid leakage. The posterior labrum was left intact but detached from the capsule to reach the extra-articular surface of the posterior wall.

He was aware of coughing 6 months previously and had a headache 3 weeks ago, so he visited our hospital. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple brain tumors in the bilateral cerebellum and cerebrum (Fig. ). Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a 15-mm nodular shadow in the middle lobe of his left lung, and he was referred to our Department of Respiratory Medicine (Fig. a). He was admitted for further examination because he was suspected of having lung cancer with brain metastases. There was no special mention in his medical history; there was no alcohol drinking or tobacco smoking history. On physical examination, his body temperature was 36.7 \u00b0C, his blood pressure was 122/78 mmHg, his pulse was 56 beats per minute, and his respiratory rate was 12 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation was 98% in room air. Lung and bronchial sounds were normal. Head, eyes, and nose examinations were unremarkable. His neck had no lymphadenopathy. An examination of his heart, abdomen, and extremities showed no abnormalities. Blood test findings revealed elevation of tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC). On day 4 after admission, bronchoscopy was performed. The histology at bronchoscopy for the middle lobe of his left lung is shown in Fig. . Adenocarcinoma cells exhibiting a papillary pattern were found, and he was diagnosed as having papillary adenocarcinoma of the left lung according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, 4th edition. His adenocarcinoma was positive for ALK according to immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method (Fig. ).

She was a housewife and had no history of tobacco smoking or consuming alcohol. A physical examination at the time of presentation was not significant except for right costovertebral angle tenderness. Her heart rate was 96 beats per minute and blood pressure was 155/90 mmHg. The findings of laboratory tests, which were complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, and urine analysis, were within normal range and they did not help us find the etiology of her right flank pain. Abdominal screening with computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass on her right kidney, which was considered a primary renal cell carcinoma and she underwent a right nephrectomy. Unexpectedly, PTC metastasis was diagnosed from demonstrative histopathological findings, such as positive immunoperoxidase staining for thyroglobulin (Tg). After further examinations of her thyroid and neck with ultrasonography (USG), a total thyroidectomy was performed. Pathological examination of thyroid tissue revealed a 5 cm tumor with capsular invasion and a strong positive immunoperoxidase staining of cytokeratin-19, HBME-1, and galectin-3. She was diagnosed as having metastatic PTC. Orally administered levothyroxine 75 mcg daily was initiated in addition to the metformin 1000 mg twice daily and amlodipine 10 mg daily treatments she received prior to PTC diagnosis. Postoperative serum Tg was above 300 ng/ml and anti-Tg was negative. Afterward, she was screened with unenhanced thoracic CT and skeletal scintigraphy. They revealed bilateral multiple nodules in her lungs and bone metastasis on T10 vertebra and right sacroiliac joint.

He was a current smoker with a 45-year history of smoking 2 packs of cigarettes per day. He had no past medical history except for pulmonary tuberculosis two years prior. On physical examination, the sound of his right lung was decreased with crackles but he did not have lymphadenopathy or weight loss. Laboratory findings were unremarkable except that the pulmonary function test revealed a moderately obstructive lung defect. Chest X-ray showed reactivation of pulmonary tuberculosis in the upper lung field and a round mass shadow in the mid-tracheal area (). A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 2.2 cm-sized homogenous mass originating from the left lateral inner wall of the trachea, and active pulmonary tuberculosis with cavitation in the right upper lobe and in the superior segment of the right lower lobe (). Flexible bronchoscopy revealed a broad-based, polypoid mass obstructing 75% of the lumen in the left lateral wall. The mass was 5 cm above the carina, without endobronchial lesion (). We decided to surgically remove the lesion after initial management for pulmonary tuberculosis since airway obstrucion could occur during the bronchoscopic procedure owing to rich vascularity on the tumor surface.\nThe patient underwent right thoracotomy with segmental resection and end-to-end anastomosis. Four tracheal rings were excised along with the tumor. The excised tumor appeared as a single well-demarcated solid, polypoid mass, measuring 2\u00d72 cm in size. The mass was completely covered by intact mucosa without any visible sign of hemorrhage or necrosis. On microscopic examination, the mass was composed of epithelial and myoepithelial cells in the chondromyxoid stroma (). There was no definitive cellular pleomorphism and mitotic figures.

She had not been routinely seen by any providers until this recurrence. She underwent right neck dissection, but the mass was found to be adherent to the carotid artery and esophagus, precluding complete resection. Pathology again revealed PTC. This was followed by treatment with 150 mCi of 131I 2 months postoperatively with subsequent whole-body scan uptake in the thyroid bed without evidence of distant metastasis. She was offered adjuvant external beam radiation to the neck but declined.\nOne year later, CT of the neck revealed a heterogeneously enhancing and partially necrotic mass within the right thyroidectomy bed extending posteriorly to the esophagus and involving the right recurrent laryngeal nerve. The mass measured 2.2 \u00d7 3.0 \u00d7 2.8 cm in its respective anterior-posterior, transverse, and craniocaudal dimensions. She was referred to our institution for surgical resection and underwent right radical neck dissection and wide local excision of the neck mass, though it was noted that residual tumor plaque on the carotid and trachea were unable to be fully resected.\nPathology revealed components of both classic PTC and SMECE. There was also a background of lymphocytic thyroiditis, and the tumor involved all margins, indicating that the tumor likely arose from a thyroid remnant. Upon immunohistochemistry, both PTC and SMECE stained positive for CK AE1/AE3 and negative for calcitonin. The PTC component stained positive for thyroglobulin, whereas SMECE was negative (Fig. ).

The examinations of cerebellar, ganglionic, and cortico-spinal pathways were all normal. The results of all of these neurological examinations were within normal limits and suggested that our patient did not have any symptoms of neurological disturbance.

The patient's childhood and adolescent development was normal. He was a good student and an active soccer player in high school. His social skills were standard, and he had no family history of mental illness. When he was 23 years old and a fourth year university student, he became convinced that he was being observed and he withdrew from social activities. His parents brought him to a psychiatric hospital, and he was diagnosed with schizophrenia according to DSM-IV-TR (). The prescribed medication worked well and he was able to graduate from university at 27 years old. After graduating, he worked part time in a convenience store or at a nursery for several years. He then started to work at a distribution business under a handicapped employment program. His father committed suicide 3 years before he first presented at our hospital and a friend also died from a sickness. Because his auditory hallucinations repeatedly told him that he was responsible for their deaths, he could not stop blaming himself for their passing, in spite of his mother and brother telling him that he was not responsible. He was pessimistic about his future partly because he was able to earn only a meager income. In order to increase his income, he started a second part-time job at a supermarket in addition to his distribution job. He slept less and felt the accumulation of fatigue.

A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the lower extremities revealed a well-defined multicystic mass arising from the distal metaphyseal region of the left fibula (Figure ).\nThe mass was subjected to a core needle biopsy and subsequent histological evaluation of the biopsy specimen revealed a collection of hypercellular, spindle polygonal cells with an abundance of osteoclastic giant cells; which provided the tissue diagnosis of an osteosarcoma. Following this diagnosis, the patient presented to our clinical setting for further management. He underwent surgical excision of the tumor followed by the placement of a vascularized fibular bone graft.

There was tenderness at the posterior aspect of the knee, and no deficit was found in the neurovascular system. The knee was stable under varus and valgus stress, and the result of the anterior drawer test at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion was negative. Posterior tibial sag was apparent, and the posterior drawer test with the knee flexed at 90\u00b0 revealed a grade III instability (approximately 12 mm of posterior translation) with a soft endpoint. Radiographs revealed fractures of the posterior intercondylar eminence and the lateral tibial condyle (Fig. ). The positions and sizes of the displaced fracture fragments were verified using computed tomography (CT) (Figs. and ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee revealed that the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), collateral ligaments, and both meniscuses were intact. The appearance of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) was consistent with that of a PCL avulsion fracture at the tibial insertion, and the lateral tibial condyle was avulsed anterosuperiorly without disruption of the articular cartilage (Fig. ).\nArthroscopic examination revealed that the ACL, both meniscuses, collateral ligaments, and popliteal tendon were intact; the substance of the PCL was loose but not ruptured, and the cartilage surface of the lateral tibial condyle was not",

Previous history included no medications, distal left lower extremity venous thrombophlebitis 2 months prior, status post laparoscopic gastric Roux-en-Y bypass (for obesity and diabetes mellitus which had been untreated and resolved postoperatively) three years prior to presentation and a left ulnar nerve decompression nine years prior. Physical examination revealed no palpable lymphadenopathy, a fullness in the left upper quadrant and fecal occult blood positive stool. Laboratory studies showed a serum hemoglobin of 6 mg/dl. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed a 24 cm left upper quadrant mass with multiple liver lesions, splenomegaly and a 1 cm mass in the spleen (Fig. ). A laparoscopic liver biopsy was performed and histopathology was initially reported as hepatocellular carcinoma versus hepatoid carcinoma. One month later, serum hemoglobin was 4.4 mg/dl and gross melena was seen. Blood transfusions did not resolve the anemia. Serum albumin was decreased to 1.7 g/dl.\nThe patient underwent gastrectomy, splenectomy, distal pancreatectomy and resection of small bowel and a portion of colon that were adherent to the tumor mass. At the end of surgery, there was no gross tumor remaining except for the previously identified liver metastases. Pathology showed a tumor that originated in the pancreas with direct extension to the small bowel, colon, and stomach. The resected specimen weighed 3500 g and the spleen measured 14x7x10cm (Fig. ). On cut section, the spleen contained a 1.0 cm lesion consistent with a metastasis, which was then confirmed to be a metastatic lesion on histopathologic evaluation (Fig. ).\nThe final pathology report showed a pNET, well differentiated, stage T4N0M1 with 0/13 lymph nodes containing tumor.

In her surgical history, she underwent transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma at the age of 40, with replacement therapy with levothyroxine at a dose of 100 mcg per day. The patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus at the age of 29 and has been treated since then with long-acting insulin. She also has a diagnosis of CKD in treatment with automated peritoneal dialysis from 47 years of age. A living-donor kidney transplant protocol was initiated, related to her sister (healthy 39-year-old woman), with whom she shares one haplotype and specific negative anti-donor antibodies.\nThe induction scheme was performed with basiliximab and methylprednisolone, with a cold ischemia time of 120 minutes. During surgery, arterial anastomosis was observed with progressive decrease of the thrill. For this reason, it was necessary to dismantle the anastomosis followed by exploration, observation, and discharge of a thrombus from the renal artery. The anastomosis was completed with adequate graft perfusion. The renal biopsy at time zero was without significant vascular, glomerular, and interstitial tubule alterations (Figures \u2013). After surgery, the patient remained in oligoanuria. A Doppler ultrasound of the graft was performed, which showed the renal artery throughout its course with high resistance pulsatile flow, with an average systolic flow velocity of 58.7 cm/second and inversion of the diastolic flow. The segmental, interlobar, and arcuate arteries in the upper, lower, and middle poles showed decreased systolic flow with an average of 34.1 cm/second.

The body mass index of patient was 22.3 kg/m2, and she had no medical history of vascular disease, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The patient had smoked a half of pack per day for 15 years. She was placed in the lithotomy position during operation, and the intermittent pneumatic compression device was placed on the lower extremities. The operation lasted 6 hours 45 minutes under general anesthesia. The patients' vital sign was stable throughout the operation. The estimated blood loss was 300 mL and hemoglobin level was 13.2 g/dL at the beginning of the operation and 11.8 g/dL postoperatively. During operation, there was no specific finding. In the recovery room after surgery, the patient complained of pain, tenderness, and numbness in left lower leg, and the numeric rating scale for pain was 9 points. However, pulsation of the dorsal arteries of the feet was confirmed. Then computed tomography venography for evaluation of deep vein thrombosis was performed, and revealed low attenuation and suggested decreased perfusion in left calf muscle. However, there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis in both legs (). Then using the analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pethidine and patient controlled analgesia, the numeric rating scale was reduced from 9 to 2 points. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for closed observation without any procedure. On the first postoperative day, left lower leg pain was persistent. Computed tomography angiography for evaluation of lower extremity thromboembolism was performed.

There were no deficits in motor function affecting the right hand. The patient reported no medical antecedents, apart from an apparent ganglion of his right wrist.\nPhysical examination revealed a soft, non-tender, subcutaneous 2 \u00d7 1 cm mass over the volar aspect of the right wrist with no atrophy of the thenar eminence. Altered sensation in the distribution of the median nerve of the right hand was detected by static two point discrimination and the use of the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test. Tinel's sign and Phalen's test were both positive. Somatic examination did not reveal any signs of neurofibromatosis or lymph node tumefaction.\nNerve conduction studies inferred a reduction in median nerve conduction at the wrist. Radiographs of the hand and wrist did not show any ectopic calcifications or bony abnormalities. The MRI scan revealed an 18.5 \u00d7 9.7 mm volar mass within the carpal tunnel which was initially thought to be a ganglion cyst compressing the median nerve (Figures and ). On the basis of this surgical exploration and decompression was recommended.\nUnder general anaesthetic, a longitudinal incision was made at the wrist. After dividing the transverse carpal ligament a grossly enlarged median nerve was observed. To facilitate exploration, the incision was extended up to the middle of the forearm and distally into the palm. The nerve was yellow and pink with longitudinal fatty streaks within the nerve fibres. These fatty streaks extended from the distal third of the forearm to the distal edge of the carpal tunnel (Figure ).

    "original_text": "A 20-year-old woman presented with a five-week history of otalgia, ear discharge, and deafness. There were no additional systemic symptoms or signs. Audiometry showed bilateral conductive hearing loss. She initially received antibiotics; however due to severe otalgia, she had bilateral myringotomies with grommet insertion without improvement. CT and MRI revealed fluid in the middle ear clefts and mastoid cells bilaterally. Blood tests showed a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 50 mg/l, normal full blood count, renal and liver function tests, and a negative ANCA. Urinalysis was negative. Oral prednisolone 60 mg daily resulted in some symptomatic improvement. Seven weeks later, she developed a left lower motor facial nerve palsy and reduced sensation in the middle third of her face. Repeat MRI showed bilateral middle ear inflammation but no additional intracranial abnormalities. Further oral steroids again improved her symptoms. Nasal and middle ear biopsies revealed evidence of a necrotising inflammatory process, but no features of infection.\nFurther oral prednisolone improved the clinical symptoms with some subjective improvement in the facial weakness and general well-being, and reduction in CRP. Reducing steroids to 20 mg resulted in deterioration of symptoms, with increasing facial and ear pain plus a rise in CRP. With this further deterioration despite corticosteroids, a decision was taken to escalate therapy and she received cyclophosphamide with methylprednisolone plus cotrimoxazole, with slow improvement noted in her left ear hearing, clinical symptoms, and CRP. After three pulses, a CT scan of her lungs was requested to investigate a persistent cough. Despite normal repeat chest radiographs, cavitating lung lesions consistent with a diagnosis of WG were demonstrated.

She was scheduled for hemireplacement arthroplasty. She had not sustained any head injury during the fall. She was a known diabetic on insulin therapy. Her past history revealed that prior to the valve replacement, she used to get breathless even while doing routine daily activities. Presently, she could climb two flights of stairs without any syncope, palpitations, fatigue, chest pain or breathlessness prior to the trauma. She was receiving oral warfarin 2 mg once daily.\nPhysical examination revealed her to be afebrile, with an irregularly irregular pulse-104 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute and blood pressure 160/86 mmHg. Her systemic examination did not reveal any pathology. Patient's electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 110 per minute. Her ECHO showed 54% ejection fraction, normally functioning valves, no paravalvular leak and confirmed absence of vegetations and clots. The chest X ray revealed ball in cage mitral valve prosthesis, an aortic prosthesis, sternotomy sutures and cardiomegaly (Fig ). Her preoperative laboratory evaluation reports are given in Table .\nWe advised the patient to discontinue warfarin for four days and started on unfractionated heparin 4000 IU subcutaneously 6th hourly. On the day of surgery, the last dose of heparin was administered 6 h prior to surgical incision and the coagulation studies prior to starting the surgery revealed PT 16 (patient) and 14 (control) with a INR 1.1, APTT 32 (patient) and 28 (control).

The amount of discharge was not related to the act of voiding. He lived with his grandmother, who had tried topical applications of native medications without much improvement. On clinical examination, he had a ring scar located at the midshaft of his penis. The scar did not appear to be constrictive. There was no change in skin coloration or texture and no alteration of sensation distal to the scar. He also had minimal exuberant granulation tissue on the dorsolateral aspects of the scar associated with very minimal purulent discharge (Figure ). There was a palpable dense periurethral induration beneath the scar. The bladder was not distended. His blood urea nitrogen, electrolytes and serum creatinine were normal. His retrograde urethrogram revealed a tight ring stricture in the middle third of his urethra (Figure ).\nAt surgery under general anesthesia, a hemostatic tourniquet was applied to the root of his penis. A degloving incision was made in his old circumcision scar and the penile skin was dissected off the corporeal bodies towards the base of the penis. At the site of the ring scar, an intact black hair thread tourniquet was seen encased in dense fibrous tissue and binding the penile skin to the corporeal bodies. The hair thread tourniquet was divided and removed (Figure ), and the penile skin sharply dissected off the corporeal bodies circumferentially at that location.

She felt discomfort with the disfigurement of gums which appeared un esthetic due to its more severity and there was bleeding and difficulty while chewing food.\nPast medical history revealed that she is under medication for hypertension with amlodipine (10 mg/day orally) for the last 2 years and 6 months. The amlodipine dose was increased to 50 mg/day orally and statins were prescribed due to the acute angina attack and hypercholesterolemia before 6 months of the dental visit.\nClinical examination was carried out by assessing the periodontal status by plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), Russel's periodontal index. The patients oral hygiene status revealed the presence of more amount of plaque and some amount of calculus on both anterior and posterior surfaces of the teeth due to the presence of new niches for accumulation of plaque and microorganisms. There was generalized bleeding on probing and generalized probing depths ranging from 3 to 8 mm with greatest depths in relation to mandibular anteriors.

He has suffered from ulcerative colitis for 2 years and taken oral mesalazine daily. He was also diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 6 months ago, and his blood sugar levels have been well controlled by metformin. There was no history of allergies to food or drugs. He fasted for more than 8 hours before surgery and was given no sedative or opioid premedication.\nWhen arriving at an operating room, the patient was monitored with an electrocardiogram, a non-invasive arterial blood pressure monitor and a pulse oximeter. Anesthesia was induced intravenously with thiopental sodium 350 mg, following preoxygenation with 100% oxygen. After confirming the loss of consciousness and self respiration, we mask-ventilate the patient with oxygen. Mask ventilation was performed without difficulty, and he did not show any signs of airway irritation including cough. Vecuronium 10 mg was given for neuromuscular block, and then fentanyl 100 \u00b5g was administered. After a few seconds after the injection of fentanyl, the patient began to cough suddenly and vigorously. Coughing has persisted for about 30 seconds until he vomited a large volume of greenish fluid around the face mask. His head was immediately turned to the left and head down tilt of the table was applied. When vomiting ceased, after suctioning of the oral cavity and oropharynx, endotracheal intubation was achieved. During this episode, the arterial oxygen saturation transiently decreased to 93%, but soon recovered to 98%. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and 50% oxygen in air.

He was unable to bear weight due to pain, and range of motion in his right hip was severely limited. He denied recent trauma or pain in other joints but had undergone routine dental cleaning one week prior to presentation. He had received 2 gm of amoxicillin immediately prior to his dental procedure. He presented afebrile, mildly hypotensive, and was noted to have exquisite tenderness with passive movement of the right leg and reduced range of motion secondary to pain. He had full range of motion and strength distally. He had a leukocytosis of 15,600 WBC per milliliter. Aspiration of right hip joint revealed cloudy fluid with WBC 68,000 cells per milliliter. The patient was resuscitated with IV fluids and started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. On the third hospital day, he underwent prosthetic joint drainage and washout with retention of liners. Joint aspirate culture grew Gram-positive cocci in chains, which we subsequently identified by matrix-assisted desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) as S. salivarius. We narrowed antibiotic therapy to ceftriaxone to complete six total weeks of intravenous therapy, after which he was treated with amoxicillin for additional six weeks.

Since electrocardiogram showed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and echocardiography showed a thrombus in the left atrium, she was admitted to receive treatment. Echocardiography also showed pericardial effusion and circumferential thickening of the left atrial wall. The thrombus in the left atrium revealed high echoic mass, while circumferential thickening of the left atrial wall revealed low echoic lesion in echocardiography. Thus, these two parts were completely different components. To examine active inflammation or malignancy for the thickened left atrial wall, gallium-67 scintigraphy was performed. The frontal planar image showed abnormal accumulation of radioisotope (RI) in the chest (). The single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) fusion images showed corresponding diffuse abnormal accumulation of RI in the thickened left atrial wall (), possibly suggesting active inflammation in the left atrial wall including acute myocarditis, sarcoidosis, or amyloidosis or malignant disease such as malignant lymphoma. However, clinical symptoms and subsequent general examination showed no findings suggestive of sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, or malignant lymphoma. As the patient had no increased white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level and had no symptoms other than palpitations, she was followed up without receiving specific treatment for the atrial lesion.\nAnticoagulant therapy for the thrombus in the left atrium resulted in its dissolution, and administration of a \u03b2-blocker for atrial fibrillation achieved favorable heart rate control. In the second gallium-67 scan 2 months after the first scintigraphy, the abnormal accumulation in the heart was no longer visible on the planar and SPECT/CT images (). Echocardiography showed no thickening of the left atrial wall. Regarding the cause of cardiac inflammation, acute myocarditis was considered because the serum antibody titer of cytomegalovirus was significantly elevated in a few weeks though endomyocardial biopsy was not done because the patient did not agree with it. She is now continuing follow-up check of atrial fibrillation in outpatient department.",

For the last several years he has had severe pain in the anterolateral aspect of the left arm, but denies any weakness or parasthesias. On physical examination, he demonstrates localized tenderness to palpation along the anterolateral aspect of the mid-humerus ~8\u201310 cm proximal to the lateral epicondyle.
