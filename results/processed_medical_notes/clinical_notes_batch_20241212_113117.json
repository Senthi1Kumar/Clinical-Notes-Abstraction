The patient was a smoker and a social alcohol drinker. However, his history of trauma to the lesion was unremarkable and he had no past medical history or family history of similar lesions or other skin diseases. Physical examination revealed an exophytic verrucous yellowish-to-whitish tumor measuring approximately 4 cm in diameter. The patient complained of mild tenderness on the lesion and the tumor was firm upon palpation. No lymphadenopathy was detected on the neck or sublingual area.\nMicroscopic examination of a punch biopsy specimen revealed an endophytic epidermal proliferation with bulbous and blunted projections composed of large well-differentiated squamous epithelial cells extending into the reticular dermis (). Cellular pleomorphism was minimal and mitotic activity was confined to the basal layer (). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with verrucous carcinoma. Carbon dioxide laser treatment was then performed following tumescent local anesthesia using lidocaine 0.2%.\nAfter 10 days, the wound was completely epithelialized. At this point, topical treatment with imiquimod was started, with application of cream to the washed and dried tumor surface and then washed off 12 hours after application 3 times per week. After 4 weeks of treatment, the verrucous plaques had decreased in size; however, formation of mild erythema and crust with oozing was observed on the tumor and the patient complained of local pain. Therefore, application of imiquimod was then stopped and the patient received oral administration of analgesics and topical application of antibiotics to the tumor. Over a 4-week period of treatment with analgesics and topical antibiotics, local pain, erythema, and crust slowly disappeared. At this point, administration of imiquimod was started again, with application of treatment 3 times per week over a period of 4 weeks. Treatment",

There was a 13.9 cm incidentally noted left renal mass concerning for renal cell carcinoma (). Upon further work-up, he was noted to have significant retroperitoneal and iliac lymphadenopathy, the largest measuring 6.4 cm (). He underwent a biopsy of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes in November 2018 which was consistent with metastatic poorly differentiated renal cell carcinoma (Figures \u2013). Based on a performance status of <80% and eventual system therapy within one year of diagnosis, he was considered to have an IMDC risk score of 2, and as such intermediate-risk disease. He was started on nivolumab (3 mg/kg IV infused over 30 minutes) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg IV infused over 30 minutes) every three weeks for four cycles. This was followed up with a single agent nivolumab (240 mg IV infused) every 2 weeks for 12 cycles. There were no reported adverse events while on systemic therapy. Follow-up imaging revealed a significant decrease in disease burden with only subcentimeter retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and shrinkage of the primary tumor to 9.5 cm (Figures and ).\nIn October of 2019, the tumor was deemed surgically resectable. He was thus taken to the operating room for a complete resection. A midline laparotomy incision was used for the intraperitoneal approach. Intraoperatively, the tail of the pancreas and spleen were both fixed to the anterior surface of Gerota's fascia, thus requiring a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy.

    "original_text": "A 65-year-old male patient was referred to our pain clinic due to pain in the left anterior thigh. The pain had begun 15 years earlier and had worsened following fine needle biopsy for the evaluation of a painful mass five years later. The nature of the pain was severe (score of 8 out of 10 on the visual analogue scale [VAS]) with constant dullness and paroxysmal lancinating pain. Clinical examination revealed severe tenderness at the biopsy site (VAS score 10 out of 10) and mild skin color change, loss of hair, decreased sweating, and static and dynamic allodynia and hyperalgesia in the left anterior thigh. The patient had been receiving treatment at another hospital where electromyogram, biopsy, and MRI results had been non-specific. Based on the clinical signs and symptoms, the patient had been diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type 1 and neuropathic pain. Previous treatments had included administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), gabapentin, nortriptyline, opioids, and also several nerve blocks with little success. After arriving at our hospital, the patient received diverse interventional therapies during the next three months without significant results. Selective transforaminal epidural block (L1, L2 levels) and sympathetic ganglion block (L2 level) were effective in reducing pain 30% to 50% for only a day or two. Pulsed radiofrequency treatment of the L1 dorsal root ganglion also showed limited results.

    "cleaned_text": "a 65-year-old male patient was referred to our pain clinic due to pain in the left anterior thigh. the pain had begun 15 years earlier and had worsened following fine needle biopsy for the evaluation of a painful mass five years later. the nature of the pain was severe (score of 8 out of 10 on the visual analogue scale [vas]) with constant dullness and paroxysmal lancinating pain. clinical examination revealed severe tenderness at the biopsy site (vas score 10 out of 10) and mild skin color change, loss of hair, decreased sweating, and static and dynamic allodynia and hyperalgesia in the left anterior thigh. the patient had been receiving treatment at another hospital where electromyogram, biopsy, and mri results had been non-specific. based on the clinical signs and symptoms, the patient had been diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome (crps) type 1 and neuropathic pain. previous treatments had included administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), gabapentin, nortriptyline, opioids, and also several nerve blocks with little success. after arriving at our hospital, the patient received diverse interventional therapies during the next three months without significant results. selective transforaminal epidural block (l1, l2 levels) and sympathetic ganglion block (l2 level) were effective in reducing pain 30% to 50% for only a day or two. pulsed radiofrequency treatment of the l1 dorsal root ganglion also showed limited results. although intravenous infusion of ketamine reduced pain for five days, the pain relief was only felt in the anterior thigh, while the tenderness in the biopsy site was not reduced.\nfurther examination with ultrasonography at the biopsy site confirmed a round 0.8 \u00d7 0.6 cm2 sized hypoechoic cyst in the subcutaneous fat tissue (). the patient first received injection of 3 ml of 0.75% levobupivacaine around the cyst under ultrasonography guidance, but this did not provide any pain relief. one week later, 2 ml of 0",

Several years prior to his presentation, he had sustained a fall from approximately 3 meters, with minor posterior chest wall trauma. The patient\u2019s past medical and social history were unremarkable and he took no medications. On review of systems, the patient reported an increasing level of fatigue and exertional dyspnea over the past seven months. On exam, the patient\ufffd\ufffds vital signs were stable and cardiac auscultation revealed a pericardial friction rub with no murmurs or gallops. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed an incomplete right bundle branch block with non-specific T wave changes. The cardiac enzymes revealed a slightly elevated Troponin-I level of 0.10 ng/mL.\nInitial imaging with chest X-ray (Figure ) was performed and a contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed a low attenuation mass located along the right heart anteriorly that measured approximately 10 cm by 10 cm with no significant enhancement (Figure ). At this point we considered a differential diagnosis of a pericardial cyst versus a true aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm of the right coronary artery (RCA). Echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65-70%, no pericardial effusion, and a well circumscribed echolucent mass compressing the right ventricle (not shown). Selective coronary angiography was performed to further define the abnormality and the RCA injection confirmed the mass to be a giant right coronary artery aneurysm (not shown). CT reconstructions were also performed, which revealed the extent of right heart obstruction by the aneurysm (Figure ).

He was positive for hepatitis B virus infection. His alpha feto-protien levels were significantly elevated at 34,700.50 ng/ml (normal values 0-15 ng/ml). His scan revealed a moderately hypermetabolic mass in the right lobe of liver, which was the site of the primary HCC. In addition to the primary mass there was extensive hypermetabolic thrombus involving the portal vein and its branches, the splenic vein and the superior mesenteric vein. The maximum intensity projection image shows hypermetabolic thrombus involving the right and left branches of the portal vein (thin arrows), the main portal vein (block arrow), splenic (arrow head) and superior mesenteric (curved arrow) veins []. The CT images show a filling defect completely occluding the lumen of the right and left portal veins and the main portal vein. All these vessels were expanded and were enhancing when compared with the plain baseline images. The mass in the right lobe of liver directly invades the portal vein branches and shows attenuation characteristics same as that of the tumor [, left panel]. The fused PET CT image shows the hypermetabolic tumor thrombus in the branches of portal and in the main portal vein [, right panel]. Hypermetabolic filling defects were also seen in superior mesenteric vein [, upper panel] and splenic vein [, lower panel].

She had undergone bilateral THA at our hospital 28 years earlier for bilateral osteoarthritis of the hip joint.

Range of motion at the right hip joint was limited. Plain radiography of the right hip at the time of admission showed a slight peri-implant osteolytic change (Fig. , black arrow), but no evidence of loosening of the implant. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a ring-enhancing region suggestive of abscess formation around the right hip joint (Fig. , black arrow).

Suspecting VVF, her gynecologist instilled 2ml of crystal violet dye diluted to 1% concentration. No VVF could be identified but the physician was unable to drain the dye from her bladder as his patient refused catheterization. She then developed an irritable bladder, frequent urination and gross hematuria. She was diagnosed to have acute cystitis and prescribed antimicrobial agents for one week. However, her symptoms did not improve and she was referred to our urology department.\nA blood examination showed only a mild degree of elevated C-reactive protein. Her urinary sediment showed a red blood cell count of >100 cells/high-power field and a white blood cell count of >100 cells/high-power field. Her condition was gradually getting worse, with severe urgency to urinate every 10 minutes and gross hematuria with clots. Cystoscopy showed abnormal mucosa of her bladder. The surface of her bladder was hemorrhagic with a lot of necrotic tissue (Figure ).

    "original_text": "A 70-year-old man underwent partial resection of the mid pancreas without reconstruction for a pancreatic cystic tumor. Postoperative pathological examination showed a lymphoepithelial cyst. About 1 month after the operation, a PPC developed as a consequence of grade B postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) and acute pancreatitis (Fig. ). Internal drainage of the PPC using endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) should have been considered as one of the procedures. However, there was no doctor who was skilled in the procedure at our hospital, and we wanted to observe the PPC over time. Therefore, transpapillary drainage was judged to be the first choice of treatment. Endoscopic drainage was subsequently performed, and two endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage (ENPD) tubes were placed into the PPC and main pancreatic duct (Fig. ). There was a stricture of the main pancreatic duct near the PPC, and we judged that long stent insertion was necessary and considered that endoscopic retrograde pancreatic drainage (ERPD) was more appropriate than ENPD from the view of QOL. After improvement of abdominal pain and PPC was observed, the drainage tubes were exchanged with an ERPD tube.\nOne month later, the PPC worsened again (Fig. ). Unfortunately, the ERPD tube had migrated into the main pancreatic duct and could not be removed endoscopically. ENPD tubes were placed again into the main pancreatic duct side by side with the migrated ERPD tube (Fig. ). In addition, bleeding from the main pancreatic duct caused by tube contact was observed. If the condition was absent, internal drainage of PPC using endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) should be considered because additional pancreaticojejunostomy may cause another postoperative pancreatic fistula.

The patient had a history of a Ross procedure for aortic insufficiency associated with a bicuspid aortic valve 16 years previously. A computed tomography (CT) scan at the time of admission revealed a 6.1-cm aneurysm with a small dissection flap (Fig. ). The patient had recently undergone an echocardiogram that revealed a preserved ejection fraction of 55\u201360% and aortic root dilation to 5.9 cm with additional dilation of the ascending aorta to 4.4 cm. As echocardiography just 6 months earlier had measured the aortic root and ascending aorta at 5 and 3.8 cm, respectively, concern had been raised for accelerated aneurysmal degeneration and planning for elective aneurysm repair had been underway. Given the patient\u2019s symptomatic presentation and associated CT findings, she was admitted for medical optimization and was taken to the operating room 8 days later.\nIntraoperatively, transesophageal echocardiography revealed severe aortic regurgitation with dilatation of the autograft root to 6.4 cm. On gross examination, degeneration of the aortic valve leaflets and limited dissection of the non-coronary sinus of the autograft was appreciated (Fig. ). After the autograft and valve were excised and the coronary artery buttons mobilized, a 29-mm bioprosthesis and Valsalva graft were sutured to the annulus of the autograft. The coronary buttons were anastomosed to the graft, and finally the graft was anastomosed to the distal ascending aorta. After routine de-airing maneuvers, the aortic cross-clamp was released, and immediately the patient experienced severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and hemodynamic instability. Accordingly, the heart was rearrested and the Valsalva graft was opened to inspect the aortic valve and coronary buttons.

Her immunisations were up to date according to the Malaysian National Immunisation Schedule with normal developmental milestones. Our examination revealed bilateral lower limb weakness with a power of 1/5 to 3/5. Furthermore, hyperreflexia of bilateral lower limbs, clonus, and reduced sensation from L3 to S5 bilaterally were also noted.\nA series of imaging procedures were performed beginning with a plain radiograph of the spine which showed a mixed sclerotic bony lesion of the T12 vertebral body with preserved vertebral height (Figures , ). No fractures were seen in the visualised bones and no lesions were revealed in the other visualised spines. An MRI revealed an aggressive lesion of the T12 vertebra with a large soft-tissue component and intraspinal extension that led to spinal cord compression, resulting in cord edema (Figures -). A computed tomography scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis (CT TAP) also revealed an aggressive T12 vertebral bony lesion with a soft-tissue component likely representing a malignancy with the presence of subcentimeter para-aortic nodes. A bone scan was done and the result revealed the absence of distant metastasis.\nThe patient already had a neurological deficit but unfortunately, her condition worsened and therefore, a CT-guided biopsy was done to further identify the nature of the lesion. Then, she underwent urgent surgical intervention in the form of posterior instrumentation and fixation from T9 to T12 spinal vertebrae.

His laboratory tests were within the normal ranges apart from serum creatinine, which was elevated (1.82 mg/dl, normal range 0.7\u20131.3 mg/dl).\nDue to the findings of metastatic pelvic and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy it was decided that systemic therapy would be the next step with the exception of cisplatin use due to his renal failure and former nephrectomy. Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and nivolumab 1 mg/kg combination for four cycles started on July 2018 and continued until the last dose was administered in late September 2018 with intervals of 21 days. His CT staging, after the completion of the four cycles of combined immunotherapy, revealed a significant response in all affected metastatic lymph nodes.\nIn early November 2018, in his scheduled follow-up visit, the patient complained about muscular weakness and maculopapular rash on his hands, thighs and face without any pruritus. His laboratory tests revealed elevated creatine kinase (CK) 1025 IU/L (normal range 24\u2013195 IU/l). Skin biopsy was performed but was inconclusive. Methylprednisolone was administered due to suspected myositis related to immunotherapy administration. A dose of 48 mg per day was initiated with slow tapering of the dose and gradual improvement of the physical findings and a gradual decrease of CK. The patient continued with his scheduled follow-up visits where the CT scans always revealed stable disease, no findings of relapse and a gradually decreasing CK. In March 2019 the patient was urgently admitted to the Oncology Clinic due to fever, proximal muscle weakness and symptoms of dysphagia. The laboratory tests revealed again rising CK (725 IU/L)",

The pericardial surface of the heart was markedly granular and thickened. An area on the pericardium of the anterior left ventricle was focally disrupted without frank tearing or laceration and blood was observed to ooze through this defect.

During the examination, his measured blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, heart rate 82/minute, and oxygen saturation 99%. A longitudinally located, nearly 3 centimeters long cut with smooth margins on the medial part of the right knee was observed. Peripheral pulse was detectable, motor and sensory examination was normal, and motility of extremity was not limited. The local wound exploration committed during the extension of the right knee did not show any sign of the deep penetration. The lesion was evaluated as a simple superficial cut and the patient was discharged after the tetanus prophylaxis, wound care, and saturation. Two days after the discharge, the patient was readmitted to the emergency department with the complaints of persistent pain on the right knee, swelling, and mild redness. During the second examination, we found out that the flexion and extension of the right knee were painful and there was mild hyperaemia over the right knee around the sutured lesion. Vital signs of the patient were normal, blood pressure was 100/70 mmHg, heart rate was 75/minute, oxygen saturation was 99%, and fever was 37\u00b0C. The detailed anamnesis of the patient revealed that he got this stab wound while he attempted to hit the attacker's abdomen with his bent right knee. In the bidirectional radiographic examination, a broken knifepoint (nearly 3 centimeters long) behind the right patella in the medial region of the femur, on the sagittal plane with intraosseous penetration, was detected (Figures and ).\nPeripheral pulse, sensory, and motor examination of the patient were normal.

According to his family, the headache started gradually over the left side of his head and then became holocephalic and moderate to severe in intensity. The patient reported feelings of nausea and 2 episodes of vomiting. Moreover, his family stated the patient was often seen \u201cbumping\u201d into surrounding objects while ambulating. The patient reported experiencing some visual disturbance during this period. The patient's family felt he appeared confused at times and was not responding to his surroundings. He had no clear history of seizure, according to the family, and his past medical history was unremarkable apart from diabetes. He had sustained a minor head trauma 3 years prior with no concussion; however, his scan was reported to have shown \u201cscattered areas of bleeding\u201d in his brain. He otherwise maintained a healthy life and never required a hospital visit for any medical issues. His family reported the patient had normal cognitive function, especially as someone who ran his own business.\nThe patient was lethargic upon arrival to the accident and emergency department.

A 56-year-old man had been followed up (for 10 years\u2014since 1996) for a WHO grade 2 papillary urothelial carcinoma which was localized towards the left lateral wall of the urinary bladder. At a routine follow-up cystoscopic examination, two small tumour foci in the dome of the urinary bladder were found which were resected transurethrally. The microscopic features of the tumour were markedly different from those of his previous tumour by the infiltration of neoplastic cells that were arranged in a diffuse pattern of variably sized nests. There was evidence of invasion of lamina propria and muscular layer. There was no evidence of papillary configuration in the tumour. The tumour cells characteristically exhibited pale to eosinophilic cytoplasm with bland nuclear features. The mitotic activity in the tumour was low, and there was no evidence of perineural invasion. The histological findings were reported to be consistent with those of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma. The option of radical cystoprostatectomy was offered to the patient but he refused to undergo cystoprostatectomy. However, during a follow-up period of 23 months, he developed three recurrences of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma.\nImmunohistochemical studies of the tumour were undertaken and these showed that the percentages of cells that were positive for Ki-67, p53, and p27 were 20%, 40%, and 40% in Case 1 and 15%, 40%, and 50% in Case 2, respectively ().

He continued to have persistently increased work of breathing, persistent expiratory wheeze and symptoms and signs of air trapping.\nThough he did not progress to respiratory failure, weight gain and oxygenation was achieved only by initiation of Heated Humidified High Flow Nasal cannula therapy (HHHFNC).\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) revealed the persistence of rhinovirus and adenovirus for 10 weeks in both NPAs and bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs), with parainfluenza type 3 found in just one NPA sample. Adenovirus was also found in blood by PCR testing. Rhinovirus is not normally tested for in blood samples and there was no validated assay available for this. One BAL and one urine sample were screened for cytomegalovirus (CMV) by PCR also, and found to be negative. One stool sample was tested and found to be negative for rotavirus and adenovirus (despite the persistence of adenovirus in the respiratory samples at this time).\nThere was no significant family history of any genetic diseases and the patient was born at term. Mum is a smoker but states that she did not smoke during her pregnancy. During pregnancy, intrauterine growth restriction was identified.

The pain was associated with several bouts of vomiting. There was no diarrhoea, joint pain, or petechial rash.\nPhysical examination revealed a temperature of 38 \u00b0C, pulse rate 109 min\u22121 and normal blood pressure.

He had a history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension for 20 years and took metformin 1000 mg/day and diltiazem 60 mg/day. His past medical history revealed progressive slowness in thinking and walking, memory impairment, sleep-wake disturbance and mood disorder, which had slowly progressed for the past 20 years; however, it had rapidly worsened during last year of his life. He was diagnosed with organic mood disorder 5 years before this presentation and treated with risperidone 0.5 mg/day, sertraline 50 mg/day, and trihexyphenidyl 1 mg/day. Even with this treatment, his symptoms had been progressively worsening for the past 1 year to the point that he could not perform daily living activities, such as taking the correct medications. He was the fifth of seven children. His sister had a history of unexplained hearing loss, cognitive decline, and slowness of movement starting at the age of 20.

He was paraplegic following laminectomy of the thoracic spine at the T4 to T8 level for removal of a lipoma in 1998, following which he had to rely on manual evacuation of the bowels. Recently, he was finding it exceedingly difficult to evacuate his bowels, and had sought medical advice. On examination, he was noted to have an empty rectum, and a mass was felt in the posterior rectal wall. Routine blood investigation results were within normal ranges. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen revealed a dilated sigmoid colon. Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy was attempted, which revealed external compression at 20cm of the sigmoid colon with a mass lesion posterior to the bladder. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan of the pelvis showed a mass lesion in the presacral region, with a neurogenic origin. An MRI scan of the pelvic region revealed a presacral mass suggestive of a schwannoma causing anterior displacement of the rectum (Figures and ). A transrectal ultrasound scan (TRUS)-guided biopsy of the mass revealed that the histology was compatible with a schwannoma.\nOur patient underwent a laparotomy and excision of the presacral schwannoma. A globular mass measuring 1.4\u00d79.0\u00d78.0cm was removed (Figures and ). A meticulous dissecting technique was used to minimize bleeding during mobilization of the tumor and diathermy coagulation and local compression was used to arrest any bleeding that occurred. As a result, blood loss was minimal and postoperative blood transfusion was not required. The surgery was uneventful and there was marked symptomatic improvement in our patient after surgery. Subsequent histological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of a pelvic schwannoma. Suspicious histological features such as nuclear polymorphism or necrosis were not observed. Our patient was discharged from hospital and, since the histology was benign, surgical excision",
