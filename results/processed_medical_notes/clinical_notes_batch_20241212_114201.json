    "original_text": "Raymond was a 40-year-old male referred to a specialist service for adults with psychosis and complex mental health needs in one of the National Health Service Trusts in East Midlands, UK, for an individual psychotherapeutic input. Raymond was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and a comorbid anxiety disorder (not otherwise specified). A number of ongoing symptoms were reported, including derogatory and threatening auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions, high anxiety levels, and social avoidance and withdrawal. Past and ongoing interventions consisted of pharmacotherapy with a maintenance dose of antipsychotics and tranquilisers, social inclusion activities facilitated by a community based team, and recurrent crisis oriented admissions to acute mental health wards.\nSince early adolescence, Raymond regularly used excessive amounts of alcohol and cannabinoids, which initially seemed to be his way of conforming to peer pressure in the deprived area where he lived. He received strict upbringing from his father; thus spending hours in pubs appeared to function as an avoidance of exposure to distressing stimuli at home. With time, Raymond became dependent on the use of illicit substances. He was trained as a builder and enjoyed his work. Yet, after the onset of psychosis Raymond gave up his trade. His first episode of hearing voices occurred at the age of 30 and involved his first admission to an acute mental health ward, where he underwent an alcohol detoxification. Raymond has managed to remain abstinent from alcohol since and yet continued to use cannabinoids on a regular basis. After a few years of remission, the second episode of psychosis occurred and was followed by another inpatient admission. Subsequently, Raymond remained abstinent from cannabis as well. However, auditory hallucinations persisted on a daily basis. Additionally, Raymond developed a range of paranoid appraisals of voices and delusional beliefs about other people's vicious intentions towards him, which precipitated social withdrawal and triggered high anxiety levels.

Postoperatively, the patient had a sense of instability coupled with pain and weakness.

In January 2018, a routine gastrointestinal endoscopy found an ulcerative lesion of approximately 10 mm diameter in the greater curvature of the gastric body (Fig. ). An endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) of this lesion showed the first three sonographic layers were blurred, which suggested submucosal invasion. An endoscopic biopsy of the lesion exhibited clear cytoplasm with prominent nucleoli, which was histologically compatible with metastasis to the stomach of the patient\u2019s known RCC. On the other hand, computed tomography (CT) incidentally detected a well contrast-enhancing round-shaped mass in the fundus of the gallbladder (Fig. ). Additional ultrasonography revealed a sessile polypoid lesion, and gallbladder stone and wall thickening were not observed. Although these findings were lacking conclusive evidence of diagnosis whether the gallbladder tumor was primary or metastatic, the circumstantial evidence potentially pointed to the tumor as a metastasis from the patient\u2019s known RCC. 18F-Fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography combined with CT (FDG-PET/CT) was performed as a preoperative workup to detect other possible remote metastasis.

The patient did not report any acute trauma at that region and noted that her symptoms worsened while shooting. At that time a painful snapping sensation over the dorsoulnar aspect of the wrist followed the forceful forearm rotation. Physical examination revealed swelling, edema and tenderness over that area. A \u201cclunk\u201d and palpable dislocation of the ECU tendon along the ulna head with active or passive supination and ulnar deviation of the wrist was observed. Hand and finger function was normal, and neurovascular examination showed no abnormality.\nThe patient underwent radiological investigation with plain radiographs of the wrist, that were negative for any bone pathology ( and ), and dynamic Ultrasound (U/S) at rest (with the wrist in 0\u00b0 of flexion-extension) and during pronation and supination with comparison to the contralateral ECU tendon. During supination, the unstable ECU tendon slided abruptly over the ulnar wall of the distal ulnar groove and dislocated volarly, while during pronation the tendon relocated into the groove ( and ).\nDiagnosis of recurrent ECU tendon dislocation was made on the basis of clinical history, physical examination and imaging findings. As the patient\u2019s symptoms had not improved after a 4-month period of conservative management and in conjunction with a highly demanding sport, surgical intervention was opted.\nSurgical reconstruction of ECU tendon sheath was carried out under axillary block anesthesia using a high humerus tourniquet.

Pathology revealed a nuclear grade 2 clear cell carcinoma (TNM-staging: pT2 pN0 G2 M0) with favorable prognostic features according to MSKCC criteria, and thus the patient underwent a regular comprehensive review after surgery. Right middle femur metastasis occurred in January 2018, and positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) showed multiple lung metastases on 5 February 2018. At this time, she experienced low fever, poor appetite, and fatigue. Physical examination of lungs showed clear breath sounds, no weakening and no rales. She began therapy with sunitinib, and zoledronic acid, 4 mg every 4 weeks. During sunitinib treatment, a grade 2 hand-foot skin reaction occurred. After a 2-month treatment, a CT showed that the lung metastasis had increased in size, which was evaluated as progressive disease according to RECIST 1.1.\nAfter providing informed consent, the patient received 2 mg/kg nivolumab combined with approximately 5 \u00d7 109 CIK cells every 3 weeks starting in April 2018. After two cycles of therapy, the patient experienced increased appetite, but a CT scan performed 2 months after initiation of this therapy revealed enlarged and new pulmonary metastases. We continued to apply nivolumab and CIK cells combination therapy. After 6 months of therapy, a CT showed that the lesions in the lungs had begun to decrease (). Subsequent CT scans showed progressive disease reduction until November 2019.\nIn December 2018, the patient experienced intermittent headaches.

Because the pain persisted for several months, she went to a nearby hospital where she was referred to our institute for a second opinion and treatment. She had thyroid cancer and received tumor resection 5 years prior to the knee symptom without local recurrence. Radiographs demonstrated a 4\u00d74.5 cm osteolytic lesion in her medial femoral condyle (Fig. ). On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the lesion was depicted as low intensity on T1-weighted image (T1WI), low-intermediate intensity on T2-weighted image (T2WI), and highly enhanced after gadolinium contrast administration. There was no penetration of the tumor through the cortex and no soft tissue mass was present (Fig. \u2013). An open biopsy was performed and, histologically, the tumor showed clusters of epithelial cells. These epithelial cells were oval or spindle-shaped with squamous differentiation, and surrounded with fibrous stroma. Tumor cell nuclei were relatively uniform, did not show pronounced atypia, and had a low rate of mitosis. Reactive bone formation, similar to fibro-osseous lesion, was seen around the epithelial cells (Fig. ). On histological examination, adamantinoma was initially considered for the diagnosis. However, it was inconclusive due to its unusual localization. Considering the patient\u2019s age, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma was possible although the primary lesion was not evident. Moreover, it was difficult to exclude metastasis of the thyroid cancer she had 5 years ago because papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland sometimes undergoes squamous metaplasia thereby resembling squamous cell carcinoma. Because there was no other known lesion after further screening, we performed a wide resection of the tumor and implanted a tumor endoprosthesis to reconstruct the defect (Fig. \u2013). The resected specimen showed the same histological feature as the biopsy sample; therefore, the final diagnosis remained inconclusive. She was discharged without any complication.

    "original_text": "A 67-year-old male with a past medical history of congestive heart failure, non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and pacer-dependent heart block, presented to the University of Miami emergency department with refractory complex partial seizures. Due to the fact that the patient was pacemaker-dependent, he was unable to undergo MRI. Therefore, a contrasted CT scan of the brain was performed, which demonstrated a heterogeneously enhancing left frontal mass just anterior to the left motor cortex thought to be either a primary central nervous system tumor or a metastatic lesion (Figure ).\nA full metastatic workup was conducted with no primary lesion detected. Given the location of the lesion, further imaging was thought to be necessary for two reasons: 1) to further elucidate the differential diagnosis of the lesion and 2) to help safely guide resection or biopsy of a lesion in close proximity to eloquent brain tissue. As a result, cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for the possible replacement of the patient\u2019s current pacemaker with an MRI-compatible alternative. The patient subsequently underwent the removal of their pacemaker and replacement with a Surescan Medtronic DDD Pacemaker RVDR01 (Minneapolis, MN, US). Following this procedure, an MRI was performed and demonstrated a multi-lobulated, relatively uniformly enhancing left frontal lesion (Figure ). Due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis, the decision was made to perform an awake craniotomy with MRI-assisted stereotactic guidance and intraoperative electrocorticoraphy for a definitive diagnosis. The lesion was able to be resected with the initial pathology suggestive of Mycobacterium tuberculosae brain abscess. The patient was placed on anti-tuberculosis medication and intravenous (IV) antibiotics and discharged home. Approximately one year later, he returned to the hospital after suffering a partial seizure with subsequent right upper extremity weakness.

She complained from severe pain in the left hip and inability to bear weight on her left leg. Clinical examination showed a shortened left leg in external rotation; all movements as well as axial pressure were painful.\nRadiographs of the left hip, anterior-posterior and axial, showed a pertrochanteric multifragmentary fracture of the proximal femur (AO Classification 31-A2) ().\nThe next day the patient was operated on where the fracture was fixed with a third-generation short Gamma nail (Stryker, Kalamzoo, USA), using a set screw to control rotation of the lag screw. The procedure and postoperative course were uneventful, with the Gamma nail in good position as could be confirmed on the postoperative X-ray (Figures and ). The patient was able to mobilize and was allowed full weight bearing of the left leg the next day. After 11 days the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center.\nAfter six weeks we saw the patient in the outpatient clinic for a scheduled follow-up. At that point there were no complaints and she was mobilizing with a walker. The X-ray after 6 weeks () showed an identical position of the Gamma nail and consolidation of the fracture.\nUnfortunately, three months after the operation the patient presented herself again in the ED with acute pain in her left hip for 2 days and an inability to walk. There was no preceding trauma and there were no signs of an infection.

During a few months before referral, the patient had noticed a firm palpable mass in close relations to the supernumerary nipple on the right side (). She had no other symptoms. Bilateral mammogram and ultrasound revealed normal breast parenchyma. Ultrasound of the supernumerary nipple on the right side confirmed a small mass in relation to this nipple, presenting as a hypoechoic, well-defined area, measuring approximately 10 mm in diameter ().\nUpon clinical examination, the supernumerary nipple on the right side presented with inversion and a palpable firm mass underneath this nipple. Ultrasound-guided needle core biopsy (16G) was performed (). The pathology report described elongated epithelial islands composed of cubic cells, with a small centrally located lumen with focally identifiable cuticles. The epithelial structures were surrounded by a dense fibrous stroma. The microscopic analysis indicated the possibility of SyT and the lesion was categorized as a B3-lesion (a lesion with uncertain malignant potential) ().\nFollowing a Multidisciplinary Team Conference, it was decided to recommend resection with a 5 mm rim of normal tissue, which was subsequently performed ().\nMacroscopically the tumour measured 7 x 5 x 5 mm and was described as a firm and grey-white tumour, in close relations to the supernumerary nipple. Microscopically the tumour measured 13 mm in diameter and was localized in the deep part of dermis and underlying subcutaneous tissue with no relation to the epidermis. The tumour was composed of solid trabecular and glandular imitating formations with focal cysts.

Due to the fact that the patient was pacemaker-dependent, he was unable to undergo MRI. Therefore, a contrasted CT scan of the brain was performed, which demonstrated a heterogeneously enhancing left frontal mass just anterior to the left motor cortex thought to be either a primary central nervous system tumor or a metastatic lesion (Figure ).\nA full metastatic workup was conducted with no primary lesion detected. Given the location of the lesion, further imaging was thought to be necessary for two reasons: 1) to further elucidate the differential diagnosis of the lesion and 2) to help safely guide resection or biopsy of a lesion in close proximity to eloquent brain tissue. As a result, cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for the possible replacement of the patient\u2019s current pacemaker with an MRI-compatible alternative. The patient subsequently underwent the removal of their pacemaker and replacement with a Surescan Medtronic DDD Pacemaker RVDR01 (Minneapolis, MN, US). Following this procedure, an MRI was performed and demonstrated a multi-lobulated, relatively uniformly enhancing left frontal lesion (Figure ). Due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis, the decision was made to perform an awake craniotomy with MRI-assisted stereotactic guidance and intraoperative electrocorticoraphy for a definitive diagnosis. The lesion was able to be resected with the initial pathology suggestive of Mycobacterium tuberculosae brain abscess. The patient was placed on anti-tuberculosis medication and intravenous (IV) antibiotics and discharged home.

On review of symptoms, the patient had no other significant medical history, was not immunocompromised and took no regular medications. On examination, her visual acuity was 20/20 OU; the physical examination was significant for large immobile nonfluctuating supra-tarsal mass with red and erythema surrounding the mass []. There were no orbital signs observed on examination; there was full ocular motility in both eyes, no proptosis and color vision was intact. In addition, the dilated funduscopic examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the orbits was performed, revealing a large mass extending from the frontal sinus through the soft tissue of the eyelid [ and ]. There was extensive bony erosion with no inter-cranial extension. Initial laboratory investigations were performed, including a complete blood count, chemistry, and coagulation studies, all within the normal limits. A biopsy was performed with a combined approach; both ears, nose, and throat (ENT) team, and oculoplastic teams were present []. The ENT team approached endoscopically using a navigation system to properly locate the lesion within the area of the frontal sinus. The oculoplastic team approached through a lid crease incision, and the material was sent to biopsy. Biopsy revealed an inflammatory infiltrate with many plasma cells and granulation tissue with a lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate with plasma cells and neutrophils. There was an abnormal ratio of kappa to lambda and a high level of CD: 138 expression. Polymerase chain reaction was also performed and a monoclonal B-cell proliferation was seen. The histopathological diagnosis was plasmacytoma. The hematology department was consulted, and a systemic workup was performed",

The skin over the nodules was shiny with several yellowish points indicative of underlying calcium deposition. The skin surrounding the nodules, testis, and penis was normal on palpation. The nodules were painless and firm in consistency. On laboratory examinations the following were found to be within normal limits: serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D hormone levels; uric acid; alkaline phosphatase; and lipid profile. Based on clinical features and laboratory reports, a diagnosis of ICCS was made.\nHe was advised a scrotectomy under spinal anesthesia, which he refused. The nodules were excised under local anesthesia in several sittings. The skin was sutured using chromic catgut (4\u20130).

His abdomen was soft but tender to palpation in the right lower quadrant, without evidence of generalized peritonitis. Lab values were insignificant except for leukocytosis (WBC 17.4 k) and mild hyperglycemia (blood glucose level 124 mg/dl). Computed tomography imaging obtained prior to the surgical consult demonstrated dilation of the appendix up to 11 mm with periappendiceal fluid (Fig. ) and a 3-cm abscess adjacent to the appendiceal tip (Fig. ) consistent with appendicitis with perforation and locally contained abscess.\nTreatment options included appendectomy, treatment with antibiotics, and percutaneous drainage of the abscess, all of which were discussed with the patient and his family.

There was very little blood in the heart, and no active source of bleeding was found in the chest. Direct cardiac massage was started followed by initiation of the massive transfusion protocol. Three units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) were given rapidly during the Emergency Department admission period. Vital signs returned after a brief period (about 2 minutes) of direct cardiac massage. She had obvious, open pelvic fractures () with a bleeding perineal wound. The bleeding was controlled by external packing with gauze. The patient was then taken to the operating room (within 15 minutes of arrival), where a damage control laparotomy was performed. Upon entering the abdomen, a large amount of blood was noted, and an expanding pelvic hematoma was packed. The chest and abdomen were left open and a negative pressure dressing was applied. Resuscitation continued in the operating room with six units of warmed PRBCs, four units fresh frozen plasma (FFP), one unit of apheresis platelets, three liters of crystalloid, and two liters of albumin.

He had a history of chronic medical problems including asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requiring 4 L of home oxygen therapy, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, and chronic kidney disease. He was on long-term 17.5 mg methotrexate weekly and 10 mg prednisone daily.\nVital signs recorded on admission included normal temperature with normal heart rate and blood pressure. On initial physical examination, he was noted to be awake but lethargic and had poor oral hygiene with multiple dental caries. On auscultation, there was reduced air entry into his lungs, and bilateral wheezing, and his abdomen was tender to palpation. He was noted to have extensive bruising over his left hand and bilateral pitting pedal edema. He was admitted and managed for COPD exacerbation and dehydration due to diarrhea.\nOn admission, he was started on intravenous methylprednisolone and bronchodilator treatments; on day 2, his mental status became more altered. He was later intubated urgently after failure of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) trial for acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure.

She had right foot ligament tear, which included anterior talofibular ligament, calcaneoufibular ligament and posterior talofibular ligament, followed by a modified Brostrom surgery on the right foot in March 2017. However, the patient still felt a painful sensation, the numerical rating scale (NRS) was 10 of 10, at the right foot. She also complained of allodynia, burning and tingling sensation, leg edema, and change of skin color with a dystonic posture of the right foot. The result of electromyography and nerve conduction velocity was no abnormal findings. However, bone scan showed diffusely decreased perfusion, blood pool and bone uptake of right foot and quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test suggest sympathetic postganglionic sudomotor dysfunction or sweat gland abnormality in right distal leg. Department of orthopedic surgery in our institution gave an opinion that there were no joint pathology, bony abnormality and nothing to cause the pain with orthopedic opinions. Following a clinical assessment, she was diagnosed with CRPS type 1 according to the International Association for the Study of Pain clinical diagnostic criteria []. Although she was treated with several medications, physical therapy, lumbar epidural blocks, and lumbar sympathetic ganglion blocks, her symptoms remained intractable.\nIn August 2018, she was considered for SCS trial. During the SCS trial, strict aseptic techniques and prophylactic antibiotics (cefazolin) were used. A guide needle for an electrode was inserted through the right L1-2 paramedian epidural space, and the tip of the electrode was placed at the T9-10 level.

Previous records did not exist in our hospital system, and the patient was not able to provide any information regarding the severity, diagnostic workup, treatment and the number of prior episodes. On arrival, his blood pressure was 162/62 mm Hg, the heart rate 70 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and the temperature 98.7 F. Cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. He had normal skin turgor with no peripheral edema and no focal motor deficits. Computed tomography of the head was unremarkable for any intracranial findings. In the emergency department, his serum sodium concentration was 117 mEq/l, BUN was 6 mg/dl, creatinine was 0.7 mg/dl and glucose was 96 mg/dl. The urine osmolality was 132 mosm/kg, and plasma osmolality was 250 mOsm/kg. Urine sodium was not checked initially. He received 1 liter bolus of normal saline. A second serum sodium concentration was obtained at 12 h after the bolus, and the level was 127 mEq/l. The patient produced 8 liters of urine in his first 12 h after arrival. Five percent dextrose water (D5W) was then started at 100 ml per hour to relower the serum sodium concentration and to prevent rebound increase. Fifteen hours after the initial normal saline bolus, his serum sodium concentration decreased to 123 mEq/l. His urine osmolality and urine sodium were now 315 mosm/kg and 128 mEq/l, respectively.

    "original_text": "A healthy 5-year-old boy presented with an asymptomatic abdominal mass that had been noted by his mother. On abdominal physical examination, two fist-sized masses were palpated in the right flank and umbilical region. On palpation, the mass was relatively nonmobile, nontender, and hard in consistency. The results of laboratory blood and urinary analyses were within normal limits and the urinary excretion of vanillylmandelic acid, catecholamines, and homovanillic acid was also within the normal range. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed an 11 cm\u00d77 cm mass that appeared to arise from the isthmus of a HK. A band of renal parenchyma was seen extending across the midline, which was suggestive of a HK (). A post-CT abdominal X-ray film revealed bilateral malrotation typical in a HK and bilateral hydronephrosis caused by extrinsic ureteral compression of the mass. Even though the results of a chest X-ray film were normal, a chest CT scan showed two small nodules in the left upper lobe anterior segment and right upper lobe posterior segment of the lung (). Fine-needle biopsy of the mass revealed the presence of blastema, stromal, and epithelial cells without anaplasia, which suggested a diagnosis of WT with favorable histology ().\nThe patient was classified as having a stage IV WT on the basis of the presence of metastatic small nodules in the chest and was treated with 6 weeks of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We used the DD-4A regimen (pulse-intensive dactinomycin, vincristine, and doxorubicin) under the proposed Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocol (AREN0533).

After 2 weeks from discharge, he was readmitted to the hospital for nausea and vomiting and was diagnosed with postoperative small bowel obstruction around the ileostomy. He underwent a small bowel resection because he did not improve from conservative treatment. After reoperation due to the small bowel obstruction, he reported abdominal discomfort and postprandial stabbing epigastric pain with nausea and vomiting. He showed a weight loss of 9 kg over 18 days since the readmission (). An abdominal CT scan was performed under suspicion of postoperative intestinal obstruction, which demonstrated moderate gastroduodenal dilation with compression of the SMA, and 7 mm of aortomesenteric distance, consistent with SMA syndrome ().

No records were available regarding the initial resuscitation of the baby and whether a nasogastric tube was passed at birth to assess esophageal patency. She was seen at three different hospitals where a diagnosis of esophageal atresia was made before she reached our center for further management.\nOn examination, the baby was a sick-looking full-term female neonate having severe tachypnea with persistent white froth in mouth. No chest wall retractions or central cyanosis was noted. Heart rate was 162 beats per minute and respiratory rate was 54 per minute. Auscultation of the chest revealed equal air entry on both sides with coarse crepitations. Insertion of a red rubber tube through the mouth revealed obstruction at 10cms from the mouth was noted. Chest roentgenogram with the red rubber tube in situ demonstrated the tube lying at the level of the third thoracic vertebrae with presence of air in the stomach. Echocardiographic examination was normal. A clinical diagnosis of esophageal atresia with distal tracheo-esophageal fistula (Vogt type III) was made. She was stabilized by low-pressure continuous upper pouch suction, oxygen, antibiotics and chest physiotherapy.\nThe patient was taken up for a right postero-lateral thoracotomy. On exploration, the esophagus was found to be in continuity with no evidence of esophageal atresia. Careful palpation of the esophagus revealed a hard mass in the upper esophagus. Longitudinal esophagotomy over the mass showed multiple foreign bodies (beetle nuts pieces) and they were meticulously removed (Fig. 1). After removal of beetle nut pieces, a nasogastric tube could easily be passed into the stomach from the mouth. Esophagus was repaired over the nasogastric tube and chest was closed after putting an intercostal drain. Post-operative period was uneventful",

The neck mass, which was diagnosed as a cervical lymphadenitis at a local clinic, had been present for one week, had progressively increased in size and had become red. The physical examination showed that the patient had a temperature of 38.3\u00b0C and presented with a tender mass (size, 3 cm) and skin erythema on the left side of the neck at level II-III. The total white cell count was 18.7\u00d7109/l and the C-reactive protein value was 12.3 mg/dl (normal value, <0.5 mg/dl). No additional clinical abnormalities, such as transnasal fiberoptic laryngoscopy, were identified as a result of the head and neck examinations. The patient provided written informed consent.\nAn ultrasonographic scan showed a hypoechoic and heterogeneous deep abscess between the left sternocleidomastoid muscle and the common carotid artery. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the neck was performed and a hypodense predominantly cystic lesion, exhibiting ring enhancement over the left carotid space, was observed (). The pus culture developed Staphylococcus aureus and the cytological examination via fine-needle aspiration revealed the presence of non-malignant inflammatory cells alone. Following adequate control of the infection, the patient became afebrile and the skin erythema ameliorated. However, the neck mass remained present and the possibility of a malignancy could not be excluded due to the patient regularly chewing betel nut and a concern regarding the lateral cervical cystic lesion that the patient exhibited. Therefore, an additional fine-needle aspiration of the lesion was conducted and the cytology revealed malignant epithelial cells, which were consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. The diagnostic procedures were conducted to characterize the occult carcinoma, although the results of the abdominal ultrasonographic scan, chest radiography and the bone",
