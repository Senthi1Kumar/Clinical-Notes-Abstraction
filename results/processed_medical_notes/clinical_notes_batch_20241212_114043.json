The initial signs and symptoms appeared when he was 6 years old. Deformity of interphalangeal joints initially appeared in the fingers. Hips, knees, and wrists were then gradually involved. Diagnosis of JRA was considered by local hospitals, and glucocorticoids were prescribed without any efficacy. As he grew up, his symptoms deteriorated.

At 26 years of age, he first experienced progressive pain with numbness radiating down his entire left leg and right thigh. At 34, he started to have mild difficulty in urination. Thereafter, his leg pain progressed and he became immobile. Treatment with tramadol, physical therapy, and spine injection were tried but were not effective.

Due to the fact that the patient was pacemaker-dependent, he was unable to undergo MRI. Therefore, a contrasted CT scan of the brain was performed, which demonstrated a heterogeneously enhancing left frontal mass just anterior to the left motor cortex thought to be either a primary central nervous system tumor or a metastatic lesion (Figure ).\nA full metastatic workup was conducted with no primary lesion detected. Given the location of the lesion, further imaging was thought to be necessary for two reasons: 1) to further elucidate the differential diagnosis of the lesion and 2) to help safely guide resection or biopsy of a lesion in close proximity to eloquent brain tissue. As a result, cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for the possible replacement of the patient\u2019s current pacemaker with an MRI-compatible alternative. The patient subsequently underwent the removal of their pacemaker and replacement with a Surescan Medtronic DDD Pacemaker RVDR01 (Minneapolis, MN, US). Following this procedure, an MRI was performed and demonstrated a multi-lobulated, relatively uniformly enhancing left frontal lesion (Figure ). Due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis, the decision was made to perform an awake craniotomy with MRI-assisted stereotactic guidance and intraoperative electrocorticoraphy for a definitive diagnosis. The lesion was able to be resected with the initial pathology suggestive of Mycobacterium tuberculosae brain abscess.

There was no history of UTI or visible haematuria. His past medical history included left inguinal hernia repair associated with left simple orchidectomy for atrophic testicle, at 11 years of age.\nAbdominal examination revealed the scar related to left inguinal hernia repair. Digital rectal examination revealed a firm right prostate base.\nThe patient then underwent a multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) scan of the prostate (T2W, DW and Dynamic Contrast Enhanced sequences) prior to transperineal prostate biopsy.\nHis CT and mpMR imaging together with biopsy findings, were then discussed in our multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting. CT urogram () showed a horseshoe kidney with atrophic left part and a supernumerary right kidney. The ureter of the atrophic left horseshoe kidney was draining into the ipsilateral seminal vesicle whereas both the right horseshoe and the supernumerary right kidneys drained via a single ureter into the urinary bladder. MpMR images () showed a 26 cc prostate with a PI-RADS 4/5 lesion at the right posterior peripheral zone at the base. They also showed an abnormally enlarged left seminal vesicle. His prostate biopsies confirmed right side Gleason 3 + 4 in a significant number of cores. Consensus from MDT meeting was that the patient should be offered active treatment options for his clinically significant prostate cancer.

His medical history was notable for untreated HIV diagnosed six years prior to admission and a remote history of methamphetamine abuse.\nTwo months prior to his hospitalization, the patient was hospitalized at an outside hospital in California for abdominal pain and a 40 lb weight loss. The initial CT abdomen showed an SBO and thickening in the terminal ileum, concerning inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at that time was unremarkable though biopsies were obtained.

His tremors were aggravated by nervousness and relieved when asleep. He had had a history of hypertension and took a daily dose of 5 mg amlodipine. The patient had no history of any other chronic illnesses and was not on any other type of medication. Neither the electrocardiogram nor the Holter monitor showed any abnormalities. His baseline recumbent-upright blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were normal prior to treatment with piribedil, as shown in Table . He was diagnosed with PD based on the Movement Disorder Society clinical diagnostic criteria []. Initially, he received dopamine replacement therapy of 50 mg piribedil per day.

Thereafter, partial resection with right radical neck dissection was performed for tongue cancer of pT1N1M0. In 2016, a new undiagnosed hilar mass near the anastomosis site, as a lung metastasis of tongue cancer found on chest computed tomography (CT), was treated with radiotherapy of 36 Gy at a previous hospital.

The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable, and there was no evidence of allograft rejection on the 12 biopsies obtained within first six months posttransplantation. He presented for an outpatient right heart catheterization (RHC), coronary angiography, and EMB for his routine one year posttransplantation evaluation. Coronary angiography revealed a very large RCA measuring 5 mm with a fistulous connection from posterolateral branch to possibly the right atrium (Supplemental ). There was no \u201cstep-up\u201d in venous saturations suggestive of an intracardiac shunt. Hemodynamics were unremarkable with a pulmonary artery pressure of 29/18, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mmHg, and a cardiac output of 5.6 L/min. The patient's transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), two months posttransplant, was suggestive of a very subtle right coronary artery to right atrial shunt which was not noted on the initial read (Supplemental ). This anomaly was not present on the donor heart TTE immediately pretransplant. A retrospective systematic review of all EMB slides revealed a blood vessel sample present on one of the prior biopsies (). This particular biopsy was obtained via a transjugular venous access and under fluoroscopy guidance. We also pursued a coronary CTA that revealed an ectatic RCA measuring approximately 6 mm in diameter and an ectatic posterolateral branch measuring 4.5 \u00d7 5.5 mm with a fistulous communication to a dilated coronary sinus (Supplemental Videos ). The fistula was not hemodynamically significant as the patient had continued to remain asymptomatic, with normal right atrial and right ventricular dimensions and normal filling pressures on RHC.

She had first undergone treatment for GISTs associated with an incomplete-type Carney\u2019s triad 11 years prior, at the age of 10 years.\nAt the time of her first admission and treatment, the patient had presented with black stools as her chief complaint. Endoscopic examination revealed the presence of two submucosal tumors in the pyloric antrum (Fig. ) []. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple nodular tumors presenting as low signals on the T1-weighted image and high signals on T2-weighted image of the gastric body to antrum. In addition, computed tomography showed pulmonary nodular shadows in the S1 region in the right lung and lingular region in the left lung (Fig. ) []. Based on these findings, the patient underwent open partial gastrectomy with Billroth-I reconstruction. Histopathological examination showed a positive result for c-kit and negative for S-100 protein; thus, we provided a diagnosis of wild-type GISTs. There was no vessel or lymphatic invasion, and MIB-1 labeling index was below 10%. The GISTs were diagnosed to be of high risk because the pulmonary tumors were considered to be metastatic. Two months after this gastric surgery, imatinib was initiated for the treatment of the pulmonary tumors. As the pulmonary tumors grew slowly, the type of TKI was changed from imatinib to a combination of sunitinib and regorafenib. This change did not lead to a positive tumor response. As the pulmonary tumors in the right upper lobe increased in size, a right upper lobectomy was performed, 9 years after the index gastric surgery.

The past medical history showed arterial hypertension and prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy in 2005.\nIn July 2014, an SCC of the skin located in the scalp was diagnosed and completely resected without any signs of metastases. At that time, there was no sign of progressive B-CLL. In January 2015, the patient presented with progressive lymphadenopathy, night sweats, fever and weight loss and a worsening of peripheral blood count with a decrease in hemoglobin (from 11 to 9 g/dl) and a reduction of thrombocytes (from 60 to 20 \u00d7 109/l). Further examinations revealed a progression of the B-CLL with generalized lymphadenopathy and an increase in monoclonal B-CLL population (up to 65%) in peripheral blood detected by FACS. Therefore, salvage therapy with ibrutinib was started in January 2015.\nAfter an initially very good response to ibrutinib with fast significant lymph node regression and improvement of the peripheral blood count, in February 2015, he presented with progressive painful cervical swelling and numbness of the right side of his face. At that time, the B-CLL was in stable remission, and therapy with ibrutinib was stopped immediately. An MRI scan revealed a progressive cervical tumor. A lymph node biopsy showed an infiltration of a keratinizing, moderately differentiated squamous cell cancer of the skin due to a metastatic manifestation of the squamous cell cancer of the scalp diagnosed in July 2014. In February, first-line treatment with primary radiochemotherapy (cisplatin 20 mg/m2 days 1\u20135 and radiation with 60 Gy) was initiated. He received a total of three cycles until April 2015. There were no signs of metastases at the end of therapy. However, the primary tumor, located retroauricular, was not resectable",

The pathological stage of her cancer was T2N0M0 with intermediate grade and lymphovascular invasion. The primary tumor was ER, PR, and HER2 positive and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) negative as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The expression of ER and PR was scored according to the Allred score. HER2 status was scored as positive if >30% of tumor cells showed strong (3+) membrane staining, and PTEN status was designated as positive if tumor cells showed positive staining by IHC. The patient was treated with CAF (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and fluorouracil) adjuvant chemotherapy for six cycles and tamoxifen for 2 years without radiotherapy or trastuzumab. Metastases to the supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes and left chest wall relapse were found in December 2007. Thus, the disease-free survival was 32 months.\nFrom December 2007 to August 2012, the patient underwent multiple-line rescue treatments including several cytotoxic agents, HER2-targeted therapies, and endocrine therapies used for breast cancer (). Pretreatment biopsy and pathology results were not available. The rescue treatment was started with chemotherapy, but this was switched to endocrine drugs due to the adverse effects of chemotherapy. The patient obtained clinical benefit from endocrine therapy. The recurrent tumor in the left supraclavicular lymph nodes was HR negative by IHC and HER2 positive by fluorescence in situ hybridization detection in two hospitals in May 2009. Then, chemotherapy and HER2-directed therapy as main choices were applied, and endocrine therapy was also used due to the intolerance or lack of response to chemotherapy. Among these regimens, two regimens provided clinical benefit, namely, anastrozole combined with goserelin for 11 months and exemestane plus lapatinib for 7 months during the earlier treatment. In contrast, a total of seven regimens containing trastuzumab and two regimens containing lapatinib all failed ().\nAfter discussion",

He had no prior history of coronary artery disease, and his risk factors included tablet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and a current smoking history. His ECG demonstrated significant ST-segment elevation in leads V1-3, though he was clinically stable on arrival with no evidence of decompensating left ventricular failure.\nThe patient also reported a history of haemophilia A (codon 2164 mutation) with no prior major intra-articular or intramuscular haemorrhage. At presentation, he was well controlled on tranexamic acid maintenance therapy. Haematological advice was that he required recombinant factor VIII or desmopressin only prior to major surgery.\nGiven his lack of significant bleeding episodes and his clinical presentation with chest pain and ST-segment elevation, he was transferred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention without further delay.\nCatheterisation was performed via the right radial artery using a 6F JR4 and XB 3.0 guide catheter. The patient was loaded with 300 mg aspirin and 60 mg prasugrel prior to the procedure and was then administered with 5000 units of heparin. A flow-limiting 95% stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery was identified, with no significant disease in the left mainstem, circumflex, or right coronary arteries (). Two attempts at thrombus extraction using a Pronto LP device yielded very little, so the decision was made to direct stent the proximal LAD with a bare metal stent (3.5 \u00d7 23 mm Vision). The final result was excellent, with TIMI 3 flow down to the distal LAD (). Haemostasis at the puncture site was achieved using a TR band filled with 13 mLs air.\nAfter PCI, the patient was transferred to the High Dependency Unit for observation. His blood revealed an APTT of 54.1, factor VIII level of 60%, and a peak troponin I level of 6.",

Echocardiography showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and an inferior wall motion abnormality with mildly impaired left ventricular function (LVEF 44%).\nFor the intervention of the RCA, a guidewire was passed through the severe stenosis of the distal RCA into the posterolateral branch (PLB). Extensive balloon dilatation of the vessel resulted in large dissection planes, which complicated the passage of a second guidewire to protect the posterior descending artery (PDA). Initial wiring of the PDA was considered unnecessary but became crucial after the dissection extended into the distal bifurcation of the PLB and PDA. A dual-lumen microcatheter was not available at that time, and the operator was unable to deliver the second guidewire distally passing the dissection planes. He then came up with a guidewire co-transporter made from a regular 2.0/20 SC balloon catheter that was used to predilate the lesion and was able to successfully place a second guidewire into the PDA.\nPreparation of the guidewire co-transporter (sidecar) is illustrated step-by-step in Figure . Any regular balloon catheter can be used with longer balloons being more practical. Inflate the balloon to 4 atm and puncture it at its proximal end with a 23-gauge needle (radial puncture needles are ideal). Insert the needle gently into the balloon without puncturing the distal end of the balloon. Insert the guidewire through the needle into the balloon and push it until the tip of the balloon. Squeeze all the air and contrast media out of the balloon by sliding your fingers from distal to proximal while holding the second guidewire together with the balloon shaft.

The owner noticed a progressive deterioration of the neurologic signs over the preceding 3 days. Symptomatic treatment before the presentation with phenobarbital (2 mg/kg twice a day orally) failed to alleviate the seizures.\nThe dog had been generally healthy until the occurrence of acute seizure episodes. He had been fully vaccinated and dewormed, with no history of trauma or exposure to toxins. Further medical enquiry with the owner revealed that the dog had been fed an almost exclusive diet of boiled sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) as a primary diet source for 4 weeks with an average consumption of approximately 100\u2013150 g (about one to one and a half small whole sweet potatoes) per day due to his picky eating behaviours (chronic food refusal). Furthermore, this food refusal had gradually worsened over time.\nAt presentation, the seizures were classified as generalized tonic-clonic with vomiting aura. The initial onset of seizures was 3 days before the admission, and the cluster seizures activity was recorded over three sequential days (more than three seizures in a 24-hr period). The average duration of the 3 ranged from 20 to 30 s, and the time interval between consecutive seizures was approximately 10 min. The last seizure episode verified by the owner was at least 6 hr before admission. Except for neurological abnormalities, other abnormalities were not noted on complete physical examination. Mentation was normal.

She denies vaginal bleeding and reports that her last menstrual period was approximately one month ago. She endorses a history of bulimia, and reports forceful vomiting episodes every day for the past year. Otherwise, the patient denies fever, cough, recent illness, trauma or injury.

She is currently taking warfarin and aspirin.\nPhysical exam is remarkable for blood pressure of 99/69 mmHg and heart rate of 98 beats per minute, remaining vital signs within normal limits. On exam, the patient is in no acute distress. The exam is significant for diffuse abdominal tenderness with voluntary guarding.\nDue to significant abdominal tenderness on initial physical exam, bedside FAST scan was performed, which was found to be positive, demonstrating a significant amount of free fluid in the right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, and suprapubic views (Figures , ).\nOther workup was remarkable for anemia with a hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dl and negative pregnancy test. Surgery was consulted and computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest, abdomen, pelvis were performed emergently due to concern for internal bleeding.

Prior to the endoscopy she had lost 15% of her total body weight due to severe regurgitation of undigested food and debilitating chronic nausea. She had undergone a 4-h solid-phase gastric emptying scan and CT scan which were consistent with gastroparesis. She used a gastric tube to infuse supplemental elemental feedings and had failed to respond to all prior medical therapy.\nThe upper endoscopy was performed using monitored sedation with propofol. After ensuring there was no evidence of gastric outlet obstruction, 100 units of Botox (OnabotulinumtoxinA) was injected into the pylorus (25 units into each quadrant). The injections were unremarkable, with no evidence of intra-arterial injection, and she was discharged from the recovery area 1 h after the procedure feeling well. Two hours post-procedure, she experienced weakness in her bilateral lower extremities, which progressed rapidly to her upper extremities. Within 3 h post-procedure, she became unable to walk and was brought to the emergency department by private vehicle 3.5 h after the Botox injection.\nUpon arrival, she was evaluated by the neurology service who noted diffuse muscle weakness (1/5) in all muscles \u2013 with only the ability to slightly flex her neck. Her lower extremities were weaker than her upper extremities. She complained of inspiratory weakness but did not require endotracheal intubation.\nBoth systemic botulism and acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy were considered as potential causes for her symptoms, and a lumbar puncture was performed. Her cerebrospinal fluid was normal without increased protein and given the temporal relationship of her symptoms to the injection, systemic botulism toxicity was felt to be more likely. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was contacted and recommended administration of the botulism anti-toxin. The anti-toxin was then urgently transported by commercial airline and courier",

Computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed a large fusiform aneurysm of the arch of aorta and proximal descending thoracic aorta, distal to the left common carotid artery with involvement of origin of the left subclavian artery. The descending thoracic aorta showed aneurysmal dilatation till D8 level. The saccular part of the aneurysm measured 8.5 cm \u00d7 7.0 cm with total craniocaudal span of the aneurysmally dilated segment measuring 16 cm. Compression and narrowing of the trachea was seen with displacement of the trachea and esophagus toward the right. The left major bronchus was mildly displaced anteriorly. Atelectatic changes were seen in the left lower lobe [].\nThe surgical plan in this case was to exclude the thoracic aneurysm and reduce the volume of the aneurysm to reduce compression on the airways. This aneurysm could have been treated by placing a stent graft, but this would not have reduced pressure on the airways for several weeks to months. Thus, the open surgical repair was planned under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) through peripheral cannulation.[] Transesophageal echocardiography was performed perioperatively in this case.\nIn preanesthetic assessment, all laboratory investigations were normal, with arterial pressure (blood pressure [BP]) of 110/70 mmHg and heart rate of 72 beats/min.

Twenty-five days after the last round of chemotherapy, enhanced CT of the chest suggested a significant reduction in the tumor volume, mediastinal lymph nodes, and tumor thrombus in the arch of the azygos vein (Fig. c, S), and general PET-CT showed no distant metastasis.\nOne month later, the patient underwent McKeown radical resection. Intraoperative exploration showed a tumor located at the level of the arch of the azygos vein, measuring approximately 3 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter, with the tumor invading into the esophageal outer membrane. Two enlarged lymph nodes measuring approximately 1 cm in maximum diameter were present around the tumor, and the tumor had a relatively clear boundary with the surrounding tissues. The arch of the azygos vein was hard in nature, wherein the embolus could be palpated (Fig. a, b and c). The operative process included entering the posterior-lateral 5th intercostal space of the right chest to expose the esophageal bed and open the mediastinal ple",

His history of chief complaint showed typical presentation of severe pain due to advanced buccal cervical carious lesion.\nBased on clinical findings, radiographic interpretation, and vitality tests, a diagnosis of acute pulpitis of upper left first molar was made. No periapical diagnosis was identified. Routine endodontic therapy was planned. Local anesthesia using 2% lignocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine was administered. Standard routine root canal procedure was performed under rubber dam isolation. The carious lesion was removed and replaced by composite material (Filtek\u2122 P90, 3M). The endodontic access opening was prepared. Working length was established. In addition, cleaning and shaping were performed using crown down technique with ProTaper rotary instruments (dentsply). In addition, obturation was done with lateral compaction. A root canal completion radiograph confirmed the correct root canal therapy. A single dose of 600 mg ibuprofen was prescribed to control postendodontic pain. The patient reported to has an increased erectile function and libido after 2 h from taking the ibuprofen tablet. He has reported that has done three sexual intercourses with his wife at that day. On the next day, he was curious, and he repeated taking the ibuprofen tablet. Surprisingly, he had the same experience of his first use of ibuprofen of having increased libido and erectile function that has lasted for at nearly 6 h. He contacted us to question this unusual experience. His medical history was re-reviewed thoroughly with an endocrinologist, and nothing was mentioned. Furthermore, tests for complete blood count, testosterone, thyroid stimulating hormone, cholesterol pre and post ibuprofen intake were assessed, and all results came up as normal.

Past medical history included diverticular disease, COPD, hypertension, atrial fibrillation and appendectomy. Of note, he had no prior history of endoscopic procedures or recent trauma. The CT showed a primary cerebral mass at the temporal right site suspected for a glioblastoma. Hence, he went through a contrast-enhanced Chest/Abdomen CT for staging. No secondary lesions were detected but a small amount of free gas was unexpectedly noted in the abdomen secondary to a suspected colonic diverticular perforation (). Therefore, a surgical consultation was granted. At a first observation the patient was totally asymptomatic. Vital signs were in range. He had a healthy appetite, bowel sounds were active and he was opening his bowels normally. On examination the abdomen was soft and nontender with no distension. Laboratory tests were also normal including WCC (4.72 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl) and CRP (2.05 mg/dl). To confirm the diagnosis we proposed an explorative laparoscopy that the patient refused as he was feeling well. Few weeks later he underwent neurosurgical intervention and the cerebral mass was resected. The postoperative period was uneventful and he was discharged home on postoperative Day 7.\nUnfortunately, once he returned home his temperature started to rise up to 38\u00b0C and he was readmitted to the hospital. A new contrast-enhanced Chest/Abdomen CT showed a bilateral pneumonia and a massive amount of intraperitoneal free gas, mainly in the abdominal upper quadrants (). No fat stranding, nondilated bowel, no vascular abnormalities and no free fluid were detected. Although the CT showed an evident worsening, the patient still remained completely asymptomatic on physical examination. Accordingly, he started to be treated with meropenem for pneumonia (Escherichia coli was isolated into the sputum) and he finally agreed to underwent diagnostic laparoscopy.
