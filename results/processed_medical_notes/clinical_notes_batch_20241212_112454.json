He also underwent periodic imaging examinations during follow-up, for the last 10 years, for a benign biliary stricture caused by CP. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) conducted as a part of these examinations revealed multiple CBD stones (Figure ). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography performed 6 months before the MRCP had not revealed stones in the CBD; however, gallbladder stones were seen. It was presumed that the gallbladder stones had now progressively moved to the CBD. Therefore, we performed an endoscopic therapy for the CBD stones.\nAn endoscopic cholangiography revealed a stricture of the distal CBD and four CBD stones. The shortest diameter of each of the four stones (6, 5, 4, and 3 mm) was larger than the diameter of the distal CBD lumen (Figure ); therefore, endoscopic extraction of the stones was challenging. After endoscopic sphincterotomy (Figure ), we attempted to remove the CBD stones using a basket catheter, which is often used for the destruction of stones. However, the movement of the basket catheter was limited by the biliary stricture. Therefore, the basket catheter could only hold a small stone but could not extract them. The distal biliary duct was extremely narrow. Therefore, there was a possibility that the placement of multiple biliary plastic stents would be difficult, or they would not dilate the distal biliary stricture adequately to remove the CBD stones. Additionally, no pancreatic atrophy was observed during the imaging examinations. Due to the risk of injury to the pancreatic parenchyma, we did not perform dilatation with a balloon catheter.

    "original_text": "A 49-year-old male cultivator residing in Mankono (western Ivory Coast) with no particular history presented with pruritus. For 3 years, he had had recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, followed by pruritic papules on the body 3 h after meals. The patient tried herbal medicines with a regression of lesions within 2 h. He believed that a spell had been cast, comforting his option for traditional medicines. However, 2 years later, he found that the symptoms appeared only after the consumption of red meat such as beef, mutton and agouti. He therefore stopped eating red meat. After 15 days, the patient restarted his red meat consumption, and the same symptoms reappeared. He decided not to consume red meat for several months and had no symptoms. After 4 months, he consumed smoked meat and had no symptoms for the first 2 months, but then the symptoms recurred. He stopped the consumption of red meat and limited his meat intake to poultry and fish, with no reaction after consumption. The notion of tick bite was not found, but the patient reported being bitten repeatedly by insects. He had no domestic animal such as dog or a cat and did not report consuming cat meat. Suspected of being a sorcerer and upset by this situation, he joined his brother who decided to bring him to the capital for medical care. We performed a red meat challenge with beef in our department. Three hours later, the patient complained from abdominal pain, followed by pruritic papules on the body (fig. ) without anaphylaxis.

He was running up to 300 km/week on streets and cross-country in an even distribution. Although he had taken analgesics, the pain during exercise did not improve, and he presented to our emergency department with lower leg pain (Fig. ). There was no clear abnormality on the radiographs of the tibia, but STIR magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a high-intensity area of the distal one-third of the tibia, and the diagnosis of stress fracture and shin splint was made. The patient was instructed to suspend training, and the injury was treated conservatively with follow-up on an outpatient basis (Fig. ). Follow-up radiographs were checked at 2 and 3 months. With this treatment, the fracture healed with no complications, and he decided to return to running after 3 months. At 6 months, radiography showed thickening of the bone cortex in the back one-third of the right tibia and in the back of the distal part of the left tibia, so that he was again instructed to stop training (Fig. ). However, he discontinued coming to the outpatient clinic on his own after 6 months.\nHe was then seen in the emergency department, having sustained an injury to the right lower leg while running a middle-distance race, 1 year after the initial examination. He described how, when he had just started and passed through the first corner, he had felt a \u2018\u2018snap\u2019\u2019 in his right calf, suddenly could not run, and fell and had to abandon the race.

The dog had noticeable difficulty in breathing for three-month duration with progressing severity 30 days prior to presentation. The client noticed that the dog had been pawing at her nose and rubbing it on the ground throughout the day with increasing frequency. There were no reports of fainting or loss of consciousness at home, but sleep apnea had been reported. It was reported that the dog would frequently wake up gasping after prolonged periods of attempting to breathe through its nose. The clients believed that the dog generally seemed most comfortable while panting. They also reported that the dog had difficulty in eating due to its inability to breathe through its nose, although it continued to have a normal appetite and interest in food. An initial workup was performed by the primary care veterinarian, which included a nasal endoscopy. The procedure was unable to visualize the entire nasal cavity and was inconclusive. Therefore, the primary care veterinarian believed laryngeal paralysis to be the primary differential diagnosis. Medical treatment of the clinical signs had not been attempted, and the dog was referred to Iowa State University at that time.\nOn presentation to Iowa State University, the dog appeared bright, alert, and responsive. Air movement through the nares was absent bilaterally, and there was mucopurulent discharge from the right naris. No facial deformation or asymmetry was present, and no pain was elicited with facial palpation. There was no resistance or pain with ocular retropulsion of either eye, and vision was intact.

He was introduced to our hospital for further examination of a liver tumor that was increasing in size. The tumor had been found incidentally after laboratory findings in a health checkup showed impairment of liver function. The patient had declined treatment due to his employment situation, and had instead been followed up for 1 year.\nAt the first visit, he was completely asymptomatic with normal vital signs. A physical examination revealed a palpable right upper mass without tenderness. No symptom related to Cushing syndrome was observed. In blood tests, hepatitis B virus surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody were negative. Liver function tests indicated mild dysfunction. Regarding tumor markers, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were normal; however, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was elevated.\nUltrasonography showed a large low-echoic solid tumor with a vertical diameter of > 80 mm with partial calcification implied by an acoustic shadow in an anterior lesion of the liver. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed an 81 \u00d7 76 \u00d7 72 mm large, heterogeneously enhanced mass in the right lobe of the liver with dense partial calcification (Fig. a). Subsequent positron emission tomography (PET)/CT showed a large hepatic mass in the right lobe with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of 22.4 and no extrahepatic metastasis. In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), most of the tumor was weakly enhanced in T1-weighted images and strongly enhanced in T2-weighted images. Part of the tumor had early enhancement and washout in enhanced MRI.

His clinical history included a viral illness 5 days prior to admission, with malaise, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Early in the course of that illness he was seen by a pediatrician who noted mild dehydration, and suggested oral rehydration and antipyretics. He was otherwise healthy, with up-to-date immunizations.\nOn arrival to the ED physical exam revealed flaccidity in right upper and lower extremities. X-rays of right upper extremity obtained to rule out trauma were negative. Lab results showed microcytic anemia with hemoglobin of 6 g/dL, and thrombocytosis, with a platelet count of 512,000. The remaining labs were normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast showed hypodensity of the left thalamus (). In addition, high attenuation was noted throughout the bilateral deep venous system, compatible with acute DCVT ().\nAnticoagulation therapy and IV hydration were initiated immediately after radiologic findings were discussed with the ED physician. The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit of our tertiary pediatric hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated restricted diffusion in the central aspect of the thalamus, surrounded by vasogenic edema, compatible with acute venous infarction (). No other parenchymal lesion was detected. Signal changes within the deep venous system were compatible with acute intraluminal thrombus (). MR venography confirmed lack of flow-related signal throughout the deep venous system ().\nThe patient had a follow-up MR venography done two days later before discharge but was found to have no significant interval change with relatively stable venous infarct in the left thalamus and posterior limb of the internal capsule.

The patient had been on warfarin therapy for anticoagulation of his mechanical heart valves as well as prophylactically for underlying AF for greater than 20 years. He was initially diagnosed with cellulitis and treated accordingly with antibiotics. Despite multiple antibiotic regimens, the skin lesions did not improve and instead progressed into painful, necrotic ulcers.

One month before, she described a similar swelling of her right lower extremity that lasted for about 1 week which spontaneously improved. She has one child of 4 years of age and has been taking oral contraceptive pills for 2 years. She had a history of thrombocytopenia of which cause has not yet been determined. She has no known underlying cancer. She has no history of miscarriage. Upon admission, she was fully conscious and alert. Her weight and height were 96 kg and 170 cm, respectively. Her initial blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature were 112/82 mmHg, 108 bpm, 20 bpm, and 37.9 c, respectively. She had swelling of both lower extremities more pronounced on the left side. After an initial assessment, color Doppler ultrasonography was done and revealed acute deep venous thrombosis. She was positive for lupus anticoagulant which suggested that antiphospholipid syndrome was the cause of her extensive thrombosis. Further, CT venography revealed partial thrombosis of the entire inferior vena cava (IVC) down to the common and external iliac veins and common femoral veins []. A ventilation-perfusion lung scintigraphy was requested to evaluate for pulmonary embolism. Imaging was carried out with Vertex V60 EPIC HP Gamma Camera System (ADAC Laboratories, USA) using a LEGP collimator. For the ventilation study, the patient inhaled 20 mCi of Tc-99m diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid aerosol and 6-view images of the lungs were obtained for 300 k counts per view.

Prenatal ultrasonography showed that the massive area of fluid was of pericardial, not pleural, origin. An abnormal heart chamber (4 \u00d7 5 mm) was detected in the apex of the right ventricle in the four-chamber view (). The presumptive diagnosis was a ventricular diverticulum or ventricular aneurysm. The connection to the ventricle was narrow, color Doppler ultrasound detected blood flow in and out of the abnormal heart chamber, and M-mode assessment indicated normal synchronous contraction of its walls with those of the ventricle; these findings were consistent with a diagnosis of ventricular diverticulum. There was an anechoic space peripherally around the heart, and both lungs were severely compressed (>50% lung compression) into a posterior position in the fetal thorax. This finding distinguished our case from that of a pleural effusion manifesting as an anechoic space located peripherally around the compressed lungs.

    "original_text": "A 24-year-old woman from a Middle Eastern country presented to the Jefferson Pancreas, Biliary and Related Cancer Center for evaluation of a recurrent pancreatic mass. She complained of right upper quadrant fullness, and physical examination revealed a remote right subcostal incision. At the age of 12 years, she had first developed decreased appetite, weight loss, fatigue, pruritus, and subsequently became jaundiced. Medical records from that episode revealed that an endoscopic biliary stent was placed with surgical exploration through a right subcostal incision and partial resection/enucleation of a pancreatic mass. In the intervening 12 years, the mass had persisted and enlarged, although the patient was asymptomatic, having neither anorexia, pruritus, nor jaundice.\nRoutine hematology and basic chemistry panels were normal. The tumor marker cancer antigen 19-9 was mildly elevated at 89 U/mL (<35 U/mL). An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast revealed an 8.2 \u00d7 7.6 cm heterogeneous-enhancing lesion, prominently involving the uncinate process of the pancreas (). The pancreatic head and neck were displaced and splayed around the anterior aspect of the tumor. The mass abutted the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) as well as the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). There was no evidence of main pancreatic ductal dilatation and the pancreatic neck, body, and tail were normal. Imaging showed no evidence of metastatic disease to the liver or regional lymph nodes. The mass was believed to be an SPT, based on the previous partial resection and the accompanying pathology report.\nThe patient underwent an open cholecystectomy and a difficult classic pancreaticoduodenectomy. The operative time was 12 h and the estimated intraoperative blood loss was 1500 mL.

General and neurologic examinations were not remarkable on admission. Routine laboratory investigations including coagulation profiles and platelet function were within normal limits. Head computed tomography (CT) on admission revealed an isodense CSDH on the right hemisphere with mild midline shift (Fig. a). A CT angiography (CTA) was performed to rule out any intracranial vascular malformation. A DAVF was noticed at the transverse sinus with dilated cortical venous drainage (Fig. b). So, a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the external carotid artery and DAVF embolization was planned.\nNo anomaly was noticed during selective angiography of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries and the left external carotid artery. Selective angiography of the right external carotid artery showed that the DAVF was located at the transverse sinus and fed by posterior branch of the middle meningeal artery (MMA), the occipital artery, and the posterior meningeal artery and drained to the occipital cortical veins with venous ectasia (Fig. a-b). The DAVF was classified as type IV according to the Cognard classification. The embolization was performed via the MMA. The Headway duo catheter was used and accessed to the DAVF, and Onyx was injected until the shunt disappeared (Fig. c-d). The patient experienced an uneventful recovery. His CSDH gradually resolved in 1 month (Fig. ). No neurologic deficit was noticed.\nA PubMed search of published studies written in English and Chinese was conducted on June 30th, 2017.

The patient was a diagnosed case of multidrug-resistant TB on CAT IV AKT (kanamycin 500 mg, levofloxacin 750 mg, ethionamide 500 mg, cycloserine 750 mg, and pyridoxine 100 mg) since 4 months. After 1 month of starting AKT, the patient showed a change in behavior of becoming irritable, refusing to take her medications and having delusions of infidelity against her husband. There were no other hallucinations or delusions. The patient was referred to a local psychiatrist who diagnosed her as suffering from cycloserine-induced psychosis and advised the physician to stop cycloserine. The patient was then started on tab olanzapine (5 mg) which was increased to 30 mg in 15 days. Tab haloperidol (1.5 mg) and tab trihexyphenidyl (2 mg) were added after 2 weeks of being on tab olanzapine as the patient's aggressive behavior was uncontrolled though her suspiciousness towards her husband had reduced. The patient developed tremulousness and dystonic reactions within 2 days of adding the above medications for which her olanzapine was then reduced and gradually stopped over 1 week as it was in high doses. After the extra pyramidal symptoms had subsided, the dose of haloperidol was gradually increased to 10 mg with trihexyphenidyl at 4 mg over 10 days, as the patient still remained aggressive though her delusions had now abated. However, the next day patient came with severe akathisia and whole body tremulousness as a side effect of the typical antipsychotic medication.

During her childhood, the patient used to live in an endemic county for cutaneous leishmaniasis (S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o da Serra - S\u00e3o Paulo) and described the presence of a long-lived skin ulcer, which had appeared at that time and diagnosed as cutaneous leishmaniasis. At examination, the lesion presented as a painful, foul smelling, and edematous 8 cm-diameter ulcer in the fibular malleolus region, which showed fibrin but without infiltrated edges (A). Another atrophic circular scar has also been found on the left pretibial region. Histology of the biopsy obtained from the border of the lesion was compatible with a venous stasis ulcer with intense granular tissue and scarring (B).

    "original_text": "A 21-year-old Philippine woman was referred to the University Medical Center Utrecht with right upper quadrant abdominal pain since one year. An initial abdominal ultrasound showed cholecystolithiasis. Incidentally, a cystic lesion was detected in the tail of the pancreas. Additional CT imaging exposed a 24 mm cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail, in close proximity to the spleen (). The caudal wall of the cyst appeared to be thickened and enhanced. Following our protocol for cystic lesions of the pancreas, a subsequent MRI was performed and revealed a 31 mm cystic lesion with hyperintensity on T1-weighted images, indicative of previous haemorrhage (). Enhancement of the cystic wall was seen in the venous phase, with some gadolinium enhancing of the center of the lesion during the arterial phase (). The rim of the lesion showed some diffusion restriction on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) ().\nThe patient had no medical history and additional physical examination and laboratory tests were normal. The patient case was further discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting and a solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (Hamoudi or Frantz tumor) with past haemorrhage was considered as the most likely diagnosis based on clinical and radiological findings. Owing to the low malignant potential of the suspected solid pseudopapillary neoplasm in the tail of the pancreas, a robot-assisted spleen preserving distal pancreatectomy was advised. In addition, a cystic neuroendocrine tumor and mucinous cystadenoma were in the differential diagnosis. Due to questionable sensitivity, endoscopic ultrasound is not part of standard work-up for pancreatic (cystic) lesions at our institution [].

She was diagnosed in Korea in 2010 with endometriosis via laparoscopy; however, no tissue biopsy was performed. She had an intrauterine device placed, which was removed in 2011 due to no resolution of symptoms, and subsequently was given Depo Lupron. She reported that the pain persisted, and she received Lupron for a total of 12 months until June of 2012. She was then started on oral contraceptive pills but continued to have chronic pelvic pain. In August of 2013, she underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy and was told that she had endometriosis once again. However, no biopsy was completed during this surgical procedure. The patient reported debilitating pain with associated rectal pain during her menses. Additionally, she had pain on intercourse with deep penetration. An ultrasound showed no evidence of an endometrioma, and magnetic resonance imaging was negative for the recto-vaginal endometriosis.\nAfter a thorough review of the signs and symptoms of endometriosis, as well as evaluation of pathophysiology and current management options, the patient opted to undergo a third diagnostic laparoscopy. The patient desired removal of endometriotic lesions if any were present. The patient underwent a robotic laparoscopy using the da-Vinci Si robot firefly mode, an integrated fluorescence imaging capability providing real-time image-guided identification of key anatomical landmarks using near-infrared technology, for identifying endometriotic lesions. The ureters were first identified bilaterally to avoid injury. In normal three-dimensional mode on the da-Vinci Si, the pelvis appears endometriosis free []. However, when correlating the patient's complaints with the Firefly mode on the da-Vinci Si, the endometriotic lesions appear as green vascular structures [].

On physical examination, we detected a spherical mass close to her uterine rectal nest, and she was referred to the Department of General Surgery at our hospital. Combined with the results of a needle biopsy, the mass was believed to have a smooth muscle origin, and surgery was scheduled.\nOn computed tomography, a mass sized approximately 11.2\u00d79.0cm was detected in her uterine rectal nest. We found varied density and low density shadows and a calcified separating strip. The edges of the lesion and separation showed obvious enhancement with enhanced scanning. The lesion was completely encapsulated. Her uterus, vagina, rectum and bladder pressure changed due to the tumor. There was no obvious pelvic lymph node enlargement and no pelvic effusion (Figure ).\nOur patient was prepared for surgery following our routine preoperative procedures. We placed our patient in the dorsal lithotomy position and made an approximately 20cm longitudinal caudal incision to her perineum. We performed a laminectomy, removing the third to the last sacral vertebrae, to access the posterior vaginal wall tumor. The tumor, including the capsule, was resected completely. The resected mass measured about 12.0\u00d79.5\u00d78.0cm, and two drains were inserted into the area from which the tumor had been removed (Figure ).\nThe histological pattern of the tumor was of a well-differentiated spindle cell sarcoma with pleomorphic areas.

He reported no other associated signs or symptoms. Upon general examination, the patient looked unwell, but no pallor, jaundice, or cyanosis was observed. His vital signs were all within the normal range. On neurological examination, he was conscious, oriented to time, place, and person, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 out of 15 and normal papillary reaction and size bilaterally. The patient had power grade 4+ in both the upper and lower right limbs, with normal tone and reflexes in all joints. Systemic review was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations including stool and urine general test results were unremarkable, so no further cerebral spinal fluid analysis was pursued. Initial plain head computed tomography (CT) showed a focal area of high density within the left parietal region. An MRI of the brain was then performed and showed a fairly well-defined 1.8 \u00d7 1 cm lobulated, cortical-based intra-axial lesion within the left posterior parietal region. The lesion demonstrated homogeneous enhancement and had associated moderate perilesional vasogenic edema with only a mild localized mass effect. No other focal lesions were seen (Fig. ). A list of possible differential diagnoses was made and included granulomatous lesion, lymphoma, a primary glial neoplasm, and less likely meningioma.\nMagnetic resonance spectroscopy, although nonspecific, demonstrated a choline peak suggestive of cell membrane turnover that can be seen in a number of different conditions including neoplasms, demyelination, inflammation, and gliosis. Correlating this with the patient age and history, an inflammatory lesion was thought to be more likely (Fig. ).

She started the CrossFit practice routine 2 months before the injury. The patient trained CrossFit three times a week without any other sport activity on the remaining week days. Olympic weightlifting (overhead movement) was described as the last activity before the acute pain started. The initial overhead load was 55 pounds and was part of a \u201cnovice\u201d training routine with reported adequate technique. One week prior to the CrossFit competition the patient was oriented to increase the Olympic weightlifting load to 75 pounds as a requirement for competition. Repetitions were set to her own limitation. After the injury, she stopped her exercises and applied ice to the shoulders and upper arms. During the following days, she experienced continuous pain and sought medical attention. Physical examination did not show any reduction of passive and active arcs of movements. Also, Jobe and Bear Hug tests were negative. There was only a mild ligamentous laxity and 10 degrees of elbow hyperextension. Her medical history did not include medications, prior fractures, neoplastic disease or prior surgery on the upper extremities. Also, she did not have history of anabolic or glucocorticoid steroid use. The patient\u2019s height was 1.53 m and weighted 54 Kg, with a BMI of 22.9 and was physically active for more than 3 years. She has never had CrossFit lessons or prior training. Before she started CrossFit practice, the patient used to swim three times a week in college, but did not participate in competitions.

This was followed up with an endoscopic ultrasound which revealed a 33 \u00d7 32 mm mass with well-defined borders involving the pancreatic head. No cystic areas were present within the mass. No other abnormalities were detected in the remainder of the pancreas, bile duct, or liver. A fine needle aspiration of the pancreatic mass was performed.\nDuring the next 3-4 weeks, the patient developed gradually worsening abdominal pain, fatigue, and weight loss. A repeat abdominopelvic imaging study revealed ascites and the pancreatic mass which had slightly enlarged. Cultures of the ascitic fluid grew Escherichia coli and hence antibiotic therapy was initiated. Impaired glucose tolerance was detected in the ensuing hospital stay.

The histology report was of a recurrent well differentiated thymic carcinoma (Fig. ).\nPostoperatively he developed acute renal impairment and peripheral oedema.

One month prior to admission, the patient was diagnosed at another institution with acute occlusion of the right above-knee popliteal artery, but thrombectomy at this facility was unsuccessful.\nSince this patient did not have an available or suitable autologous vascular conduit, he underwent right femoropopliteal arterial bypass with a prosthetic graft (GORE-TEX, W. L. Gore & Associates Inc., Newark, DE, USA). Although no immediate postoperative complications were observed, recurrent graft infections developed 1 and 4 months after surgery, and he presented with high fever (38.9\u2103). Blood and wound cultures were positive for MRSA. After continued antimicrobial therapy, the infected tissue, including the segment of the prosthetic graft, was completely debrided, and cryopreserved cadaveric iliac arterial allograft reconstruction was performed. Because antibiotic treatment had resulted in elevated serum creatinine concentrations, postoperative imaging was performed using Duplex ultrasonography, which showed patent flow in the femoro-popliteal arterial bypass graft.

However, a CT scan performed 4 years after surgery showed huge aneurysmal changes of the cadaveric allograft, suggestive of its deterioration and degeneration (). Since there was no evidence of recurrent arterial allograft infection, a new prosthetic graft (GORE-TEX) was implanted, and the cadaveric arterial allograft was resected ().

There was no associated fever, pain, voice changes, breathing difficulty, dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, and/or history of exposure to tuberculosis. There was a history of exposure to cats. Exposure to cats with the onset of symptoms in the patient led to cat scratch disease and fungal infections being included in the differential diagnosis.

Two foetuses joined at the chest and abdomen were identified by two-dimensional ultrasound, and further confirmation was made by three- and four-dimensional ultrasound. There was blood incompatibility between the parents (the husband was A+ whereas the mother was A\u2013). Anti-D was previously administered after delivery of her first child, a single viable healthy male baby. She had no history of abortion or miscarriage. Her height was 165 cm, weight 63 kg, looked normal, was neither anaemic nor hypertensive and had no history of chronic diseases.\nThe last menstrual date of this twin pregnancy was unknown. The mother did experience normal foetal movements. She had no vaginal discharge or hyperemesis gravidarum. Her abdomen was slightly large for the date of pregnancy. There was no family history of twins.\nA Voluson 730 ultrasound machine from GE Healthcare (Waukesha, WI) was used. The transabdominal ultrasound was performed and two conjoined female foetuses were detected; each foetus was with a single head and a pair of arms and legs. The twins were joined at the lower chest and the upper abdomen.
