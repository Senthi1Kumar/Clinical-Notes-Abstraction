Seventeen years earlier, she had undergone left thyroid lobectomy for a reportedly benign 4 \u00d7 4 cm colloid nodule.

The pain remained unresolved after physical therapy and she began to develop new symptoms of numbness and tingling in her left lower extremity.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the patient's spine and pelvis revealed a 6.3 \u00d7 4.1 mm lytic sacral lesion in S-1 compressing the spinal canal () and an iliac tumor highly suggestive of metastatic disease. She underwent computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which revealed multiple subcentimeter pulmonary nodules and low-attenuation lesions in the liver. Subsequent biopsy of the sacral lesion revealed metastatic FTC; immunohistochemical staining of the specimen was positive for thyroid transcription factor-1.\nThe patient reported only mild anterior rib and left hip pain with numbness radiating down her left leg. On physical examination, she had an absent left thyroid lobe, no palpable masses in the right thyroid lobe and no lymphadenopathy. Neurologic exam was grossly normal with full power and intact sensation throughout, normal reflexes, and no clonus. She ambulated without difficulty and only had some mild pain on palpation of the sciatic notch.\nNeurosurgical evaluation noted significant epidural disease which had transferred pressure to the left S1 nerve root, causing mild radicular symptoms. However, because the sacral lesion was not causing significant bone destruction or evidence of spinal instability, it was felt there was no immediate indication for surgical intervention. Neurosurgical recommendations included treating the patient with selective external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or RAI. Head and neck surgery also evaluated the patient for completion thyroidectomy to facilitate treatment of distant metastatic disease with RAI.\nPresurgical",

On examination, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 0, and the ABCD2 (A: age; B: blood pressure at presentation; C: clinical features; D: duration of symptoms) score was 0. The presence of diabetes (1 point) score was 3. There was carotid bruit bilaterally with higher intensity on the right and no focal neurological deficits. Stroke alert was called initially in the emergency department. A stat computed tomography (CT) brain revealed no acute intracranial abnormalities. The patient was not a candidate for alteplase, as the NIHSS is 0 and the symptoms had resolved, and aspirin 325 mg was given immediately. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain was done the same day and showed no acute ischemic or hemorrhagic infarct. We diagnosed the patient with a transient ischemic attack, and further workup was initiated to evaluate the underlying cause. The 12-lead electrocardiogram and cardiac monitoring showed no dysrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation. The transthoracic echocardiogram ruled out any intracardiac source of emboli. The carotid ultrasound revealed 50%-69% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery and no stenosis in the right carotid system.

After transfer to this institution, she developed ischemic bowel that required right hemicolectomy and primary ileocolonic resection.\nThe patient's postoperative course was complicated by abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting. Follow-up imaging including a CT scan (Figures and ) showed a significantly distended stomach and gastric volvulus with the antrum located above the diaphragm. An upper GI series (Figures and ) confirmed these findings and she was brought to the endoscopy suite. An upper endoscopy (performed by LHJ) using an adult GIF-H180 revealed a sliding hiatal hernia and a U-shaped stomach. The endoscope had to be retroflexed and advanced adjacent to the gastroesophageal junction to enter the antrum. As the endoscope was advanced through the pylorus into the duodenum, the stomach was noted to assume its normal orientation. Under fluoroscopy, a stiff Jagwire was placed in the duodenum to help maintain this position, but withdrawal of the endoscope caused the antrum to prolapse back into the intrathoracic cavity. At this time, the decision was made to push down the greater curvature of the stomach with the endoscope and straighten out the gastric antrum. This scope was then detached from the processor and left in this position with the tip in the second portion of the duodenum, in the long position, to keep the entire stomach under the diaphragm. A second 4.9 mm pediatric endoscope was advanced alongside the adult endoscope and used to complete percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement for anterior gastropexy. We noted that the previously seen prolapse of the gastric antrum through the diaphragmatic defect into the intrathoracic region was no longer seen. The antrum maintained its position and the previously seen U-shaped stomach was less tortuous. Both endoscopes were then withdrawn and there were no complications from this procedure",

The main reason for consuming sunflower seeds was that it was easily accessible as her father was a farmer and grew sunflower.\nOn further inquiry, a positive family history was reported. The patient told that her brother, sister, mother, grandfather, and her husband were all having the same habit of consuming sunflower seeds in a similar manner from the past 30 to 35 years.\nRegarding oral hygiene practices, the patient used a soft-bristled toothbrush and toothpaste for cleaning her teeth since childhood. She brushed twice daily for about 2\u20133 min in a vertical direction. She cleaned her tongue with the toothbrush itself. No other oral hygiene aids were used.\nOn intraoral examination, all permanent teeth were present. Patient had fair oral hygiene and no carious lesions. Mild calculus was present in the lingual aspect of lower anterior teeth. No pockets or loss of attachment was detected. Further examination of anterior teeth revealed a prominent notching on the incisal edges of upper and lower incisors []. The lesions were symmetrical and complimentary in their location to each other. The lesion extended to about 2 mm in depth in enamel. None of the posterior teeth showed any sign of wear. The case revealed no history of dentinal hypersensitivity in affected location. Informed written consent was obtained from the patient to click and publish photographs of her teeth. Since all",

    "original_text": "A 49-year-old nonsmoking male presented to the dental office complaining of missing maxillary right lateral incisor []. The tooth was extracted 2 months before presenting to the clinic due to root fracture. Previous dental history revealed that the tooth had received a root canal treatment and had a postretained crown. A removable partial denture was fabricated for him by his previous dentist immediately after extraction to restore the space of the extracted maxillary lateral incisor.\nRadiographic examination revealed a socket of recently extracted maxillary lateral incisor with bone level 2\u20133 mm below the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) of the adjacent teeth []. Intra-oral examination revealed a fair oral hygiene with 1\u20132 mm recession of the gingival margin below the CEJ. The space available of the area related to maxillary lateral incisor was 6 mm mesio-distally and 7 mm interocclusal distance. Upon presentation of the various options of treatments, the patient opted to restore the space with implant treatment. Clinically, there was enough bone to place an implant size 3.5\u20134 mm. Radiographically, enough bone height was available to receive up to 13 mm implant. The decision was made to proceed with a single implant to restore the space of the maxillary right lateral incisor and to maintain and to create natural soft tissue contour and emergence profile around the tooth to improve esthetic.\nMaxillary and mandibular study models with a face bow transfer were obtained, and a diagnostic waxing of the maxillary lateral incisor was performed. A surgical guide was then fabricated to insure proper position of the implant during placement procedure.

Extrahepatic PH was manifested with ascites, splenomegaly, and bleeding episodes from grade II oesophageal varices. The latter was treated by endoscopic sclerotherapy . At the time of initial presentation spiral computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen depicted a superior mesenteric and portal vein thrombosis in addition to cavernomatous transformation of the portal vein. Her family history was negative for thromboembolic events while she denied the use of oral contraceptive at the time of presentation. After diagnosis she was started on phenprocoumon for anticoagulation, which however discontinued because of episodes of variceal bleeding. A beta-blocker and nitrate were also administered for the treatment of portal hypertension. Six months following the initial presentation the patient started to complain of recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant pain, typically of biliary origin.

He underwent cadaveric renal transplantation to the right lower abdomen without complications. The early postoperative course was uneventful. The patient maintained the adequate urine output. The creatinine level decreased to 1.0. However, on the ninth postoperative day, he experienced sudden pain and swelling in his scrotum, with a drop in a urine output to nearly zero. His creatinine levels abruptly climbed from a nadir of 0.9 to 3.4 over 4 days. The patient's scrotum was markedly dilated with scrotal cutaneous urine leaks. The patient underwent an ultrasound examination, showing the normal looking kidney in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen with normal perfusion and no evidence of hydronephrosis or a perinephric fluid collection. On the next day, the patient underwent Tc-99 m MAG3 radionuclide renography which showed normal renal flow and function with a complete drainage of activity from the renal collecting system to what looked like the urinary bladder. In addition, there was an evident urine leak and an accumulation of radiotracer activity in the pelvic floor extending below the pelvic floor. However, the exact location of the urine leak was unknown (Figure and ). SPECT/CT imaging of the pelvis was obtained to evaluate the exact location and extent of the urine leak. The low dose noncontrast CT was obtained for the purpose of anatomic co-registration with the SPECT images.

She has experienced severe dystonia especially in her neck and both upper extremities; Dystonia Rating Scale (DRS) score was 66 points on the dystonia movement scale and 19 points on the disability scale. Spasticity was identified as grade 2 in the right upper extremity, grade 1+ in left upper extremity, and grade 1 in both lower extremities on the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS).

    "original_text": "A 64-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and arrhythmia presented to the emergency room with severe pain and immobility in her left elbow, which resulted from a previous traffic accident. The patient complained of severe, painful limitation of motion on straightening or bending of the elbows, and her left hand was heavily bruised and swollen. Physical examination using palpation revealed burning and local tenderness. X-ray revealed a displaced fracture of the left olecranon with soft tissue swelling. The fracture was defined as a type IIA olecranon fracture according to the Mayo classification system.[ The orthopedic specialist suggested surgical open reduction with internal fixation, but the patient hesitated under the consideration of increased surgical risk due to her history of hypertension and arrhythmia. Therefore, the orthopedic surgeon fixed her left elbow with protective clothing only. Later that day, she visited our outpatient clinic to seek help from TCM.\nIn the first visit, we used the TCM methods for manipulative reduction of the fracture after physical examination. The physician held the patient's left palm in one hand and held the left elbow of the patient in the other hand. Next, the doctor pushed the proximal end of the patient's elbow with his finger to move closer to the distal end, and at the same time, straightened the patient's elbow slowly. Finally, the patient slowly buckled the elbow to 60\u00b0. It was then braced securely. We also asked the patient to avoid flexion and extension activities of the elbow and to fix the elbow with protective clothing for about 1 month, until her fracture had healed. That duration depended on X-ray interpretation to ensure complete union of the fracture.

He was the fourth child of parents with normal pregnancy and childbirth (). Although his older brother had similar symptoms, we were unable to collect the data because he died from a severe accident in the previous year. The proband had no history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and syphilis, which are common risk factors for Charcot neuroarthropathy. However, he reported that he had been unable to respond to pain since birth. When he was 1 year old, he often bit his fingers without any sensation of pain; later, his parents noticed that he was incapable of experiencing pain. When he was 10 years old, he repeatedly suffered painless fractures and got burned unknowingly. When he started smoking, he often burned his fingers with lit cigarettes but did not experience pain (). Furthermore, he did not experience pain due to extreme heat or cold, although he could distinguish between hot and cold sensations. However, the proband had a complete sense of smell as he could distinguish smells of water, alcohol, or white vinegar. In his 30 s, he developed multiple joint swelling, instability, and deformities caused by repetitive microtrauma and painless fractures (). Bone and joint destruction induced a severe negative impact on the quality of his life.\nDetailed physical examination revealed swelling in the right knee, left ankle, and right elbow joint; reduced right knee flexion; valgus deformity; and left ankle varus. Skin ulcers were noted on the right knee and on the lateral side of the left ankle (). A neurological examination indicated normal cognitive function ().

The patient had generalized fatigue for over a year. At the age of 30, the patient had symptoms of dyspnoea and painful nodular swellings over her legs. During that time, sarcoidosis was suspected and was confirmed by lung biopsy. For the fear of adverse effects, she had declined steroid treatment. The patient had occasional flares since then until a year later, when she suffered from exacerbation of sarcoidosis in the form of polyarthritis, generalized fatigue, dyspnoea, fever and nodular swelling over legs. The patient again declined steroids and chose to remain on naproxen. Her symptoms had improved over a period of time except the generalized fatigue. She also had diabetes mellitus diagnosed at the same time, which was well controlled with metformin.\nA neurological examination revealed a right-sided partial ptosis, and compensatory pseudo- retraction of the left eyelid (Figure ). Diplopia was noticed on right lateral gaze due to right lateral rectus weakness. Fluctuations in diplopia and ptosis were noticed during her hospital stay. The patient did not have any bulbar symptoms like dysphagia or dysphonia. But she was having generalized weakness in all her extremities, both proximal and distal, with marked diurnal variation in the form of more weakness during the evening.\nDuring her hospital stay she developed respiratory distress and hypoxemia. A chest CT scan demonstrated a 7 cm necrotic mass in the left anterior mediastinum and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure ). Pulmonary function tests revealed restrictive lung disease and moderately decreased diffusion capacity.

A colonoscopy revealed ascending colon cancer, and she was referred to our hospital. She had no previous history of abnormal bleeding. Her brother had pointed out any abnormalities in his blood coagulation test; however, we could not find the details because he had already died. Her family history except the brother was negative for bleeding tendencies, purpura, and hemophilia. She did not smoke or drink alcohol. She had no allergies. A total colonoscopy showed an ascending colon tumor with severe stenosis (Fig. ). Computed tomography revealed the wall thickness of the ascending colon (Fig. ). There were no distant metastases on the liver or lungs. Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT 93.9 s) was found incidentally during a routine preoperative examination. However, the prothrombin time (11.2 s), platelet count (480 \u00d7 103/L), and liver function test results were all within normal limits. We conducted a cross mixing test, and she was diagnosed with a deficiency pattern (Fig. ). The activities of factors VIII, IX, XII, and von Willebrand factor were normal. The plasma activity of FXI was 3%, and the diagnosis of FXI deficiency was confirmed. It took about 2 weeks from confirmation of an abnormal APTT time to diagnosis of FXI deficiency. A total of eight units of FFP were transfused for 2 days before the operation. After the transfusion, APTT improved to 37 s, and FXI also increased from 3% to 25% as a result (Fig. ).\nIt takes about 3 days to obtain the result of FXI plasma activity in our hospital.

He was mostly preoccupied and used to walk about in his room or brood or occasionally goes out to the yard and even during these brief visits to the yard, he avoids interacting with anybody. He had no history of any muttering to self or laughing to self. There was no history of fear of being harmed, suspicion of being controlled or history of hearing voices. There was no history suggestive of any first rank symptoms. He did not have any depressive, anxiety or manic features. There was also no history of any repeated ritualistic behavior.

The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) blood test was 90. A CT was performed in December of 2016 and a single slice through the cancer is shown in . The mass measured 8 cm in greatest diameter. Its posterior borders suggested local penetration into adjacent retroperitoneal tissues. Lymph node involvement was suspect with a node greater than 1.5 cm in diameter.\nIn December of 2016 the patient was taken to the operating theater. By laparoscopic exploration no peritoneal or ovarian metastases were seen. The mass was mobilized by laparoscopic dissection and the proximal small bowel and ascending colon were divided without incident. The dissection posteriorly was difficult. To avoid damage to the right ureter a right ureteral stent was placed and the laparoscopic resection was converted to open [].\nThe pathology report showed a poorly differentiated T3N2M0 malignancy. The margins of resection were not involved by cancer. The patient recovered from the surgery without incident. CEA decreased to normal range.\nBecause of the positive lymph nodes, the patient was recommended for adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX regimen) []. In December of 2017, an increasing CEA blood test to 20 ng/ml was noted and a follow-up CT obtained. A mass was identified in the left mid-abdomen and was biopsied under CT guidance. Pathology showed adenocarcinoma that was histologically the same as the primary caecal malignancy. A full course of 5-fluorouracil with irinotecan (FOLFIRI) was administered [].

Significant medical history included prostate cancer, hyperlipidemia, benign hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and tobacco use. Clinical evaluation revealed an intraoral swelling in the right floor of the mouth with smooth benign appearing mucosa.

He initially noticed lesions on the face which spread to involve the neck and both forearms and hands. The lesions were associated with moderate to severe itching which increased on sun exposure. There was history of such episodic appearance of lesions for the last four to five months. He was taking docetaxel injections for prostate cancer once in three weeks since five months. The lesions had initially appeared two to three days after the first injection, according to his case history. Subsequently they would fade in two weeks but again flare up after the next injection. The patient was not administered any other drug simultaneously for the same disease or for any other associated or non associated disease condition.\nOn examination, violaceous, well defined, non scaly, non tender plaques were present on the dorsum of hands, extensor surface of forearms, face and front of neck [Figures and ]. Only the photo exposed parts of the face were involved. Systemic examination was within normal limits. A clinical diagnosis of drug induced photolichenoid eruption with differential diagnosis of discoid lupus erythematosus was kept in mind. On investigating, the patient had microcytic hypochromic anemia with hemoglobin of 9.8gm%.

Intermittent lower abdominal pain occurred 2 years ago for the first time. She was investigated in the emergency department a few times. The pain gradually increased over the time. Physical examination revealed that the patient was well and no physical changes were identified. CT scan revealed a clearly defined, hypodensic, cystic, without clear solid components mass, about 11 cm \u00d7 10 cm \u00d7 6,5 cm, ventrally reaching the right side of abdomen wall, dorsally contacting abdominal aorta, inferior vena cava and right common iliac artery, caudally lying on the ileocolic artery and vein ( and ). The mass extended from pancreatic head and superior mesenteric vein near ileum to right iliac area along the ileocolic artery and vein. Lymphangioma of the ileum mesentery was suspected. Also, an atypical anatomy of the celiac trunk was detected.\nAfter multidisciplinary team discussion the decision was made to proceed with the surgical treatment. Midline laparotomy was performed. A cystic lymph-filled tumor about 12 cm in diameter was detected in the abdominal cavity within the mesentery (). The tumor was dissected from the surrounding structures with vessel sealing device. Right ileocolic artery and vein were freed from the tissues of lymphangioma (). No extravasation of the lymph flow was observed after removal of the mass.\nOn pathological examination, the macroscopically observed partially opened fatty-fibrous cystic formation 9 cm \u00d7 5 cm \u00d7 3 cm was identified. Cysts of up to 2 cm filled with whitish, turbid substance were visible. 6 lymph nodes up to 0.5 cm were excised alongside with the lymphangioma.

She had a history of subarachnoid haemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm in the terminal region of her basilar artery and an unruptured aneurysm of her anterior communicating artery. She had undergone cerebral embolization 6 months earlier. On clinical examination she presented with gait disorders associated with cognitive impairment. Computed tomography found hydrocephalus. She was admitted to our neurosurgery unit for a depletive lumbar puncture (50cc). Twelve hours after the procedure, she experienced complete and proportional right hemiplegia, confusion, deviation of her head and eyes to the right, and cortical blindness. She also had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure which ceased with a dose of clonazepam. Her blood pressure at that time was normal. Emergency cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bioccipital and left-side basal ganglia hyperintensities in the fluid attenuated inversion recovery and the diffusion-weighted images (Figures , and ). We observed a high apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) suggesting vasogenic oedema. The above MRI image findings are consistent with a radiological diagnosis of PRES. We implemented antiepileptic therapy, calcium channel blockers to prevent vasospasm and antiplatelet therapy to prevent ischemia.\nWe noticed a pronounced improvement concerning her neurological deficit in the first 2 days and almost complete recovery of motor disorders after 5 days. Her vision problems persisted with minimal recovery of central vision. She also had massive amnesia.\nAfter a positive progression for 5 days, she had perseverations and automatism with difficulty to make contact.\nElectroencephalography showed posterior slow waves without any spikes.\nHer evolution was successful with appropriate antiepileptic therapy.

He underwent surgical excision of the tumor in March 2018. He was apparently well for 6 months postsurgery when he developed recurrence at the original site of treatment and oligometastasis to the lungs. He was advised amputation by the plastic surgeon as a treatment for pain control which the patient refused. On January 21, 2019, he presented to the emergency department with a history of massive bleed from the tumor site followed by drowsiness since the preceding 2 days. He was apparently well 2 days prior to the incident, when he noticed that his pajama was stained with blood. He consulted a local physician who advised him to apply pressure over the area. This helped to arrest the bleed, and the rest of the day was uneventful. Next day morning, his family members found him soaked in blood with sluggish response to verbal calling thus rushed him to the emergency department. On examining him, he had a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, pulse rate of 125/min, and respiratory rate of 24/min. He had severe pallor and edema of the right lower limb. Other general and systemic examinations were unremarkable. He was found to have a large nonhealing ulcer of 7 cm \u00d7 4 cm \u00d7 4 cm on the medial aspect of the lower half of the right thigh with continuous oozing of large-volume blood from the site. On investigating further, he was found to have hemoglobin of 5.2 g/dl and other counts and electrolytes were unremarkable.
