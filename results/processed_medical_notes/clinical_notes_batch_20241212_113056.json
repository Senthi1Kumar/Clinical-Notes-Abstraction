    "original_text": "An 87-year-old man was referred to the office by a urologist with a chief complaint of right groin pain and enlarging scrotal bulge that had been present for two months. He initially sought urologic consultation with the same complaint, as he already had an established relationship with his urologist. His medical history was notable for hypertension, hypothyroidism, and prostate cancer, for which he underwent radiation treatment three years prior. His surgical history was notable for an open left inguinal hernia repair with mesh and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. On physical exam, the patient had chronically incarcerated right inguinal hernia that was not reducible. The patient's laboratory workup was unremarkable with a normal renal function and a normal urinalysis. An outpatient CT scan one month before evaluation had shown a right nephroptosis, hydronephrosis, and hydroureter (Figure ) with part of the right ureter inside the right inguinal canal (Figure ).\nAfter discussing management with the patient, the decision was made to proceed with laparoscopic repair of the hernia with preoperative cystoscopy, retrograde pyelogram, and ureteral stent placement. The patient was placed in a lithotomy position, and cystoscopy with a retrograde pyelogram was performed. The ureter looped down into the scrotum (Figure ) and then turned back up into the retroperitoneum into its normal anatomic position. Wire passage was attempted into the renal pelvis but was unsuccessful due to significant angulation and tortuosity of the ureter. A 6 mm x 30 mm Polaris stent (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) was deployed in the distal ureter (Figure ). We then proceeded with the laparoscopic portion of the case by placing a 12 mm port in a supraumbilical position and two 5 mm flank ports. A peritoneal flap was developed, and a substantial amount of preperitoneal fat was observed protruding through the defect. Using gentle manual pressure and endoscopic traction, we were able to reduce the hernia sac contents",

She subsequently underwent numerous synovectomies to treat local recurrences and radiation therapy to her left knee joint at age 15. Ultimately, her disease spread to her upper calf and posterior thigh. At age 32, her upper calf lesion was resected, and the tumor in her posterior thigh was treated with radiation. At age 34, swelling of an inguinal lymph node was noted and fine needle aspiration was consistent with malignant TGCT. Other staging scans revealed a pelvic mass and a sub-centimeter pulmonary nodule. Her disease remained stable after four cycles of doxorubicin/ifosfamide and she subsequently received gemcitabine/docetaxel as well as radiation therapy to her pelvis with stable disease for three months. She underwent left-sided above the knee amputation and excision of the intrapelvic masses. Eight months later, enlarging pulmonary nodules were resected. She was treated with sirolimus (rapamycin) and remained disease-free for eight months until a pulmonary nodule and two inguinal masses were noted. In 2007, at age 37, she was referred to our hospital and treated with sorafenib for four months with mixed response. She subsequently began on sunitinib 37.5 mg daily. Interval restaging scans showed no evidence of progressive disease for 15 months. She had significant interval progression of a right-sided pelvic mass while she temporarily stopped sunitinib in the perioperative setting of resection of painful metastatic nodules near the amputation stump (Fig. a, b, and c). Given that the drug had a significant role of controlling the disease, her sunitinib was restarted in combination with sirolimus (rapamycin). Her disease was under good control for eight additional months until she had progressive disease in the pelvis and underwent hemipelvectomy. She died of the disease at age of 39, six years after the malignant transformation.",

Her most recent CS was complicated by intraoperative cardiac arrest requiring eight minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation prior to return of spontaneous circulation. The presumed cause was pulmonary embolism (PE); however, this was following a successful neuraxial block, and therefore the cause may have been hypotension that was not immediately recognized because of the patient habitus. Following this complication, the patient required a week-long intensive care unit (ICU) stay leading to significant deconditioning on top of her already morbidly obese state. Upon discharge, the patient was mostly bedbound, which led to a weight gain of over 250 pounds. Her prenatal care consisted solely of a single obstetric visit with ultrasound at 12 weeks. Social history was positive for marijuana use during pregnancy.\nWhen she presented initially to our institution at a gestational age of 38 weeks 2 days, she complained of worsening shortness of breath. Given her prior history of possible PE, limited mobility, and atrial fibrillation without anticoagulation, suspicion for repeat PE was very high. However, she could not undergo computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPE) study, as a 500-pound weight limit precluded her from fitting in the scanner.

We then extracted about 20 mL of fluid from the cyst. The follow-up magnetic resonance imaging on the same day indicated the cyst did not become smaller (Fig. ). A \u201cone-way valve\u201d fistula was suspected such that cerebral spinal fluid could pass into the cystic space from the subarachnoid space but could not flow in the opposite manner. Therefore we designed a procedure to localize the fistula. We penetrated two needles into the cyst and subarachnoid space separately in the L3/L4 level under digital subtraction angiography (Fig. ). Pending the fluid drained through those two needles, we injected 10 mL of contrast medium slowly into the subarachnoid space and a little contrast medium infiltrated into the cystic space horizontally at the T12/L1 level.

    "original_text": "A 24-year-old girl was referred to the outpatient department because of one-month history of acid regurgitation and abdominal pain. The patient was born with an eyeball atrophy and blindness of the right eye but denied other concomitant diseases. She was two weeks premature. Her sister was delivered full-term and healthy. No drug has been applied in the past 3 months. Physical examination showed increased intensity of pulmonary second sound and systolic murmur at the 2nd to 4th intercostal space near the left sternal border. No positive abdominal sign was found. Upper gastrointestinal barium examination revealed that the folds of esophagus were continuous, while the wall was soft, and the peristalsis and evacuation were normal. No stenosis or filling defects were found. The stomach was low tension and hook-shaped, while the mucosal appearance was quite normal. Unexpectedly, the pylorus and duodenal bulb were invisible. Barium was going through the duodenal loop with a high speed. Abdominal computed tomography was further complemented, but no other malformations were found (Fig. A,B).\nGastroendoscopy played a decisive role in diagnosis, which revealed bile reflux into the esophagus and mucosal breaks involving at least 75% of the esophageal circumference at 32 cm from the incisors. Consistently, we found that the pyloric channel and duodenal bulb were absent, and the duodenal mucosa characterized by villi was adjacent to the lower body of the stomach. Involuntary retrograde passage of bile was draining out from the exposed papilla due to a lack of pyloric constraint (Fig. A-C).

    "cleaned_text": "a 24-year-old girl was referred to the outpatient department because of one-month history of acid regurgitation and abdominal pain. the patient was born with an eyeball atrophy and blindness of the right eye but denied other concomitant diseases. she was two weeks premature. her sister was delivered full-term and healthy. no drug has been applied in the past 3 months. physical examination showed increased intensity of pulmonary second sound and systolic murmur at the 2nd to 4th intercostal space near the left sternal border. no positive abdominal sign was found. upper gastrointestinal barium examination revealed that the folds of esophagus were continuous, while the wall was soft, and the peristalsis and evacuation were normal. no stenosis or filling defects were found. the stomach was low tension and hook-shaped, while the mucosal appearance was quite normal. unexpectedly, the pylorus and duodenal bulb were invisible. barium was going through the duodenal loop with a high speed. abdominal computed tomography was further complemented, but no other malformations were found (fig. a,b).\ngastroendoscopy played a decisive role in diagnosis, which revealed bile reflux into the esophagus and mucosal breaks involving at least 75% of the esophageal circumference at 32 cm from the incisors. consistently, we found that the pyloric channel and duodenal bulb were absent, and the duodenal mucosa characterized by villi was adjacent to the lower body of the stomach. involuntary retrograde passage of bile was draining out from the exposed papilla due to a lack of pyloric constraint (fig. a-c). apparently, these congenital defects contributed to gastroesophageal reflux disease and caused severe acid regurgitation. doppler echocardiography revealed both atrial and ventricular septal defects, with sizes of 0.9 cm and 0.36 cm, respectively. we doubted if there was a potential genetic association between multiple variations.\ndna sample preparation (the proband, her parents, and sister), exome capture, and bioinformatics analysis were performed as previously described.[ briefly",

About 2-3 days later, there was spontaneous recovery of vision, but diplopia recovered over next 5-6 months. About 14 months later, he had another (second) episode that was in July 1999 in the form of acute onset gradually progressive imbalance while walking with a tendency to fall on either side, but more towards the left, also, felt mild weakness of left lower limb. At the onset, his symptoms were very subtle which progressed over next 6 months when there was also change in speech. The speech was slurred with intermittent scanning and abrupt loudness of voice. At this time, the patient was admitted and was diagnosed to have RRMS and was given pulse injection methylprednisolone (1 gm intravenous once daily for 5 days) at another hospital. He completely recovered within 3-4 months. He remained asymptomatic for the next 2 years (January 2000-December 2002). By the end of December 2002, he developed (third episode) subacute onset and progressive gait instability, which progressed over next 6months. He was admitted and underwent relevant and extensive investigations. During this period of progression, injection Rebiff was initiated, but the patient could tolerate only four doses and was discontinued due to intolerable fever and myalgia. His symptom was progressive and was admitted under our care in May 2003. During the hospital course, detailed work-up was done and his MS was of secondary progressive type (SPMS).

    "original_text": "A four-year-old Japanese girl with no remarkable medical history was referred to our orthopedic clinic for treatment of 2 cm of LLD. She had a two-year history of progressive LM in a wide range of the posteromedial aspect of the right thigh and the medial aspect of the right lower leg. At the first presentation, skin lesions exhibited hyperpigmentation, induration, and xerosis. The range of motion of the right knee was full extension to 80\u00b0 of flexion. Radiographs of the right lower extremity revealed dysplastic/atrophic femur and tibia. LLD increased with time and reached nearly 10 cm at seven years of age (). As she and her parents refused to undergo epiphysiodesis of the unaffected side of the lower extremity, we performed simultaneous lengthening of the right femur and tibia using a unilateral external fixator (EBI/Zimmer Biomet Carbon Rail Deformity System; Warsaw, Indiana, USA). She had taken low-dose prednisolone every day or every second day prior to the first lengthening procedure. The dosage regimen had been dependent on the disease activity based on clinical and thermographic assessment. Tibial osteotomy was performed with the Gigli saw, whereas femoral osteotomy was done with a multiple drilling technique. No postoperative immobilization was used, and full-weight bearing was encouraged from the second postoperative day. After 14 days of the waiting period, distraction of the femur and tibia was commenced at a rate of 1 mm and 0.5 mm per day, respectively. Femur was lengthened at the same rate throughout the distraction period, whereas the distraction speed of the tibia was gradually decreased after the lengthening callus showed thin and sparse on radiographs.

She had a subcutaneous induration with a diameter of 5 \u00d7 12 mm, below the right mandibular angle (). Recurrent inflammation had been persisting for a year. Pediatrist had followed her with a diagnosis of recurrent parotitis. Previously, CT () and MRI images had been taken and the radiologist found small calcifications in her right parotid gland but no sign of parotitis, cysts or fistula. No other abnormality, including extra auricular canal, was detected. No particular family history was recorded.\nUnder general anesthesia, the ablative operation was performed. Christal violet ink was used to dye inside of the cavity. Beneath the induration was observed a string structure, halfway dyed, adhering to the fascia on the sternocleidomastoid muscle (). With a part of the fascia, the string was pursued but could be followed no further than the frontier border of the muscle. The wound was closed primarily.\nIn the histological report, only fibrous scar was found without a sign of fistula or epithelial cells ().\nA year after the surgery, small subcutaneous infection with pus appeared on the scar. Oral administration of antibiotics was able to control it. Though it appeared every 3\u20136 months, still no sign of fistula could be found by CT scan. To the parents, a high possibility of the residual first branchial cleft fistula was explained. Total resection of the fistula was suggested with a potential risk of facial nerve palsy.

On the third day, she was suffering from vomiting five times in three hours, which ultimately weaken the patient. After four days of fever and headache, she consulted a doctor who had prescribed her paracetamol and advised to perform some clinical investigations such as complete blood count (CBC), dengue NS1, and the Widal test. The Widal test report was found to be negative, but the dengue NS1 test was reported positive. After consultation with the doctor, she got admitted to the hospital.\nAfter hospitalization, all the tests were conducted again, including the immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody test and the factor VIII test. The results confirmed DF along with haemophilia A. On examination, the patient was found to be severely dehydrated with low blood pressure (60/85 mmHg) and was managed with continuous intravenous infusion of a multivitamin containing normal saline.

Rest of the systemic review was unremarkable. His general physical and systemic examination was normal. His right shoulder joint movements were restricted especially abduction and he could not abduct his arm more than 90 degrees. He also has two swellings over the scalp on the right side.\nDiagnosis\nOn the basis of his symptoms, an X-ray for shoulder joint along with skeletal survey was advised (Figure ) which showed lytic lesions in the right humerus, right distal femur, and right iliac bone.\nHe subsequently had an MRI of the right shoulder joint (Figure ), which showed scapular soft tissue mass, humeral lesion showing significant uptake, suggestive of metastatic disease. The patient was hospitalized to the ward for further evaluation and pain management.\nTo assess the disease burden, the patient had a PET CT (Figure A-D) which showed abnormal fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake involving multiple bones (lytic and sclerotic in nature involving right rib, humerus, femur, and tibia) a soft tissue deposit involving the right side of skull with the suspicion of brain involvement, as well small nodules in both lungs.

It had worsened dramatically with shortness of breath on mild exertion and fever with chills 15 days prior to the patient seeking medical attention. He also noticed difficulty in taking steps around one month ago that progressively worsened to involve weakness in lower limbs around the same time his cough worsened.\nOn examination, he was found to have generalized muscle wasting and was cachectic, he had bilateral foot-drop (Figure ) as he was walking with a high steppage gait.

    "original_text": "A 34-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department with complaints of right hemiparesis, numbness, dysphagia, and ataxia. These complaints began as numbness over her right scapular area two weeks prior, and the numbness later progressed to include the right leg. Additionally, she reported five days of waking up during the night with severe headaches. Although she reported a history of migraines, which were usually accompanied by an aura, she stated that these new headaches were different in nature. She also had no known allergies and no previous surgeries. Her mother had a history of breast cancer, and her father had a history of ischemic heart disease. A review of systems was otherwise negative. After workup in the emergency department and consultation by neurology, she was referred to neurosurgery for management of a high-grade brainstem tumor.\nExamination\nOn initial presentation, the patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15. Her pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. Cranial nerves II-XII were grossly intact. Motor testing revealed that strength was 5/5 in both upper and lower extremities. Pronator drift was noted in the right upper extremity. Dysmetria was noted in the right upper extremity during finger-to-nose testing, and discrimination of fine touch was subjectively diminished on the entire right side from the zygomatic process to the foot. Patellar reflexes were 3+ bilaterally. Over the course of her initial admission, the patient demonstrated a progressive decline, to include mild left facial droop, dysarthria, and a worsening dysphagia.

The major port incision was on the anterior axillary line of the 3rd intercostal space and was 4 cm in length. No adhesions were present in the pleural cavity. Two bullae were found at the apex of left lung and were resected with an endostapler without complications.

Microscopic examination revealed monocytes (750 \u00d7 106 cells/L) and erythrocytes (450 \u00d7 106 cells/L), but no neutrophils. After the patient ingested Sudan black, the leakage turned blue (Figure ). A diagnosis of chyle leakage from the incision was thus made. Dynamic lymphoscintigraphy was performed after intradermal injection of Tc-99 m sodium phytate in each foot. Approximately 60 min after injection, tracer accumulation in the bilateral inguinal lymph nodes was captured.

She was unable to walk after the procedure which was in fact a new complaint after kyphoplasty. Referring physician informed about difficulty while taking entry into both the pedicles at L3 and L4. The procedure was performed with uniportal entry into pedicles. Examination revealed positive straight leg raising test in lower limbs, paresthesia and weakness in the both thigh and leg (muscle power: Grade 3) below L3, and restricted lumbar spine motion due to low back pain. Roentgenographic images (Figure ) showed the post procedure radiogram of lumbar spine which could not reveal further information about complication. Therefore she was investigated with CT scan (Figure ) which showed intracanal extension of cement from L2-L4 and axial image exhibit significant compression of cord at all three levels. Cement leakage was found from medial pedicle wall of L3 (Figure ) which was extended along the posterior longitudinal ligament at L2-L4 levels causing severe compression of canal.\nSurgical intervention was required to relieve the intractable leg and back pain as well as neurologic deficits. However, due to chronic renal failure and poor cardiac function of patient, one-stage posterior approach was performed without instrumentation: laminectomy of L3-and L4 and partial laminectomy of L2 was performed to achieve decompression of cord (Figure ). Complete removal of cement was not tried. During operation we could find the pedicle breakage from medial wall at L3 from where cement was removed. Nerve root decompression was performed at L2-L4 levels bilaterally and posterolateral fusion was achieved with local bone mixed with allograft. The radiating pain was immediately relieved",

After BMT, she developed acute skin GVHD and was successfully treated with systemic tacrolimus (2 mg/day) and PSL (30 mg/day), which was tapered over almost 1 year. In early 2011, just after tapering of treatment for acute skin GVHD, she developed DED and transient difficulty opening her mouth, which was diagnosed as chronic ocular and oral GVHD.

At the first visit to Keio University Hospital in 2013, severe conjunctival fibrosis of the upper conjunctiva and fornix shortening, partial LSCD and conjunctivalization of the upper cornea on her right eye were observed (Fig. ) despite no sign of active systemic GVHD. BCVA was 20/100 in her right eye and 20/20 in her left eye. Therefore, we decided to perform AMT on the right eye. Conjunctival fibrotic tissue was removed from the upper fornix to the limbus, and AMT was performed as a substrate and to cover the ocular surface. The patient was able to undergo cataract surgery on the right eye 1 year after AMT as improvement of corneal clarity in the pupillary area of the right eye was achieved. Two years after AMT, there was only a minor recurrence of corneal conjunctivalization, and BCVA was 20/28 in her right eye.

On examination, his abdomen was slightly tender and bowel sounds were present. Initially, focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) showed mild intraperitoneal fluid in his pelvis. A subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of his abdomen revealed mild pelvic hemoperitoneum, but there was no definite solid or hollow visceral injury. So, he was admitted to the general ward for serial abdominal observation.

We kept him nil per mouth and a nasogastric tube was inserted. The intake and output chart was regularly calculated. Serial Hb monitoring showed a continuous fall in his Hb level during the following days. He continued to have altered rectal bleeding. On day 3 his Hb dropped to 6.1 gm/dl, despite having received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). He started to develop a mild fever with a temperature of 37.8 \u00b0C, tachycardia with a HR of 140 bpm, and the BP dropping to 70/40 mmHg. He was resuscitated and stabilized with intravenously administered crystalloid fluids and 2 units of PRBC. He did not require any inotropes or vasopressors. Due to this clinical deterioration, he was urgently taken to the operating room for further diagnostic and therapeutic management. The nasogastric tube revealed bile without hematemesis. After initiating general anesthesia, an on-table colonoscopy was performed to identify the bleeding site.

Conjunctival swabs were taken and sent to the microbiology laboratory for analysis. A day later the conjunctivitis had become bilateral and purulent. Several hours after the conjunctivitis became bilateral the patient also developed a sore throat. The previous swab cultures isolated Streptococcus pneumoniae as the infective pathogen. Three days later, the patient noticed tenderness and swelling of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the index finger in the left hand, which became progressively more swollen and tender over the next couple of days. The patient had become febrile; however, there were neither chills nor rigors. He was prescribed oral amoxicillin 500 mg TID and flucloxacillin 500 mg QID, in the belief this was septic arthritis.\nTwo days after the swelling started he was seen by a rheumatologist, who made a diagnosis of reactive arthritis. The patient was fully investigated (see following text and Table ). Plain X-ray showed a little soft tissue swelling over the proximal interphalangeal joint of the left index finger. The patient was negative for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-DNA antibodies and antinuclear antibodies; complement factors C3 and C4 were within the reference range. No pathogen could be grown in blood culture and joint aspiration (performed by the rheumatologist) yielded no synovial fluid. The patient was HLA-B27 negative. A firm diagnosis of reactive arthritis as a sequel to pneumococcal conjunctivitis was made. Anti-inflammatory drugs resolved the swelling and pain within 48 hours. The conjunctivitis had already recovered though the antibiotics were continued until the course was completed.",

There was initial improvement in the skin lesions and the elevated pre-admission serum levels of muscle-associated enzymes, including aspartate transaminase, creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, myoglobin and aldolase, decreased, but the muscle weakness persisted, albeit with some improvement. On further examination, colonoscopy study and histopathological examination revealed the presence of adenocarcinoma of the rectum; therefore, the patient was given a diagnosis of colon cancer-associated DM. She was treated with radical low anterior resection, and the final diagnosis was moderate differentiated adenocarcinoma, pT3N0M0, stage II rectal cancer. Following excision of the rectal cancer, the characteristic features of the skin rash and the muscle-associated enzyme levels improved and the patient was discharged home after a few days.

    "original_text": "A 34-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presented with the chief complaint of left facial numbness, left ear pain and decreased hearing in the left ear of three years duration. The patient had also been experiencing sharp and shooting pain in different areas of her left thigh. The pain was not associated with any weakness, tingling or numbness. Besides mild fatigue she denied having any fevers, night sweats or weight loss. Neurological physical examination was grossly intact except for sensory loss in the V2 (maxillary) and V3 (mandibular) distribution of trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V). Abdominal exam was without evidence of lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Given deficits in the sensory distribution of trigeminal nerve, she was initially evaluated by ear, nose and throat (ENT) and underwent two sequential minimally invasive surgeries for nasal polyps without significant resolution of her symptoms. She was subsequently referred to a neurologist and had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain performed.

At physical examination, no abdominal masses or ascites were detected. A pelvic ultrasound (US) was performed, and an adnexal cystic mass of 19 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 12 cm with solid component was observed in the area of the left adnexa. There was no ascites or any other abnormalities observed in the pelvic cavity. Serum CA-125 was 4.13 U/ml, and routine preoperative laboratory tests were obtained and reported as normal, as was the chest x-ray. A CT scan was conducted as part of the preoperative evaluation; the scan confirmed the US findings and revealed solid areas in a cystic tumor (Figures and ).\nAn exploratory laparotomy was performed with the diagnosis of a suspicious malignant adenexal mass. During the procedure, a tumor measuring 19 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 12 cm was found in the left retroperitoneal space, the tumor completely separated from the ovaries or other intrapelvic structures. Complete and intact removal of the lesion was obtained; this was sent for frozen section, and was subsequently reported as mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. At the time of the surgery, both ovaries and fallopian tubes were grossly normal, as were all intra-abdominal structures. The patient's postoperative course showed no complications or adverse events. Six courses of adjuvant chemotherapy were administered with carboplatinum at a dose of 6 area under the curve (AUC) and paclitaxel at 175 mgs/m2.

Three years earlier, he had undergone a pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy for a pancreatic mass. The diagnosis of the pancreatic mass was lymphoepithelial cyst.\nAt admission, blood chemistry tests showed slightly increased liver enzymes. The ultrasound examination revealed mild dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary ducts, which did not allow a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiographic intervention for balloon dilatation of the structured segment or biliary stenting. The magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) detected stricture at the HJ anastomosis and a gallstone in the common hepatic duct just above the bilioenteric anastomosis (). The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiography using double-balloon enteroscope, which was unsuccessful due to the sharp angle between the jejunal limb and the biliary tree. Thus, it was decided to perform surgery. During exploration, the HJ anastomosis was found to be narrowed and covered with a scattered fibrotic tissue, with an outer diameter of less than 7 mm and 2 to 3 mm length. In addition, a stone was palpated in the common hepatic duct just above the HJ anastomosis. The length of the remnant common hepatic duct from the hilar region to the HJ anastomosis was approximately 1.5 cm. We decided to perform a Heineke-Mikulicz strictureplasty.

She underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed severe multivessel coronary artery disease, including a nearly completely occluded right coronary artery with some collateral filling from the left, high-grade proximal left anterior descending (LAD) lesion, as well as circumflex arterial lesions in the first and second obtuse marginals.\nTransthoracic echocardiogram performed at our institution revealed moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an estimated ejection fraction of 25% to 30%, diastolic filling pattern consistent with Grade II diastolic dysfunction (pseudonormalization), moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, regional wall motion abnormalities, moderate ischemic MR, and moderate to severe MAC.\nThe patient was taken to the operating room and general anesthesia was induced uneventfully under multichannel invasive monitoring. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed with a 3D matrix-array probe (X7-2t transducer; Philips Healthcare, Andover, MA) that showed similar results as the preoperative transthoracic echocardiogram except for moderate to severe central MR.\nThe patient underwent an uneventful triple vessel CABG (left internal mammary artery to her LAD, saphenous vein graft to a dominant obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein graft to her acute marginal), as well as a mitral valve repair with a size 26 mm St Jude annuloplasty ring.
