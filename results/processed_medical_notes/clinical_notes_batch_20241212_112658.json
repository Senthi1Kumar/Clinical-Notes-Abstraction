Regular follow-ups showed no signs of recurrence until 1 week before admission when he developed progressive dyspnoea. Chest X-ray at a provincial hospital showed massive right lung pleural effusion and an anterior mediastinal mass was detected. His GP referred him to a tertiary level hospital for further care. Upon admission, hospital regulations stated that a patient who is over 15 years of age must be admitted to an adult ward; hence he was transferred to an internal medicine ward. During his first night, he witnessed the death of a patient who had a cardiac arrest. The nightshift team performed CPR, intubation, and various other lifesaving procedures. The boy witnessed all of this, and was deeply traumatised. After which, he had a complete psychotic breakdown and did not stop screaming until his doctor sedated him. When he woke up in the night, he continued screaming; thus he needed to be sedated again, and nurses had to put a curtain around his bed, blocking him off from the rest of the ward. At the time of his palliative care team consultation, the patient was restless with a palliative performance scale (PPS) of 40, and had suicidal tendencies. He kept screaming whenever he woke up, calling constantly for his mother to end his misery and yelling, \u201cI don\u2019t belong in this place\u201d.

The mass had heterogeneous contrast enhancement with central necrosis (Fig ). Based on these features, radiologist suggested a malignant tumor of the nasopharynx.\nA radiation oncologist evaluated the patient and investigations, and began radical chemo-radiation. However, the tumor did not regress despite receiving 20 Gray of radiation, and this led to a suspicion of a benign growth. On 25th March 2008, a fresh CT scan (Fig ) was done and it showed nasopharyngeal tumor with same features as pre radiotherapy but increased considerably as compared to earlier CT scan. Since there was no histopathological evidence of the carcinoma, the intra-oral incisional biopsy was done and was found to be suggestive of a pleomorphic adenoma.

He had a history of hypertension for 15 years, and his blood pressure was typically controlled at approximately 140/80 mm Hg during a resting state. He had also been diagnosed with gout in a local hospital 7 years earlier and had intermittently received medication. Otherwise, he had no medical history. After admission into the ward, the patient underwent coronary angiography (CA), which demonstrated multiple-branch coronary lesions. Following a comprehensive consultation between cardiologists and cardiac surgeons, the patient was transferred to the Department of Cardiac Surgery, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Beijing, China on November 7, 2016. Physical examinations and routine laboratory tests indicated no abnormalities; color Doppler ultrasound heart (UCG) demonstrated acceptable cardiac function, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 52% and no valvular regurgitation or hydropericardium, the chest X-ray also showed no abnormality (Fig. ).\nAn operation was performed on November 14, 2016 at Anzhen Hospital, Beijing, China; the patient underwent grafting of the left internal thoracic artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery and sequential grafting of the saphenous vein to the left circumflex branch, diagonal branch, and descending posterior branch. This procedure went smoothly during bypass grafting, and the mean flows were satisfied. However, when the proximal anastomotic bleeding was assessed, an ascending aorta hematoma was identified, and aortic dissection was rapidly diagnosed. The cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was then immediately established via right atrium and right femoral artery cannulation; a dissection was specifically indicated when the aorta was incised, and the innominate artery was involved by the dissection when exploring the aorta arch.

Though occasionally he suffered from jaw lock, other symptoms associated with neurologic deficit such as drooling, facial weakness, paresthesia, or auditory defects were absent. Apart from being a social alcohol consumer, there was no history of smoking, prior radiation, or significant family medical history, especially in regard to his present illness.\nPhysical examination revealed a tender right parotid swelling below the ear lobule, which extended inferiorly to the angle of the mandible (). The skin overlying the swelling was slightly erythematous, thickened, and nodular. The swelling was firm, diffused, and fixed to the underlying muscles, and there was no associated lymphadenopathy. Otoscopic examination of both ears was within normal limits.\nThe patient initially had a neck ultrasound and then a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize the nature of the lesion. The neck CT scan revealed a well-defined altered signal enhancing mass measuring 3.5 \u00d7 2.2 \u00d7 2.0 cm at the posterior aspect of the superficial part of the right parotid gland (). The radiologist's impression was an altered signal enhancing mass lesion, likely to be a benign pleomorphic adenoma. The patient then underwent MRI of the parotid glands, which showed a well-defined focal lesion of altered signal intensity at the posterior aspect of the superficial part of the right parotid gland, measuring 3.5 \u00d7 2.2 \u00d7 2.0 cm along its maximum transverse, craniocaudal, and anteroposterior diameters, respectively. The impression was again benign pleomorphic adenoma of the right parotid gland.

The patient had initially taken antipyretics and antibiotics but found no effect. On clinical examination, the patient was febrile, and his abdomen was soft without any guarding or rigidity. Routine investigation showed that the patient had diabetes, which was uncontrolled. The test results indicated that the patient also had a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate along with a high total leukocyte count and a high level of positive C-reactive protein. Therefore, insulin and empirical antibiotics were started immediately. An ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen revealed hepatomegaly, chronic pancreatitis, and splenomegaly with multiple splenic abscesses.

He was referred by his GP who treated him initially with NSAIDs having little effect. He had no previous medical history and denied any trauma. He had no nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, malaena or haematochezia. While he was in the emergency department, he experienced an episode of severe pain, which caused him to collapse. On physical examination, the patient was pale, anxious and in moderate distress. His blood pressure was 74/57 mmHg, pulse rate 82 beats per min and oxygen saturation 96% on 4 L of oxygen. His abdomen was tender to palpation and guarded on the left upper quadrant but there were no signs of generalized peritonism. Laboratory studies revealed a haemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dl, without any evidence of bleeding. After a bolus of 1L normal saline, his blood pressure increased to 106/85 mmHg.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 10-year-old boy when dental treatment under moderate sedation was first planned. He had a medical history of a sudden cardiac arrest during separation surgery for syndactyly, from which he had been rescued by immediate cardioversion. He had received a diagnosis of long QT syndrome. The QT interval of the patient was prolonged above the normal range in an electrocardiogram (ECG) (). He had been taking beta-blockers (Atenolol) as a routine medication.\nAt a regular visit, ICDAS 5-6/+ () mesial proximal dental caries at the right mandibular permanent first molar and ICDAS 4/+ caries at the right maxillary permanent first molar were observed. The right mandibular first molar tooth was thought to require endodontic treatment (). Profound local analgesia must be achieved before endodontic treatment because the treatment is often very painful and uncomfortable. Emotional stress can also induce arrhythmia in patients with long QT syndrome, therefore treatment under sedation was planned. On the day of the treatment, we first administered N2O at a concentration of 40 vol % before intravenous cannulation. We attached a bispectral index (BIS) sensor to his forehead. Propofol was infused with a computer-controlled drug delivery system after intravenous cannulation. We adjusted the propofol effect-site concentration to maintain a BIS value in the range of 70-80. The effect-site concentration of propofol was maintained in the range of 0.6-1.2 \u00b5g.ml-1 during the treatment period. There was no fatal arrhythmia during propofol sedation. Composite resin restoration of the right maxillary first permanent molar and an endodontic treatment on the right mandibular first permanent molar were successfully performed under propofol sedation.

We ordered a sepsis workup including two sets of blood cultures and urine culture. The patient was treated with aggressive intravenous fluid hydration and broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem).\nA non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed bibasilar pulmonary atelectasis without focal infiltrate and the presence of a right-sided VP shunt catheter traversing the right neck, the right chest, and the right abdominal wall; the tip of the catheter was located within the gastric lumen and had likely entered through the PEG tube insertion site (Figures -). The PEG tube was outside the gastric lumen, terminating in the abdominal wall that was evidenced in the repeat CT scan confirmed that patient had abdominal wall cellulitis and localized abscesses around the PEG tube insertion site (Figure ). Medical records from another facility confirmed previously normal positioning of the PEG tube and normal intraperitoneal positioning of VP shunt catheter one year prior.\nGiven the malposition of the VP shunt inside the gastric lumen, we suspected VP shunt infection or meningitis/encephalitis and subsequently lumbar puncture was performed; the results of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were unremarkable.

He has suffered from type 2 DM for 15 years and renal impairment for 3 years as a complication of DM. The patient has no contrast matter exposure recently. We performed an elective coronary angiography and implanted 2.75 mm \u00d7 38 mm and 3.0 mm \u00d7 15 mm drug-eluting stents into the mid-portion of the circumflex artery to relieve symptoms of angina. Coronary angioplasty was performed by using 230 mL of iohexol (BIEMEXOL\u00ae 300), which is a slightly higher dosage compared with standard coronary intervention. After 4 h from the procedure, the patient has realized that he had twitching in his left foot. First, we suspected that it arised from nerve irritation caused by puncturing the femoral arterial access. After a while, it turned into a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that ended spontaneously after 20 s. Two hours later, he had another generalized tonic-clonic seizure, which was longer than the first. The seizure was terminated with midazolam (2 mg iv). Postictally, the patient suffered from dizziness, vomiting, and somnolence. Then, he has started on antiepileptic treatment with loading dose infusion of sodium valproate, and then a daily dose of 500 mg 2 times a day. Although the patient has been evaluated neurologically, non-contrast head computerized tomography (CT) was performed immediately without contrast agent to exclude the potential causes of the seizure such as subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Cardiologists performed multiple EVTs, including stenting the superficial femoral artery (SFA) as well as balloon angioplasty in the common femoral artery (CFA), deep femoral artery (DFA), and tibial arteries. After EVT of the anterior tibial artery (ATA), the ATA ruptured and compartment syndrome of the calf subsequently occurred. Fasciotomy and inappropriate debridement were performed and led to major tissue loss with consequent exposure of the anterior tibial surface (Fig. ) because of persistent limb ischemia, even after multiple EVTs. The patient was advised to have a major amputation, but he did not want this, and he came to our hospital seeking a second opinion. Bacterial culture of the wound showed co-infection of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter. Initially, the likelihood of limb salvage seemed to be low because of the extensive tissue loss with osteomyelitis of the exposed tibia. However, we decided to seek the possibility of limb salvage considering the following conditions: (1) the patient was able to walk under cane support and eagerly wanted to maintain ambulatory status and (2) the patient had no atherosclerotic risk factors other than hypertension without significant comorbidities. The prognosis seemed to be good once limb salvage was achieved.\nComputed tomography angiography (CTA) showed stenosis in the external iliac artery (EIA), total occlusion of the SFA and peroneal artery, severely diseased ATA, patent posterior tibial artery (PTA), and well-developed sural artery (SA) (Fig. ), revealing the PTA as an ideal target for bypass surgery.

Physical examination on admission revealed a systolic murmur in the left para-sternum, trans-thoracic echocardiography showed a subarterial VSD with a diameter of 8 mm, left to right shunting, pressure gradient via the defect was 70 mmHg. The left ventricle dilated mildly with left ventricle end-diastolic diameter was 57 mm and left ventricular ejection fraction was normal range. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 33 mmHg at rest. Mild aortic regurgitation was present.\nThe patient was conducted under general anesthesia with a single-lumen endotracheal tube and placed in supine position as for standard median sternotomy with two arms along the body. Defibrillation pads were placed on the right and left chest before sterile draping. The femoral artery and vein were dissected in preparation for cannulation with a 2\u20133 cm oblique right groin incision. A 4 cm left parasternal thoracotomy was used to enter the thorax via the third intercostal space (ICS). The left internal thoracic artery was preserved carefully. The third costal cartilage was divided close to the sternum, without resection, to increase exposure. The ribs were slowly spread with a mini-thoracic retractor. The pericardium was opened longitudinally and suspended with stay sutures. The femoral artery cannula was inserted directly into the common femoral artery. A multi-stage venous cannula was inserted using the Seldinger technique with the tip of cannula advanced to the superior vein cava under transesophageal echocardiography guidance.

    "original_text": "A 50-year-old male presented with a history of left-sided chest pain for a few years that had been progressively worsening over the last 3 months. The pain was characterized as vague and intermittent, although there were some fluctuations in intensity. He had a gunshot wound to the left upper abdomen resulting in diaphragmatic and splenic rupture 30 years ago. He stated that his spleen had been removed at that time. Other medical history included chronic hepatitis C and a 30 pack-year history of smoking. His physical examination revealed several abdominal scars, but was otherwise unremarkable. Routine blood work demonstrated no significant laboratory abnormalities. A peripheral smear was not obtained. On presentation, his chest X-ray showed a large, ill-defined, clearly marginated mass along the left heart border on the posteroanterior view. In comparison, the chest radiograph obtained 1 year previously was reviewed, and the lesion was noted, in retrospect, to have been present at that time; it had obviously grown over the 12-month period between the two examinations (Figures A and B). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest with intravenous contrast showed a large, homogeneously enhanced mass of 13 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 8 cm extending from the level of the aortic arch inferiorly along the mediastinal contour into the left upper quadrant, corresponding to the lesion seen on the chest radiograph (Figure C). Technecium-99 m (99mTc) sulfur colloid scintigraphy was performed based on a high index of suspicion for splenosis given the patient\u2019s trauma history and subsequent splenectomy. Thick linear uptake was present in the medial left hemithorax, corresponding to the mass on the chest CT, and was consistent with splenic tissue (Figure ).

She was never diagnosed with behavioral disturbances. She had presented with ankle extension weakness, and no other myotomal weakness was detected preoperatively.\nThe patient gave her informed consent for surgery. She also gave her written, informed consent for publication of the case, including the accompanying images. At our institution, ethical approval is not required for reporting individual cases.\nUnder uneventful general anesthesia, the patient underwent tubular surgery with the assistance of MEL in the prone position. During the surgical procedure, there were no dural tears or bleeding (surgical blood loss of 40 mL). After the surgery and before the patient was transferred to the recovery room, the patient recovered from leg pain and numbness. There were no apparent complications, and somatosensory and motor-evoked potentials were both normal. Closed suction drains were maintained for approximately 48 hours postoperatively. All closed suction drains were used with full negative suction pressure. However, 2 days after the surgery, the patient noticed decreased lower limb sensation and power of the right leg, and she developed numbness from the level of L5 and weakness from the L4, 5 myotome distally. On examination, big toe extension, ankle flexion and extension, knee extension, and thigh abduction were weak in both legs. Loss of sensation in her legs was noted. Based on the clinical examination, urgent MRI was performed and demonstrated a large T2 hyperintense collection within the vertebral canal extending from approximately L4 to L5, suggesting the presence of a PSEH (Fig. ). It was thought that emergent re-exploration would be beneficial because these findings were suggestive of hemorrhage in the L4-5 space. Thus",

Neither physical examination nor laboratory examination revealed any significant findings. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a 2.6 cm diameter intraluminal polypoid hyperechoic mass in the gallbladder. Color Doppler ultrasonography examination demonstrated vessels in the mid-portion of the mass. Computed tomography scan confirmed the presence of a gallbladder tumor that appeared as an enhancing pedunculated tumor within the gallbladder, without thickening of the gallbladder wall.

Furthermore, TDM scan showed a cortical fleshy nodule of the right kidney, measuring 2.2 cm, with no involvement of the perinephric adipose (Figure ). The biliary symptoms and pedunculated appearance of the tumor on the TDM scan suggested a possible diagnosis of primary carcinoma of the gallbladder.

On physical examination there was direct tenderness on the whole abdomen and we could hear rale in both lower lung fields. Laboratory studies showed leukocytosis and a leukocyte count of 1,500. An x-ray of the chest showed abnormal air shadows above the diaphragm (Figure ). Computed tomography showed what appeared to be a loop of intestine in the pericardium (Figure ). We performed an emergency operation with median laparotomy. The small bowel was herniated to the pericardial space through the diaphragmatic defect and the herniated bowel was edematous and strangulated. We pulled the herniated bowel for an easy manual reduction. After the reduction of the herniated bowel, we identified the diaphragmatic defect. The defect was located at the left side of the central tendinous portion and had no communication with the pleural space. The defect was 3 \u00d7 3 cm in size with a round shape, and the margin of the defect was smooth and thick. We could see the heart beat through the defect. We resected the strangulated small bowel and performed end-to-end anastomosis. The defect was closed with Gortex patch with interrupted ethibond sutures. On chest x-ray after operation, no bowel gas was seen in the chest (Figure ). The patient received ventilator care during the immediate postoperative period. On the fourth postoperative day, the patient was transferred to a general ward and the postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged on the ninth postoperative day. We concluded that the patient\u2019s final diagnosis was small bowel strangulation due to peritoneopericardi",

The tumor was 5.0 \u00d7 6.0 cm, and it was pathologically diagnosed as malignant meningioma (Fig. A). As metastasis from a primary site was suspected, imaging examinations, including head and neck magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) examination, were carried out, but since all were negative, it was diagnosed as ectopic malignant meningioma of the primary axillary soft tissue. After surgery, 50 Gy radiation was locally administered, and she received follow-up outpatient observation. In June 2016, chest radiography showed a nodular shadow in the right lung, so she was referred to our department. There were no notable findings in the laboratory blood test results. Chest radiography indicated a similar circular nodule shadow, 1.1 \u00d7 1.0 cm in size, in the right lower lung field. Chest CT showed the 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 cm nodule shadow in the right S4; mediastinal and hilar lymph node enlargement was not observed (Fig. B). PET-CT demonstrated slight uptake in the nodule, with a maximal standardized uptake value of 2.94 (Fig. C). There was no evidence of distant metastasis. After the initial examination, it was considered to be a metastatic lung tumor, and we decided to perform surgery as there were no abnormal findings in other organs. Surgery was performed in the left lateral decubitus under differential lung ventilation and 3-port thoracoscopy. There were no adhesions or pleural changes, and the tumor was directly under the right S4 pleura. Thoracoscopic right middle lobe partial resection was performed and the tumor was resected.

Papillomas were detectable in the larynx, trachea, and main bronchi and the patient had progressive lung manifestations. At the time of referral the patient had already undergone 116 operations. A total of 16 surgical excisions and laser ablations were performed during the following 5 years.

One year later the patient developed symptoms of Leriche\u2019s syndrome caused by thromboembolic occlusion of the aortoiliac bifurcation. An embolectomy was performed. Additional thromboembolic events caused minor infarctions in both kidneys and the spleen. An ischemic stroke in the supply area of the left middle cerebral artery caused aphasia, hemiparesis and facial nerve paresis. Four days later, another thromboembolic crisis led to an occlusion of both femoral arteries. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a suspicious mass in the left cardiac atrium, involving the right pulmonary vein.

His symptoms were attributed to recurrent transient ischemic attacks involving the posterior circulation. Computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the neck showed moderate left vertebral artery (VA) V4 and origin stenoses. His symptoms persisted despite being on aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin. After 4 months, a repeat CTA neck showed progression of left VA stenoses with development of a V4 segment intraluminal thrombus (). He was started on oral anticoagulation for 2 weeks without symptoms improvement; therefore, a decision was made to proceed with elective cerebral angiogram with the intent to treat the left VA origin.\nCerebral angiogram one week later showed 90% left VA origin stenosis and distal V4 segment occlusion. Final angiography following left VA angioplasty revealed markedly improved VA flow, and 50% remaining stenosis of the proximal left VA.\nA few hours postoperatively, the patient developed new onset left upper extremity dysmetria and paresthesia that resolved after 10 minutes. He was discharged from the hospital after 2 days without needing physiotherapy. On the following day, he returned to the emergency room with left hemibody paresthesia and gait unsteadiness. MRI brain showed acute posterior upper cervical cord infarction, confirmed with a dedicated MRI cervical spine (). CTA neck showed no restenosis of the left VA origin and patent V4 segment with resolution of previously seen thrombus (). His physical examination revealed decreased vibration and proprioception and dysmetria on the left upper and lower extremities, with positive Babinski sign ipsilaterally, and no loss of temperature or pain sensations. He was discharged home the following day with the plan to continue aspirin and clopidogrel and outpatient physiotherapy.\nThree months later, the patient reported resolution of left hemibody paresthesia, with mild residual left-hand coordination difficulties and gait imbalance.",

He experienced excessive salivation and had noticed marked weight loss, although undocumented. Furthermore, he complained of involuntary persistent twitching, most notable over the chin, tongue, upper and lower limbs. According to the patient, the difficulty in chewing and swallowing developed prior to the muscle twitching.
