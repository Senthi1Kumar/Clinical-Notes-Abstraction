His lower limbs weakness and spasticity were initially episodic with full recovery without treatment. Later it became more frequent and affected his daily activity. He also complained of urinary hesitancy and recurrent multiple painful genitalia and oral ulcers. He was treated with oral carbamazepine 200 mg daily for lower limbs spasticity. Subsequently, he developed cerebellar signs, dysarthria, nystagmus, and intentional tremor. MRI of brain and spine was performed to rule out compressive myelopathy and the result was normal. Blood investigations for sexual communicable diseases and autoimmune diseases were negative. Based on clinical finding and inconclusive investigations, he was diagnosed as primary spinocerebellar degeneration with a differential diagnosis of vasculitic Beh\u00e7et\u2019s. Despite being on treatment, his limb weakness progressed. He was paraplegic and wheel chair dependent.\nOne year after his initial presentation, he developed painful right eye with reduction of vision for 3 weeks. He was then referred to ophthalmology team for further eye assessment. Retrospectively, he had history of right eye painless progressive blurring of vision for the past 1 year. His vision was perception to light on the right eye while left eye vision was 6/12. Ocular examination showed the presence of bilateral uveitis.

She had previously undergone curettage and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cementation of a biopsy-proven giant cell tumor of the first metatarsal two and a half years prior at a different institution. Six months following the index surgery, she had a recurrence treated with repeat curettage, liquid nitrogen local adjuvant, and placement of bone substitute graft. After the second procedure, she was ambulatory, but occasionally used a boot for comfort and avoided high-impact activities. Physical examination demonstrated a prominent first metatarsal base and a well-healed dorsal incision. She exhibited tenderness to palpation throughout the area of the scar.\nRadiographs of the left foot showed an expansile, radiolucent lesion of the first metatarsal base surrounding the known cement implantation of the first metatarsal (). Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large soft-tissue mass surrounding the first metatarsal circumferentially and abutting the second metatarsal (). There was high T2 signal with no T1 signal changes at the base of the second metatarsal. Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated an expansile lucency at the proximal aspect of the first metatarsal base toward the dorsal lateral side (). There were some areas of cortical breach, and the bone was expanded and abutting the base of the second metatarsal. There was no evidence of direct extension into the second metatarsal or areas of osteolysis within the second metatarsal base. She was diagnosed with a second recurrence of giant cell tumor of bone of the first metatarsal base. As the tumor was recurrent, with destruction of the articular surface and little residual bone of the first metatarsal base, a wide resection of the tumor was recommended.\nThe procedure began by harvesting iliac crest bone graft (5 cm in length, 2 cm in depth).

Few hours later, a CT scan was performed owing to his increasing pain that revealed an anterior dislocation of his right hip joint (). Consequently, he was referred to our center. In Emergency room, his right lower extremity was in external rotation position. He explained an anesthesia in medial side of right leg and ankle. Active extension of the right knee was impossible and the muscle force could not be assessed due to extreme pain. Motor and sensory functions of the sciatic nerve were normal. The right hip was reduced under general anesthesia in the theater and was followed by skin traction. Post-reduction radiographic images demonstrated an appropriate anatomical position of the right reduced hip without any fracture.\nAfter reduction, marked wasting of knee extensor muscles and decreased sensation in the femoral nerve distribution were noted on examination. Electrophysiological studies shown a neurapraxia and the patient was informed that the muscles force would be restored and the numbness would be resolved. On discharge, skin traction for two weeks, gentle range of motion and knee extensors strengthening exercise, and analgesic were prescribed. Three weeks later, there has been a steady improvement in the patient's symptoms. He could extend the right knee against gravity and the sensation was regained in the medial of the right leg. Therefore, gait training was initiated and physical therapy was continued. At two months follow-up, complete clinical recovery of right femoral nerve was achieved and he was able to resume his job. Findings of an electromyography and nerve conduction study were normal at three months after injury. Recent eight months review has not shown any neurological deficit and he had full range of motion in both right knee and hip joints.",

    "original_text": "A 51 year old man presented to the ED for the third time in 2 weeks with complaints of flank pain and hematuria. He had complained of left sided flank pain during the initial 2 visits. During the first visit, the patient was diagnosed to have renal colic. X-ray KUB did not show any renal stone. He was treated symptomatically with analgesia and discharged. During the second visit with complaints of persistent left flank pain despite taking analgesia given at discharge, he was admitted to the emergency observation ward for pain management. Bedside ultrasound done then was noted to have mild left sided hydronephrosis. He was pain free at the end of the observation and was then discharged with analgesia and an outpatient follow-up with the urology department. He was also scheduled to have an outpatient computed tomography scan of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (CT KUB). However, 2 days before the scheduled CT, he represented to the ED with right sided flank pain since morning on the day of his visit. The pain radiated to the right groin and was associated with hematuria. He was not passing blood clots. He denied any other complaints of fever, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. He had a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He had previous surgeries for appendicectomy and cholecystectomy.\nHis vital signs were stable. There was tenderness over the right flank on physical examination. There was also a palpable tender mass measuring about 5x5cm over the right lumbar region. There was no renal angel tenderness. Bedside ultrasound in the ED showed an appearance of a 6 cm cystic lesion around the inferior pole of the right kidney with internal echogenicity within the cyst.

    "original_text": "A 67-year-old man presented to an outside institution's emergency department with right groin and abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis. Three years prior he had undergone hybrid open and endovascular repair of common iliac and infrarenal aortic aneurysms consisting of open bilateral femoral artery access for placement of an aorto-left iliac device, as well as a left to right femorofemoral bypass with an 8 mm ringed polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft. Physical examination now revealed a large right inguinal hernia extending into the right hemiscrotum, as well as abdominal distension and tenderness. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed a bowel-containing inguinal hernia with upstream small bowel dilation. The constriction of the bowel appeared to be occurring at the level of the femorofemoral bypass graft where the hernia sac abutted the anastomosis (Figs and ).\nDue to the large scrotal component of the hernia and potential adherence of the sac to the vascular graft, an open approach was undertaken. A vascular surgery consultant was apprised of the case, reviewed the imaging prior to surgery and was available during the surgery. Bilateral groins, thighs, abdomen were included in the operative field in case revision of his vascular reconstruction should become necessary. The graft's course was traced utilizing a handheld Doppler and a transverse, curvilinear incision was made extending laterally from the pubic tubercle, superior to his vertical femoral cutdown scar. A large indirect hernia sac was found to be protruding from the external inguinal ring and to be adherent to the vascular graft.

The intraoperative findings included massive intra-abdominal intestinal contents and pus, severe edematous and adhesive intestines, a 1-cm defect on the intestinal wall located approximately 30 cm from the caecum and a perforation on the uterus. Simple repair of the intestinal defect and uterus and peritoneal irrigation were performed during the operation.

Abdominal CT showed a lower intra-abdominal abscess of approximately 10 cm in diameter and surrounding disordered bowel structures.

Seven days after the operation, he was found with bile leaking from the drainage tube, which gradually developed into an intra-abdominal abscess; septic episodes occurred within the next 3 days. Then, he was transferred to the intensive care unit of our hospital due to persistent sepsis. On admission, bile leakage from the drainage tube exceeded 800 ml in the first 24 hours. For sepsis control, a broader spectrum antibiotic was administered. An acid inhibitor drug, omeprazole, and somatostatin analog, octreotide, were administered to reduce the output. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was given due to poor intestinal function. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) exam and fistulography revealed a 2-cm defect on the junction of the descending part and horizontal part of the duodenum and a large surrounding fluid collection. Because of the high risk of a second operation, a damage control strategy should be considered in these cases. Thus, conservative treatment was selected. To facilitate effective drainage, active suction drainage was needed instead of the previous passive drainage method. Thus, a homemade triple-cavity tube (Fig. ) with functions of continuous irrigation and suction, which was designed with an insertion length of approximately 14 cm as determined by measuring the previous drainage tube of the intra-abdominal part on fistulography, was immediately inserted in the direction of the duodenal defect along the initial drainage channel when the previous drainage tube was removed. Then, the location of the triple-cavity tube was identified and slightly adjusted near the duodenal defect under fistulography. Negative pressure was applied at approximately \u2212100 mm Hg. With the patient's stabilization 7 days later, the fistula tract formed gradually and was identified by repeated fistulography. Due to intestinal function recovery, octreotide was reduced",

On biopsy, it was diagnosed as a GFHP. At the moment of the first diagnosis, there was only an endoscopic report and the endoscopic appearance could be compatible with an atrophic mucosa. In January 2013, upper endoscopy was repeated, which revealed that the polyp had grown to 12 mm in diameter with a slightly rounded head (Fig. ). Biopsy was not performed at the time.\nIn June 2014, the patient underwent positron emission tomography-computed tomography to evaluate the treatment effect on her right breast cancer, for which she had undergone surgery and received chemotherapy and radiation therapy at the age of 53 years. There was an abnormal accumulation in the lower gastric body (Fig. ). Subsequent upper endoscopy showed that the polyp had grown to 20 mm in diameter, and the surface of the head was slightly reddish and tense (Fig. ). The biopsy specimen obtained from the head of the polyp was histologically diagnosed as tubular adenocarcinoma and was determined to be unrelated to the breast cancer. It was suggested that the polyp became malignant during the nine years of follow-up, and the patient was referred to our institution for further evaluation and treatment.\nOn physical examination, scars from the right breast mastectomy with bilateral axillary lymph node dissection were noted. No other remarkable findings were observed.\nNo abnormalities were found in the blood counts or liver and renal function tests. The serum H. pylori immunoglobulin G antibody and stool H. pylori antigen were both negative.

In the 4 months previous to seeking medical attention, she noticed pain around the mass, severe weight loss and recurrent episodes of postprandial vomit, which prompted her family to take her to the emergency room. On clinical examination, a malnourished and dehydrated patient with a giant mass in the upper abdominal was discovered. She reported a slight pain on palpation, but no tenderness was encountered. Blood work was normal and due to the size of the mass, an abdominal contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) was requested.

He was admitted with the left hemisphere ischemic stroke, which was confirmed by a deep right-sided paresis and aphasia. During the structural assessment on the day of admission to the rehabilitation, the following were observed: a significant weakening of the abdominal and lateral oblique muscles on the right side. Additionally a deep paresis of the right lower and upper limb as well as weakness and decreased postural muscle activity in the torso were also observed. Symptoms of the disease were particularly noticeable as the limited possibilities of taking the vertical position and maintain the posture. It means that before starting the rehabilitation, the patient did not take an upstanding position himself. Due to paresis of the right limb, the patient was not able to move this side independently.\nThe first step during the rehabilitation was an attempt to support the patient in taking the most optimal and active upright position using SPIDER capabilities. This was performed to stimulate the equivalent reactions, mutual control and cooperation of antigravity muscles.\nThe second step was started from the slow and gradual weighting of a right limb with the use of SPIDER device. The appropriate strength of the abductor and external rotators of the hip joint, knee extensor muscles and the three-headed calf were needed to maintain the proper position of the joints during the successive load.

He had sustained a minor head injury and lacerations to the right side of his face and right arm as a result of falling while walking in the street. The patient had obvious chorea of his head and all four limbs which he said had caused him to fall. The patient insisted that falling in the street was unusual as he had learned how to live with his abnormal movements over the preceding ~20 years, and that despite his movement disorder he was usually able to maintain his balance.\nThe patient had been an accomplished athlete in his youth and hoped to pursue a career as a professional golfer. These aspirations were abandoned with the onset of his involuntary movements. At the time of presentation, the patient was gainfully employed as a gardener and enjoyed fishing. There was no evidence of a deterioration of performance in either work or hobbies, such as impaired ability to organize and perform specific tasks.\nCranial nerve examination revealed no abnormality apart from mild chorea of his face and his tongue. Speech was normal. His head and all four limbs displayed marked chorea. Tone was mildly reduced, and deep tendon reflexes were normal. Sensory examination was normal, and there was no evidence of cerebellar dysfunction.\nThe patient appeared to be oriented in time, place, and person. Based on his ability to interact and hold a conversation, his cognitive skills appeared consistent with his seventh grade education. This impression was supported by his physical presentation (personal hygiene, clothing), mood, language usage, and his ability to give an apparently appropriate detailed medical history, however, formal cognitive testing was not performed.

Her renal function was normal. She was commenced on steroid therapy and achieved remission a few days following commencement of steroids, thus confirming steroid sensitive NS. Unfortunately, five months after her steroid treatment was weaned she developed a clinical relapse of her nephrotic syndrome. She recommenced treatment with high dose steroid therapy. Again she responded within one week of commencing steroid treatment. However, when the steroid-weaning regimen was started, she suffered further proteinurea. Despite the return to high dose steroids she failed to achieve remission after 4 weeks of daily oral steroid treatment at 60 mg/m2, and 3 day of IV methylprednisolone at 600 mg/m2. A percutaneous renal biopsy was performed at this point and confirmed minimal change disease. Following the renal biopsy she was commenced on cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day) therapy and alternate day steroid therapy at 40 mg/m2 and went on to achieve remission in one week. Her renal function remained normal.\nTen months following initial presentation of NS, and three months after commencing cyclosporine treatment, the patient noted an enlarged blind spot in the vision in the right eye. She had no other symptoms suggestive of a raised pressure syndrome or associated systemic illness. At the time of this presentation she was in clinical remission from her NS and was taking prednisolone (1 mg/kg alternate days) and continued on cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day).

According to the physicians at the previous hospital, the patient had a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus with chronic kidney disease (not requiring dialysis), and his activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) had been increasing over the past 3 months.\nOn examination, his consciousness was clear, and his vital signs were within the normal limits. No purpura was observed on the entire skin surface. His face had no swellings, and no other significant findings were observed; however, he could not close his mouth because of the presence of two large intraoral hematomas that occupied the oral cavity. The hematomas were approximately 60 (right buccal mucosa) and 30 mm in diameter (left buccal mucosa) (Fig. ). Laboratory tests revealed that his anemia had become more advanced since his admission to the previous hospital.

She has given informed consent to this report. The patient had repeat rectal surgeries for sphincter damage after childbirth, and in 2011, she was diagnosed with a T4 rectal cancer causing haemorrhage. No distant metastases were found and treatment with curative intent was decided at a multidisciplinary team conference. She had neoadjuvant chemotherapy with fluorouracil and leucovorin followed by radiation with 50.4 Gy to the rectum. The tumour was resected half a year after the diagnosis. The postoperative course was uneventful except for a superficial wound infection and she was discharged after 3 weeks of hospitalization. After 2 weeks, she was readmitted because of a Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and intestinal obstruction requiring more surgery with resection of a short segment of small bowel. After 1 year, the first lung metastases were diagnosed with a 2-cm metastasis in the right lower lobe and a 5-mm. tumour in the lower left lobe. After 3 pulmonary resective procedures, further lung metastases were seen during follow-up. A second line of chemotherapy was started with oxaliplatin, resulting in shrinkage of the noted lesions. Then, local treatment was done with SBRT, 17 Gy \u00d73 for 2 right-sided metastases and a resection of the left lung, 3 years after the resection of the primary tumour. Three months later a new lung metastasis was diagnosed and treated with SBRT, 7 Gy \u00d78. Six months later, 2 more lung lesions were found and a third line of chemotherapy based on irinotecan was started, but as tumour progression was observed, treatment was discontinued after 3 months.\nWithout having the final test result on microsatellite instability in the tumour, it was decided to start PD-1 treatment (this was not within a clinical trial, since the only available trial in Sweden had not opened yet",

She had been diagnosed with right breast cancer (T1N0M0, stage I) 9 years previously and had received breast-conserving surgery, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy for the residual whole right breast at a previous hospital. She then developed pigmented skin on her right breast 6 years after surgery, and this lesion was diagnosed as an angiosarcoma. The patient underwent a breast mastectomy to treat for RAAS. Following this, however, the angiosarcoma on her chest wall recurred three times within 2 years. The angiosarcoma was resected each time, and she received radiation therapy to her chest wall after the third operation. Four years after the first occurrence of RAAS, we observed light pigmentation and a dark red tumor (gross diameter of 5 mm) on her right chest wall (Fig. ). Clinically, recurrence of RAAS was suspected, and recurrence of angiosarcoma was diagnosed by biopsy. We considered that it was necessary to remove the irradiated skin as much as possible in order to cure the RAAS. After extensive resection of the irradiated skin and tumor, new skin collected from her right thigh was grafted to the site (Fig. ). Pathologically, the tumor size was 6 mm and the surgical margin was negative. Histologically, there were many spindle cells and dilated vascular channels. Immunostaining showed that the tumor was CD31-positive and mildly positive for CD34 (Fig. ). Ki-67 index was also high. It was revealed that there is no inconsistency as recurrence of RAAS is pathological. After the operation, the patient was hospitalized for 30 days and did not experience any complications.

Due to pain and deformity in the right elbow and wrist joints, he visited our hospital. Swelling and a dinner fork deformity of the right wrist joint and pronounced swelling of the right elbow joint were observed. No skin damage was observed. No findings of nerve injury or arterial injury were obtained in the right upper limb. Radiography revealed lateral dislocation of the radial head, a fracture of the proximal ulnar metaphysis, and mild bending deformation at the fracture site. In addition, fractures of the distal radius and ulna, as well as dorsal displacement of the distal fragment, were seen (). Thus, the patient was diagnosed with Bado type III Monteggia injury with ipsilateral fracture of the distal radius and ulna.\nManual reduction under nerve block was attempted on the day of injury. However, because it was difficult to maintain the reduction of the radial head, as shown in , open reduction and percutaneous procedures were performed under general anesthesia. A Kirschner wire was inserted, percutaneously, from the olecranon into the ulnar diaphysis. When the Kirschner wire was in place, the dislocation of the radial head immediately showed good reduction. Further, open reduction and fixation of the fractured distal radius and ulna were performed with Kirschner wires (). A long-arm cast was used for external fixation with the elbow in 90\u00b0 flexion and the forearm in an intermediate position.\nTwo weeks after surgery, callus formation at the fractured bone was observed. Therefore, the cast was removed, and range of motion (ROM) exercises of the elbow and wrist joints were initiated. Since bone union was achieved at 6 weeks postsurgery, the Kirschner wires were removed. Pain, ROM limitation, and lateral instability were not observed in the elbow or wrist joints at 3 months after surgery. Additionally",

In her first attack, the patient suddenly experienced an aura with visual disturbances which she described as increasing scotomata in the bilateral visual field. After a few seconds, the patient developed a serious headache, mainly located on the left side. After a few minutes, she presented a paralysis of the right side and speech difficulties accompanied by dizziness and vomiting. These symptoms resolved after about 2 h. After this initial onset, she had an attack nearly every 4\u20135 years, and the clinical presentations of her attacks were always similar to the first one. The duration of the aura symptoms and the migraine was typically 1\u20132 h but sometimes the migraine could last up to 4 days. Sometimes headaches occurred before the hemiplegia and aphasia. Each headache was accompanied by dizziness and vomiting but without loss of consciousness. In most attacks, this patient experienced additionally a flushing of the neck and face and felt that the skin temperature of this affected area was increased, but the temperature was never measured. These symptoms may be related to an extracranial vasodilation when a migraine attack occurred. She did not undergo regular treatment except for simple analgesics as a symptomatic therapy. Recently, her condition aggravated as the frequency of attacks increased from once every 4\u20135 years to once every 1\u20132 weeks which had a serious impact on her everyday life. Therefore, during a severe migraine attack, she visited our hospital. We reviewed her family history, and we found that three other subjects, her mother, brother, and nephew, had similar clinical symptoms (Figure ).

She had been diagnosed with right breast cancer (T1N0M0, stage I) 9 years previously and had received breast-conserving surgery, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy for the residual whole right breast at a previous hospital. She then developed pigmented skin on her right breast 6 years after surgery, and this lesion was diagnosed as an angiosarcoma. The patient underwent a breast mastectomy to treat for RAAS. Following this, however, the angiosarcoma on her chest wall recurred three times within 2 years. The angiosarcoma was resected each time, and she received radiation therapy to her chest wall after the third operation. Four years after the first occurrence of RAAS, we observed light pigmentation and a dark red tumor (gross diameter of 5 mm) on her right chest wall (Fig. ). Clinically, recurrence of RAAS was suspected, and recurrence of angiosarcoma was diagnosed by biopsy. We considered that it was necessary to remove the irradiated skin as much as possible in order to cure the RAAS. After extensive resection of the irradiated skin and tumor, new skin collected from her right thigh was grafted to the site (Fig. ). Pathologically, the tumor size was 6 mm and the surgical margin was negative. Histologically, there were many spindle cells and dilated vascular channels. Immunostaining showed that the tumor was CD31-positive and mildly positive for CD34 (Fig. ). Ki-67 index was also high. It was revealed that there is no inconsistency as recurrence of RAAS is pathological. After the operation, the patient was hospitalized for 30 days and did not experience any complications. Although some reports suggest chemotherapy can be used to treat RAAS, we considered that this option would offer little benefit in this case, because the patient was elderly and had a history of cerebral infarction. Indeed, the patient has remained angi",
