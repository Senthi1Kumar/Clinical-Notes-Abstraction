Several teeth had slowly become loose and one tooth had fallen out. The patient was previously prescribed antibiotics by a local dentist who considered the problem to be a bacterial infection. The symptoms were alleviated, yet the problem was never completely resolved. Eight months prior to the current presentation, an initial panoramic radiography of the jaw was taken in a local hospital and the patient was diagnosed with osteomyelitis of the jaw. Although it was suggested that the patient should receive further treatment at a tertiary hospital, since the symptoms were tolerable, this advice was not followed in the eight months previous to the current presentation. At this time, the patient was immediately admitted to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine (Hangzhou, China) for further investigation.\nClinical palpation of the right mandible revealed that the lateral surface of the mandibular body bulged and that the inferior margin of the body was concave. The first molar was missing and mobility of the neighboring teeth was detected. The second and third molars sloped anteriorly, resulting in immature tooth contact. There was a conspicuous pit in the right mandible, between the first premolar and the second molar, yet no obvious pus-like discharge was found (). The midline of the mandible was shifted to the right by ~2 mm.\nThe initial panoramic radiograph showed an osteolytic lesion in the right mandible, ranging from the canine to the third molar, and with a moth-eaten margin. The lesion had already invaded the cortices and resulted in a pathological fracture of the mandible (). As the supporting bone was destroyed, the involved teeth appeared to be floating in the osteolytic lesion. The displacement of bone fragments led to immature contact of the lower third molar with the upper second molar ().",

The surgery had been uneventful, and she had been discharged on the sixth postoperative day. She came to the OPD after seven days with the complaint of bleeding per vaginum with a history of the passage of clots. On examination, bleeding was found to be more than average. The patient was medically managed, and the subsequent ultrasonography returned normal findings.\nAfter transfusing one unit of blood and giving antibiotic coverage, the patient was discharged with bleeding per vaginum within the normal limit. The patient presented to the OPD again after 10 days with the same complaints. On PV examination, bleeding was still present. Intrauterine packing was done and kept for 24 hours. Packing was removed after 24 hours, and she was kept under observation for the next 48 hours with no bleeding PV. Again, after 10 days, the patient returned with the same complaint with ultrasound suggestive of a focal hypogenic mass devoid of any vascularity extending from endometrium to subserosa on the left side. The patient was referred to our center and the decision was taken to manage the case laparoscopically.\nIntraoperative findings were as follows: bladder was found adhered to the anterior uterine wall, which was dissected down. A Hematoma was present at the right end of the cesarean scar, extending up to the broad ligament. Cesarean scar sutures had given away. Active bleeding was present from the right angle of the scar.\nRetroperitoneal dissection was performed, and bilateral internal iliac arteries were ligated.

His serum amylase was significantly elevated on admission and CRP level after 48 h was elevated (Table ).\nChest X-ray revealed a small pleural effusion on the right side. Ultra sound scan of the abdomen showed a coarse echogenic liver with gross ascites.\nFollowing this episode he had persistent anorexia and weight loss with intermittent abdominal pain. He did not have fever or vomiting. Bowel opening was normal. He was subsequently transferred to our unit from the local hospital with worsening abdominal pain and distension. On clinical examination he was emaciated and was mildly pale. He was not icteric. He was hemodynamically stable and had a right sided small pleural effusion. Abdomen was distended and tense. Investigations revealed high amylase and low albumin (Table ).\nContrast enhanced CT scan of the chest and abdomen showed a large multilocular cystic lesion occupying almost the entire abdominal cavity. The largest locule in the right side measured 30 cm \u00d7 15 cm \u00d7 14 cm displacing the liver medially and the right dome of the diaphragm superiorly. Two smaller locules were seen in the lesser sac, compressing the central abdominal structures. Cysts contained clear fluid with no enhancement of the walls. No separations or evidence of haemorrhage was seen (Figs. , , ). There was a small right side pleural effusion with collapse consolidation of the medial segment of the right lower lobe.

The patient's medical history included coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia. Further history revealed he had received (2) stents in the past and undergone multiple heart catheterizations (up to seven) approximately seven years prior at an outside facility. During his last catheterization and stent procedure, which took over 4 hours (approx. 33 mSv), he developed a radiation-induced injury to his right back around the T10 dermatome (). During the following years, the burn was closely followed at an outside facility, and the area developed a chronic nonhealing ulcer which continued to evolve over time eventually growing outward from his back and developing a foul odor on his presentation to our facility in 2017. He reported increasing pain at the periphery of the tumor margin. Up to a year prior to presentation, the area was flat and biopsies revealed no evidence of malignancy. Upon presentation to us, however, the physical exam demonstrated a fungating mass approximately 5 \u00d7 9 cm with central purulent necrosis and induration surrounding the periphery (Figures \u2013). No additional nodularity or adenopathy was found on physical exam initially. At this time, punch biopsies demonstrated undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma along with frankly necrotic debris.\nInitial staging showed only localized disease by MRI with no evidence of metastasis by CT scan (Figures and ). Approximately one month following diagnosis, the patient underwent a radical excision with a 20 \u00d7 9 cm elliptical excision of the site. In this case, the patient chose human dermal matrix reconstruction, as primary closure was not possible due to the size of the site.

His parents did not refer any other relevant medical history about him. Tuberculin skin tests resulted positive and a chest X-ray showed a dishomogeneous parenchymal consolidation in the left lower lobe ().

These findings were suggestive of pulmonary sequestration, including a differential diagnosis of congenital pulmonary airway malformation, because of the presence of a cystic component within the consolidation. The injection of contrast medium showed an artery arising from the descending thoracic aorta that divided into two 1.2 cm after its exit, with both branches extending to the dysplastic area; therefore, a diagnosis of intralobar sequestration with associated aspects of bronchial atresia was made; superinfection and trapping of contiguous parenchyma coexisted.

The patient was in good health, and her family members did not have similar lesions. A physical examination showed that the mass was in the right occipital region at the upper margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and exhibited slight tenderness without obvious pulsation or vascular murmurs during auscultation.\nA head CTA examination at admission suggested that the lesion was approximately 3 \u00d7 5 cm in size, was mainly composed of vascular components, presented as a \u201cwool mass\u201d, was located in a subcutaneous region, involved the muscles, and showed obvious enhancement. The lesion was mainly supplied by the occipital and muscular branches of the vertebral arteries. The venous drainage of lesion communicated with the suboccipital venous plexus and the paravertebral venous plexus, and the venous drainage communicated with the subcutaneous cervical superficial veins (Figs. and 2).\nA further DSA examination revealed that the blood supply of the lesion was mainly from the occipital artery and less from the muscle branches of the vertebral arteries (Fig. ). The lesion was considered an AVM based on its imaging characteristics and was recommended for surgical removal. The surgery was carried out under general anesthesia. The lesion could be touched when the occipital skin was incised during the operation. The lesion showed a clear boundary. The occipital artery touched the anterior margin of the lesion, was exposed and ligated, and was removed around the lesion. The lesion consisted of massive blood vessels, and the surrounding muscles were swollen, indicating IH.\nAfter the lesion was removed, the normal muscle tissue around the lesion was also removed. The specimen was sent to pathology, and postoperative pathology confirmed that the lesion was IH accompanied by thrombolytic recanalization. HE staining showed that the lesion almost purely consisted of capillaries with only rare cavernous components among the muscles",

He presented the following symptoms: generalized episodic abdominal pain of progressive onset that was relieved by diarrheal stools occasionally associated with rectal bleeding over the past 2 months. The patient had recurrent skin lesions of different ages on the lower limbs that had started to appear 6 months before the onset of abdominal pain. These lesions began with an inflammatory nodule that resolved within a few days with a pustule that ruptured quickly and spontaneously gave way to an ulceration whose diameter quickly reached several centimeters. The healing was spontaneous and left hypertrophic stigmata.\nThe patient was not a drinker or smoker and was of middle socioeconomic status. He had no personal or family medical history, especially cancer or blood or inflammatory disease. Upon admission, he had a body temperature of 37.4 \u00b0C, a pulse rate of 81 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 110/85 mmHg. His physical examination revealed a moderate general condition, moderately colored conjunctiva, pain in the left iliac fossa, and hypogastrium without a palpated mass. The result of his rectal examination was normal. His dermatological examination demostrated objectified large, circumferential scarring lesions on both lower limbs and progressive ulceration on the posterior side of the left thigh (Fig. ). His Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15; he had no sensory or motor deficit, and the result of examination of his cranial nerves was normal. Biopsy of the progressive lesion showed a suppurative and inflammatory central zone with ulceration and neutrophil infiltration. The results of cytobacteriological (aerobic and anaerobic culture) and fungal studies were negative.\nWe concluded that these skin lesions were PG. Colonoscopy for the exploration of abdominal symptomatology revealed a necrotic and hemorrhagic budding lesion 20 cm from the anal margin, confirmed by contrast enema, which showed a narrowing of the lumen of the rectosigmoid junction.

His parents did not refer any other relevant medical history about him. Tuberculin skin tests resulted positive and a chest X-ray showed a dishomogeneous parenchymal consolidation in the left lower lobe ().

These findings were suggestive of pulmonary sequestration, including a differential diagnosis of congenital pulmonary airway malformation, because of the presence of a cystic component within the consolidation. The injection of contrast medium showed an artery arising from the descending thoracic aorta that divided into two 1.2 cm after its exit, with both branches extending to the dysplastic area; therefore, a diagnosis of intralobar sequestration with associated aspects of bronchial atresia was made; superinfection and trapping of contiguous parenchyma coexisted.

Twelve days after the onset of unspecified symptoms, a Black male aged 16 years went to the emergency department and was admitted the following day with a febrile illness.

The patient was born in the United States, but his parents were from Nigeria and they spent substantial time there. In repeated interviews with health care providers and the local health department, the patient and his guardian reported that the last time he had traveled internationally was to Nigeria, more than 2 years earlier, in 2015, for approximately 15 days; he had never lived in Nigeria or another country where malaria is endemic.

However, the patient\u2019s father was treated for malaria in Nigeria 1 or 2 years previously and had also received a malaria diagnosis in the United States in 2016, confirmed by the state public health laboratory. Blood specimens for the father (2016 illness) and son (2017 illness) were sent to CDC, and parasite sequencing and microsatellite analysis was conducted. Genotype profiles and microsatellite results showed that the parasites from the father\u2019s 2016 illness and the son\u2019s 2017 illness were not related. The patient traveled to a southern U.S. state 1 month before illness onset, although his infection could not be linked epidemiologically to any malaria case there.

On physical examination, he appeared to be in good health. Chest auscultation did not reveal any specific pathological heart or lung sounds. Abdominal objectivity was negative. His parents did not refer any other relevant medical history about him. Tuberculin skin tests resulted positive and a chest X-ray showed a dishomogeneous parenchymal consolidation in the left lower lobe (). Suspecting active tuberculosis, a preliminary CT scan of the thorax was performed showing a heterogeneous consolidation with some cystic masses containing mixed fluid and air in the left lower lobe posterior segment, not in communication with the respiratory tract, and a probable expression of a dysplastic parenchymal area ( and ). These findings were suggestive of pulmonary sequestration, including a differential diagnosis of congenital pulmonary airway malformation, because of the presence of a cystic component within the consolidation. The injection of contrast medium showed an artery arising from the descending thoracic aorta that divided into two 1.2 cm after its exit, with both branches extending to the dysplastic area; therefore, a diagnosis of intralobar sequestration with associated aspects of bronchial atresia was made; superinfection and trapping of contiguous parenchyma coexisted. Just below the emergence of the previously anomalous vessel, another artery was detected that crossed the midline to achieve a healthy parenchyma in the right pulmonary base, configuring a pattern of aberrant systemic artery feeding a normal lung (\u2013). Other congenital anomalies that appear to be related to pulmonary sequestration were absent; in particular, pulmonary venous drainage was regular through the pulmonary veins, there was no communication between the bronchus and the oesophagus, and no diaphragmatic defects or other gross pulmonary anomalies were identified either. Our patient responded well to antitubercular antibiotic therapy and his clinicians, together with his family, decided to keep him under control with clinical follow-up, avoiding surgery for the moment.",

She was found to have on an average of four to five episodes of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) per year during the same period. She was apparently well until about two years ago when she started developing LRTI which was initially treated with various antibiotics including fluoroquinolones, beta-lactam antibiotics and macrolides at different walk-in clinics. Chest X-rays obtained before the presentation were normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest which was obtained at our hospital revealed right lower lobe focal cylindrical bronchiectasis. This was presumed to be post-infectious based on LRTI history. Frequency of LRTI increased from an average of two episodes in six months to three to four episodes in six months.

The patient signed an informed consent statement, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Yeungnam University Medical Center.\nThe plain radiograph revealed the collapse of the T12 vertebral body. CT showed an acute burst fracture at the T12 vertebral body with an osteolytic mass-like lesion within the vertebral body and pedicle, causing severe encroachment of the spinal canal (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a bulging posterior cortex, with an acute fracture of the vertebral body and severe compression of the spinal cord (Fig. ). Considering his medical history and the MRI findings, a pathologic fracture with a tumorous condition was suspected. Therefore, the evaluation of the malignant potential and metastasis in the remote area was necessary. Hence, 18FDG PET/CT was performed, and 18FDG uptake at the T12 level was measured. A maximum standardized uptake value (maxSUV) of 1.7 was noted, with a central FDG defect on the vertebral body (Fig. ); this was interpreted as a benign fracture by a senior radiologist. Additionally, there was no positive uptake in the other body parts on PET/CT.

Eight months ago, he underwent total thyroidectomy with both central and sentinel lymph node dissection due to papillary thyroid carcinoma and the pathologic stage was diagnosed as T3N1bM0 on the permanent pathologic report. After that, the first radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy was conducted and an iodine [\u2013] whole body scan was planned to determine whether to perform the second RAI that was on the next day of visiting the emergency room, therefore, he had to stop the thyroid medication for 3 weeks to prepare for the examination.\nAt the time of admission to the emergency room, he was noted to be somnolent and had a decreased level of consciousness. He opened eyes to pain, showed inappropriate verbal response and flexion withdrawal from pain, which suggested that Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 10 out of 15. On physical examination, there was no pretibial edema and his pupils were equal in size and normally reactive to light. His abdomen was slightly distended with decreased bowel sound and his extremities were cold. His blood pressure was 127/96 mmHg, heart rate was 101 beats per a minute, and respiratory rate was 25 breaths per a minute with oxygen saturation 97% on room air.

The patient reported seeing a physician a year earlier in Georgia due to fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. After his diarrhea and vomiting had resolved, he had swelling of the lymph nodes on the right side of the neck. After returning to Turkey for treatment, he had received cephalosporin and penicillin for suspected pharyngitis.

Exploratory laparotomy revealed superior pole renal and caudate lobe hepatic lacerations which were hemostatic. The popliteal fossa was explored once proximal control was gained at the level of the groin and revealed considerable popliteal vein injury without arterial injury. Once hemostasis was obtained, fasciotomies were performed for the lower leg due to the significant time under tourniquet control before surgery. Osseous injuries to the spinal column were deemed stable, suitable for upright positioning, and the plan was to treat them conservatively.\nDue to the multiple injuries and critical status, his early care was dominated by intensive resuscitation, and once he was deemed adequately resuscitated for additional surgery, it was planned to address the retained bullet and shoulder joint arthroscopically. Of particular interest in addressing the left shoulder was the diagnosis of acute paraplegia with possible incomplete spinal cord injury, which would necessitate as much preserved upper extremity function as possible",

He had awoken at 4:30 am that morning and found that he could no longer bear weight on the right foot due to the intensity of the pain and had been using an old set of crutches to ambulate around his home. The patient indicated that the pain was primarily over the dorsal aspect of the foot, radiated up the back of the calf and was worse with bearing weight and movement. He had taken ibuprofen at home with no improvement in his symptoms. He denied any recent strenuous activity or injury to the foot, but had been dancing at his prom the previous night. He had been treated for plantar fasciitis in both feet by his podiatrist and had received a cortisone shot in the left foot three weeks earlier. Patient had also been having symptoms of fatigue, night sweats and fever for which his primary care physician had prescribed levofloxacin.

After initial evaluation at a community hospital she was transferred emergently to a Level 1 care center. On arrival she was evaluated by the orthopedic and trauma surgery teams, and noted to have a severely deformed left lower extremity with a significant soft tissue injury and active proximal bleeding. She was taken to the operating room where bleeding was isolated to small branches of the femoral artery at the level of an inguinal crease laceration. Hemostasis was obtained by the trauma surgery team. Concurrently, the orthopedic surgery team placed a spanning external fixator across her comminuted, Type IIIB open femur fracture. Proximal fixation was within the proximal femur and distal fixation in the tibia, spanning the knee joint (Figure ). Of the pins within the femur, the proximal pin was placed using standard percutaneous technique and the distal pin placed under direct visualization through the large soft tissue defect (Figure ). Prophylactic four compartment leg fasciotomies were performed as well.\nAt the time of her index procedure distal pulses were absent and an on-table angiogram was performed. Initially, this showed limited flow below the level of the trifurcation, which improved with application of local vasodilatory agents. Over the preceding 12 hours her dorsalis pedis pulse was lost and a CT angiogram performed. This study suggested the SFA was lying lateral to the distal of the two femoral ex-fix pins, becoming kinked as the anatomic course of the vessel is medial to the femur. The altered path of the SFA was also recognized on retrospective review of the initial angiogram (Figure ).

He was initially treated with nebulization and oxygen therapy. Chest X-ray revealed a metallic FB in the right hilar area []. He was referred to a higher center for bronchoscopic removal of the FB, where he reported the next day and underwent rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia for removal of the FB. A large, bullet-shaped metallic FB was visualized in the BI. Attempts to grab it by any kind of forceps only pushed it distally. Several attempts to engage it in a dormia basket were also unsuccessful. After nearly 2 h of attempts at removal, the child was noticed to have developed subcutaneous emphysema in the neck which started progressing rapidly suggesting the possibility of airway injury. A tear could be seen in the BI which was partially traversed by the FB. The bronchoscopic procedure was abandoned, ventilation through the endotracheal tube was continued, and a 16F chest tube was inserted into the right chest. There was no fall in oxygen saturation, and he was hemodynamically stable. With a diagnosis of suspected BI injury, he was transferred to our hospital for surgical management.\nAt a presentation in our emergency department, the patient was on mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube with stable hemodynamic parameters. Subcutaneous emphysema was noted in the neck and upper chest. He had reduced air entry in the right lower zone. Consent for thoracoscopy/thoracotomy was taken from the parents, and the child was immediately taken up for thoracoscopy under general anesthesia. Single lung ventilation with collapse of the right lung was achieved by selective intubation of the left main bronchus under bronchoscopic guidance.

He underwent an EGD with a mass noted, and a biopsy was obtained confirming the diagnosis of gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (Fig. ). Staging scans revealed pulmonary nodules which were biopsied and demonstrated the presence of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor tissue was amplified for HER2, with overexpression noted. His performance status was 0 as measured by the ECOG scale. The patient started combination chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin, and capecitabine plus trastuzumab (Herceptin). Unfortunately, the patient became neutropenic and a dose adjustment was made. PET CT performed in August 2015 demonstrated an excellent response with the previously affected nodal areas now completely regressed. Capecitabine was discontinued after 3 cycles due to severe fatigue and hand-foot syndrome but docetaxel, cisplatin, and trastuzumab were continued for an additional 5 cycles. Given the continued response, cisplatin was discontinued and the patient continued on docetaxel and trastuzumab for another 2 cycles. In February 2016 repeat staging scans revealed no evidence of active disease; therefore docetaxel was discontinued and the patient was continued on trastuzumab maintenance (6 mg/kg every 3 weeks). The patient tolerated this therapy well, and ECHO examinations did not reveal a decrease in cardiac ejection fraction. However, after 3 months of trastuzumab maintenance therapy a PET CT scan demonstrated disease progression in the left supraclavicular lymph nodes. Paclitaxel was introduced while trastuzumab therapy continued. However, after 2 months on this therapy he demonstrated slight progression of disease and the therapy was then changed to FOLFIRI plus trastuzumab. He completed 6 cycles of this combination with evidence of complete remission on PET CT scan. At that time (January 2017) he received consolidative radiation therapy (50.4 Gy) to the primary tumor field and previously involved nodal areas including the supraclavicular lymph nodes.

His annual CT scan showed a soft tissue mass, located between the hepatic artery and the portal vein, which encased the former vessel. Its maximal diameter was measured at 2.5 \u00d7 2 cm, with an adjacent necrotic node measuring 1.2 \u00d7 1.5 cm (). On positron emission tomography, only focal mild hypermetabolism was noted at the site of the suspected recurrence with no evidence of metastatic disease, which was confirmed on a CT chest.\nThe patient underwent neoadjuvant therapy (Gemcitabine with radiation therapy followed by Gemcitabine-Oxaliplatin). A CT scan to assess response showed stable disease.\nIn April 2013, the patient underwent an angiogram that detected a replaced right hepatic artery originating from the SMA (). An endovascular stent (32 mm proximal extension graft [Renu Stent Graft, Cook Medical]) was placed to cover the CA. Three weeks later, the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed the mass in the surgical bed, where the CHA was completely engrossed by the tumor with a margin of less than 1 cm before the takeoff of the GDA. Confirmation of effective collateral flow after clamping the CHA was demonstrated and further confirmed with intraoperative Doppler sonography. The mass was resected en bloc after clamping the CHA and transecting it just proximal to the GDA. In this patient's case, we were required to resect the CA flush with the aorta to ensure gross negative margins; this was made less complicated because of the presence of the endovascular stent.

    "original_text": "Patient B is a 70 year old white female who presented with a large left breast mass. The patient was unsure how long the lesion had been present. Nonspecific findings consistent with a fibroadenoma were noted in the same region on a mammogram obtained 5 years previous to her presentation. Her past medical history was significant for hysterectomy at age 52. She had no personal history of cancer, although her family history was significant for lung and pancreatic cancers. She had used an estrogen and progesterone combination for hormone replacement in the past, the duration of which was unclear.\nOn physical examination, the patient's left breast had a multilobulated and relatively firm mass that measured approximately 12 cm in diameter and essentially replaced the entire breast. No cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy was noted. The contralateral breast showed no signs of a mass. Core tissue biopsy taken at the time of presentation suggested a diagnosis of cellular fibroadenoma or phyllodes tumor. Pre-operative CT scan revealed a 7.5 \u00d7 11 cm mass in the anterior portion of the breast, with no apparent mediastinal, lung, neck, or axillary lymphadenopathy.\nLeft modified radical mastectomy with dissection of level I and level II lymph nodes was performed.

Collaterals in the skin supplied the tumor, and no deep invasion was identified. The superior and inferior skin flaps included skin that had been overlying the tumor.

The patient was diagnosed with a squamous cell carcinoma in the lower third thoracic esophagus and a nodule in the left superior lung lobe. These were considered to be synchronous double primary lesions, based on the imaging characteristics. Chest and upper abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed wall thickening in the lower esophagus, accompanied by a solitary nodule, 2.3 cm in diameter, in the superior lobe of the left lung (Figs. and ). Lymph nodes >10 mm in diameter were detected around the left gastric artery and gastric cardia. Additionally, a 5 mm lymph node was found with the suspicion of metastasis along the right recurrent laryngeal nerve. By esophagogastroscopy, an ulcerative mass, 35 to 40 cm from the upper incisors was identified. Using endoscopic ultrasound, the esophageal tumor was staged as T3N1. No distant metastases were detected in this patient prior to treatment.\nThe patient refused any treatment, except surgical resection, because of his advanced age. Therefore, an MIE and lobectomy was performed, via a left video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical approach. First, we performed thoracoscopic lobectomy and thoracic esophageal mobilization in the right lateral position (Supplemental video 1). The operator was positioned in front of the patient. Based on our prior experience, a 2 cm incision at the 8th intercostal space, along the middle axillary line, was selected as the observation port. The principal operating port, with a 3 cm access incision, was made at the 5th intercostal space, before the anterior axillary line.

On examination, he was pale and febrile with a temperature of 38.5\u00baC. Examination of his chest revealed reduction of chest movement on the left side with reduced air entry into the left lung. There were no masses palpable. Haematological investigation revealed haemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL and a normal white cell count. Other blood investigations were unremarkable. A chest radiograph showed a large pleural mass in the left hemithorax, with rib destruction and a pleural effusion but no significant shift of midline structures (). A CT examination of the chest showed a large heterogenously enhancing mass arising from left chest wall with lytic destruction of the fourth rib and coarse calcifications. There was a left pleural effusion with underlying lung collapse consolidation. There were no lung nodules in the right lung to suggest metastases (). Due to the presence of calcifications in the tumour, a provisional diagnosis of osteogenic sarcoma with a differential diagnosis of chondrosarcoma was made. Pleural aspirate yielded bloody exudate. Cytology was negative and culture of the aspirate showed no growth. A tru-cut biopsy of the mass revealed osteogenic sarcoma. Histopathology findings showed a cellular tumour composed of diffuse sheets of cells with pleomorphic nuclei and basophilic cytoplasm with presence of multinucleated cells with mitotic figures. There were also areas of calcification and osteoid formation. This was in keeping with a tumour originating from the bone.\nHe underwent three cycles of chemotherapy. Post-chemotherapy CT examination for assessment showed reduction of pleural effusion but insignificant improvement in the tumour size.

In March 2015, a contrast-enhanced MRI showed an ulcerated tumor lesion on the posteromedial surface of his right leg, measuring 46 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 18 mm (Fig. ). In June 2015, the lesion was biopsied, and the histological analysis revealed histomorphological features compatible with undifferentiated spindle cell sarcoma. Chest, abdominal, and pelvic CT scans did not show secondary metastatic lesions. We suggested radiochemotherapy treatment to the patient in a neoadjuvant setting. Due to an underlying cardiac disease, the patient was contraindicated to anthracycline therapy. Thus, concomitant external radiotherapy together with trabectedin chemotherapy was finally proposed to the patient. Treatment with trabectedin was started in September 2015 at the approved dosage and regimen: 1.5 mg/m2 was given as a 24-h infusion on day 1 of every 3-week cycle. Between September 2015 and March 2016, the patient completed a total of 9 treatment cycles.\nParallel to that, between November and December 2015, the patient underwent external radiotherapy with a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions during 5 weeks, directed at the tumor lesion on the right leg. There were no significant toxicities during the whole period of neoadjuvant therapy. An MRI preoperative evaluation performed in April 2016 revealed the same tumor lesion in the subcutaneous tissue of the posteromedial face of the middle third of the right leg, whose dimensions were similar to those of the previous examination. In May 2016, surgical resection with flap was performed, and the tumor was histologically confirmed as a high-grade spindle cell sarcoma with skin ulceration reaching striated muscle tissue. The tumor showed a very good pathological response with 80% of necrotic area; the neoplasia was abutting one of the circumferential resection margins.
