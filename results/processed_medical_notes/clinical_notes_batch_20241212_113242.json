At the time of injury, she experienced no symptoms, but 3 days later, she begun to walk with a limp, experienced some leg weakness, and she had one episode of urinary incontinence. Neurological physical examination revealed bilateral proximal and distal weakness in her legs. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the thoracic spine revealed a burst fracture of the T8 vertebra with an approximately 90% height loss at maximum. All vertebral components were involved with thickening of the pedicles []. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a strongly enhancing lesion, including the epidural soft tissues [] with severe spinal canal stenosis and resulting cord compression. Our initial differential diagnosis included eosinophilic granuloma, lymphoma, or metastatic disease. Since there was significant spinal cord compression with resulting neurological deficits, we elected for surgical intervention.\nThe patient underwent a two-stage surgery while under the same anesthesia. First, an anterior T8 corpectomy was performed with tumor removal, placement of cage, and fusion. Subsequently, we completed a posterior T8 laminectomy, tumor removal, decompression, and T5 to T11 fusion. We were unable to obtain an intraoperative frozen study because the resected tissues were mostly composed of bone. There was significant intraoperative bleeding requiring multiple transfusions. No further immediate intraoperative complications were encountered, and overall, the patient tolerated the procedure well.\nPostoperatively, the patient exhibited complete resolution of leg weakness. Pathology was confirmed to be a benign VH. Early postoperative scans confirmed a successful T8 corpectomy, laminectomy, and anterior/posterior fusion [].

    "original_text": "A 50-year-old woman visited our hospital by ambulance with a fever and chest pain. She visited the outpatient clinic due to a fever and cough and was prescribed with an antipyretic 5 days before admission. Her body temperature was 40 degrees Celsius, and the rapid influenza diagnostic tests were negative. The blood tests (Table ), chest X-ray (Figure A), and chest-CT confirmed a diagnosis of pneumonia. The causative bacteria were confirmed to be Streptococcus pneumoniae by blood cultures and sputum cultures later. Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) incessantly developed in the emergency department (Figure B). She did not experience any palpitations or faintness before or during the VT. An intravenous lidocaine injection was effective in terminating the VT. From the ECG taken after termination of the VT, ST elevation in lead V2 became evident (Figure C,D). Although we could not perform cardiac catheterization due to acute respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome was ruled out by serial blood tests for the cardiac enzymes. She was admitted to the intensive care unit, and the pneumonia was treated with intravenous antibiotics. A continuous lidocaine injection was terminated 3 days after admission, and the ST elevation gradually normalized along with her body temperature.

The pregnancy had been complicated by gestational diabetes, which had been well controlled with diet, exercise, and a daily dose of metformin 500 mg. There had been no immediate post-surgical complications. Three days after discharge, the patient had begun to experience worsening difficulty in breathing and reported to the ED. The shortness of breath had initially occurred only after exertion; however, it had progressed on the last day to occur even at rest. Furthermore, the patient endorsed respiratory distress when lying flat as well as waking up in the middle of the night to catch her breath. The patient stated that the root cause of her decision to seek medical care was her worsening respiratory symptoms coupled with an at-home pulse oximeter reading of 77% oxygen saturation on room air. In the ED, she was found to have an oxygen saturation of 89% on room air and was started on 4 L of oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. Consequently, her saturation improved to 93%.

No previous history of eye disorders was acknowledged. She was taking antibiotics (phenoxymethylpenicillin and chloramphenicol eye drops) for her symptoms.\nNo RAPD was present at the initial examination. BCVA was 1.3 in the right eye and <1.0 in her left eye. The results of a fundus examination showed a normal retina, papilla, and macula in both eyes. An SST color vision test did not reveal any abnormalities (0p). A confrontation visual field exam revealed a possible inferior temporal defect in the left eye. The overall lack of findings in the examination did not lend support for any medical treatment.\nTwo weeks later, her vision deteriorated during a trip abroad. She could only perceive hand waving on her right eye and finger counting on her left. An MRI scan of the spinal cord, brain, and orbita revealed increased signal intensity in the optical nerve sheaths of both eyes, suggesting OPN. There was no evidence of any other abnormalities in the brain or spinal cord. She was being treated with methylprednisone 1 g/day for 5 days and prednisone 50 mg until her next examination 2 weeks later.\nAt this visit, the patient reported that her vision had normalized and that the pain had disappeared.

He was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to nephrosclerosis and has been treated by automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) since October 2006. He had had six previous episodes of peritonitis due to diverse agents, all resolved with intraperitoneal antibiotic treatment. The first episode also required peritoneal catheter removal for its resolution. He reported no fever or gastrointestinal symptoms, nor disconnections of the dialysis circuit.\nPhysical examination detected diffuse abdominal pain, but no tenderness or guarding. The rest of the examination was normal. After admission, the peritoneal effluent was sent for cytological examination, gram stain and aerobic, anaerobic and fungal cultures. The first cellular count showed 1140 cells per microlitre with 98% neutrophils and 2% macrophages. Gram stain showed leucocytes but not bacteria. The empirical treatment for peritonitis included ampicillin, teicoplanin and tobramycin (he is allergic to vancomycin). The initial dose of the antibiotics was: 800 mg of teicoplanin, 1 g of ampicillin and 100 mg of tobramycin, all of them administered by intraperitoneal route. Maintenance dose was: 400 mg of teicoplanin at 48 hours and later every 5 days, 250 mg of ampicillin in each change and 50 mg of tobramycin in the nocturnal bag.\nAfter diagnosis of peritonitis, as is usual in our hospital, the patient was changed to continuous ambulatory PD, with four peritoneal exchanges daily for observation. The peritoneal effluent caught on at 48 h. Five days after diagnosis, we performed another cellular count in the peritoneal effluent which showed 20 cells per microlitre, with 74% macrophages, 21% lymphocytes and 4% neutrophils.

His medical record was unremarkable otherwise and he had no history of abdominal surgery, except for right hydrocelectomy. The results of laboratory values, including coagulation laboratory tests, were unremarkable. His abdomen was slightly rigid and distended. Erect and supine abdominal radiographs showed multiple dilated small bowel loops with multiple air-fluid levels, suggesting mechanical ileus. Computed tomography (CT) showed fluid- and gas-filled distension of the small bowel loops and a transition point was observed at the distal ileum in the right pelvic cavity (). An intraluminal tubular mass-like lesion was observed at the transition point, measuring approximately 10.5 \u00d7 3.8 \u00d7 3.6 cm (, ). The lesion was heterogeneously hyperdense without enhancement or visible septa, suggesting a complicated cystic lesion. The distal ileum was collapsed in the region distal to the transition point. There was no evidence of intussusception or volvulus. Small bowel obstruction due to a complicated cystic mass was provisionally diagnosed. The US examination revealed a multiloculated cystic mass with fine septation in the distal ileum at the transition point (). The mass comprised an echogenic portion, which was probably a hemorrhagic portion.\nLaparoscopic exploration was performed for suspected small bowel obstruction caused by a complicated cystic mass. A large dark-bluish and reddish tubular cystic mass was detected at the transition point in the distal ileum (). Segmental resection of the small bowel and end-to-end anastomosis were performed. Histopathologic examination indicated a submucosal cystic mass filled with blood; these findings suggested submucosal organizing hematoma in the distal ileum.

He was diagnosed with a fracture of the right femoral neck () by an orthopedist in a private hospital who subsequently referred him for an elective surgery at Thammasat University Hospital. The orthopedic team at Thammasat University Hospital planned a total hip arthroplasty for the patient. Carotid duplex ultrasound and transcranial Doppler ultrasound were evaluated before surgery without significant abnormality. Unfortunately, during surgery, the patient developed sudden hypotension and was resuscitated with 500 ml of normal saline load. Within five minutes, his blood pressure was stable.\nOne hour after surgery, the patient became unresponsive after weaning off anesthetic drugs. Medical consultation was requested for persistent unresponsiveness. On evaluation by the consultant physician, the patient was unable to answer any question or follow command; he had no spontaneous eye opening. The temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg, and the heart rate was 120 beats per minute. The respiratory rate was 35 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation was between 90% and 95% while the patient was breathing via a non-rebreathing bag with 8 liters per minute of oxygen flow.

It was localized to the upper-mid abdomen and was constant, dull, and 5-7 out of 10 in intensity and non-radiating. The pain was predominantly diurnal and aggravated with food intake but did not relieve with eructation, vomiting, bowel movements, or change in position. The pain was associated with nausea, followed by nonbilious, nonbloody vomiting unrelated to eating. He had not attempted to treat the symptoms with medications. He reported a 25-pound unintentional weight loss in the last month but denied fever, jaundice, change in the color of his urine or stool, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea, constipation, urinary symptoms, or fatigue.\nAbdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting is a common presenting symptom for patients seeking evaluation in the emergency department. A multitude of disorders affecting various organ systems such as the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular, endocrine, metabolic, CNS, renal, hematological, malignant and nonmalignant processes may be associated with such symptoms. A comprehensive history and physical examination need to be conducted to identify potential etiologies to the underlying processes.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was positive for atraumatic and intermittent back pain for the past six months. Lower back pain that persisted mostly during day-time worsened with a change in position. Family history was pertinent for high blood pressure and diabetes in both mother and brother. The patient denied taking any medications, herbal, or nutritional supplements. He denied smoking, alcohol intake, or drug use. He had not been sexually active for many years and did not have a history of sexually transmitted infection.

She had no past medical histories and was at the week 25 of her first pregnancy. On examination, the patient was afebrile and there were two large masses on her left breast with diameters of 20\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202fcm and 10\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202fcm, which was ulcerated and bleeding (). A relatively fixed 2-cm lymph node in the left axilla was also noticed. On ultrasound, there were two heterogeneously echogenic lesions with irregular borders and fatty infiltrate, of which the diameters were about 10\u202fcm and 20\u202fcm respectively. Besides, several axillary lymph node with the largest diameter of 2\u202fcm were found, but the fatty hilum was still present. The patient was anemic, with a hemoglobin level of 58\u202fg/L.\nLocal dressing and pressure were applied to slow down the bleeding. Blood transfusion and prophylactic antibiotics were also indicated. The initial clinical diagnosis was cT4bN2M0 breast cancer. However, an open biopsy with local anesthesia was done which yielded the result of lactating adenoma of the breast. The tumor still significantly bled and palliative mastectomy was performed. During surgery, we found two large tumors which had unclear borders and spread to almost entire breast tissue but did not invade the pectoralis muscles.\nOn post-operative pathological examination, there were necrosis areas along with breast ductal hyperplasia. The epithelial cells exhibited secretory changes which had mildly hyperchromatic, round nuclei and prominent cytoplasmic vacuoles (). The final diagnosis was then lactating adenoma.

The right lobe of his TG was 20\u00d721\u00d749mm in size with normal findings and the left lobe of 80\u00d770\u00d755mm was described as hypoechogenic, lobulated, hypervascularised with propagation retrosternally.

She had placement of bilateral saline prosthetic implants for cosmetic breast augmentation from a negative A to a C in 2000 with good results and no immediate postoperative complications. She was diagnosed with DCIS of the right breast in 2012 and underwent wire-guided excisional biopsy of the right inferolateral quadrant with subsequent reexcision for positive margins. Following these procedures, she noted significant breast asymmetry and rippling deformity in both of her breasts. On admission, she had asymmetric breasts with a well-healed horizontal scar on her right breast 1-2 cm above the inframammary fold (IMF). The IMF to nipple distance was significantly decreased on the right side compared to the left side and right nipple was more ptotic (). Rippling was visible along the medial borders of the breasts bilaterally (Figures and ).\nBecause of the patient's thin skin we decided to proceed with right breast augmentation with the exchange of implant to a larger size implant (275 to 350 mL) and placement of AlloMax bilaterally to improve the rippling. In the operating room, attention was first turned to the right breast, where a hypertrophic scar from previous biopsy site was noted (). We made an incision to excise the hypertrophic scar, and incision was carried down to the subcutaneous fascia through the capsule. We opened the capsule and removed the existing 275 cc normal saline implant (Mentor, Santa Barbara, CA). We also performed a medial and superior capsulectomy. For reconstruction, we soaked a 6 \u00d7 20 cm AlloMax dermal matrix sheath in normal saline for 5 minutes. The thickness of AlloMax was between 0.8 and 1.8 mm.

HCV genotype 2 with a viral load of 7 312 217 copies/mL (\u223c2 708 228 IU/mL) was discovered. Alanine aminotransferase was 105 IU/L and liver histology supported mild hepatitis.

He continued to dialyse alongside patients with detectable HCV RNA.\nThe patient was routinely tested for HCV after returning from a holiday abroad in January 2011 and was found to be weakly positive for HCV antigen (Ag) (44 pg/mL). Retrospective testing of a serum sample collected in December 2010 confirmed that HCV Ag and RNA were then absent. Subsequent HCV RNA testing in February 2011 detected HCV RNA with a viral load of 7791 IU/mL. Genotyping using the Versant HCV Genotype 2.0 assay (INNO-LiPA) identified this to be HCV genotype 3a.

Intraocular pressure was measured as 11/12 mmHg. Slit-lamp and fundus examinations of the right eye were normal, while slit-lamp examination of the left eye showed +2 cells in the vitreous. Fundus examination showed minimal hyperemia in the optic disc. Fundus fluorescein angiography revealed a normal right eye and focal leakage in the macula of the left eye as well as fluorescein leakage in the optic disc. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated cystoid macular edema in the left eye (). The patient reported a history of sexual promiscuity. His laboratory tests showed normal results for complete blood count, liver function tests, and blood urea nitrogen. Toxoplasma and HIV immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM tests were negative. He had elevated C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 54 mm/h, and negative purified protein derivative test. His chest radiography and brain magnetic resonance imaging were normal. As the results of the venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) and T. pallidum hemagglutination tests were positive, the patient was diagnosed with ocular syphilis. In consultation with the Department of Infectious Diseases, the patient was evaluated for systemic infectious diseases and there was no evidence of past or current dermatological, neurological, or systemic involvement of the disease. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture and VDRL test of the cerebrospinal fluid was negative. The patient was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g/day for 14 days because he had allergy to penicillin.

The patient presented with chest discomfort and laboratory results showed an elevated beta-natriuretic peptide level and elevated troponin of 54.5. Heart rate on admission was 99 beats per minute, blood pressure was 118/69 mm Hg, and saturation was 99% on room air.\nElectrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST changes in leads II, III, and AVF. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% to 35% and hypokinesia of the inferior wall. She subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization, which revealed clean coronary arteries with an EF of 20% to 25% and moderate diffuse hypokinesis of the left ventricular wall. She did not have symptoms suggesting a viral etiology. She did not have a family history of coronary artery disease or sudden cardiac death. Her past 2 pregnancies were successful with no cardiac complications. Further history revealed that she had been going through a difficult time and recently started using supplements to help her lose weight. She started using xenadrine weight loss supplement 1 month ago and took 8 tablets per day. Prior to starting weight loss supplements, the patient was ambulating without any difficulty. She denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea. She could climb a few flight of stairs with ease. She denied tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, or LSD use. At the hospital, the patient was advised to discontinue the weight loss supplement.\nOn presentation to our hospital, her urine toxicology screen was negative.

    "original_text": "A 34-year-old man, known case of Marfan syndrome, presented with three episodes of non-massive hemoptysis. Seven years earlier, he had undergone Bentall operation and arch replacement with E-vita graft using frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique with a stent-graft in the descending aorta due to acute aortic dissection and aortic arch aneurysm. Six years later, he had returned with a thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm and a huge pseudoaneurysm around the distal part of the descending aorta. An extensive surgery with thoracoabdominal incision replacing all the thoracic and abdominal aorta by Dacron graft had been done, and the proximal part of the graft had been sutured to the distal end of the stent-graft.\nFinding out the cause of hemoptysis, he was admitted and a comprehensive evaluation including computed tomography angiography (CTA), bronchoscopy, and transesophageal echocardiography set out. The CTA showed a new collection, most probably a pseudoaneurysm sized 4 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 9 cm around the ascending aorta extending to the posterior border of the manubrium at the maximum diameter (Fig. B, C). Therefore, we focused on the ascending aorta as the source of bleeding into the mediastinum, which could have caused an aortobronchial fistula and ultimately the hemoptysis.

Biopsies of the area showed mild chronic inflammation and intestinal metaplasia consistent with Barrett's oesophagus and no dysplasia. A CT scan revealed that what was thought to be a paraoesophageal hernia in the OGD was in reality a 5.5 \u00d7 4.7 cm epiphrenic oesophageal diverticulum containing food residue ().

Robotic-assisted laparoscopic excision of the epiphrenic diverticulum with distal oesophageal myotomy and hiatal closure with crural repair was performed. Postoperative water-soluble swallow demonstrated no leak from the diverticulectomy site and some narrowing at the gastrooesophageal junction likely due to postoperative oedema.

No history of trauma was recalled. She is a smoker and had laparoscopic cholecystectomy many years ago secondary to cholelithiasis. On further questioning, she reported a similar episode 2 weeks prior at the same joint. However, the symptoms settled within 24 hours and did not prompt her to seek medical attention. On examination, the affected joint was swollen, exquisitely painful on passive movement, erythematous, and warm to touch. Biochemical study showed normal calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and thyroid function level. X-ray showed a prominent area of soft tissue calcification projected just dorsolateral to the head of the middle finger metacarpal bone measuring 12 mm \u00d7 4 mm in diameter (). Ultrasound-guided biopsy was unable to aspirate any sample due to the relative solid nature of the lesion. Initial differential diagnosis was either a crystalline arthropathy or early septic arthritis and empirical therapy (intravenous cefazolin and oral colchicine) for both conditions were commenced. Minimal improvement was observed overnight, and the decision was therefore made to perform an arthrotomy and irrigation of the joint. Perioperatively, access to the lesion was achieved by a single curvilinear dorsal incision. A single gouty tophus like structure was found external to the joint, but infiltrating into the collateral ligaments of the joint (). Sharp dissection was done from paratenon to joint capsule. The lesion was excised and deposits removed from collateral ligament as much as possible. There was no evidence of ulceration or fistula formation with the superficial skin.

She subsequently underwent numerous synovectomies to treat local recurrences and radiation therapy to her left knee joint at age 15. Ultimately, her disease spread to her upper calf and posterior thigh. At age 32, her upper calf lesion was resected, and the tumor in her posterior thigh was treated with radiation. At age 34, swelling of an inguinal lymph node was noted and fine needle aspiration was consistent with malignant TGCT. Other staging scans revealed a pelvic mass and a sub-centimeter pulmonary nodule. Her disease remained stable after four cycles of doxorubicin/ifosfamide and she subsequently received gemcitabine/docetaxel as well as radiation therapy to her pelvis with stable disease for three months. She underwent left-sided above the knee amputation and excision of the intrapelvic masses. Eight months later, enlarging pulmonary nodules were resected. She was treated with sirolimus (rapamycin) and remained disease-free for eight months until a pulmonary nodule and two inguinal masses were noted. In 2007, at age 37, she was referred to our hospital and treated with sorafenib for four months with mixed response. She subsequently began on sunitinib 37.5 mg daily. Interval restaging scans showed no evidence of progressive disease for 15 months. She had significant interval progression of a right-sided pelvic mass while she temporarily stopped sunitinib in the perioperative setting of resection of painful metastatic nodules near the amputation stump (Fig. a, b, and c). Given that the drug had a significant role of controlling the disease, her sunitinib was restarted in combination with sirolimus (rapamycin). Her disease was under good control for eight additional months until she had progressive disease in the pelvis and underwent hemipelvectomy.

This happened to be the at the site of a previous right-sided thoracotomy where she underwent segmentectomy of the right upper lobe, and a right upper lobe lobectomy in 2004. No radiation or chemotherapy was administered at the time of surgery and she had remained cancer free with no reoccurrence based on her yearly pulmonary follow ups. Upon initial presentation, she stated that she had noticed the mass over the past year and although it was painless, it had raised concern due to its progressive size. She denied fever or recent history of trauma. On physical examination, the surgical scar from the thoracotomy appeared well healed with no signs of infection. A non-tender mass was palpated just under the surgical scar and at the time of exam, measured approximately 2-3 cm in diameter but became more prominent with movement of the scapula. U/S showed a 3 cm complex mass and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was recommended for further evaluation (Figure ).\nHer MRI showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass along the right posterior lateral chest wall (Figure ). The mass had increased in size compared to the chest CT scan from 2015 that was routinely performed for lung cancer follow up. Biopsy was recommended, and the patient was referred to the oncology clinic.\nThe patient was evaluated by oncology and at that time, the differential diagnosis included elastofibroma, desmoid tumor, sarcoma, and recurrent lung cancer.

Her chest discomfort began the day prior to presentation, but she initially attributed it to indigestion and thus waited to seek medical attention. Her chest pain persisted however, which prompted her to seek evaluation in the emergency department. Upon arrival, she was given aspirin with resolution of her symptoms. Laboratory analysis revealed an elevated troponin I level of 0.319 and initial creatine kinase (CK) of 12.7. Brain natriuretic peptide level on presentation was not checked. Electrocardiogram (ECG) was notable for diffuse T-wave inversions demonstrating inferior, as well as anterolateral ischemia, and a prolonged QTc of 503 ms (). Echocardiogram demonstrated moderate left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction of 35%-40%) with mid to distal anteroseptal, anterolateral, and apical akinesis (). The patient was taken to the catheterization suite and underwent emergent left heart catheterization. Angiography revealed 90% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery (RCA) which was believed to be the culprit lesion. There were no significant obstructive lesions noted in the left anterior descending or left circumflex arteries. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with successful stent placement to the RCA (). She was then started on appropriate guideline-directed medical therapy and observed in the intensive care unit where her chest pain resolved. Repeat laboratory analysis revealed that CK had decreased to 6.4. ECG obtained following PCI revealed interval improvement of the inferior T-wave inversions, with sustained T-wave abnormalities in the anterolateral leads (). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is not available at our facility and was not performed.

At the first presentation, skin lesions exhibited hyperpigmentation, induration, and xerosis. The range of motion of the right knee was full extension to 80\u00b0 of flexion. Radiographs of the right lower extremity revealed dysplastic/atrophic femur and tibia. LLD increased with time and reached nearly 10 cm at seven years of age ().

However, at presentation, his motor development was delayed: he was still unable to hold up his head. He also showed bilateral congenital horizontally narrow eyes with drooping eyelids (blepharoptosis), heterochromia iridis, and dystopia canthorum (W-index: 2.24) (Fig. ). Interview and visual inspection did not find musculoskeletal abnormalities or limits of mobility in the limbs. His defecation was normal and no intestinal signs indicating constipation, disorder of peristalsis, or obstruction were apparent by interview and auscultation. Oto-acoustic emission, conditioned orientation response audiometry, and auditory brainstem response revealed severe hearing loss (Additional file ). Computed tomography of the temporal bone revealed hypoplasia of the semicircular canals and cochlea in the bilateral ears (Additional file ). None of the members of his family had any of the symptoms found in the proband (Additional file ).\nAt 5 months of age, the proband developed an attack of generalized seizures. Initially, the seizures lasted for a few seconds and occurred once a day. In the following 2 weeks, both the frequency and duration of the seizures increased. 2 weeks after the seizures started, the proband had a systemic clonic seizure that lasted for about 4 min and the next day he had a longer clonic seizure with eye deviation to the right for about 12 min. Although obvious abnormal findings were not observed in the electroencephalogram, epilepsy was suspected. Sodium valproate was started 3 days after the 4-min-long seizure.

His surgical history is significant for an adjustable gastric band placed 35 years earlier followed by an OAGB performed 5 years before presentation to achieve better weight loss. The decision to perform an OAGB instead of an RYGB was based on surgeon preference. Five years after the OAGB, the patient developed a persistent cough and recurrent pneumonia. During the workup, an upper gastrointestinal (GI) barium swallow revealed evidence of a GBF involving the left main bronchus (Figure ). Gastroscopy was performed and revealed a fistula present at 1-2 cm distal to the gastroesophageal junction. Bronchoscopy was not performed at the time. Our patient was properly diagnosed with an upper GI barium swallow, which revealed contrast filling of the left lower lobe of the lung and gastroscopy and computed tomography (CT) scan.\nEndoscopic management of the fistula was attempted twice. Stent migration was encountered after both attempts. Failure of endoscopic management was attributed to the technically challenging location of the fistula. Because of technical limitations at our institution, other methods of endoscopic management were not attempted. The patient was re-evaluated and offered a laparoscopic RYGB.\nIntraoperatively, the OAGB was identified and reversed.

The fistula was ablated, and a 1 \u00d7 1-cm opening was identified in the gastric pouch (Figure ).

In 2007, the patient noted enlargement of left inguinal lymph nodes, and small melanocytic lesions on the skin of his left leg. He was treated with interferon alpha under a clinical trial at a regional cancer hospital, with reduction of the nodes and resolution of the skin metastases.

This was biopsied and a diagnosis of recurrent melanoma was confirmed. He was then treated with wide excision and skin graft.\nIn March 2012, the patient was diagnosed with a recurrence within the left leg skin graft. This was excised and a new skin graft procedure was performed. Pathology revealed positive margins of the excised metastasis, so a re-excision was performed, again with positive margins. At the same time, needle biopsy of a left inguinal lymph node confirmed the presence of BRAF-positive metastatic melanoma. A Computed tomography (CT) scan performed in Mar 2012 revealed no evidence of distant metastases.
