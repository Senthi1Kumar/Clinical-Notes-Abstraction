She had a history of headache, visual loss in her right eye and four-limb paresthesia over a period of 10 months prior to presentation. During this period, the patient had developed behavioral and mood changes such as depression, paranoia, and memory loss. The primary diagnosis was multiple sclerosis and she was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g / day) for three days followed by 1 mg / kg / day of prednisone administered orally for six weeks then tapered weekly over the next four months.

Spinal fluid examination revealed a high protein concentration of 250 mg / dL with no cells and no oligoclonal immune globulin.

He remained on observation for 4 additional years and then received an additional 4 cycles of FCR followed by 5 cycles of maintenance rituximab. Five years later, he was found to have 17p deleted recurrent disease and he was started on ibrutinib with good response. He presented to an outside facility with acute onset altered mental status after stopping ibrutinib 2 months earlier due to financial constraints. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was initially concerning for CLL infiltration of the CNS with neoplastic-appearing lymphocytes identified by cytomorphology; however, serological tests for West Nile virus indicated acute infection based on positive IgM and negative IgG; however, PCR could not be performed. The patient received therapy for presumed CNS involvement by CLL with intrathecal methotrexate along with intravenous rituximab and methylprednisolone before being transferred to our institution. On admission, his complete blood count revealed leukocytosis with a normal differential and thrombocytopenia, after reviewing the patients' historical trends, we could discern that the platelet count had been within normal limits in the past and had likely decreased due to the acute illness; additionally, we can appreciate the increasing trend in WBCs until the start of treatment around 10 years prior to this admission (). Peripheral blood smear showed normal platelet morphology and moderate leukocytosis with lymphocytosis with coarse, block-like chromatin pattern concerning for prolymphocytoid transformation which had not been present previously. Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypercellularity with diffuse infiltrate of the medium to large-sized mononuclear cells with irregular nuclear contours and prominent nucleoli similar to that seen in the peripheral blood smear (). Repeat CSF studies at our hospital showed lymphocytes accounting for 49% of total events per flow cytometry, positive for CD19",

The patients\u2019 medical history revealed that she was a known case of \u03b2-thalassemia minor. She had undergone splenectomy five years ago without any history of blood transfusion. Due to high platelet counts, aspirin was recommended by an oncologist to reduce the risk of thromboembolism.\nThe intraoral examination revealed the transposition of the left maxillary canine that erupted mesial to the third molar (). The distal slope of the canine was in contact with the mesial marginal ridge of the lower left third molar. The crown of the transpositioned canine was well-formed with a prominent cingulum ().\nThe left maxillary first and second molars as well as the right and left mandibular first and second molars were missing. Furthermore, major occlusal plane discrepancies were observed due to the mandibular posterior teeth lost. The right canine was also missing. The patient interview revealed that the mentioned tooth was impacted and already surgically extracted by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon. The upper and lower dental midlines did not coincide, and there were spaces between the lower anterior teeth.\nThe right and left deciduous maxillary canines were retained.

She had a slight functional limitation of her left hand grip due to pain and stiffness. The left hand was slightly cold to touch compared with the right hand.

    "original_text": "A 37-year-old woman was admitted to emergency services with complaints of left-sided abdominal pain which had persisted over two weeks, as well as a mass which had increased in size for several days. The patient was not receiving any specific medication and her medical history did not suggest any major disease. Nor was there any history of alcohol usage or trauma. Physical examination revealed the presence of a huge mass in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen, but without tenderness or rebound tenderness. Laboratory findings were all within normal limits. The abdominal X-ray examination showed no presence of intestinal gas in the upper left quadrant and the normal location of the intestines was pushed toward the right, indicating the presence of a mass in the upper left quadrant (). An abdomino-pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a 15 \u00d7 10 cm, hypo-dense, well-capsulated and huge cystic lesion of unknown origin in the upper left quadrant ().\nA surgical procedure was decided upon because of compression symptoms and the possibility of the mass being malignant. Under general anesthesia, a median incision was performed in the upper abdominal region. The spleen appeared normal, while the presence of a mass was confirmed, firmly attached to the pancreatic tail. The mass was hard and uneven with tubercles of varying sizes. To perform en bloc resection of the mass, mobilization of the spleen was deemed necessary. Both the splenorenal and splenocolic ligaments were detached from the retroperitoneum to mobilize the spleen. After removal of the pancreatic tail and the spleen from the abdominal cavity, excision of the mass and the pancreatic tail, as well as splenectomy, were performed to ensure en bloc resection ().

During the initial evaluation was performed a thorax CT scan that showed lymph nodes enlargement and subsequently by presence of abdominal pain was performed an abdominal and pelvis CT scan that showed a right kidney tumor of 4 \u00d7 5 cms besides of abdominal lymph nodes enlargement. A radical right nephrectomy was designed, prior to surgery we performed an spirometer study that revealed a moderate obstruction pattern. The surgical procedure included lymph nodes remotion. Histopathology study revealed Hodgkin's lymphoma involving right kidney, abdominal lymph nodes, ureter and liver. Immunostaining showed positiveness for CD15, CD30 and LMP-1 while CD3, EMA and ALK were negative. Histological study also reported a clear renal cell cancer, degree II, involving only the right kidney without extension to any other structure. Surgical resection was complete and margins were negative for cancer, diffuse glomerulosclerosis also was found. After surgical procedure we did a bilateral bone marrow biopsy that was negative for lymphoma. Staging studies showed an IV b stage and 4 unfavorable factors (stage IV, hemoglobin 7,2 g/dl, albumin 3.2 g/dl and lymphocytes <0.6) at diagnosis. We performed an echocardiography study that revealed light enlargement of right cavities, diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.

His level of consciousness was drowsy at initial presentation, but subsequently worsened to stupor. He showed sudden respiratory difficulty, so underwent endotracheal intubation. Because a stroke was suspected, a brain computed tomography (CT) was performed. The CT scan revealed a hemorrhagic lesion in the central pontine area. The amount of bleeding was estimated to be approximately 5 mL (). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and received conservative treatment because surgical intervention was impossible. Hemostatics, antihypertensive agents, and anticonvulsants were administered. The hemorrhagic lesion in the pons was reduced in size on subsequent brain CT scans, and his mental status also improved. His mental status was restored to the alert level and self-respiration was possible without mechanical ventilation 7 days after ICU admission. After he recovered his mental status, he complained of hearing difficulty. He said that he could hear speech sounds, but could not understand them at all. Physical examination of both ears revealed normal tympanic membranes. His average hearing threshold by pure tone audiometry was 26 dB HL in the right ear and 32 dB HL in the left ear (), but his speech discrimination score was zero for both ears. Further hearing tests were performed to reveal the cause of hearing loss. Transiently evoked otoacoustic emission (OAE) and distortion product OAE showed robust responses for both ears, but the auditory brainstem response (ABR) showed only a broad wave I at 100 dB nHL click stimuli (, ). Based on these results, he was diagnosed as having auditory neuropathy. Follow-up hearing tests were performed 6 months after the initial hearing tests, and the OAE and ABR tests showed the same results, including robust OAE responses",

She reported that the facial droop was new but the diplopia was not. Once in our facility, an extensive history was gathered by the neurology team, including questions about fatigue, dysphagia, ptosis, or any other focal or lateralized weakness; these symptoms were denied by the patient. She did admit to a generalized weakness but denied any diurnal worsening of this weakness or any of her other symptoms. The physical examination determined that she had a right upper and lower facial weakness and no active diplopia or ophthalmoparesis, even after sustained upward gaze. The computerized tomography (CT) angiogram of the head and neck along with the remainder of her stroke work-up were also unremarkable.

He was treated 3 weeks earlier with oral acyclovir and topical steroids because of suspected LE herpetic anterior uveitis as serological tests revealed positive immunoglobulin M to herpes simplex virus-1. Initially he responded to treatment but 2 weeks later, his vision declined from 6/9 to counting fingers (CF), resulting in his referral to our center.\nThe patient denied any relevant past medical history. However, he mentioned that a month earlier he was examined for LE discomfort and diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis following minor blunt trauma from a tree branch.\nOn examination, visual acuity (VA) was 6/6 in the right eye (RE) and CF at 1 meter in the LE. Intraocular pressure was 14 mmHg in both eyes. RE anterior and posterior segments were normal. There was a remarkable LE anterior chamber reaction with dust-like keratic precipitates, cells (4+), flare (2+), and some iris nodules. Fundus assessment was not possible because of dense vitritis.

    "original_text": "Case presentation 2: a 21-year-old male suffered isolated mandibular angle fracture following a road traffic accident. Patient in this case wanted early return to the work and also on CT scan a torsional deformation was seen on the fracture fragments. Hence the decision to do open reduction was made. Incision designing and access ad procedure was carried out as described. Access was satisfactory and 2 miniplates were placed and fixation achieved ().\nSurgical procedure: both the above-mentioned patients were treated under general anaesthesia. Thiopentone sodium was used for induction and patients were intubated nasally. Oral cavity was kept free to achieve maxillo-mandibular fixation and achieve the occlusion. Isoflurane and/or sevoflurane were used for maintenance. Surgical site and incision line were marked with a marking ink before commencing the procedure. Thereafter the marked line was infiltrated using lidocaine with adrenaline in 1: 1000 concentrations. Incision remains the key of this approach as aesthetics has been given prime importance to the designing of this surgical access. Care has to be taken that incision follows the curvature of the angle of the mandible and suture line has to be visualized beforehand such that it is hidden completely in the shadow of the angle. Incision can be said to be combination of postramal Hind\u00b4s incision and submandibular Risdon\u00b4s incision but to the fact that it remains closer to the angle of the mandible, around 1 cm away from the bony landmark completely in the shadow of the mandible. Sharp incision with a 15 number blade is imperative to avoid any jagged incision line.

    "cleaned_text": "case presentation 2: a 21-year-old male suffered isolated mandibular angle fracture following a road traffic accident. patient in this case wanted early return to the work and also on ct scan a torsional deformation was seen on the fracture fragments. hence the decision to do open reduction was made. incision designing and access ad procedure was carried out as described. access was satisfactory and 2 miniplates were placed and fixation achieved ().\nsurgical procedure: both the above-mentioned patients were treated under general anaesthesia. thiopentone sodium was used for induction and patients were intubated nasally. oral cavity was kept free to achieve maxillo-mandibular fixation and achieve the occlusion. isoflurane and/or sevoflurane were used for maintenance. surgical site and incision line were marked with a marking ink before commencing the procedure. thereafter the marked line was infiltrated using lidocaine with adrenaline in 1: 1000 concentrations. incision remains the key of this approach as aesthetics has been given prime importance to the designing of this surgical access. care has to be taken that incision follows the curvature of the angle of the mandible and suture line has to be visualized beforehand such that it is hidden completely in the shadow of the angle. incision can be said to be combination of postramal hind\u00b4s incision and submandibular risdon\u00b4s incision but to the fact that it remains closer to the angle of the mandible, around 1 cm away from the bony landmark completely in the shadow of the mandible. sharp incision with a 15 number blade is imperative to avoid any jagged incision line. in the first stroke only skin and subcutaneous tissue should be visible and skin flaps hold tightly away with skin hooks, which gives clear view of the subcutaneous tissue. platysma muscle once seen can be dissected easily with a pair of scissors and blade with care that the superficial layer of deep cervical fascia is left undisturbed.\nfurther careful progression and perhaps the most challenging",

The patient referred no pain relief after taking anti-inflammatory drugs and denied respiratory symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, or cough. No weight loss, anorexia, or other symptoms were reported. There was no referral of previous surgeries or medications. A different, stronger anti-inflammatory drug was prescribed, but three days later she returned to the hospital, where a lumbar radiograph revealed the presence of a lytic lesion in the L4 vertebra. Due to the nonspecific appearance of the lesion, the patient underwent an MR of the lumbar spine. The exam revealed the presence of a heterogeneous, T1-hypointense mass in the body of L4, causing its partial destruction, and nerve root compression (). A CT-guided biopsy was performed in order to assess the etiology of this mass. The pathology report described the presence of tumor fragments of mesenchymal origin with smooth muscle differentiation that were diffusely positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors. No obvious nuclear atypia or mitotic figures were identified. Ki-67 proliferation index was less than 1%. The final report stated that the lesion was compatible with BML.\nSubsequently, a contrast-enhanced CT was performed to evaluate if other organs were affected: there were several soft tissue density round masses in the thorax, the largest being located in the left lung, measuring 44 mm (). There was a 12 cm mass in the left iliac crest that enhanced after intravenous contrast. This mass had a lytic component and exhibited an intrapelvic bulky element ().

After clinical and radiological examination of the amputated hand and the stump, the patient was consented for hand replantation. Careful dissection and debridement of the neurovascular structures both proximally and distally and a 1-cm bone shortening of both bones on the amputated hand side was done. Afterward, both forearm bones were fixed by four K-wires.

While this replanted hand survived on a single-vein repair, Weiland described that a ratio of 2 veins to 1 artery repair is required to improve the outflow and increase the chances of the hand survival. Also, other authors recommended to repair more than a single vein. The cut end of the two bones on the amputated hand side was ragged and sharp so about 1 cm of the two bones was resected. Bone shortening facilitated the neurovascular structures repair without grafts. The distal radio-ulnar joint was about 3\u20134 cm away from the trauma site so integrity of the joint was preserved.

He had been diagnosed with chronic traumatic AVF at the right thigh due to a 30-year-old shotgun wound. Initially, CVI of the right leg had slowly developed. Two years before he had symptoms of right side heart failure, including leg swelling and liver congestion. These symptoms persisted and progressed into severe congestive heart failure (CHF). His echocardiography showed severe tricuspid regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension.\nA physical examination showed swelling of his right leg with hyperpigmented skin around the ankle. Pulsatile varicose veins in the right thigh and groin were observed. A CT angiogram showed one large AVF between mid-SFA and SFV together with multiple AVFs along the external iliac artery and vein, the common femoral artery and femoral vein, and the distal SFA and SFV. There was a 5 cm aneurysmal change in the proximal right external iliac artery and vein. A venous aneurysm (3 cm in diameter) was found next to the largest AVF site ().\nAt first, the authors planned to close all AVFs in this patient, but it was impossible because of multiple AVFs along the external iliac artery to the distal SFA level. Since the authors had an experience of postoperative DVT in the venous aneurysm in case 1 after closure of the chronic AVF, the authors closed only the largest AVF, which would facilitate a decrease in his cardiac return. This would ease his cardiac failure condition but still allow some arterial blood flow to prevent acute thrombosis in the venous aneurysm. This was carried out by resecting the dilated AVF segment, and then arterial and venous bypasses were performed using an 8 mm Dacron graft individually (). Immediately after the authors clamped the AVF, the patient suffered reflex bradycardia (the Branham effect). The patient's heart rate dropped below 40 beat per min and his blood",

Medically, the patient was fit and well, with a history of smoking 20 cigarettes per day and 20 units of alcohol per week. There was a soft, erythematous swelling of the right cheek measuring 3 \u00d7 3 cm. It was painful, without a discharging punctum and had features of an infected sebaceous cyst. The patient was not complaining of dysphagia and was systemically well. Intra-oral examination showed chronic periodontal disease and carious teeth but no sign of acute infection (Figs and ).\nA diagnosis of an infected sebaceous cyst was formulated and arrangements made for incision and drainage under local anaesthesia. Unfortunately, the patient then left the department before treatment was undertaken. He returned 1-week later with the same complaint, when the lesion was drained and a review appointment made. A review at 1 week found the erythematous area to have increased in size, with the incision site now having an exophytic, indurated appearance. An urgent biopsy was undertaken and ultrasound scan arranged.\nHistology showed a high grade adenocarcinoma with appearances unlikely to represent a primary adnexal carcinoma. The immunoprofile of the specimen suggested a metastatic deposit of a tumour originating in the gastrointestinal tract or pancreatico-biliary system. In light of this, a CT abdomen, thorax and pelvis was undertaken whilst a referral was made to a gastrointestinal surgeon. CT showed a large tumour of the lower oesophagus with multiple metastatic lymph nodes, bony metastasis in vertebrae L2 and lung metastases. Oesophageal biopsies confirmed an invasive adenocarcinoma, just superior to the gastro-oesophageal junction. Spinal decompression and stabilization was undertaken, in order to maintain quality of life, and he was discussed at the UGI MDT where it was decided that treatment would be palliative in nature. Radiotherapy involved five fractions to the lumbar spine and right cheek, before referral to a medical oncologist for palliative chemotherapy.",

The patient underwent an uneventful procedure. On the fourth day after the operation he became confused with mild dysphasia. A computed tomography (CT) of his brain showed a hypodense collection in the left temporal lobe (Figures -). Further investigation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain demonstrated a fluid collection within the substance of the left temporal lobe and significant oedema of the surrounding temporal lobe with mass effect, but there was no evidence of haemorrhage or abscess formation (Figures -).

The patient showed further worsening of his confusion and speech disturbance and the decision was made to proceed to the operating theatre.\nAt operation the pseudomeningocele was evacuated; a 2x2 cm craniotomy was performed over the squamous temporal bone.

The dyspnea was gradual in onset, at times precipitated by stress, but most of the time there was no precipitating factor. It was associated with severe nonproductive cough and bilateral headache. There was no significant past medical history. There was no history of fever, night sweats, and wheeze or chest pain. Also, there was no hoarseness of voice or hemoptysis. The patient sought medical advice at a private health center when the patient's daily activities gradually started getting affected. The patient was prescribed Salbutamol inhaler which gave her temporary relief. At the same time, the patient was diagnosed to have hyperthyroidism and was started on carbimazole. The patient took these medications for about 4 weeks and discontinued them against medical advice as she experienced lethargy and easy fatigability due to the sideeffects of the prescribed drugs.\nAfter a brief period of relief of symptoms, the patient again started to have dyspnea and presented to the Cardiothoracic Unit in our hospital for evaluation. Baseline investigations were done, which included complete blood count, renal function tests, and liver function tests; all were within the normal range. Chest X-ray showed a well-demarcated right upper lobe mass close to hilum (). Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral thyroid nodules and a large well-defined heterogeneously enhancing mass measuring 11 \u00d7 6 cm with a central hypodensity at the right upper lobe with significant compression to the superior vena cava (). There was no evidence of significant lymphadenopathy or pleural effusion. Complete surgical removal of the tumor along with safety margins was done and sent for histopathology examination. The biopsy report revealed ill-defined neoplastic growth showing biphasic pattern comprising epithelial and mesenchymal components consistent with pulmonary blastoma (Figures and ).

Laboratory studies revealed normal hemogram, urinalysis and blood ureanitrogen results. The results of a complete ear, nose and throat examination were also normal. The head and neck computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 4\u00d72.5-cm mass in the right parotid region accompanied by an osteolytic destruction of the right mandibular branch (). A roentgenogram of the chest was observed to be normal. Further examination by an abdominal CT scan revealed a 6.5-cm mass in the left kidney, suggesting RCC (), and a mass in the right iliac area accompanied by a slightly osteolytic destruction of the right iliac bone (). A radical nephrectomy was performed. The histological analysis revealed a renal clear cell carcinoma () and confirmed the renal tumor to be the primary neoplasm.

Extraorally, the patient had dolichocephalic, symmetric face with harmonious facial thirds []. The central portion of the upper lip was high with an indistinct philtrum which is characteristic of SMMCI syndrome. On profile examination, the patient had a convex profile with a decreased nasolabial angle and a retrognathic chin.\nOn intraoral examination, the patient was in a mixed dentition stage with one large maxillary central incisor situated exactly in the midline []. Maxillary and mandibular arches were symmetrical with angles Class I molar relationship. The patient had a V-shaped palate and marked midpalatal vomerine ridge. The labial frenulum of the upper lip and incisive papilla were absent.

He denied obvious dislocation or deformity of his hand. Since that time he said the swelling and pain have persisted and he rated it a 6/10 in severity. He admitted to a snapping sensation at his knuckle with flexion of his finger. He tried ice and anti-inflammatory medication with some relief. He denied numbness and tingling of his hand. He denied loss of strength but had limited active range of motion with flexion of his middle finger of his right hand. His team\u2019s athletic trainer had placed him in a splint to limit flexion so that he could continue to play basketball as his team was attempting to make the playoffs. He denied significant past medical history. He has had a sports hernia surgery several years ago but denied other surgeries. He has injured his other hand before and said this is similar.

The patient was diagnosed with tendinopathy of the wrist extensor tendons, and managed for 2 months with physiotherapy, anti-inflammatory drugs and rest. In January 1984, the young athlete presented to the emergency room of our hospital with persistent neck pain after twisting his neck during a basketball game. His initial examination showed contracture of the cervical paravertebral muscles. Neurological examination was unrewarding. Radiographs showed an osteolytic area of the sixth vertebra of the cervical spine (C6) (Fig. ). Myelograms showed compression of the cord. A CT scan showed a mass involving the right side of the vertebra including the body, the lamina, and the lateral mass with its joint. The patient was immobilized in a halo cast, and referred to the senior author (V.D.), who performed a surgical resection of the mass through a staged anterior and posterior approach.\nThe first stage was performed with a posterior approach with the patient prone. At surgery, the tumour was removed posteriorly. The tumour involved the right side of the vertebra including the body, the lamina, and the lateral mass of C6. An intra-operative biopsy was performed, and a histopathological diagnosis of osteosarcoma was formulated.\nA wide resection of the mass was performed. A Roy Camille plate was used on the left side, which was free of tumour. A non-instrumented fusion was obtained on the right side with a bony bar harvested from the ipsilateral iliac crest.

    "original_text": "A 31-year-old female patient was referred to our general surgical unit by a general practitioner with a large, painless right-sided breast mass which had been growing slowly for the last 10 years. She presented with an ulcer on the same breast that began as a hot porridge scald burn 15 months before. The ulcer had since increased in size and become fungating. During her childhood, she had been of the same stature as her peers. However, her growth had started to lag around the age of 5 years. Around the same age, she had noticed small nodular growths which had begun to appear on the fingers of her right hand as well as angular deformity of the right upper limb and right lower limb. A few months later, she sustained a fracture of her right tibia after a trivial fall as well as another pathological fracture a year later at the shoulder region. Over the rest of her childhood and adolescence, her limb deformity worsened. She was otherwise in good general health. She was right-handed however, the hand deformity did not prevent her from using that hand for daily tasks or writing. She was also able to walk, albeit with a limp and she reported a minimal effect on her work as a subsistence farmer.

The patient was awake and alert but complained of fatigue and difficulty swallowing. His vital signs were normal. Upon physical examination, the patient had obvious bilateral ptosis of the eyes and diminished chest movement with respiration. Negative inspiratory force revealed an initial reading of 18 cm/H2O and a subsequent reading five minutes later of 15 cm/H2O. The patient and his family were informed of the patient\u2019s impending respiratory failure. They agreed to the treatment plan of intubating the patient in order to protect the airway and provide ventilatory support while awaiting definitive care. He was then admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) where his endotracheal tube was removed three days later without complication. The patient was awake and alert at the time of discharge, during which he provided further pertinent past medical history.\nHistory of present illness\nThe patient presented signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) at a local urgent care center 24 hours before his arrival at the ED. He stated he was experiencing urgent and frequent dysuria, and lower abdominal pain. He explained that the urgent care was exceedingly busy, so the provider quickly assessed him. He was given an intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone, and discharged home with a prescription for ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day for seven days. The provider was treating for potential multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms due to the patient\u2019s previous stay in the hospital five months prior. About 15 hours after his antibiotic injection, the patient was awakened at home around 0300 by his UTI symptoms so he took the oral ciprofloxacin.

He had problem with weakness from early childhood. In his childhood, he had frequent nose bleeding and easy fatigability. His growth was very slow. He was on no specific therapy and never suffered from symptomatic hypoglycemia. He went into a late puberty at about 17\u201318 years, but grew very rapidly and became much taller than his parents. During that period, his muscle weakness worsened and he had been in a wheelchair since he became 24 years old. His weakness in his arms also dated back to his puberty. At the time of presentation, he was unable to brush his hair and had to lean forward to eat. He had not had any heart problem. He had not had any sleep problems or chest infections. He suffered from low back pain after sleeping. His diet was high in protein with lots of meat, nuts, eggs, and yoghurt. He had never tried uncooked corn starch. GSD IIIa, for the first time, was confirmed at the age of 28 in the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square in London, on April 7, 2004.

Serial echocardiograms, during the 18-month evaluation period, were performed periodically to evaluate his worsening dyspnea and generalized edema. Despite his worsening symptoms, the echocardiograms showed no decrement in the systolic or diastolic function with minimal increase in size of the effusion with no end-diastolic chamber collapse, interventricular dependence, or spectral Doppler variation suggestive of tamponade physiology. Physical exam revealed a normotensive male that was not tachycardic. There was a pericardial knock and distended jugular veins. He had coarse breath sounds bilaterally and mild abdominal distention with hepatomegaly. Extremity exam showed deep pitting edema to his thighs and small joint deformities associated with his known rheumatoid arthritis. A directed echocardiogram for evaluation of constrictive pericarditis showed a hyperdynamic left ventricle. Right ventricular collapse was evident along with respirophasic ventricular septal motion.

In the year 2010, he presented with a growth on the base of the tongue that had gradually increased in size over the preceding 8 months. He was a chronic smoker (15 pack years) and chewed tobacco. An irregular, friable growth was seen on the right side of the base of tongue measuring 1.5 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm \u00d7 0.5 cm along with the level I right cervical lymphadenopathy. All the routine laboratory investigations along with X-ray and computed tomography (CT) of the patient's chest and abdomen were within normal limits. Fine needle aspiration cytology smears from the enlarged cervical lymph node showed metastatic deposits of squamous cell carcinoma. We received an incisional biopsy in the Department of Pathology and histological examination showed features of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the base of tongue. Thus, a final diagnosis of carcinoma of the base of tongue, stage III (T1N1M0) was made, and the patient was planned for radical radiotherapy. The patient received radiotherapy (dose 66 Gy/33 fractions/6.5 weeks) in the same year and achieved complete response. He was regularly followed up at an interval of 4\u20135 months with no recurrence for 6 years. He had stopped smoking as well as chewing tobacco. His oral hygiene was good. However, in the last follow-up session in May 2016, he complained of mild pain while swallowing. On examination, an irregular firm growth was seen on the base of tongue. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. CT scan showed a growth on the right side of the base of tongue measuring 3 cm \u00d7 2 cm \u00d7 1 cm []. Salivary glands and vocal cords showed hyperechoic echogenicity caused by the fatty tissue infiltration, suggestive of mild radiotherapy-induced changes.

His medical history was noncontributory. On extra- and intra-oral examination, there was no apparent trauma to the soft tissues.\nIntra-oral examination revealed a complicated crown root fracture of the maxillary left central incisor and uncomplicated crown fracture with maxillary right central incisor. The fracture line of 21 was supragingival on the labial side and subgingival on the palatal side. The fractured fragment of 21 was incompletely separated and mobile [].

The intraoral periapical radiograph showed the fracture line. There was no evidence of periapical pathosis.\nThe adhesive reattachment of the coronal fractured fragment to the remaining tooth structure was planned for 21, to be followed by composite restoration of 11. To improve the tooth resistance and expand the bonding areas involved in the adhesive reattachment technique, placement of a translucent glass fiber post was also planned with 21. The patient accepted the treatment plan.\nThe gingiva was separated on the palatal side, and the fractured fragment was removed using a forceps without incurring any damage. The subgingival extent of fracture was confirmed on fragment removal. The surface of fragment and pulp chamber was debrided and cleaned. The fragment was preserved in saline until reattachment to avoid discoloration and dehydration.

He also reported that he had a surgical procedure at initial presentation in which his \u201cnostrils were scraped\u201d and subsequently was put on antibiotics for 6 months (patient unaware of the name of the antibiotics he received). His symptoms improved, only to resurface ten years later. Shortly thereafter, he moved to the USA. He experienced progressive worsening of nasal congestion, difficulty swallowing, and hoarseness of voice and went to a primary care physician for evaluation. He received 3 doses of intramuscular ceftriaxone followed by oral antibiotics. He reported a mild clinical improvement followed by rapid relapse with continued symptoms progression. He presented to our hospital for further evaluation. By the time of hospital presentation, in addition to the above symptoms the patient also noted a mass protruding into the back of his throat. He denied weight loss, fever, or chills. His past medical history was significant for treated pulmonary tuberculosis at the age of 16. He denied any cigarette smoking, drug use, or alcohol intake. His family history revealed that his maternal uncle and his oldest son had constant rhinorrhea and his mother had a mass in her nose, but all affected family members remained in Mexico with limited access to medical care.
