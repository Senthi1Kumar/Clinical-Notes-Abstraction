The patient was referred 2 years post trauma to a wound centre as the wound had failed to heal after 6 months of treatment by his General Practitioner.\nAt the wound centre the patient received treatment for a non-healing ulcer by means of various ointments, honey and dressings, with a view to referral for skin transplantation if the wound did not heal satisfactorily. It is noted that the patient was not diabetic and did not have any cardiovascular risk factors but was undergoing follow-up for aortastenosis and polycythemia vera. There was initially improvement in the wound over an approximately six-month period, but due to the return of hypergranulation tissue, increasing size of the wound and a request from the patient, a punch biopsy of the wound was taken which confirmed basal cell carcinoma. The patient was referred to The Department of Plastic Surgery and Breast Surgery, Roskilde Hospital for excision of the carcinoma. The ulcer, approximately 4 cm in diameter (), was surgically excised with a 5 mm margin, without the use of frozen sections, and covered with a split thickness skin transplant. The histology showed an ulcerated basal cell carcinoma of nodular type, with growth deep into the dermis, but not involving the subcutaneous tissue. Histology also showed that the BCC was radically removed. Post-operative control included follow up in the Plastic Surgery clinic for approximately one month. After the skin transplant healed the patient was discharged from follow up in our clinic to yearly control at his Dermatologist. There has been no local recurrence of the BCC. The patient was subsequently diagnosed, with diabetes mellitus type two (DMT2) and started treatment with dietary changes and exercise.",

At the time of admission, the patient endorsed worsening shortness of breath on exertion and a 20-pound weight gain over 1 month. During evaluation, a percutaneous axillary intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was determined to be an appropriate option for circulatory support.\nOn hospital day 9, the patient was taken to the operating room and the left axillary artery was accessed under direct ultrasound guidance. An IABP was advanced and positioned so that the proximal marker was just below the lower border of the left mainstem bronchus. The patient tolerated the procedure well, and good augmentation of the pump was noted. Daily chest x-rays confirmed placement of the IABP in the proximal-to mid-descending aorta (). During the early morning of hospital day 15, the patient began to experience cramping lower abdominal pain. Simultaneously, the IABP was noted to no longer be augmenting. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrated a perforated infrarenal aorta with an associated aortic dissection extending from the tip of the balloon pump into the left external iliac artery. There was an associated retroperitoneal hematoma measuring 12.7 \u00d7 4.9 cm. The distal tip of the IABP appeared to terminate external to the aorta (). The patient's right dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses, although previously palpable, were now noted to have only Doppler signals. Her left lower extremity also demonstrated diminished flow with 1+ dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse only with a Doppler signal.

Moreover, he had not experienced any difficulties when performing daily activities, such as walking, self-caring, and house chores. Due to the lack of severity for his URI symptoms which consisted of rhinorrhea, cough, and myalgia, his medications were not consumed. On physical examination, the patient's vital signs were normal.

His weakness and numbness were not exactly matched with the dermatome of the limbs. Upper motor neuron signs were not detected in all limbs. In addition, there were no abnormal intracranial findings on his brain computed tomography scans.\nAfter two weeks from his initial presentation, the patient experienced progressive muscle weaknesses, which corresponded to poor grade at upper extremities and grade traces at both lower extremities on MMT.

On physical examination there was a distended abdomen and pain on deep palpation.\nInitial investigations included a transvaginal ultrasound, which revealed a pelvic tumor extending towards the abdominal cavity. Pelvic MRI showed a mass located in the bladder dome that measured 12 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 11 cm, with heterogenous signal in T2 and a necrotic center (). The exophytic appearance and the mass location were suggestive of a lesion originated in the urachal diverticulum. The mass compromised other structures such as fat and muscle around the bladder, as well as a portion of the ileum, which showed thickening and narrowing of its lumen. Retroperitoneal and iliac lymph nodes were increased in size. No lesions were evident on the bladder neck, trigonum vesicae, or ureters.\nSubsequently, the patient underwent a transurethral resection (TUR) for a microscopic diagnosis. The initial pathology reported limited sample with insufficient material for diagnosis. Due to the tumor characteristics with evident invasion to other tissues, it was considered appropriate to perform a palliative surgery, consistent in partial cystectomy plus partial ileum resection.\nThe pathology report from the partial cystectomy showed an ulcerated and hemorrhagic lesion measuring 11 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 7 cm macroscopically. Light microscopy revealed a neoplastic proliferation of large polygonal epithelial cells, arranged in a nesting and trabecular pattern, with central necrosis.

However, the treating physician did not verify the distal circulation of her hand and discharged her after prescribing a painkiller.\nAfter returning home, her fingers turned pale and eventually started to show a bluish discoloration (). The pain became intolerable; therefore, she visited our ED, 12 hours after the procedure. Her initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 127/77 mmHg; heart rate, 101/min; respiratory rate, 16/min; and body temperature, 36.7\u00b0C. Although seemed stable, she complained of excessive pain (8/10 on the numeric rating scale) in her left second and third fingers. A physical examination revealed significant sensory deterioration and coldness on the affected sites. Puncture marks were visible near her radial artery. Emergency Doppler ultrasonography performed in the ED showed normal blood flow from her radial artery to the common palmar digital artery. Decreased flow at the second and third proper palmar digital arteries was also found. Computed tomography angiography showed a pseudoaneurysm in her left radial artery and no sign of blood flow from her palmar digital artery (). A thromboembolism resulting in digital necrosis was suspected. Subcutaneous enoxaparin (40 mg) and oral nifedipine (30 mg) were administered. The occluded branch was distal, which limited the usefulness of surgery; therefore, angiography was performed instead.\nAngiography showed patent radial",

In clinical neurologic examination, he showed acute-onset dysarthria, right-sided hemiparesis and hemihypoesthesia. Other neurologic examinations showed no pathologic findings, and he had no evidence of venous thrombosis. His past medical history indicated a previous hospitalization for ischemic stroke. He had no vascular risk factors (diabetes mellitus, hypertension or smoking). He had been taking aspirin 80 mg/day and rosuvastatin 20 mg/day for the past 2 months.\nBrain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging revealed an acute infarction in the left internal capsule and left corona radiata (Fig. ). In addition, there was confluent bilateral white matter (T2) hyperintensity in both cerebral hemispheres as well as the pontine area (Fig. ). There was no evidence of venous thrombosis or micro-bleeding on brain MRI. Brain and cervical MRA did not detect any significant arterial stenosis. Findings of transthoracic echocardiography and duplex ultrasonography were normal. Routine ECG examination showed normal sinus rhythm without abnormal changes. Applying a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), we found no cardioembolic condition. There were no episodes of atrial fibrillation in 48-h ECG monitoring. There was no minor-risk embolic source identified in our evaluation. His routine blood test, vasculitis screening profile and blood complement levels were normal (Table ).

He described burning abdominal pain radiating to his right shoulder and endorsed symptoms of nausea, abdominal bloating, and heartburn but denied vomiting. The patient confirmed flatus and bowel movement since the time of onset. He reported having a recent left rotator cuff repair, without complication, and denied taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications in his postoperative period. He was given a treatment of \u201cGI cocktail\u201d with 30 mg of toradol intramuscularly. Subsequent X-ray was obtained, which demonstrated an extensive pneumoperitoneum. Also, diffuse mildly conspicuous gas-filled loops of large and small bowel were noted throughout the abdomen with no convincing portal venous gas (Figure ). Patient was transferred to the emergency department for further workup.\nIn the emergency department, the patient appeared to be in progressive distress and was found to have significant abdominal tenderness in all four quadrants, worse in the epigastrium. His focused abdominal examination was significant for guarding, distention, and tympany to percussion. Subsequently, general surgery was consulted for further management. CT was ordered (Figure ). Further history revealed a remote history of peptic ulcer disease and negative history of colon complications or constipation. He reported normal bowel movements throughout the week. The patient was taken to the operating room for a diagnostic laparoscopy to evaluate for upper abdominal perforation with possible bowel resection with an ostomy.\nThe laparoscopy showed no evidence of contamination, peritonitis, or perforation throughout the abdomen and the remaining gas was suctioned from the abdomen before closing.

Whole body computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the presence of a pulmonary malignant-looking nodule without hilar lymphadenopathy. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed avid uptake of the pulmonary nodule as well as oropharyngeal, sigmoid colon, and prostate gland uptake (Fig. ).

Conversely, video-assisted laryngoscopy showed an infiltrative ulcerated lesion involving the base and both valves of the tongue. Oropharyngeal biopsy was performed and histology revealed an infiltrative squamous cell carcinoma. Subsequently, CT guided lung biopsy showed a lung adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent colonoscopy with polypectomy and histology revealed the presence of adenocarcinoma. Finally, specimen from the prostate gland revealed an adenocarcinoma (Gleason score: 3 + 3), too (Table ). Abnormally enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen up to 1.7 cm in diameter along with several non-specific lymph nodes have been identified. CT scan of the neck and facial bones showed a bulky mass in the right aspect of the oral cavity, infiltrating the base of the tongue with preservation of the adjacent mandibular cortical bone abutting the midline, given a horseshoe-like appearance of the tumor. There was infiltration of the muscles of the tongue base whereas the left mylohyoid muscle was preserved. Bilateral enlarged lymph nodes at level II and III have been identified. Given the presence of these multiple malignant tumors, multidisciplinary assessment was necessary. The laryngeal lesion was treated by radio and chemotherapy whereas the sigmoid and prostate tumors were treated by surgical excision. In regard to the pulmonary tumor, the decision about whether surgery or radiotherapy would be more appropriate was considered later.",

    "original_text": "A 37-year-old male was referred to the CTEPH center of the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam for the analysis of suspected CTEPH. At the age of 30, he was diagnosed with KS by genetic counseling (karyotype 47, XXY). One year later, following a high energetic trauma complicated with osteomyelitis of the right femur, he presented with acute onset dyspnea. By computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography, acute bilateral PE was diagnosed as sequelae of a DVT of the right leg. The patient's family history was negative for VTE. Anticoagulant treatment was instituted with vitamin K antagonists for total duration of six months, whereupon he recovered promptly.\nSix years later, however, he started to suffer from slow onset dyspnea on exertion. Perfusion scintigraphy showed multiple segmental and subsegmental defects, consistent with possible pulmonary embolism. Since anticoagulant treatment for six months did not improve his complaints, he was referred to our hospital. At referral, the patient was in no respiratory distress at rest, with a peripheral oxygen saturation of 99%. He was mildly retarded and obese (body mass index 31.7), had a thickened neck, and a widened forehead with little hair growth. Systemic blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg. Cardiac and pulmonary examinations were normal, except for a split second heart tone. No peripheral oedema was observed. Laboratory tests were within normal range; NT pro-BNP:120 micrograms/mL (N < 200 pmol/l, []). No coagulation abnormalities were detected, except for Factor VIII which was slightly elevated 211% (N < 150%). CT angiography demonstrated large, organized thrombi in the left main pulmonary artery, as well as in the right upper lobe multiple webs ().

On the date of admission the urine was light yellow and the patient reported that feces were of normal color and consistence. He denied alcohol or illegal drug use and had no travel history within the last 10 years. He reported jaundice and pruritus progressing for one month prior to admission. He denied having pain, nausea, vomiting, or elevated temperature during the whole month. Pain in the lumbar region was progressing during the last 2 years, due to PCa metastasis. Patient had metastatic PCa and underwent palliative hormonal therapy in ambulatory settings; he also had moderate aortic stenosis found by echocardiography and angina pectoris of class II according to the classification system by Canadian Cardiovascular Society. In year 2016, metastatic process involving the lumbar spinal and thoracic region was diagnosed using skeletal scintigraphy. Starting from year 2016 he received androgen deprivation therapy in outpatient settings and testosterone level was controlled in conjugation with PSA. Testosterone remained at castrate level.\nDuring physical examination, yellow skin, scratch marks on the back and thorax due to pruritus, and aortic murmur were revealed.\nBlood tests indicated that the patient had cholestasis, elevated alanine aminotransferase, elevated aspartate transaminase, elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase, and elevated bilirubin (). Infectious disease such as hepatitis C and hepatitis B was excluded using testing for antibodies. Autoimmune causes were also excluded; anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-glycoprotein antibody-210, and anti-sp100 antibodies, IgA and IgM, were all negative. Alpha-fetoprotein was also negative.

Her preoperative physical examination was normal and she had no past medical history (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I). No premedication was given. On arrival at the operating room, ultrasound-guided femoral and sciatic nerve blocks were performed under sedation with midazolam 2 mg and fentanyl 0.05 mg. After confirming the effects of blocks, general anesthesia was induced with propofol 3 mg\u00b7kg\u22121. A size 4 LMA Supreme was inserted successfully at the first attempt without difficulty using the standard insertion technique. The cuff was inflated with air at an intracuff pressure of 60 cmH2O using cuff pressure gauge (VBM Medizintechnik, Sulz, Germany). The LMA appeared to be in the correct position because there was gas leakage at a positive pressure of approximately 25 cmH2O and insertion of a gastric tube was smooth. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 1.5% and nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen under spontaneous breathing. The patient was in the supine position and hemodynamic parameters were stable during the surgery. The surgery was uneventful and the duration of anesthesia was two hours. The LMA was removed as the patient woke and there were no immediate postoperative complications.\nThe next morning, the patient complained of difficulty in swallowing and slurred speech. Physical examination showed the deviation of the tongue to the right on protrusion (). The gag reflex and global and taste sensations of the tongue were normal. To exclude cerebrovascular diseases or internal carotid artery dissection, CT scan was performed, confirming the absence of abnormalities. These findings revealed isolated right hypoglossal nerve palsy after use of the LMA.

After performing the standard multi-organ procurement, it was noted that the donor left renal vein was essentially dismembered from the inferior vena cava (IVC). This prohibited performing the standard en-bloc technique to transplant the kidneys. Normally, the suprarenal IVC is sutured closed, and the infrarenal IVC is spatulated at the iliac bifurcation for anastomosis to the recipient iliac vein. The pediatric kidneys were divided on the back table similar to an adult kidney procedure. The left renal vein was separated completely. The aorta was split down the middle and Carrel patches were made around the renal arteries. The right renal vein was elongated using the donor IVC in the standard fashion, and a venotomy was made on the side of the IVC for the anastomosis. The transplant then proceeded normally by exposing the right iliac vessels. Adequate exposure was achieved. The internal iliac veins were ligated and divided to elevate the external iliac vein and allow for a tension-free anastomosis. The external iliac artery was dissected to its full length, from the takeoff of the internal iliac artery to the inguinal ligament.

Upon emergency medical services (EMS) arrival, he was noted to be in monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) (Fig. ) that needed immediate synchronized cardioversion with subsequent resolution of his symptoms. Upon arrival to the emergency room, the patient was hemodynamically stable with benign cardiovascular examination. Resting ECG (Fig. ) showed sinus tachycardia with T wave inversions over the lateral leads.\nLab analysis revealed sub-therapeutic prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (INR). Initial work up with coronary angiography revealed trivial coronary artery disease and possible congenital coronary anomaly. TTE on the day after admission demonstrated a LV apical aneurysm with mural thrombus formation.

Hysteroscopy and laparoscopic ovarian drilling had been performed about six months before beginning fertility treatment. Bilateral tubal patency was confirmed and both ovaries appeared grossly unremarkable. Screening laboratory tests for both partners were normal and repeat semen analysis here found sperm concentration to be 100 M/ml, motility 60% and 35% abnormal forms (1992 WHO criteria). Based on these findings, the couple elected to undergo intrauterine insemination following ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate. After no pregnancy was achieved after three cycles, a simple 4 cm right ovarian cyst was noted and further ovulation induction was deferred until this lesion regressed. The cyst was essentially unchanged two months later, and serum CA-125 was 36.2 u/ml (reference range <35 u/ml), although the borderline elevation was thought to be secondary to recent exposure to fertility agents. By this time, the couple had elected to pursue IVF and, in anticipation of this, the cyst was decompressed by ultrasound-guided transvaginal needle drainage. While this cyst fluid was not specifically analysed, the ovaries now appeared grossly normal and an uneventful IVF cycle commenced. Seventeen oocytes were retrieved, and careful assessment of the right ovary identified a septated 3.8 cm cyst (Figure ) which was aspirated separately from follicular fluid and collected oocytes. The structure was mapped to a similar location where the previous needle puncture and drainage had occurred. This time, the ovarian cyst fluid was submitted for formal cytologic evaluation. The patient had an uncomplicated day-three embryo transfer (n = 2), and there were three blastocysts available for subsequent cryopreservation.\nThe cytology data were returned five days after embryo transfer, and was consistent with borderline or well-differentiated serous adenocarcinoma",

    "original_text": "A 59-year-old woman presented to our outpatient department with complaints of fever and loin pain of one-week duration. She had no previous history of hematuria or loin pain and denied any history of recent instrumentation or catheterization. She had no comorbid diseases. General and systemic examinations of the patient were normal except for bilateral renal angle tenderness. Her blood urea was 80 mg/dl and serum creatinine was 1.9 mg/dl. The blood counts were within normal limits and her daily urine output was 2500 ml. Urine analysis revealed plenty of pus cells and culture of the urine revealed Escherichia coli and hence she was started on appropriate antibiotics. Ultrasonogram of the kidney ureter and bladder revealed bilateral gross hydroureteronephrosis with renal cortical thickness of only 5 mm. Ultrasonography also revealed bilateral double J stents in situ with associated encrustations in both the renal and vesical ends. On further probing, the patient recollected total hysterectomy performed for fibroid uterus 32 years ago for which prophylactic bilateral ureteric stent placement was performed. As she was asymptomatic, the patient never made it to remove the stents. Noncontrast computed tomography was done, which revealed bilateral gross hydroureteronephrosis with thinning of cortex in both the kidneys (Figure ). There were bilateral ureteric double J stents with heavy encrustation in both the renal and vesical ends (Figure ). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography was avoided on account of the persistently high renal parameters.

    "original_text": "A 13-year-old, previously fit and well, male presented with pain and swelling to his right lower leg. A bone cyst was identified on imaging including plain radiographs and MRI scans (Figures and ). He underwent curettage on three occasions, including one with a bone graft, with recurrence on each occasion. An ABC was confirmed on biopsy on tissue obtained during curettage. En bloc resection of the proximal tibia was not thought to be viable due to the extent of disease and involvement of major neurovascular structures. Vascular embolization was not possible because no feeding vessels were identified on angiogram. Throughout this period, he had ongoing severe leg pain, was unable to weight-bear or attend school, and was at significant risk of pathological fracture.\nDenosumab therapy was subsequently commenced following discussion of a bone tumour treatment multidisciplinary team. The weight at the start of treatment was 36 kg, with a height of 161 cm. The patient received four doses of subcutaneous denosumab (70 mg/m2) on a weekly basis for four weeks with significant improvement in pain, allowing him to return to school shortly after, although he was still immobile. There was a subtle initial radiological response with a slight reduction in size of the lesion. There was asymptomatic mild hypocalcaemia (corrected calcium 2.03 mmol/L; normal range 2.25\u20132.74 mmol/L) in the early stages of treatment which was treated with oral calcium supplementation (calcium carbonate 1.25 g daily). He remained on this supplementation throughout treatment.

He had a preoperative examinations including trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE), chest X-ray but not computed tomography (CT) of the thorax. His aortic valve area was 0.7 cm2 with mean and peak pressure gradient (PG) 95 and 47 mmHg, respectively. His EuroSCORE was 11; noncandidate for TAVI. After a full median sternotomy and the pericardial opening, we found an unexpected heavily calcified (porcelain) ascending aorta. We did not perform an epiaortic ultrasound to quantify the calcification and to discover an area less calcified for cannulation because we do not dispose. With the palpation, it has been found only a restricted safe area in proximity of the aortic arch. In this, we were able to cannulate the aorta and put a cross-clamp. We discussed the option of TAVI, but we had not a hybrid room for this procedure. The only solution was the surgical AVR. Then we had difficulties in aortic cross clamp; we used two clamps to occlude the aorta due to calcification with the risk of embolism. This was a really very risky action for cracking atherosclerotic plaques and induces a multifocal and severe stroke. We perform the aortotomy very high to avoid the ascending aorta. The aortic annulus was extremely calcified and small (21 mm) with an aneurysmatic dilatation of the ascending aorta (40 mm) extremely calcified. This dilatation was known from the preoperative TTE examination. In the preoperative chest X-ray, we could see also this dilatation, but all these indications of aortic dilatation and the suspicions of porcelain aorta where underestimated.

Her past surgical history was significant for one myomectomy and one low-transverse cesarean section with bilateral tubal ligation.

Intraoperative findings were notable for an approximately 18-centimeter, nonmobile, leiomyomatous uterus and significant adhesive disease requiring extensive lysis of adhesions. Dissection included visualization of the ureters bilaterally distal to the iliac vessel bifurcation, and peristalsis was noted from the left ureter.

Cystoscopy revealed a normal bladder and left ureteral orifice with efflux of urine; however, the right ureteral orifice was not easily visualized and appeared stenotic, with no efflux.

On June 27, 2011, the patient underwent left knee arthroplasty for severe osteoarthritis with necrosis and bone edema in the medial femoral condyle and tibial plateau. A hemipatellectomy was undertaken along with transection of the femur and tibia which, because of density of bone, required the use of three saw blades (Brasseler USA, blade number KM71-563) using a Conmed Linvatec motor.

He denied any distant history of dysphagia prior to the workup for the laryngeal cancer. External palpation of the laryngeal complex showed limited mobility. Elevation of the laryngeal complex was limited on voluntary swallowing. Modified barium swallow test showed no evidence of aspiration. Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation were originally planned, but the patient was lost to follow-up until he presented to the hospital with respiratory distress, requiring emergent surgical airway intervention. CT scan showed the presence of a large mass measuring 5.2 by 3.4 cm involving the epiglottis on the right, as well as the hypopharynx, causing displacement of the airway. An additional 3.7 by 2.3 cm the right neck mass, determined to be a metastatic lymph node, was found with significant enlargement of the sternocleidomastoid (). He was staged as T4N2bM0; the patient consented to pursue initial surgical management of his disease to include total laryngectomy, bilateral neck dissections, and free flap reconstruction, followed by radiation.\nDuring the case, after completion of bilateral neck dissections, the total laryngectomy was initiated.

No epsilon or negative T waves were found on the EKG (). He had no history of familiar sudden cardiac death and he did not have any previous disease despite he was a carrier of C-hepatitis virus. No medication was needed for the treatment of that virus because transaminase enzymes in blood analysis were in normal range and abdominal echography showed normal liver morphology. He was only taking sertraline and bromazepam because of depressive syndrome. He remained completely asymptomatic, in NYHA functional class I/IV, and his physical examination did not show any abnormal finding. In order to begin the study of the IRBBB we first performed an echocardiogram in which a severe right ventricle (RV) dilatation () and a moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR) appeared. Left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) was preserved (55%) and mitral and aortic valves were normal, in function and morphology. The estimated systolic pulmonary pressure was normal and there was not any indirect sign of pulmonary hypertension. To better characterize the findings in the RV, a magnetic resonance (MR) was performed. It showed a diastolic diameter of the RV of 55 mm () and confirmed the functional cause of the TR (ring dilatation). There were not any dyskinesia or akinesia areas (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2, www.jocmr.org) or pathologic gadolinium enhancement, and RV ejection fraction was 57%. Abnormal venous drainage was also excluded with the MR. The transesophageal echocardiography did not find any interatrial () or interventricular septal defects.

The complete blood count, serum chemical and electrolyte analyses were within normal limits, apart from elevated levels of calcium and phosphorus, which were attributed to the young age (5 month) of the animal (Table ). The dog underwent a radiographic examination. Two well-defined lesions within the right II and IV phalanges of the right pelvic limb were found (Fig. a), in the shape of well circumscribed, mineralized new bone formation with a trabecular pattern. The dog underwent surgery to remove the lesion on the II phalange, and the excised tissue was sent for a histopathological examination. This revealed well-differentiated bone tissue, hyaline cartilage, and fibrous tissue in addition to hematopoietic tissue and connective tissue. Based on the histopathological findings, multiple cartilaginous exostoses (ostechondromatosis) were diagnosed. In the 1 month follow-up examination, the dog showed progressive ataxia of hind limb, a stiff gait and hyperesthesia in the thoracolumbar vertebral column. Radiographs of the hips and vertebral column exposed similar lesions to those in the pelvic limb.

Slitlamp examination of anterior chamber was normal. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed multiple pigmented placoid lesions located in the posterior pole and midperiphery of the retina of both eyes and a serous macular detachment in RE (). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) confirmed the macular neurosensory detachment in the RE (). Fundus fluorescein angiography showed hypofluorescence during the arterial phase and progressive hyperfluorescence of the lesions during the subsequent phases in both eyes and a complete filling of the neurosensory retinal detachment in the late phases in the RE.\nAfter conducting an exhaustive medical history, the patient referred a cutaneous malignant melanoma in the upper-right side of the back skin removed 6 years ago.

No additional information was obtained from positron emission tomography-computed tomography (). Upper endoscopy showed severe mucosal fold thickening with a narrow gastric lumen and normal mucosa (), raising a suspicion for Borrmann type IV advanced gastric cancer.

The patient suffered from bouts of multiple oral and genital ulcerations from age 46, and he gradually developed recurrent arthritis in the left elbow and occasional skin nodular rash in the trunk. At age 48, he experienced sudden vertigo, nausea, and vomiting followed by continuous dizziness and both lower limbs weakness. An MRI showed multiple lesions in the brainstem, presenting a high signal in T2-weighted sequences, and abnormalities in the CSF were elevated protein levels and white cell count (data not available). Based on these symptoms and examinations, the patient was then diagnosed with neuro Beh\u00e7et's disease (NBD) at a local hospital. The treatment of intravenous methylprednisolone 1,000 mg/day for 5 days was administrated with rapid improvement after 1 week, and this was followed by high-dose prednisone 60 mg/d and 100 mg azathioprine, gradually adding to 200 mg per day for maintenance (about 3 mg/kg/day), which is adequate for recommended dosage of azathioprine 2\u20133 mg/kg/day in NBD (). A total of 9 months later, the patient barely tolerated the side effects of prednisone and quickly withdrew after 1 month. Despite a sufficient dose of azathioprine 200 mg per day, the patient still relapsed with confusion and slurred speech after 2 months and was transferred to our department.\nOn admission, physical examinations showed oral and genital ulcerations without a skin rash, a swollen right optic disc with only light perception, and branch retinal vein occlusion on the same side without uveitis. Neurological examination showed drowsiness, decreased attention, dysarthria, absence of pharyngeal reflex, left-side ataxia, and hypoesthesia of the right face and left trunk without meningeal irritation signs. Proximal and distal muscle strength of left limbs were 4/5 by manual muscles testing (MTT)",
