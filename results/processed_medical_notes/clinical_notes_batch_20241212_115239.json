She was employed as a dog groomer, and her past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus with insulin requirements, gastritis, and severe valvular heart disease affecting the tricuspid, mitral, and aortic valves with surgical repair of the aortic valve. On physical examination, the patient was found to have linear, hyperpigmented macules on the bilateral lower legs with foci of scarring and ulceration. Two biopsies of the proximal and distal left lower leg suggested livedoid vasculopathy pending clinical correlation.

At this time, therapeutic options for livedoid vasculopathy were considered and offered to the patient.\nThe patient's preferences and past medical history presented several obstacles to treatment of her LV. She repeatedly refused anticoagulant therapy because her husband had previously had issues with the diet restrictions and INR monitoring mandated by the use of warfarin. Antiplatelet agents were avoided due to her history of severe gastritis that was onset prior to our management of her LV. Intravenous immunoglobulin was considered; however, the patient could not afford the co-pay and her cardiologist recommended against IVIG due to the risk of these hyperosmolar preparations causing fluid overload in this patient with severe valvular heart disease. The patient was eventually started on an acceptable treatment regimen consisting of oral dapsone 100 mg once daily and prednisone 10 mg once daily, with the addition of doxepin or tramadol for intermittent pain control. With these medications, she achieved intermittent remission of her LV for several years.\nIn 2015, she began having intermittent, painful flares of her LV which were managed by increasing her dapsone to 150 mg once daily and increasing her prednisone to 20 mg.

    "original_text": "A 26 year-old man attended our ophthalmic ward in April 2017 with intermittent bleeding of the right eye, from which there was also strong odor. The patient was a heavy smoker but had no other underlying conditions. He had no history of drug-use. From his medical history it was noted that the patient had undergone a right ophthalmectomy 24 years previously due to retinoblastoma, and implantation of an artificial right eyeball in 2014 (timeline shown in Additional file ).\nOn admission, his pulse rate was between 80 and 100 beats/min. His body temperature and respiratory rate were both normal. Physical examination showed narrow conjunctival sac in right eye and the exposure of ocular prosthesis, which was discharging a yellow-green secretion along with a strong odor. The visual acuity of left eye was 0.3, and the intraocular pressure was 15 mmHg. All other characteristics of the left eye were normal. A auscultation did not show any abnormality in the lungs, and no signs of carotid murmur were found. Interestingly, laboratory investigations did not reveal abnormal inflammatory markers such as leukocytosis or any increase in neutrophils or C-reaction protein. According to clinical and laboratory investigations, infectious endocarditis was not suspected. The patient had no history of other immunosuppressive conditions, except smoking and a retinoblastoma 24 years previously.

A laparoscopic myomectomy was performed 4 years ago because of a broad ligament leiomyoma, which was about 10 cm in size. Laboratory findings included a routine blood examination, and a C-Reactive Protein (CRP) test, with tumor markers all found to be within normal ranges. The pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan showed some nodules at the posterior margin of the bladder that were considered to be endometriosis, and some pelvic effusion that was significant on the right side. It was also noted that there was a mass shadow at the lower right ureter (medial to the iliopsoas muscle), with distention of the lower right ureter (Fig. ). The patient also underwent computed tomography (CT) scans to enable the practitioners to observe the size of the abdominal mass and its surroundings. The CT images revealed a region occupying the middle right ureter that was considered to be a retroperitoneal aggressive fibroma, which led to severe hydronephrosis on the right kidney and upper ureter, and a right pelvic effusion (Fig. ). After more detailed examinations were conducted, there were no obvious abnormalities detected in the brain, heart, liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas or blood. The color Doppler ultrasound demonstrated that there was a hypoechoic mass next to the right iliac vessels that was closely related to the adjacent ureter. This resulted in severe hydronephrosis of the right kidney and a right upper ureteral dilatation (Fig. ). Ndzengue et al.

She referred to using shampoo that she had previously used numerous times at home, then fainting for unknown reasons. This resulted in her falling into a fire basin and she was taken to hospital by her family.\nThe patient had been in good health.\nThe patient was conscious, but mentally incapacitated with generally stable vital signs and no abnormalities detected in the heart and lungs. The patient's body temperature fluctuated within the normal range after admission. The total burn area of the patient was up to 4% total body surface area (TBSA). The left temporal burn wound was about 1% of the TBSA and had formed black eschar which felt hard to touch. The burn wound on the left part of face was about 1% of the TBSA, and the base of the wound was porcelain white. Branches of blood vessels could be seen in the wound and the patient lacked sensation in the area. The left eye was slightly swollen and unable to open. Although the patient could not see, she did have a sense of light. The left external ear was dry with necrotic skin. The burn wounds in the neck, shoulder and the left upper limb were 2% of the TBSA.

She suffered from multiple medical conditions including: atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and a recent mitral valve repair complicated by postoperative delirium.\nShe was admitted medically to a rural Irish hospital in November 2015 for management of a raised INR. During the admission she developed sudden onset left-sided weakness and altered levels of consciousness, as well as rigidity and one isolated temperature spike. The concern was raised that she may be or might have been suffering from neuroleptic malignant syndrome and her neuroleptics were stopped as a precaution (Table ). She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the MMUH in Dublin with a suspicion of neuroleptic malignant syndrome or encephalopathy. Computed tomography (CT) brain imaging was normal at the time. As neuroleptic malignant syndrome was suspected, olanzapine was stopped. However, her creatinine kinase levels were normal as was her body temperature. Hence, neuroleptic malignant syndrome was deemed to be unlikely. An electroencephalogram during admission showed changes suspicious of encephalopathy and MRI imaging showed no acute abnormality. A working diagnosis of metabolic encephalopathy was established but extensive investigations yielded no cause for the encephalopathy.\nDue to prolonged altered levels of consciousness and unexplained altered mental state, the Liaison Psychiatry service was consulted in January 2016.\nOn examination, she responded with a mouthed single word greeting, but made no other attempt at verbal interactions. She inconsistently followed the examiner with her gaze, but stared out of the window for most of the examination. On physical examination she presented with waxy resistance to passive movement and psychomotor retardation.

He attended all six sessions. He continued to improve after the conclusion of the intervention, by self-report and clinical assessment in follow-up medical visits.\nCase #2. A 14-year-old female with fibromyalgia and depression reported improvements in both physical and emotional symptoms after participating in the full six-week program.

During that time, he presented with headache, vomiting, and auditory hallucinations for two years. He received oral risperidone 4 mg once daily together with intramuscular depot injection of fluphenazine 25 mg monthly. Despite the current regime of treatment, he was still experiencing residual mild psychiatric symptoms such as auditory hallucination. However, he is able to tolerate it and does not affect his basic daily functioning. He can sleep at night and his appetite remains good. For the past medical history, he had a short duration of admission history in a psychiatric ward which was about 6 years ago. He had no history of major surgical procedure. However, he had histories involved in minor motor vehicle accidents, which he sustained, minor wound for 6 times in the past 10 years.\nHe is single and currently stays with his mother. They live in an urban area and came from a middle-income family. He had a basic primary level of education. None of his family had a history of psychiatric illness. He previously worked as a cafe helper but remains unemployed for the past year due to lack of interest. He had no history of travel or petting cats. He is a heavy smoker and casual alcohol drinker. He had a history of using a psychoactive substance such as ecstasy 10 years ago.\nUpon physical examination, he was comfortable, calm and able to give full cooperation. His speech was coherent and relevant. His mood was euthymic, while his affect was appropriate to his thought. There was a minimal auditory hallucination in which he could not elaborate further.

At the age of 11 years, the patient suffered from endocarditis supported by a small ventricular septal defect. At that time, the ventricular septal defect was closed and a mechanical tricuspid valve (SJM, 28 mm) implantation and epicardial single chamber pacemaker implantation due to concomitant third degree AV block without escape rhythm were performed. At the age of 17 years, the abdominal pacemaker was replaced, due to battery depletion (Biotronik). Six months later, a second surgery followed with replacement of the dysfunctional mechanical valve for a 27 mm Porcin-Baxter biological TV. Another PM replacement (Medtronic) was performed at the age of 27 years, again, due to battery depletion. At the age of 30 years, the abdominal pacemaker was explanted and a two chamber transvenous ICD (Medtronic Egida DR) was introduced, as the patient suffered a syncope during documented sustained ventricular tachycardia. The ICD lead was implanted passing the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. Six years later, severe TV stenosis developed, caused by an ICD lead, that stuck to the posterior leaflet of the biological valve and ventricular myocardium, and the TV had to be replaced a third time. To avoid future TV dysfunction due to lead related complications, we discussed several options with the patient. These included first TV replacement in combination with epicardial pacemaker leads and a subcutaneous ICD (S- ICD, EMBLEM\u2122 Boston Scientific) or alternatively placing a pacing lead in the coronary sinus in combination with an S- ICD.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan performed at this hospital showed masses in both kidneys which were suspected to be RCC; thus, the patient underwent partial nephrectomy of the left kidney.

His Charlson morbidity score was 7 []. After admission, he suffered from respiratory distress and required intubation for mechanical ventilation. Initially, his cardiologist, who was the attending doctor, preferred to use advanced care for the patient. However, the patient was unable to agree to this option because of his impaired level of consciousness and therefore the doctor obtained consent from the patient's family to initiate life-sustaining therapy. As a consequence of this intensive care that included antibiotic therapy and management of mechanical ventilation, the physical status of the patient recovered temporarily. However, on the 36th hospital day, the doctor confirmed a further reduction in his level of consciousness, and magnetic resonance imaging showed that a brain infarction had occurred. The patient's family was therefore informed of his poor prognosis. On the 48th hospital day, the patient developed acute panperitonitis caused by a gastrointestinal perforation. A surgeon proposed either an operation or conservative care for this condition to the family who subsequently selected conservative management.\nAfter 49 hospital days, the patient's physical condition worsened, with the development of oliguria and progression of renal insufficiency. The attending doctor consulted us to discuss renal replacement therapy. After a careful diagnosis of the patient, we concluded that hemodialysis (HD) should be started immediately. However, his systolic blood pressure was barely maintained at approximately 80 mm Hg by the administration of a continuous intravenous vasopressor. Moreover, sepsis became uncontrollable, associated with multiple organ failure, indicating that the patient was in the final stage of a life-limiting illness. A marked thrombocytopenia due to sepsis was also detected. As a consequence, it was considered that the insertion of the dialysis catheter for the initiation of HD may have resulted in uncontrollable bleeding.

The CT scan performed demonstrated enhancement (>20 HU) of the lesion and was suspicious for renal cell carcinoma as seen in Figures and .\nHis comorbidities included a history of Autosomal Dominant Hyper IgE (Job's) Syndrome, sickle cell trait, alcoholic liver disease, avascular necrosis of the hip, polysubstance abuse, and depression. The patient described a history of recurrent skin infections with formation of multiple abscesses since he was a young child. These skin infections were managed both medically with the use of antibiotics and surgically with incision and drainage. He also had a history of respiratory infections consistent with his Hyper Ig E Syndrome. The patient continues to suffer from recurrent dental abscesses for which he requires tooth extractions and receives topical treatment for his HIES dermatitis. Serum IgE levels at the time of his malignancy work-up were found to be within normal limits. It had been over 10 years since the patient had engaged in any drug or alcohol abuse; however, given his alcoholic liver disease and HIES, he was at high risk for immunodeficiency. Appropriate work-up further revealed that the patient did not have human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B or C.\nTreatment options were discussed with the patient including biopsy of the lesion, surgical intervention with partial/radical nephrectomy, and ablative procedures.

She underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 2010 for symptomatic calculosis. The patient was admitted to our Department with a bowel perforation suspect.

HoLEP was carried out utilizing a two-incision technique. Upon completion of morcellation, it was noted that the patient's abdomen was distended, but his peak airway pressures were normal, the abdomen was soft, and the catheter drainage was noted to be clear. In addition, there was no suspicion for a significant mismatch between irrigation used and fluid output collected in the drainage system.\nGiven the previous similar presentation in Case 1 with no suspicion of bladder injury, we suspected that the patient had extraperitoneal extravasation of the saline irrigation through a capsular perforation as occurred in Case 1. The decision was made for the patient to be awakened, extubated, and transferred to the recovery room where he was further monitored. A stat noncontrast abdominal CT scan was performed that revealed a moderate amount of free fluid in the pelvis and upper abdomen; the fluid in the pelvis and lower abdomen was distributed in the extraperitoneal region with no evidence of hematoma (). The patient remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the floor with continuous bladder irrigation. The patient was given a 40 mg dose of Lasix \u223c8 hours after the operation was completed. Overnight, there were no acute events. On POD 1, the patient's abdomen was soft and significantly less distended. The Foley catheter drained 3950 cc of urine overnight without evidence of hematuria.

There were no other signs or symptoms. FNA was done to rule out breast cancer, and the specimen showed few foamy macrophages and rare clusters of ductal cells, with focal secretory lactational changes. Based on that, it was determined that the specimen was negative for malignancy. The tumor continued to grow, and in June 2004, FNA of the right breast was repeated and showed large staghorn-shaped sheets of uniform ductal cells with no cytologic atypia along with myoepithelial cells. There were fragments of fibrotic stroma and bare nuclei scattered in a bloody background, and so, a diagnosis of fibroadenoma was made. Two months later, the patient underwent excision of the tumor in another healthcare facility. Examination of the slides showed an overgrowth of epithelial and stromal components in pericanalicular and intracanalicular patterns with irregular large cystic spaces showing protruding leaf-like structures (). The stromal cells showed plump elongated slightly dysmorphic nuclei with occasional prominent nucleoli. Other areas showed significant cellular growth of the stromal spindle cells which appeared to be arranged in long intersecting fascicles and growing in herringbone pattern (). Within the spindle cell growth, extracellular mucin was noted. One focus showed an exclusive spindle cell growth which was moderately atypical with plump elongated hyperchromatic nuclei. Numerous mitosis was found, up to 20 in 10 high power fields in this focus. Entrapped epithelial ductal elements were occasionally seen in other areas exhibiting ductal epithelial hyperplasia. These features were consistent with malignant phyllodes tumor with stromal fibrosarcomatous overgrowth. The patient subsequently underwent mastectomy as the margins were focally involved. During the procedure, a mass measuring around 3-4 cm was found in the most posterior aspect of the breast and there was some indication that it may have invaded the pectoralis major muscle.",

She had mild numbness in the right leg. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 65 \u00d7 50 mm, solid, well-defined, heterogeneous mass in the right lateral pelvis space (). Magnetic resonance imaging of the tumor revealed heterogeneous hyperintensity on T2-weighted images (). The preoperative diagnosis was a gastrointestinal stromal tumor or a neurogenic tumor in the right lateral pelvic space. We performed laparoscopic extirpation of the tumor as follows.\nWe placed the patient in the lithotomy position under general anesthesia and inserted a ureter stent into the right ureter to prevent intraoperative injury. Next, we placed a 12 mm trocar with camera at the umbilicus using the open method. We then placed four 5 mm trocars at the bilateral upper and lower quadrants. The camera showed that the mass lesion (approximately 70 mm in diameter) covered the retroperitoneum in the right lateral pelvic space. We divided the right ureter and exposed the external iliac artery and vein. The tumor was located close to the right internal iliac artery and vein. We carefully isolated the tumor from the surrounding tissue using a THUNDERBEAT handheld system (Olympus Corporation, Japan). We dissected the obturator artery and vein to secure the surgical field. We resected the branches of the internal iliac vein as they were firmly adhered to the tumor. We carefully dissected the tumor from the surrounding tissues using both sharp and blunt maneuvers.

    "original_text": "A 68-year-old Caucasian female patient presented in our Department with abdominal pain and a concomitant 15 kg weight loss over the past 6 months that was unintentional. The pain was mainly located in the epigastrium. She also had symptoms of dehydration, due to persistent postprandial vomiting, during these months. Her medical history included hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Her physical examination was normal and her blood results and an abdominal ultrasound were within normal range.\nOn admission, a nasogastric tube was inserted and the fluid and electrolyte balance was corrected by parenteric infusion of crystalloid fluids. Two days later, the patient was subjected to gastroscopy which showed mild inflammation of the lower esophageal mucosa and gastritis. The instrument could not pass further from the third part of the duodenum, due to extraluminal pressure on the duodenal wall. Gastrografin swallow confirmed the obstruction of the third part of the duodenum with proximal dilation of the stomach and duodenum (Fig. ).\nComputerized tomography (CT) scan of the upper and lower abdomen excluded the possibility of a tumor or an annular pancreas to be the cause of the compression of the duodenum. The subsequent CT scan showed an acute angle of 15\u00b0 (Figs. and ) between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta.\nThus, based on the history, the unintentional weight loss may have induced the compression of the third part of the duodenum. In this case, the clinical and the imaging findings of the patient concluded the diagnosis of SMA syndrome.\nFollowing extensive discussion with the patient and her family, she opted for surgery rather than conservative management. She was unwilling to try nasojejunal feeds or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in the interim.\nTherefore, after obtaining informed and written concern, the patient was subjected to laparotomy.

A chest computed tomography scan was performed for the evaluation of persistent fever and recurrent pleural effusion, and it showed pulmonary embolism at bilateral multiple segmental arteries and segmental infarction of the involved lung segments. Based on the results, echocardiography was additionally performed and revealed isolated pulmonary valve infective endocarditis with severe pulmonary regurgitation.\nAfter the diagnosis was made, the patient was treated with antibiotics, followed by echocardiography. The echocardiography showed progression of pulmonary valve thickening and right heart failure. We performed pulmonary valve replacement with a #24 Sorin tissue valve. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was followed up at the outpatient clinic regularly with anticoagulation.\nAfter 6 months, he was brought to the emergency unit presenting with a high fever (>39\u2103) and general weakness that had lasted for 3 days. He was treated with antibiotics including vancomycin, imipenem, and rifampin. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was isolated from his blood culture, and the echocardiography showed a hypoechoic movable mass on the prosthetic pulmonary valve () and the pressure gradient of the prosthetic pulmonary valve was 16.2 mmHg (maximum pressure gradient)/9.4 mmHg (mean pressure gradient). Follow-up echocardiography showed a worsened pressure gradient of the prosthetic pulmonary valve. We did a redo-pulmonary valve replacement under the impression of prosthetic valve infective endocarditis.\nThe prosthetic pulmonary valve leaflet was thickened with infected tissue (). After removal of the infected prosthetic valve, a secure portion for the new prosthetic pulmonary valve replacement was hard to find because of the risk of pulmonary vessel wall injury.

Per abdomen examination revealed a tense, distended, nontender abdomen wall with a large solid mass on palpation, which seemed to occupy most of the abdomen []. Radiological evaluation revealed a large 30 cm \u00d7 20 cm tumor arising from the right kidney with no intravascular extension. He was posted for excision and surgical staging of the tumor. Preoperative investigations revealed a normal hemogram and normal electrolytes. Renal function tests were also within normal limits.\nThe patient was taken up for surgery after arranging adequate units of blood and taking informed high-risk consent from the parents. The child was taken into the operation theater (OT) after premedication with midazolam. After establishing basic monitoring and decompressing the stomach with a nasogastric tube, the patient was induced in a slight head up position to decrease respiratory embarrassment due to the abdominal mass. A central venous catheter was inserted into the right internal jugular vein anticipating a large amount of blood loss and fluid shifts.\nThe abdomen was then opened and revealed a large vascular mass arising from the right kidney []. The tumor was gradually dissected and removed over the next 1 h. Hemodynamic stability in terms of oxygenation and perfusion was maintained with isotonic crystalloids initially and later with packed red blood cells. There was no drastic hypotension noted and the operation seemed to progress uneventfully till the mass was removed from the abdomen.

However, it also showed no tendency to improve, and then the swelling gradually worsened.\nAt the time of his first visit to our department, except for the induration and swelling in the left submandibular region, there were no abnormal findings in the ear, nose, throat, head, and neck. CT revealed nodular shadows with marked calcifications in the left submandibular region and the upper mediastinum (). No significant abnormalities were noted in the laboratory examinations. Preoperative FNAB of the left submandibular lesion was performed three times but revealed no evidence of malignancy.\nBecause of the uncertain diagnosis, surgery was performed. After a skin incision of the left submandibular region, an irregularly surfaced firm mass in the deep submandibular space was revealed (). First, open biopsy of a portion of the mass was carried out for intraoperative histopathological diagnosis of frozen sections. It revealed calcification with no evidence of malignancy. Following this diagnosis, tumor resection was performed.

The physical examination revealed that the skin on the distal region of his penis was swollen with a diameter of roughly 5 cm when not erect, with the consistent expression of a circular solid mass. The patient already had an incision at the distal area of a circular paraffinoma mass to release the pressure on the glands by another paramedic and cannot urinate because of the infection of the incision area. The patient was referred to our division with a catheter and infection surrounding the gland area due to the excision. The patient was scheduled for paraffinoma mass excision and defect closure with FTSG. Excision was performed from the penile-pubic junction proximally to the distal shaft up to 0.3 mm from the glands (). The depth of excision did not cross the dartos fascia. The graft was taken from the left inguinal region and closed primarily using 5\u20130 polyglactin braided and 5\u20130 polypropylene sutures.

The patient had no dysuria with normal color urine, no frequent urination, and the defecation was normal.\nThe patient had history of previous 2 cesarean sections, the past medical history was negative for any chronic illnesses, and the cycles were regular with no history of dysmenorrhea.\nThe cesarean section was done at the 37th week of gestation as an emergency surgery because she had previous 2 scars and developed severe uterine contractions, she delivered a healthy male baby weighing 3.6 Kg.\nThe drug history was negative and the family history was negative for any relevant genetic information or psychosocial abnormalities.\nOn physical examination she had normal vital signs, the patient was afebrile, with no pallor, and the body mass index was 28.\nAbdominal examination revealed a localized tenderness at site of previous cesarean section scar with a 1*1 cm opening at the central part of the scar which was discharging blood during pressure over the lower abdomen. There was no urine discharge from the scar. Vaginal examination by the speculum was normal.\nThe complete blood count was normal with normal hemoglobin and white blood cells count, the urinalysis was also normal. The patient was sent for abdominal ultrasound which showed no abnormalities.\nFrom the clinical scenario we suspected endometriosis as the provisional diagnosis as many patients present after cesarean section complaining from cyclical bleeding at the site of the scar. The patient received medical treatment in the form of GnRH agonists for three months with little improvement and the symptoms recurred after that.\nThe second option was surgical intervention, the operation was performed under general anesthesia, the scar was excised and there was an abnormal fistulous",
