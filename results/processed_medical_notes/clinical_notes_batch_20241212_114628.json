The patient was reportedly in good health before she received a dose of intramuscular naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol and opiate dependence on the day of symptom onset. The patient had been smoking cigarettes consistently for the past six years. On arrival, she was noted to be hypoxic, and oxygen supplementation was initiated through a nasal cannula. Examination was pertinent for tachypnea and bilateral crackles. The patient was afebrile. While in the ED, she was placed on a non-rebreather mask because of worsening hypoxia. Chest X-ray showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (Figure ). A CT angiogram of the chest was ordered, which was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates as well (Figures , ). Initial laboratory data were pertinent for elevated WBC count with mild peripheral eosinophilia (700 cells/microliter). Levofloxacin was administered intravenously for the treatment of suspected community-acquired pneumonia.\nThe patient was admitted to the medicine service and was started on intravenous methylprednisolone for the management of suspected AEP secondary to injectable naltrexone given the temporal relationship between administration of the medication and onset of symptoms. Bronchodilator therapy was initiated for wheezing. Antibiotics were discontinued upon admission. The patient\u2019s oxygen requirements improved. Pulmonology consultation was requested, and the patient underwent bronchoscopy.

She also had dementia, and a history of multiple incidents of cerebral infarction and its complications.\nAt the emergency department, her blood pressure was 112/72 mmHg, pulse rate was 101/min with an irregular rhythm, and body temperature was 36.5\u2103. On examination, she appeared tachypneic (respiratory rate, 28/min) and her breathing sounds were reduced over the left lung field. The arterial oxygen saturation in room air was 92%. The other laboratory findings were not notable. Chest radiography revealed opacification of the whole left lung field, thought by a physician of the emergency department to be unilateral pleural effusion (). Therefore, after local anesthesia and under sterile conditions, a 16F catheter (Prime-S; Sungwon Medical, Cheongju, Korea) was inserted into the 6th left intercostal space in the anterior axillary line without image guidance.\nShortly after insertion, blood was draining in a pulsatile way from the catheter. However, she was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 132/78 mmHg and a heart rate of 98/min. After clamping the catheter, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed () and showed that severe cardiomegaly with displacement of the heart to the left with atelectasis (originally thought to be massive pleural effusion).

    "original_text": "A 39-year-old man presented to our clinic with nausea and headache. He reported that these symptoms had waxed and waned for five years and were aggravated for three weeks before admission. His medical history revealed that he had been diagnosed with a pituitary microadenoma at the age of thirty four with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and severe headache. Initial sellar MRI showed a pituitary microadenoma with stalk deviation and thickening (). An anterior pituitary function test revealed minimal elevation of prolactin (20.2 ng/mL) with no other significant abnormalities. He began to take lisuride hydrogen maleate, which decreased his serum prolactin level. Although intranasal vasopressin therapy significantly relieved the polyuria and polydipsia, his headache did not subside, and, thus, intermittent low-dose steroid therapy was performed based on clinical evidence suggesting that corticosteroids can treat migraine and cluster headache []. Interestingly, his headache responded effectively to steroid therapy, and the size of the pituitary mass was decreased with improvement of stalk deviation as compared to the initial sellar MRI ().\nAfter discharge, the patient had a symptom-free period of three years with intermittent steroid therapy. However, nine months before the current admission, his headache recurred with severe olfactory-induced emesis. These symptoms did not respond to steroid therapy as previously. Due to the enlargement of the pituitary tumor on the follow-up sellar MRI, gamma knife radiosurgery was performed (), but his symptoms aggravated.\nWhen readmitted because of progressive worsening of the symptoms, he was presenting with general weakness and weight loss of 13 kg during the previous six months (from 66 kg to 53 kg) without sign of dehydration, skin rash, or pigmentation.

    "original_text": "A 37-year-old female presented to the emergency room at our institution with intractable abdominal pain and fever. She has a history of dysuria and hematuria for 10 months, which at the time prompted an MRI demonstrating an abdominal wall mass with extension into the bladder. Outside biopsy was reported as \u201cinflammation\u201d. She was initially treated with antibiotics. A cystoscopy was performed and a transurethral bladder biopsy showed acute and chronic cystitis and Von Brunn nests. Cytology report indicated presence of atypical urothelial cells and she was then referred to the urology service due to suspicion for malignant neoplasm. Follow up CT scan imaging demonstrated a heterogeneous ill-defined enhancing soft tissue density in the space of Retzius inseparable and compressing the anterior aspect of the urinary bladder measuring 11.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f12.8\u202fcm with a peripherally enhancing loculated collection measuring 4.7\u202f\u00d7\u202f6.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.0\u202fcm along with marked thickening of urinary bladder .

Biochemical and radiological assessment showed features of acute pancreatitis in terms of elevated pancreatic enzyme level, and CT abdomen finding showed edematous pancreas with normal ductal system. It was attributed to hormonal replacement therapy after thorough investigation. Although the patient had stopped the implicated medications, she still had recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis.\nSince there was no obvious cause found for her recurrent episodes of pancreatitis, autoimmune pancreatitis was suspected.\nThen, she underwent endoscopic ultrasound in 2015 which revealed mass swelling at the duodenal ampulla, and biopsy was taken. The biopsy showed ampullary adenoma with high-grade dysplasia (Figures and ).\nThen, the patient decided to go abroad for further assessment where she underwent Whipple's procedure and histopathology confirmed the presence of ampullary adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.\nUnfortunately, she continued to have recurrent episodes of pancreatitis despite the removal of the ampullary adenoma.\nIn 2016, while she was admitted under care of a surgical team for another episode of pancreatitis, she was reviewed by the rheumatology team to rule out autoimmune condition. Therefore, IgG4 level was tested (1.49 g/L (149 mg/dl)). The biopsy was reassessed and found to have increased IgG4-positive plasma cells around 30\u201340 per high-power field with the background of adenoma with high-grade dysplasia. Accordingly, she was diagnosed to have both IgG4-related disease and ampullary adenoma.\nShe was started on oral prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg and rituximab therapy with significant improvement over 1 year of follow-up as the pancreatitis attacks have reduced from around once in every month to around once in every 3 to 4 months after 3 months of rituximab therapy, and currently she remained attack free for around one year.",

She was unable to walk because of severe back pain, but the initial physical examination did not show neurologic deficit. She did not complain of sensory decrease and the lower extremity motor grade was more than grade 4 on both lower legs. The initial plain radiographic study showed a fracture at the anterosuperior portion of the thoracic eleventh (T11) vertebral body (). Also, we suspected oblique fractures at the spinous processes of T9 and T10 vertebrae, and therefore conducted computed tomography (CT) to confirm fracture characteristics as we diagnosed (). The L2 vertebral body fracture was diagnosed as an old compression fracture. Because the fracture involved the posterior column, which are spinous process fractures, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was required. On MRI, acute benign fracture was shown at the anterosuperior portion of the T11 vertebral body with hemorrhage of the fracture site (). Hemorrhage within the disc was also seen at the T10 to T11 space. The posterior column including spinous process and interspinous ligament had high signal intensity on T2-weight MRI. The ALL was disrupted with the bony fragment attached. Although the interspinous ligament showed a high signal, the signal intensity within the spinal cord was not increased.\nConsidering the patient's age and the absence of neurologic deficit at the initial phase, conservative management was chosen. Also, bony lesion, vertebral body and spinous process fractures, were more prominent than soft tissue lesions, and we expected only bony union. On day two of hospitalization, we applied thoraco-lumbo-sacral orthosis and started standing physical therapy including tilt table.

He had a background history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), ischaemic heart disease with a previous myocardial infarction 11 years prior, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension and a long-standing history of smoking.\nA preoperative transthoracic echo (TTE) revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 75%, no mitral or aortic valve abnormalities and trivial tricuspid regurgitation. He was scheduled for a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure 5 days after his initial presentation. TOE is used routinely at our institution for all cardiac procedures as part of routine monitoring and patients are consented for its use.\nThe procedure was complicated surgically by poor targets for revascularization leading to a longer-than-expected case. Following an apparently easy and what was described as an atraumatic placement of the TOE probe, the anaesthetist had difficulty obtaining clear TOE images. The transgastric views in particular were noted as being unusual and a second cardiac anaesthetist was called on for assistance. The TOE probe was removed and reinserted presumably in an attempt to improve image quality and exclude any previously undetected damage on the TOE probe transducer that could explain the poor image quality. On removal of the probe, it was noted that there was fresh blood on the probe and further blood was suctioned from the pharynx. On reinsertion, it was still not possible to obtain good-quality views and the transgastric views in particular were still noted to be abnormal.\nAfter the initial attempt post revascularization to separate from cardiopulmonary bypass failed, the decision was made to go back on to bypass to initiate further cardiac support.

The platelet count was markedly decreased to 58,000/\u00b5L, and physical examination showed splenomegaly. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a cirrhotic liver with splenomegaly. However, she had no history of hepatitis. Lumbar puncture was performed after platelet transfusion, and no red blood cells were found in the cerebrospinal fluid.\nMagnetic resonance (MR) imaging and CT of the brain were performed for evaluation of suspected intracranial lesions. A T1-weighted axial image showed a target-like thrombosed aneurysm located in the right anterior sylvian fissure (). Ovoid high signal intensity was suggestive of a hematoma surrounding the posterior aspect of the aneurysm. A T2-weighted axial image also showed a thrombosed aneurysm and a posteriorly located hematoma with a surrounding dark line (). Difference in signal intensity was observed between the posteriorly located hematoma and the thrombosed aneurysm on T1- and T2-weighted images, i.e. on T1- and T2-weighted images, the posterior hematoma showed homogeneous high signal intensity, whereas the thrombosed portion of the aneurysm showed intermediate and inhomogeneous high signal intensity (). A gadolinium-enhanced axial image showed no definite enhancement of the lesions (). On precontrast CT scan (), the thrombosed aneurysm showed a highly attenuating wall. This high attenuation on CT images presented as high signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images. The posteriorly located hematoma abutted the aneurysmal sac.

She initially presented to an outside hospital and on examination had left-sided neck and upper extremity (UE) pain, with paresthesias and reduced UE strength bilaterally and pain-limited lower extremity strength bilaterally. Her presentation was most concerning for a central cord syndrome spinal cord injury (SCI). Facial lacerations and bruising, headache and dizziness were concerning for a concussion. Brain and cervical computed tomography (CT) scans were negative for acute intracranial processes or cervical fractures, dislocations or spondylotic changes and she refused an MRI due to claustrophobia. Without MRI or flexion/extension radiographs, the outside hospital physician was not comfortable clearing her cervical spine. She was discharged maintaining a rigid cervical collar and recommended to follow up outpatient with neurosurgery.\nBy approximately 6 months post-injury she had regained most motor function and, without consulting a physician, self-discontinued the rigid cervical collar without any acute deterioration in neurological status. Her chronic neck and left shoulder pain and weakness did not improve with acetaminophen or occupational therapy. She did not disclose her fall history to her primary care provider (PCP) and was referred for neurosurgical evaluation. This occurred during a declared state of emergency in the northeastern USA due to COVID-19. The patient lived in rural New England, over 1 hour away from our hospital, and did not have the means to get to appointments, especially with public health measures in response to COVID-19.\nDuring telemedicine evaluation, she discussed her fall.

He had a history of alcohol drinking and no history of smoking. After admission to our facility, he signed an informed consent form and received examination and treatment. The results of the laboratory examination showed that the levels of blood amylase, lipase, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA125, and CA199 were normal. Abdominal CT scan revealed a cystic structure located in the pancreatic tail with a size of 6.5 cm \u00d7 4.6 cm and regular margin of margin enhancement in both arterial and portal venous phases []. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed that this location was not communicating with the pancreatic duct [Figure and ]. In addition, EUS examination provided the following information: (1) uniform ultrasound echo in the pancreatic parenchyma and no expansion of the pancreatic duct; (2) cyst-solid space-occupying lesion with a size of 4.2 cm \u00d7 4.1 cm, smooth inner wall of 0.28 cm thick, four-layered echo of the partial pancreatic wall similar to that of the stomach, and no separation or nodule; (3) CDFI showed rich blood flows around the lesion and no blood vessels inside. The contrast-enhanced EUS showed pronounced enhancement of the pancreatic cyst-wall and no enhancement inside the pancreas [Figure , and ].

The pruritic urticaria started three days prior to presentation; however, she has been having similar episodes over the past few months but never as severe as her current presentation.

An ultrasound scan (USS) and fine needle aspiration cytology was consistent with MTC. The blood laboratory analysis of the patient revealed high serum levels of calcitonin and CEA, 222 pg/mL and 18 ng/mL, respectively. In December 2011, the patient underwent a total thyroidectomy and bilateral neck lymphatic dissection with a good recovery. Histological analysis of this specimen revealed a 17 mm MTC. In total 49 lymph nodes were removed from the right central, paratracheal, right lateral neck, and 13 lymph nodes contained malignant deposits. These were positive for MTC (12 lymph nodes from the right and one lymph node from the left cervical). Tumor tissue examination for the RET oncogene mutations was negative and no familial or personal history was positive for a genetic syndrome. The postoperative serum calcitonin and CEA levels were 1.99 pg/mL (normal range: 0\u201318 pg/mL) and 0.9 ng/mL (normal range: 0\u20133 ng/mL non-smoker), respectively. A USS of the neck did not reveal lymphadenopathy. Following normal urinary catecholamine, metanephrine determination the patient proceeded to a surveillance program. The patient made a good recovery with a normal serum calcium on no supplements at 2 weeks follow-up. However, in the subsequent months the calcitonin levels began to rise to pre-reoperative surgery levels suggesting low grade persistent disease. A computed tomography (CT) scan and USS of the neck were performed in July 2012 revealing only cytologically proven small metastatic lymph nodes. The patient underwent a repeat uncomplicated selective neck lymph dissection. Histological analysis confirmed that lesions showed features consistent with metastatic MTC. Immunocytochemistry revealed calcitonin expression and nuclear TTF-1 expression supporting MTC. In the subsequent months serum calcitonin and CEA levels began to rise. Skin nodules began to grow and by August 2014, serum calcitonin and CEA levels reached 411",

Physical examination revealed a non-tender, reducible bulge in the left inguinal region. His body mass index (BMI) was 19.0 kg/m2. Laboratory data were all within the normal range. Computed tomography (CT) performed 5 years before admission for other disease showed a left indirect inguinal hernia. In addition, a small protrusion of the adipose tissue into the left femoral canal and a portion of the bladder pulled to the left femoral ring were observed retrospectively (Fig. ).

As a psychiatric background, he reported depressive symptoms following the death of his only son 22 years ago.\nThe patient was referred to treatment at the psychiatry department of Hospital de Braga for the first time by his family doctor for collecting various objects, predominantly stones, papers, and damaged pieces of cars that were deposited unorganized in the patient\u2019s house. The patient collected these items because he thought they were valuable and/or usable in the future, but recognized that the collection was exaggerated. He could not discard any of these items, even if he never used them when needed. He reported to get anxious when someone else discarded some of these items. This behavior had started about 20 years earlier and it worsened with time.

Upon admission, the physical examination showed a blood pressure of 95/70 mmHg, heart rate of 100 beats/min, and oxygen saturation of 95% as measured by pulse oximetry. After light exercise, her oxygen saturation decreased to 90%. Laboratory tests showed increased liver transaminase (64 U/L and 100 U/L of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, respectively) and brain natriuretic peptide concentrations (1967 pg/mL). A computed tomography (CT) scan showed that a large 70-mm diameter saccular aortic arch aneurysm had substantially compressed the periphery of the pulmonary artery and that a large thrombus had protruded into the main trunk of the pulmonary artery. No other CT findings of chronic pulmonary thromboembolism, including abrupt narrowing, obstruction, or calcified thrombi, were found in the pulmonary artery branches ().

Pathological analysis reported high-grade muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (pT2 stage). The uro-computed tomography (CT) scan did not show any abnormality regarding the upper urinary tract. Metastatic workup with thoracic and abdomino-pelvic CT scan showed clinically localized bladder cancer.

Bilateral extended pelvic lymphadenectomy with radical cystoprostatectomy and ileal neobladder reconstruction were performed. Definitive pathological analysis rendered pT2N0M0 high-grade urothelial carcinoma (TNM 2009) with free surgical borders, associated with prostatic adenocarcinoma Gleason score 7 (3 + 4), grade 4 involving 20 % of both prostatic lobes. A total of 15 days after surgery, the patient developed penile pain. Physical examination showed painful induration located on the right corpus cavernosum of the penis.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen also revealed a tumor mass located at the pancreatic body; hence, pancreatic cancer was suspected. Artery invasion was seen near the celiac axis (Figure ).\nThe patient underwent abdominal vascular ultrasonographic scanning of the hepatic vein, inferior vena cava, superior mesenteric vein, splenic vein, and portal vein, which showed that the blood flow was unobstructed prior to the surgery. The blood flow volume of the splenic vein was 14.5 cm/s and that of the superior mesenteric vein was 18.8 cm/s. The diameter of the portal vein was 1.1 cm and its blood flow volume was 28.8 cm/s. The patient underwent IRE ablation under balanced general anesthesia for pancreatic cancer because the tumor mass was considered unresectable because of tumor infiltration of the celiac axis root and major abdominal blood vessels. Furthermore, multiple metastases were established in the lymph nodes of different regions. Before the IRE ablation, we performed tumor mass biopsies. The patient was admitted to the hospital after routine blood tests, which showed normal levels of leukocytes, neutrophils, erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets, and amylase. These levels increased on postoperative day (POD) 2. The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were also increased on POD 2. The amylase level of the drain from the IRE was 922.8 U/L on POD 3, which was 6 times higher than the upper limit of the normal serum amylase level, indicating the presence of postoperative pancreatic fistula according to the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula classification[]. The drain amylase level reached the normal serum range on POD 5 and after the drain removal. The levels of cancer antigen 199 in the serum were decreased",

PVL producing CA-MRSA was isolated from sputum and blood. Broad spectrum antimicrobial treatment for cavitary pneumonia which included vancomycin was initiated.

Heavy sedation was maintained to decrease cough with continued selective right lung ventilation. Additional antibiotics including linezolid, clindamycin, and rifampin were begun to optimize antimicrobial coverage for MRSA. Thoracic surgery consultation was obtained and left pneumonectomy was recommended given a degree of lung necrosis.
