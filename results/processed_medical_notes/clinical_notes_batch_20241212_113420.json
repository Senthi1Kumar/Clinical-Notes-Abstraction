She reported pain in the left wrist and hand, with intensity 10 on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS), pulsating, and always present, thus preventing any movement. Marked hypersensitivity and allodynia were present at the level of the left fingers, wrist and hand. Pain was present in both flexion and extension of the wrist and caused a marked reduction in strength in the left wrist and hand, making a handshake impossible for the girl. There was no redness but swelling and sweating at the level of the fingers of the left hand. The pain was so intense that it interfered with her regular attendance at school, generating social withdrawal phenomena, which are unfortunately very frequent in patients with chronic pain.\nPain began three months before the consultation, after an accidental fall with trauma to the left wrist. It gradually increased and did not respond to either NSAIDs or limb immobilization. The diagnostic tests performed at the time (X-ray, Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging) were negative, as were the blood chemistry tests ( and ).\nFrom the age of 8, the girl was followed by a pediatrician in our hospital for a history of cramps and pain in the lower limbs, especially in the ankle and left knee, both in the absence of trauma or caused by frequent falls. In the following years, clinicians found bilateral flatfoot (with subsequent surgery), mild ligamentous hyperlaxity and vitamin D deficiency. In addition, borderline cognitive level with motor coordination disorder and executive function deficit, as well as stuttering, were then diagnosed.

An abdominal CT scan showed a 4.5 \u00d7 4.1 cm periampullary mass arising from the pancreas without evidence of metastatic disease. Interestingly, the CT scan also showed the colon to be in a dorsal position in relation to the SMA (). Laboratory analysis revealed normal liver function tests and serum CEA level but an elevated CA 19-9 level. At operative exploration, the entire transverse colon was found to be retroperitoneal and lies dorsal to the SMA and SMV. The duodenum coursed anterior rather than posterior to the mesenteric vessels. The SMA lies further to the right than normal and the SMV\u2013portal vein confluence lies further to the left than usual. Inspection of the duodenum and head of the pancreas revealed a firm mass in the head of the pancreas. A classic pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. The anterior placement of the duodenum made division of the jejunum beyond the ligament of Treitz relatively easy. The tumor dissected nicely away from the SMA with no uncinate process of the pancreas present. Our standard procedure is to bring the jejunal limb for reconstruction up in a retrocolic position, through a defect made in the transverse mesocolon to the right of the middle colic vessels. This limb is used to create the pancreaticojejunostomy, hepaticojejunostomy, and gastrojejunostomy. Due to the retroperitoneal position of the transverse colon, we brought the jejunal limb up in an antecolic position. Pathology revealed a moderately differentiated PDA with all surgical margins being free of tumor and 1 out of 11 specimen lymph nodes was positive for metastatic disease. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged to home on postoperative day 5. The patient eventually developed recurrent disease and died 34 months postresection.",

A working diagnosis of viral meningitis was made. Following a lumbar puncture, she was treated empirically with intravenous acyclovir 10 mg/kg three times a day pending her CSF virology polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screen result which came back negative after 3 days at which point the acyclovir was stopped (Table ).

She has required plasmapheresis as her primary treatment for her Devic's disease due to the failure of corticosteroid treatment.

Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) []. This was placed in a brachial-axillary configuration with the brachial artery connected to the axillary vein via a trilayer PTFE graft. There were no issues during the operation, and Doppler ultrasound confirmed a widely patent graft at the conclusion of the case.

There was no sensory impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intraspinal extradural tumor over T10 to L3 (Fig. ). It appeared to be a spinal extradural arachnoid cyst (SEAC). To confirm whether the fistula existed between the subarachnoid space and arachnoid cyst, and to localize the position of the fistula, we performed a real-time technique. First, we injected contrast medium into the cyst under fluoroscopy. After 1 h the follow-up computed tomography (CT) was administered, and it revealed there was no contrast-infiltration into the subarachnoid space (Fig. ). We then extracted about 20 mL of fluid from the cyst. The follow-up magnetic resonance imaging on the same day indicated the cyst did not become smaller (Fig. ). A \u201cone-way valve\u201d fistula was suspected such that cerebral spinal fluid could pass into the cystic space from the subarachnoid space but could not flow in the opposite manner. Therefore we designed a procedure to localize the fistula. We penetrated two needles into the cyst and subarachnoid space separately in the L3/L4 level under digital subtraction angiography (Fig. ). Pending the fluid drained through those two needles, we injected 10 mL of contrast medium slowly into the subarachnoid space and a little contrast medium infiltrated into the cystic space horizontally at the T12/L1 level.

He had a history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension for 20 years and took metformin 1000 mg/day and diltiazem 60 mg/day. His past medical history revealed progressive slowness in thinking and walking, memory impairment, sleep-wake disturbance and mood disorder, which had slowly progressed for the past 20 years; however, it had rapidly worsened during last year of his life. He was diagnosed with organic mood disorder 5 years before this presentation and treated with risperidone 0.5 mg/day, sertraline 50 mg/day, and trihexyphenidyl 1 mg/day. Even with this treatment, his symptoms had been progressively worsening for the past 1 year to the point that he could not perform daily living activities, such as taking the correct medications. He was the fifth of seven children. His sister had a history of unexplained hearing loss, cognitive decline, and slowness of movement starting at the age of 20. When she was 40 years old, she developed visual and auditory hallucinations as well as recurrent transient ischaemic attacks with full recovery. The patient\u2019s father and mother died at the ages of 70 and 78, respectively, and had no history of cognitive impairment or stroke.

First-line chemotherapy was comprised of cisplatin (80 mg/m2 on day one, every 28 days) and irinotecan (60 mg/m2 on days one, eight and 15, every 28 days). The patient subsequently underwent irradiation of the primary site and pulmonary metastasis in the RLL with a total dose of 60 Gy over 6 months, followed by whole-brain irradiation (WBI) for the solitary brain metastasis with a dose of 40 Gy two years into therapy (). In terms of the clinical course, cognitive function gradually declined due to WBI, and cerebral atrophy was shown on head imaging (). Pulmonary metastasis in the RUL was histologically confirmed as thymic squamous cell carcinoma following transbronchial biopsy (). Histologically, the tumor was composed of highly atypical epithelioid cells, with nuclear atypia and eosinophilic cytoplasms in the fibrotic stroma (). Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for CD5 and c-Kit (). The patient was treated with nine lines of chemotherapy and palliative radiotherapy for local control of the brain metastasis and two pulmonary metastases. The patient then underwent second-line chemotherapy comprised of two cycles of carboplatin (area under the curve 6 on day one, every 21 days)/paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 on days one, eight and 15, every 21 days). In the fourth year, pulmonary metastasis in the RUL was targeted and irradiated once at a dose of 60 Gy, but recurrence subsequently developed. Following completion of radiation therapy, the patient received six lines of chemotherapy in",

    "original_text": "A 74-year-old male patient was diagnosed 3 years ago with a superficial spreading melanoma on his back. The tumor had a Breslow thickness of 4.0 mm and there were two positive sentinel nodes in both axilla. After surgical resection, there was progression of disease 1 year later with increased size of lymph nodes in both axilla and retroperitoneal. There was suspicion of a solitary lung metastasis in the left upper lobe. The patient was referred to our tertiary center for escalation of treatment. Molecular testing showed a NRAS tumor mutation but no BRAF tumor mutation.

After 9 months of treatment with pembrolizumab, the patient developed urticaria and erythema, which were indicated as an adverse effect and successfully treated with hydroxyzine and a topical corticosteroid. The patient was operated on a presumed appendicitis in another hospital. One and a half years later, the patient developed adrenal insufficiency and oral hydrocortisone supplementation was started. A computed tomography (CT) showed stable disease with disappearance of the lung metastasis, therefore pembrolizumab treatment was continued. After a total of 27 treatments, the immune therapy with pembrolizumab was terminated. Shortly thereafter, the patient developed complaints of dyspnea and coughing. Electrocardiography and echocardiography were normal; however, a CT-scan showed bilateral pleural effusion and mesenteric panniculitis.

On examination, the man had rough breath sounds. An abdominal examination revealed mild epigastric tenderness without other definite positive signs, and the patient denied have had previous episodes with abdominal pain. A chest roentgenogram suggested bilateral pneumonia. His leukocyte count was elevated at 16\u00d7109/L. He had a history of diabetes for 5 years, which was treated with insulin. He was diagnosed with pneumonia. Unexpectedly, during the 3 days of treatment with azithromycin in the Department of Pneumology, his fever never decreased. He gradually developed right lower quadrant pain with guarding and rebound tenderness. Reexamination revealed an 8\u00d78\u00d76 cm mass. Ultrasound showed decreased echo owing to inflammation. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed gas-liquid levels and dilatation of the intestinal tract (). The appendiceal area was obscured. According to the above examination, we judged that he already had a periappendiceal abscess at that time. The leukocyte count increased to 23\u00d7109/L at this time.

The physical examination showed pain during neck flexion and extension as well as direct tenderness at both trapezius muscles and the levator scapular muscle.\nA simple C-spine X-ray test and a laboratory test found no explanation for the pain.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 16-year-old boy of Han ethnicity who was a local high school student; he had experienced upper abdominal pain and fatigue for 3 months. At the time of admission to our hospital, he had lost 4 kg in weight. He had no other symptoms and no previous history of other diseases. Gastroscopy revealed a mucosal protrusion with a smooth surface in the fundus of the stomach (Fig. a). A miniature ultrasonic probe and EUS revealed a hypoechoic lesion (10.8 mm X 22.4 mm) that was suspected of having originated from the muscularis propria of the gastric wall; the internal echo was uniform, and the boundary was clear (Fig. b and c). Based on our experience and these findings, we considered the lesion to be an interstitial tumor. After communicating with the patient and his family, they decided to choose minimally invasive surgery, namely, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), under general anaesthesia. After completing the preoperative examination (chest CT: obsolete pulmonary tuberculosis and abdominal ultrasonography: no obvious abnormalities), we performed ESD on the patient. During the operation, we did not find any lesions originating from the muscularis propria. However, after opening the muscularis propria, we were surprised to find a lesion with a relatively complete package and multiple nodules on the surface. This lesion severely compressed the muscularis propria and pushing it into the gastric lumen, and it was continuous with a lump similar to the enlarged lymph node outside the gastric wall (Fig. d and e). After the lesion was successfully removed, a histopathological examination (HE staining) was routinely performed. Surprisingly, the pathological results revealed chronic granulomatous inflammation with caseous necrosis, which is consistent with tuberculosis (Fig. f 200X and Fig. g 400X).

Post discharge, she was off antibiotics, but continued heroin and methamphetamine and was taking multiple dose of ibuprofen in addition for pain control. On admission, her physical exam was notable for severe tenderness in her right hip, marked bilateral lower extremity edema and multiple deep, circular, punched-out looking atrophic scars involving all extremities at prior skin popping (subcutaneous injection of illicit drugs) sites. Pertinent laboratory data included chronic anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, WBC count of 10.23 k/uL and a platelet count of 395 k/uL. She had negative HIV, Hepatitis B antibodies and elevated Hepatitis C antibody with undetectable Hepatitis C viral load. Her basic metabolic profile noted a sodium of 140 mmol/L, potassium of 3.5 mmol/L and a creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL (estimated glomerular filtration rate of 17 ml/min) which was a significant rise from the normal creatinine levels a month earlier. Her urine analysis noted >500mg/dL proteinuria with a protein/creatinine ratio of 28.25. She had no monoclonal proteins on serum or urine electrophoresis. CT scan of her right hip noted marked degenerative changes in the right hip, with right acetabular protrusion and cortical disruption of the medial acetabular wall. She was diagnosed with right hip osteomyelitis and was in acute renal failure with evidence of nephrotic range proteinuria.

The patient did not report any recent flight travel, surgeries, PE, or malignant tumours. Family history was negative for malignant tumours. On clinical examination, residual swelling oedema of the right lower limb was observed. For further clarification, an abdominal CT scan showed a staghorn calculus in the left kidney. Despite therapeutic anticoagulation, the patient developed multiple left-sided DVTs. Consecutively, onset of fever and concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF) was reported. To detect possible pulmonary infection, a chest radiograph was performed which showed a transparency reduction in the right upper lobe. A CT scan of the chest confirmed a lung tumour and subsegmental PE. Histological workup of an endobronchial biopsy revealed the presence of a bronchial adenocarcinoma.\nFor exclusion of structural cardiopathy as aetiology for the newly diagnosed tachycardic AF, we performed a TTE, showing ventricular hypertrophy but otherwise no sign of intraventricular masses. Nevertheless, the quality of the examination was limited due to tachycardic AF.\nAfter successful cardioversion into sinus rhythm, abdominal sonography for assessment of possible hepatic metastases revealed an abnormal mass within the right ventricle. Since it was unclear whether the mass was the result of another thrombotic event or a metastasis of the adenocarcinoma, we performed CMR for further clarification.

The patient graduated from university, had worked as an office worker and recently retired. His wife described that, the patient\u2019s memory and ability of judgment had been impaired for 2 years, and his verbal output had been decreased. The patient was not taking any medicines previously. Because of forgetting his medication schedule, he attached his medicine on his calendar. Sometimes he forgot to turn off a gas stove. Although he had never lost his ways, he had trouble with driving and made some car accidents because of misperception. There were also some changes in his behavior. He had turned much introversive instead of sociable previously, and showed indifference towards household matters or works related with their offspring. Inappropriate laughing was observed in serious situations. Without a caregiver, he could not care of his own hygiene or eating. However, there were no psychiatric symptoms such as hallucination or delusion.\nOn the first visit, there was no remarkable finding in examination of motor and cerebellar function. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no remarkable finding. A detailed neuropsychiatric evaluation (Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery) was performed. The results were interpreted using 1.0 standard deviation (16 percentile) of normal Korean population aged 55, as a cut-off value. He showed time disorientation, and impairments in encoding, retention and retrieval of verbal memory, and retrieval of visual memory. The frontal lobe functions including executive functions were deteriorated. Considering the progressive decline in intellectual function affecting memory and other cognitive domain, and interference of activities of daily, he was diagnosed with dementia.

    "original_text": "A 16-year-old Caucasian female was transferred from an outside hospital with 2 weeks of worsening swelling and pain of a left-sided neck mass. The patient experienced fatigue and intermittent low-grade fevers in the 4 months leading to her admission. The symptoms were attributed to a previous diagnosis of Lyme disease which was treated appropriately with a course of doxycycline prior to the onset of neck swelling. In the 2 weeks preceding her admission, she noticed a \u201clump\u201d on the left side of her neck. The mass started as a small bump under the skin in the anterior neck and grew larger with increased tenderness. In addition, over the week prior to admission, she became febrile, experienced trismus, limited range of motion of the neck, as well as began to experience multiple episodes of abdominal pain and vomiting.\nThe patient sought treatment from several providers prior to presentation with an ultimate diagnosis of sialadenitis for which azithromycin was prescribed. After 2 days of azithromycin, there was no improvement in the size of the mass nor her pain. Initial laboratory investigations at an outside hospital revealed lymphocytosis and elevated liver enzymes. Computed tomography (CT) of the face/neck with intravenous (IV) contrast demonstrated a 4.8 cm by 3.9 cm by 2.5 cm mass interpreted as a branchial cleft cyst anterior to the left sternocleidomastoid. At this time, the patient was transferred to the Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Center of New York for further evaluation and management.\nOn admission, her vital signs were within normal limits and there were no signs of respiratory distress. The left-sided neck mass was described as a 4-cm non-fluctuant, matted mass, located just lateral to the laryngeal prominence extending posteriorly to the subauricular region with associated tenderness but without overlying skin changes. Bilateral tonsillar enlargement (left greater than right), erythema, and exudate were also noted. Her initial laboratory findings are summarized",

He also had difficulty in raising his arm above his head. Left shoulder pain over the past several months was associated with a palpable mass along the medial aspect of the clavicle. He was a patient with known primary hemochromatosis and was homozygous for the C282Y mutation. This genotype is consistent with hereditary hemochromatosis.\nHe had a past history of total hip replacement 13 years ago. Histologic sections of the articular surface of the femoral head revealed varying degrees of articular cartilage damage ranging from fibrillation to focal ulceration and changes in the subchondral bone, containing focal thinning and hemorrhagic changes in the base of the articular head. Mild intertrabecular fibrosis was also noted. Several areas showed a split in the articular cartilage at the border of the calcified and uncalcified cartilage. However, no refractile material (iron) was seen in the cartilage or in the subchondral bone.\nOn physical examination, he had swelling and pain in the medial aspect of the left clavicle and left AC and SC joint with associated neck stiffness.\nRadiographs showed a focal erosion and linear chondrocalcinosis at the left humeral head and rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy Additional findings included degenerative changes at the AC joint and an old Hill\u2013Sachs deformity.\nMRI showed a 1-cm erosion at the humeral head, which enhanced with contrast. Additionally, there were subscapularis tendinosis, enlargement of anterior glenoid labrum, iron deposit causing blooming artifact at the tendon, joint and labrum, and formation of glenoid labral ovoid mass (GLOM). He also had erosion and inflammation with effusion at the AC joint. Synovial proliferation, inflammation and soft tissue prominence were also seen at the SC joint. Post-gadolinium images showed marked enhancement of the AC and SC joints, as well as the subacrom",

He had no history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis or bronchial asthma. On general examination, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 101 \u00b0F, pulse of 106 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg in right arm supine position; pallor was present and SpO2 was 91 percent on room air. On systemic examination, trachea was centrally placed, there were fine crackles heard in the inframammary region of the chest, a systolic murmur was heard in the left second intercostal space which was functional, the abdomen was soft and non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly and the patient was conscious and oriented. The patient was admitted for further evaluation and his nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 came positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method. Blood investigations of the patient revealed pancytopenia and raised inflammatory markers with normal renal and liver function test (Table ). HRCT chest was suggestive of bilateral lower lobe ground-glass opacities with an HRCT score of 5/25 and CORAD 6 (Figure ). Patient was started on oxygen support along with remdesivir and steroids (Methylprednisolone 40mg twice Daily).
