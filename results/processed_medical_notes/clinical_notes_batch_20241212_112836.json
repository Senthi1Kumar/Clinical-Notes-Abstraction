At that time, a thoracotomy in the eighth intercostal space was performed for direct closure of the diaphragm. Pooling of right pleural effusion was treated with drainage up to postoperative day (POD) 9. The patient recovered and was discharged on POD 14. In November 2012, he presented with a right DH and strangulation of the ileus of the small intestine. He underwent laparotomy at the same previous hospital, found the defect which was separated from the previously sutured area of the diaphragm, and repaired it.\nIn May 2017, the patient presented to the local hospital with abdominal pain and vomiting and was diagnosed with an intestinal obstruction; an ileus tube was inserted and the patient was referred to our hospital for treatment. Upon admission, the physical examination was unremarkable, and laboratory findings, including complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and biochemical tests, were all within normal limits. Chest and abdominal radiographs revealed colon gas in the right intrathoracic space (Fig. a, b). On contrast imaging, the ileus tube in the transverse colon was observed to be incarcerated in the right intrathoracic space (Fig. c), a finding which was confirmed on computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen (Fig. d). The patient was diagnosed with a DH and underwent laparoscopic hernia repair.\nThe surgical repair was performed with the patient in the left half-lateral decubitus position. Four laparoscopic ports were placed in the abdomen as follows: a 12-mm port at the umbilicus for the scope, two 12-mm ports at the right lateral lesion as working ports, and a 5-mm port at the middle of the upper abdomen used as an assistant. Under laparoscopic view, the transverse colon and small intestine anastomosis were found to be adherent to the right hemidiaphragm (Fig. a), and we proceeded with careful separation",

Until two days prior to presentation, the patient had been in his usual state of health. At that time he noticed malaise, headache and fever. He also noticed severe right-sided posterior neck pain which was sharp and non-radiating. He had not noticed numbness, tingling, motor or sensory deficits. A day prior to presenting at our hospital, he had visited a nearby emergency room with complaints as above. His symptoms had been attributed to viral infection. He was given symptomatic treatment and was discharged home. However, in the next 24 h, he had worsening symptoms. Two hours prior to presentation, he had sharp constant substernal chest pain that began at rest. The pain was aggravated by inspiration and being supine and relieved by lying in lateral position. The pain progressively worsened over the course of 2 h and was associated with mild shortness of breath. The pain was non-radiating and unrelated to exertion. He denied nausea, vomiting, photosensitivity, sick contacts or recent travel.\nHe did not have past medical history. He had past surgical history of umbilical herniorrhaphy. He had seasonal allergies. He was using testosterone supplements for bodybuilding. He denied smoking, alcohol or recreational drug use. His family history included myocardial infarction in the father who died at age of 52. He worked as an environmental constructor and in wooded areas which made him susceptible to tick exposure. He lived with his wife and was independent in activities of daily living.\nPhysical examination revealed a muscular male in mild distress.

Three days before admission he had developed cyanotic changes in his left lower extremity, which gradually worsened. Eighteen months previously the patient had been diagnosed with superficial bladder cancer and had undergone transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TUR-B), followed by intravesical BCG therapy (Onco Tice strain BCG; 12.5 mg BCG injected through a catheter into the bladder every week for 6 weeks). Three months later, another TUR-B was performed because atypical cells were observed in his urine. Histological examination revealed transitional cell carcinoma in situ and he underwent another 3 cycles of intravesicular BCG therapy (13 months, 10 months, and 1 month prior to presentation).\nThe patient's temperature was 37.5\u2103 and his other vital signs were stable. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed an aortic aneurysm involving the abdominal aortic bifurcation and left proximal common iliac artery, with inflammatory soft tissue infiltration in the pre-vertebral space and focal pseudoaneurysm; these had not been seen on a scan performed 17 months earlier (). Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine revealed minor cortical erosion of the L4 vertebral body and paravertebral phlegmonous and abscess-like soft tissue lesions around the L4 vertebral body ().\nExcision of the aneurysm, wide debridement of the psoas abscess, and an in situ aorto-biiliac interposition graft with a rifampicin-soaked Dacron graft were performed. The graft was fully covered with omentum. Surgical exploration confirmed a 3\u00d73 cm cystic lesion in the anterior of the psoas muscle, with a hole leading to the site of suspected spondylitis.

The following lymph node biopsy was completed and the pathological evaluation showed reactive lymphoid hyperplasia characterized by vascular, atrophic germinal lesions with surrounding concentric \u201conion skin\u201d layers of lymphocytes (Fig. ), defined as the hyaline vascular variant of CD. He denied weight loss, lymphadenopathy, tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He gave no history of bone pain and drug abuse. The bone marrow (BM) cytology indicated no clonal plasma cell infiltration. Thereafter the patient was treated with irradiation dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions with clinical response. The clinical evaluation remained stable in annual follow-up visits. In the 4th visit, the patient was diagnosed in an outside hospital with 2-diabetic mellitus on basis of increased blood glucose, C peptide release test and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The blood glucose was well-controlled by the hypoglycemic and diet therapy for three years when he presented to the previous hospital with progressive hand-foot numbness spreading from the proximal extremes to distal ends. The electromyography test confirmed the hampered nerve conduction velocity of bilateral ulnar, median and peroneal nerves. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biochemistry from lumbar puncture indicated the slightly elevated protein (1.1 g/L, normal, 0.1~ 0.4 g/L) with normal cell count. The blood monoclonal protein level and bone marrow cytology was normal. Based on the resultant diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), the patient was treated with daily intravenous pulse methylprednisolone therapy of 1.0 g for three consecutive days. Due to the minor clinical response, the diabetic peripheral neuropathy was suspected with following insulin injection and oral mecobalamin therapy.

    "original_text": "A previously healthy 8-year-old girl was admitted to the emergency department with a sudden loss of consciousness, vomiting, and bradycardia. She was unresponsive on initial evaluation. She showed evidence of decerebrate posturing to deep painful stimulation, and her Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was 4 points. The patient was emergently intubated and ventilated.\nA noncontrast CT scan of her head revealed a 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm hyperdense cerebellar lesion with obliteration of the fourth ventricle and resultant obstructive hydrocephalus []. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not performed because of the patient's poor clinical condition. A right frontal external ventricular drain was urgently placed to relieve her high intracranial pressure. The patient was taken to the operating room, where she underwent a sub-occipital craniectomy. The intracerebellar hemorrhage was removed via standard microsurgical technique. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit. A postoperative CT scan showed the expected postoperative changes in addition to a small amount of blood around the fourth ventricle. No residual tumor mass was detected by CT []. No significant improvement in the neurological status of the patient was observed during the early postoperative period. Unfortunately, the patient died 12 h after surgery.\nHistopathological examination of the hemorrhagic specimen identified it as a tumor mass composed of neoplastic round cells arranged in sheets and nodules, along with blood vessels and large hemorrhagic fields. The neoplastic cells demonstrated high mitotic activity, and the percentage of Ki-67 positive cells was 45\u201350%. The cell nuclei were round to oval in shape and had open chromatin and evidence of atypical mitosis and necrosis.

An incisional biopsy of the mass via an incision over the left cervical strap muscles showed infiltrative loose clusters of tumor cells among fibrous stroma.

The rationale to sustain the injection was to demonstrate a connection of the cyst with the biliary tree and our experience that there may be a benefit of mechanical lavage of the biliary tract in cases of obstruction by secretions or sludge, which has been reported by our institution in neonates with parenteral nutrition-related cholestasis.

In addition, there were proprioceptive deficits in the pelvic limbs. Complete blood count and serum biochemistry were within the normal limits. Standard thoracic radiographic series were obtained and were within the normal limits; however, an abdominal ultrasound revealed a mural mass at the gastric fundus with mineralization. Standard MRI sequences of the head were obtained followed by a conventional CT scan as described earlier.

The patient was treated with chemoradiotherapy including 5-FU, Cisplatin, and 50.4 Gy radiation followed by further Cisplatin-based systemic therapy. Twelve weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, anoscopy demonstrated complete resolution of the anal canal lesion with a remaining scar that was biopsied and was negative for carcinoma.

The anal lesion was increasingly symptomatic causing pain, tenesmus, and bleeding. Repeated imaging of the brain, chest, abdomen, and pelvis confirmed that the disease was still isolated to the liver and anal canal; therefore, synchronous abdominoperineal and liver resection were undertaken.

There was no history of previous orchitis or scrotal contusion. He noted the mass a month ago. A physical examination found a 2 cm palpable mass in the upper pole of his left testis. There were no signs of scrotal inflammation. The mass had a firm consistency and regular margins. Palpation of his right testis and the lower pole of his left testis were normal. Routine blood tests were normal. As a testicular tumor was strongly suspected, a bioassay of testicular tumor markers was ordered. Alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were in the normal ranges. There was no bacterial growth in urine analysis, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis screening. A scrotal ultrasound showed a homogeneous testicular parenchyma, with a conserved vascularization on Doppler. An extratesticular mass was observed, attached to the upper pole of his testis.

She stated that her pain was worse with movement and taking a deep breath, and when reaching her left arm across the right side of the body. She denied any associated numbness or weakness. Her past medical history was notable for hypertension, but she could not recall the name of her anti-hypertensive medication. She had no allergies and had no other significant past medical or social history, although she did smoke e-cigarettes.\nOn examination, her vital signs were within normal limits.

In his past medical history, he has free of symptoms and had no chronic disease. None of the family members had lung disease and none of them were smokers. At admission, his vital signs were within normal limits except high respiratory rate (45/minute). Total blood count, liver, and renal function tests were also unremarkable. On physical examination, a 2 \u00d7 1 cm palpable mass was noted at right side of neck. Computed tomography (CT) of chest revealed bilateral air cysts in varying sizes with ground glass appearance (\n). Pneumothorax was also detected. The patient underwent biopsy form the neck mass and diagnosed as LCH confined to right salivary gland. The histopathologic features include polymorph nuclear leucocytes and atypical histocytes with oval nucleus with pale granular cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical staining with CD1a (cluster of differentiation 1 a) and S100 were positive. Chemotherapy including vinblastine and prednisone was initiated. During follow-up, pneumothorax persisted and another chest tube was inserted on the left side.

The decision was made to reduce and fix the humeral shaft first. The humeral shaft fracture was amenable to reduction and fixation with an extraarticular locking plate through a posterior approach with the patient in the lateral decubitus position.

The patient began to have chest tightness and breathing shortness after general physical activity 1 year ago and coughing (dry coughs mainly) 2 months ago. A small amount of white sputum was noted after a severe cough, which was heavy at night and light in the daytime. The patient was diagnosed with \u201csevere aortic stenosis\u201d using color Doppler echocardiography at several hospitals, and was admitted to the aforementioned hospital with \u201csevere aortic stenosis (bicuspid deformity) and left ventricular outflow tract stenosis,\u201d which was confirmed using transthoracic echocardiography. The patient had a history of hypertension for 10 years and usually took antihypertensive drugs to control blood pressure. The physical examination revealed a clear respiratory sound of bilateral lungs without rhonchus and moist rales and a systolic 3/6 grade murmur in the third intercostals of the left border of sternum. The liver was not enlarged and had no swelling in both lower extremities. The laboratory examination of brain natriuretic peptide was normal. Transthoracic echocardiography showed asymmetric hypertrophy of the left ventricle with a maximum thickness of 20 mm, the diameter of the left ventricular outflow tract of 13 mm, and the anterior flow velocity of the aortic valve of 4.3 m/s. Cardiac MRI revealed myocardial hypertrophy, left ventricular outflow tract stenosis, aortic stenosis, and bicuspid deformity (Fig. ), indicating the requirement of aortic valve replacement and left ventricular outflow tract dredging.[ Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (Fig. ) showed aortic stenosis and left ventricular outflow tract stenosis.

Immunosuppressive regimen included cyclosporine 100 mg every 12 hours, azathioprine 50 mg daily, and prednisone 5 mg daily. On arrival to the hospital, the patient was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 75/48 mmHg and febrile with a temperature of 100.6 F. Norepinephrine drip and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated, although a source of infection was not obvious at that time. Laboratory testing was notable for anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP). CMV viral load was positive with a titer of 3.6 log10 IU/ml and valganciclovir therapy was initiated as a result. Morning cortisol level was substantially suppressed at 0.6mcg/dL, and, due to concern for adrenal insufficiency, stress dose hydrocortisone was administered, followed by conversion to prednisone taper. Patient's hypotension and fever resolved within 24 hours from the initial presentation, and she was subsequently discharged in stable condition with a diagnosis of CMV infection, on appropriate dose of valganciclovir with plan for follow-up as an outpatient.

Chest X-ray showed mediastinal widening []. The CECT chest showed dissection of DTA just distal to the left subclavian artery, extending over a length of 4 cm with a para-aortic hematoma []. He was planned for surgical resection of dissection and end-to-end anastomosis of DTA through left posterolateral thoracotomy using left heart bypass. In the operation theater, general anesthesia was induced with balanced anesthesia technique. A 37 F left-sided double-lumen tube was inserted for the isolation of the left lung. TEE examination confirmed the dissection in DTA. Midesophageal descending thoracic aorta long axis view showed a large lacerated flap in the DTA opening into a large (4 cm \u00d7 5 cm) pseudoaneurysm cavity. Color flow Doppler showed free flow of blood from the lumen of DTA to the aneurysm. Careful look demonstrated another tear in the wall of DTA few centimeters below the large dissection flap []. Color flow Doppler showed turbulent jet originating from DTA lumen and entering into the same aneurysm cavity. The finding was discussed with the surgeon, and the surgical approach for left heart bypass was modified. Left heart bypass was instituted with cannulation of the left atrium and femoral artery instead of direct cannulation of DTA. A cross-clamp on DTA was applied such that it remains well below the lower margin of the 2nd intimal tear and enough margin of healthy DTA remains available for the anastomosis.

She had emergency cardiac surgery involving the dissection of the ascending aorta artery and the replacement of the aneurysm (Bentall\u2019s surgery). Four days later, signs of psycho-motor agitation, sensorimotor deficits in the left upper limb and left visual field hemianopia appeared. A CT scan showed the presence of right cortical and subcortical hypodensity in temporo-parietal and occipital areas. Over the following weeks, her clinical condition improved and after 6 weeks from the lesion onset she was moved to a rehabilitation centre. At that time, she presented with left upper limb hyposthenia and severe somatosensory deficits in both the upper and lower limbs on the left. Furthermore, she showed visual field deficits (hemianopia) and spatial neglect. She was verbally fluent but sometimes appeared confused and showed signs of verbal perseverations. There were also some signs of AHS (see below for the assessment in the acute phase). The motor weakness in her left arm recovered in a few weeks, while the somatosensory deficits persisted.\nWhen we met BG, she complained of experiencing difficulties with her left hand. She reported that the hand behaved in an uncontrolled manner and did not respond to her will; it interfered with or even tried to block the right hand when she was using that one and sometimes also disturbed other people who were nearby. Furthermore, her hand moved as if it was wandering in the surrounding space (i.e., levitation).

He had been diagnosed with bleeding hemorrhoids treated by rubber ligation. He had been followed up at his nearby hospital for several years, but since he suffered more frequent hematochezia, he was admitted to our hospital for evaluation and treatment of hematochezia. He had mild anemia (Hb 11.3 g/dL) and active bleeding during rectal examination. Laboratory data showed mild anemia. Colonoscopy revealed a lesion like a submucosal tumor in the lower rectum. There were no findings suggesting the presence of malignant tumors. The lesion had a size of 20 mm and was localized just above the dentate line (Fig. ). Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed that the lesion was located outside of the rectum wall and there was blood flow in the lesion (Fig. ). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) showed an thickened rectal wall and vascular hyperplasia around the rectum (Fig. ), but no tumor component. On T1WI and T2WI obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a low signal area was found in the thickened rectal lesion indicating flow voids (Fig. ). This finding strongly suggested that it was a vascular lesion, not a tumor. Angiography of the inferior mesenteric artery and the internal iliac artery confirmed vascular hyperplasia and nidus in the periphery of the superior rectal artery (SRA) (Fig. , ). Based on these findings, we diagnosed rectal AVM. Since bleeding from AVM was out of control, surgical resection was necessary. However, due to the age of the patient, we performed TAE although APR would have been necessary for the resection of the lesion. TAE is less invasive than surgical resection and helps to improve the patient's QOL. Therefore, we performed TAE to stop the bleeding.

During his malignancy evaluation, he developed altered mental status and experienced multiple cerebral embolic vascular accidents. No source of emboli was found with either transesophageal or transthoracic echocardiogram. The etiology was postulated to be the hypercoagulable state from the underlying malignancy. The plan was surgical removal of the tumor; however, during the patient's hospital stay, his clinical status declined, and he required ventilator support to maintain his oxygen saturation. He was transferred to our tertiary care center for further workup and treatment.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the brain was concerning for leptomeningeal inflammation and hydrocephalus. Lumbar puncture revealed cryptococcal antigen, and induction therapy with amphotericin B 5 mg/kg IV every 24 hours and flucytosine 25 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for 4 weeks was begun for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis. The patient also received ampicillin 2 g IV every 4 hours, ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 12 hours, and vancomycin 1,500 mg once, followed by 1,000 mg every 12 hours. An external ventricular drain was placed to monitor intracranial pressure (ICP). After multiple lumbar punctures with elevated opening pressures and concern for uncontrolled ICP, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) was placed.\nOphthalmology was consulted approximately 1 month after the patient was transferred. Dilated fundus examination revealed bilateral multifocal, elevated, white chorioretinal infiltrates with vitritis.
