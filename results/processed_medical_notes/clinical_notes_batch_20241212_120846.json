    "original_text": "A 69-year old man presented with a history of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis and an 8 cm x 6 cm pseudocyst of the pancreatic tail. He complained of long lasting symptoms including chronic abdominal pain, nausea and early satiety.\nPreoperative upper endoscopy and multi-slice computer tomography (MSCT) showed no other pathological findings, with normal appearance of the duodenum and the pancreatic head. He underwent an uneventful surgical pseudocystojejunostomy with a normal operative and early postoperative course. Three months postoperatively he presented to the emergency department with epigastric pain, intense nausea, vomiting, intolerance of solid food and profound weight loss. An urgent MSCT showed a markedly enlarged pancreatic head with suspected tumor involvement of the pancreatico-duodenal complex and dilation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts (Figure ). On upper endoscopy, obstruction of the duodenum was apparent with duodenal biopsy showing nonspecific mucosal changes consistent with chronic inflammation. Upper gastrointestinal series also showed obstruction of the duodenum (Figure ). A decision was made to perform a PD. At laparotomy, the operation was extended into a TP since the pancreatic tail showed marked atrophy with necrotic debris filling the residual psudocyst.

Earlier in the day the child had complained of a headache accompanied by vomiting. Ibuprofen offered minimal relief. During a nap later that day, the girl was noted to be having a tonic clonic seizure, lasting for an unknown duration. Emergency medical services (EMS) noted the patient to be postictal upon her arrival. While en route, EMS noted another seizure consisting of her right arm shaking and it was treated with lorazepam. Upon arrival to the ED, the patient again appeared to be postictal. There was no history of trauma prior to or during the seizure and no history of recent infectious illness. Her point of care blood glucose was normal. The patient had a history of seizures but had been seizure-free and off medication for two years.

The patient was initially brought in for hospitalization by family secondary to altered mental status and disorientation. Upon presentation, an extensive medical workup was undertaken, including laboratory analysis (basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, urinalysis, urine drug screen, ammonia concentration, vitamin B12 concentration, folate concentration, thyroid stimulating hormone, liver function tests, and venereal disease research laboratory), computed tomography of the head, and electroencephalography.

There was no report of history of neck trauma or manipulation that would predispose the patient to injury. A week later, the pain was worsened. There were no associated episodes of headaches, nausea and vomiting or numbness in right upper extremity.\nPhysical examination revealed winging of the patient's right scapula and severe atrophy of the right trapezius muscle (). Moreover, there was weakness in contralateral rotation and ipsilateral flexion of the neck on the right side. Passive range of motion of his right shoulder joint was normal. Manual muscle test grade was poor plus in flexion and abduction; and normal in external and internal rotation on his right shoulder. The patient was unable to abduct and flex the right arm forwardly to more than 70 to 80 degrees (). There were normal muscle tone, normal sensory function and symmetrical upper extremity reflexes. Hawkins', Neer's, Roos', Wright's, and Adson's provocative tests were all negative.\nThe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nerve conduction study (NCS), and electromyography (EMG) on the right shoulder were performed to determine the cause of weakness and pain, on the basis of history and physical examination.\nThe MRI demonstrated increased signal intensity at the supraspinatus muscle. This finding was suggestive of partial tear of supraspinatus muscle on the articular surface. NCS and EMG were carried out almost 10 days after the onset of symptoms. NCS of the SANs showed low amplitude and prolonged latency of nerve potential of the right side when compared with the left side ().

She had massive swelling and multiple elevated verrucose-like lesions over thigh, the larger ones along medial and lateral aspect of thigh (). Her distal pulses and neurology were intact. Systemic examination revealed no abnormality. She had undergone hemiepiphysiodesis of right distal femoral physis and upper tibial physis at age of seven years. X-ray of right thigh was taken and it showed fracture shaft of femur at distal third with cannulated screws in situ, which were used for epiphysiodesis ().\nUltrasonography of the thigh was done and it showed venous malformation along whole thigh in dermis as well as in muscular planes. Contralateral thigh X-ray was taken and obvious differences in bone diameter as well as bone quality were noted.\nThe patient was kept on upper tibial skeletal traction for two weeks. Swelling gradually subsided. X-ray was taken with traction applied over the limb and it revealed about 15 degrees of valgus and posterior angulation with some callus at fracture site. At this time patient was taken for definitive fixation. We did closed reduction under fluoroscopy and then immobilization with external fixator. While putting the Schanz screws, distal screws were kept without predrilling due to severe osteopenia of bone.\nGradual range of motion exercise and quadriceps strengthening exercises were started from third postoperative day. Crutch walking was a bit difficult for her as her right limb was about 5 cm longer than the left.\nFollow-up X-rays showed good amount of callus ().

Computed tomography (CT) showed an unstable pelvic injury (AO type B2) with fracture of the left ilium and pubis (). Because of active bleeding from a branch of the left lateral genital artery as detected on contrast-enhanced CT, transcatheter arterial embolization was performed on the day of the injury. Eight days later, dual INFIX was used to stabilize the pelvic ring injury. The patient was positioned supine on a radiolucent table. A longitudinal 5 cm incision was made centered over the anterior inferior iliac spine. Care was taken to protect the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, which was retracted laterally. The entry point to the supra-acetabular corridor was identified from an obturator-outlet view on image intensification (). Polyaxial screws were introduced along a path between the anterior inferior iliac spine and ipsilateral posterior superior iliac spine until the head of the screw lay immediately above the fascia [, ] (). The size of the screws inserted was 80 mm long cranially, 100 mm long caudally, and both 8.0 mm in diameter. This process was repeated on the opposite side. Once both screws were inserted, 5.5 mm titanium rods were cut and shaped, considering the size and abdominal shape of the patient so as not to compress abdominal organs. Bilateral cranial screws were connected by a rod passed subcutaneously, and caudal screws were connected by the other rod. Finally, cross-link connectors connected cranial and caudal rods on the right and left ( and ). The surgical time was 100 min and intraoperative bleeding was 85 mL.

On examination, there was gross sensitivity with palpation and swelling. Elbow range of motion was painful and limited; crepitation was also detected. Neurovascular examination and adjacent joints were normal. Varus and valgus stress tests could not be applied because of gross swelling and pain.\nPlain radiographs of the elbow revealed incongruity and increase in joint space of the elbow. The medial epicondyle was not in the anatomic position and a bone fragment was present in the joint (). At this moment, it was obvious that elbow dislocated and reduced spontaneously and medial epicondyle entrapped within the joint. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed to see if any other pathology was present. Incarcerated medial epicondyle was seen easily in 3 dimension CT scan ().\nUrgent surgery was performed.

He has never had a central line passed before or cannulation of veins in the neck. His medical history was unremarkable. He was initially seen and managed in a local hospital before his referral to our facility. Magnetic resonance angiography done at our facility (West China Hospital) showed a fistula with a wide neck between the right distal vertebral artery and paraspinal venous plexus. This prompted us to do a digital subtraction angiogram (DSA). On DSA, we noticed a high-flow fistula with total antegrade blood flow from the V3 segment of the vertebral artery (Fig. A\u2013D). No further arterial supply was found except the vertebral artery. The venous drainage was via a complex venous plexus of epidural and paraspinal veins. We noticed during our evaluation that preservation of both the distal and proximal vertebral artery via endovascular obliteration would not result into severe complications owing to none contrast filling at the right distal vertebral artery. We also observed that the contralateral compensatory blood supply to the basilar artery was adequate. However, posterior cerebellar and/or spinal infarct risk and the fact that the patient already had neurological defect, prompted us to preserve the vertebral artery. Therefore, endovascular approach with balloons was the most suitable treatment option.

No abnormalities in facial expressions, limb weakness, drooling, or chest discomfort were noted during the crisis.\nOn admission to the emergency department, she was afebrile, alert, normotensive with a blood pressure of 135/82 mm Hg, a heart rate of 76 bpm, and nonobese with a BMI of 24.2 kg/m2. Her oxygen saturation was 87% on room air. Physical examination showed no noticeable abnormalities. Complete blood cell count was in the normal range. Blood biochemistry, including blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, high-sensitive troponin T, and N-terminal pro-BNP, was all in the normal range. The non-ST elevated myocardial infarction was excluded. Due to the syncopal episode at home, a head computed tomography was then performed, showing an extradural hematoma due to the collapse, but no other cerebral malformation was noted. We decided to have a coronary computed tomography angiography performed that ruled out coronary artery disease but revealed a pulmonary embolism. Multiple emboli were noted, causing a subtotal occlusion of the distal segment of the right pulmonary artery (). The left pulmonary artery was also partially occluded (). A venous duplex scanning for proximal deep vein thrombosis was performed that revealed no venous clot. Due to the presence of PE, we proceeded to screen malignant diseases and autoimmune diseases and test the autoimmune antibodies and possible causes of hypercoagulopathy, which showed no abnormality.

The pain and swelling appeared during her third trimester of pregnancy, persisted for nearly 4 months up to the first admission to the orthopedic department, and she had a 2-month-old baby at the first clinical evaluation. There was no past medical history of trauma or previous treatment. Physical examination revealed the swelling and tenderness on the dorsum of the hand in the area above the carpometacarpal joints. Routine laboratory blood test results were within normal limits. Plain roentgenograms showed a lytic lesion that involved the capitate almost totally except the proximal pole but surrounding bones were normal (). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a neoplastic lesion expanding beyond the cortices both dorsally and palmarly, eroding the dorsal edge of the third metacarpal bone, and causing edema of hamate and trapezium (). We performed an open biopsy which resulted in the diagnosis of GCTOB (). We also conducted a radiologic bone survey and computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealing no pathology, however we postponed a bone scintigraphy because she had a 2-month-old baby and wanted to breastfeed thus avoiding radioactive material. For the definitive treatment, en bloc resection and reconstruction of the resultant defect were performed. The capitate was resected together with proximal 1 cm of the third and fourth metacarpal bones as well as the articular surfaces of the trapezium, trapezoid, triquetrum, and hamate. Scaphoid and lunate were left intact. The resultant defect was reconstructed by using a bicortical iliac bone autograft. Fixation was achieved with K wires (). A short arm cast was also applied.

The patient had no history of chronic medication usage.\nInitial investigations included magnetic resonance enterography that was normal and a capsule endoscopy that showed rare erosions, aphthoid ulcers and two ulcerated stenosis ().\nOne month later, he developed an acute small bowel obstruction, and a laparotomy was therefore undertaken.\nThe laparotomy revealed the presence of two transition zones between dilated and non-dilated small bowel. These zones were located within 40 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve, and they corresponded to a few millimeters thin lesions, with no evidence of a thickening in the bowel or mesenteric abnormalities (classic stigmata of stenotic Crohn disease).

Fetal magnetic resonance urography (MRU) which was performed in the 34th week of gestation confirmed a large cystic fetal abdominal mass (8\u22179 cm) in the right abdominal cavity which displaced bowel loops to the left (Figures and ). The mass was suspicious for a large single mesenteric cyst.

She had had a history of unprovoked pulmonary embolism 4 years after the renal transplant and had been treated with oral anticoagulation for 2 years. The hematology consultant found no evidence of thrombophilia. Her cyclosporine dose had been tapered off within 1 month of starting dialysis. Her prednisone in a dose of 5 mg orally per day was continued throughout pregnancy. She was found to be 6 weeks pregnant after being on dialysis for 3 months. This was an unplanned pregnancy. The patient had a history of smoking but quit on learning of her pregnancy. She was switched to intensive hemodialysis (six dialysis sessions per week for a total dialysis time of 45 h per week) at 8 weeks of gestation.

Her chief complaint was a slowly growing painless swelling involving the right side of the mandible that had started one year previously. Her past medical history revealed no previous surgeries or diseases. Her vital signs were recorded as 120/80 mmHg blood pressure, a pulse of 103 beats per minute (bpm), 15 respirations per minute, height - 5.1 ft, weight - 165 lb, and a calculated body mass index (BMI) of 23.71.

The patient was reported to have decompensated on account of nonadherence with his home medications resulting in frequent hospitalizations and poor functioning. As per the patient's admission records, the patient's initial labs and urine toxicology were within normal limits. The patient had been on various antipsychotics since his diagnosis with schizophrenia at the age of 19, including haloperidol, olanzapine, and risperidone, but he continued to decompensate despite adequate medication trials. The decision was made to start the patient on clozapine due to possible failure of these previous antipsychotics. Clozapine was started at 25 mg PO twice daily and titrated up to 150 mg PO twice daily over the next 12 days. His current daily dose was 300 mg when he was transferred to the telemetry unit following a sudden development of fever and tachycardia on the psychiatric inpatient floor.\nOn the medical inpatient unit, the patient was mostly selectively mute and did not appear to be in any pain, was not vomiting, and had no diarrhea and no reported loss of consciousness or seizures. His admission vitals were a temperature of 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit, BP of 115/81 mmHg, HR of 114 beats per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Physical examination did not reveal any significant findings other than a mild dehydration, no skin rash, no jugular venous distension, basal crepitation or pedal edema.

Vomiting episode started when she was 3 years of age. Vomiting had started suddenly and was associated with headache. She had 10\u201312 times of vomiting on that day, and it continued for 2 days. Vomiting stopped by itself after 2 days without any medication. Then, the child started to have similar episodes of vomiting repeatedly in the next 3 years. The symptom-free interval between two episodes of vomiting ranges from 1 day to 1 month. During symptom-free interval, the child was normal without any physical complaint and was regular in her daily activities. No particular precipitating stressor could be found for triggering the vomiting episode. Each vomiting episode was severe, and it led to impairment in normal functioning. It usually contained food substances or bile and rarely blood strained.\nShe had occasional anger outburst at times at home which was not related to any specific trigger or situation. At the time of anger outburst, she used to hit her grandmother and break the things she has at hand. She used to have this behavior for few minutes, and then, she becomes calm by herself. After that, she used to apologize for her behavior.\nBorn of nonconsanguineous marriage, she is the only child and with normal developmental milestones, studying first standard in a regular school with very poor academic performance. Even though self-care is present in the child, supervision is needed at times. She is able to interact and play with her friend at school and home well.\nThe child had significant psychosocial stressors \u2013 father expired when the child was 6 months of age due to blood cancer.

The results of the physical examination revealed abdominal distension and visible intestinal peristaltic waves; however, there was no whole abdominal or rebound tenderness. Orthostatic images of the abdomen showed an incomplete intestinal obstruction, while the results of an oral colonoscopy revealed a narrow lower end of the jejunum, no ulceration and a new neoplasm, which was considered to be narrow small intestine (possibly the lower end of the jejunum). The narrow section was surgically biopsied (2011\u20136099) and judged to be a chronic mucosal inflammation of the lower end of the jejunum. Laparotomy revealed a hardening and narrowing of the small bowel at the junction of the jejunum and ileum, with significant expansion proximal to the jejunum and a large volume of intestinal contents. Numerous lymph nodes were observed on the mesentery, and the intestinal canal had significant hyperemia and edema. There was a section of diseased small intestine ~1.5 m to the ileocecal valve, and the lumen was hardened and narrow. The two mucous membranes of the small intestine exhibited pathological changes and were smooth and complete. The lesions did not penetrate the mucous layer.

He had previously been diagnosed with multiple hepatic abscesses visualized on abdominal CT and was admitted to an outside hospital for antibiotic therapy. There, he underwent repeated image-guided catheter placements in order to obtain source control. Fluid cultures repeatedly grew Actinomyces for which he was discharged home on an appropriate course of antibiotics.\nSeveral weeks later, he presented to our hospital\u2019s emergency department. Repeat abdominal CT with IV contrast demonstrated pyogenic abscess recurrence as well as a thin, radio-opaque object traversing through the posterior gastric wall into a branch of the left portal vein (). Review of his prior imaging study revealed that this opacity was present then, too, but was not identified in its final interpretation. The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent EGD which revealed a pinpoint prepyloric fistula tract with purulent discharge corresponding to the location of the foreign body on CT imaging ().\nAfter careful review of his imaging and thorough discussion with the patient and his family about the potential risks and benefits, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, cholecystectomy, porta hepatis exploration, retrieval of the foreign body, and ligation of porto-enteric fistula tract. An upper midline incision and initial exploration of the retrogastric space was attempted via the gastrohepatic ligament. During our dissection, thick fibrotic tissue was noted as we approached the distal lesser curve. Given the apparent sequelae of chronic abscesses near the gallbladder and chronic inflammation as we neared the fistula tract, we elected to perform a cholecystectomy and gain access the lesser sac via the foramen of Winslow.

On admission in our institute, the child was in acute distress. On chest auscultation, breath sounds on the left side were absent. There was no adenopathy or testicular mass.

Abdominal sonogram was initially performed, revealing the presence of a left upper pole cystic lesion in a hydronephrotic kidney and dilatation of the ipsilateral ureter. Subsequent CT examination, including both plain and contrast-enhanced images confirmed the presence of a cystic mass at upper pole of the left kidney, accompanied by thinning and enhancement of the renal parenchyma. The dimensions of the lesion were 40 \u00d7 25 mm. No renal calcifications were noted. Left ureteral dilatation was also seen, with thickening and enhancement of the ureteral wall (). Based on the CT findings, differential diagnosis included chronic pyelonephritis, papillary necrosis, medullary sponge kidney, renal cell carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma and renal tuberculosis were considered. We then performed MRI for further examination, which depicted the thinned parenchymal left kidney lesion, of low intensity on both T1 and T2-weighted images, when compared to the normal renal parenchyma, heterogeneously enhancing after gadolinium administration. In addition, there was a nodule in the parenchyma that was not enhanced by gadolinium administration with iso intensity on T1-weighted images and low intensity on T2-weighted images (). MR imaging findings indicated inflammation and fibrosis with a granuloma formation, therefore strongly suggesting renal tuberculosis. Based on our findings, further examinations were scheduled in focusing on urinary tract tuberculosis. Subsequent cystoscopy showed reddish and edematous mucosa around left ureteral orifice and biopsied specimen revealed a granuloma. Urine culture and urine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were positive for mycobacterium tuberculosis. Her tuberculin skin test was positive, showing 48 \u00d7 62 mm rubor with induration, whereas her chest radiograph showed no nodular lesion or cavity. Under the diagnosis of urinary tract tuberculosis, she received antitubercular medications with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for 9 months. Because of persistent pyuria and left kidney dysfunction, left nephroureterectomy was subsequently performed, although urine culture and PCR had become negative for mycobacterium tuberculosis.
