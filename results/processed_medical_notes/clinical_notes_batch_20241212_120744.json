Primary antiphospholipid syndrome was diagnosed 2 years prior to renal transplantation when he developed recurrent episodes of thrombosis of the arteriovenous fistula and neck veins, for which he was started on warfarin. Anticoagulation was optimized prior to surgery by withholding warfarin 5 days before surgery while bridging with heparin. During the early postoperative period (first postoperative week), he developed a peri-renal hematoma (ultrasonography 13 cm \u00d7 7 cm). Noncontrast computed tomography scan detected a homogenous fluid collection posterior to the transplanted kidney which extended superiorly up to the right subhepatic area and inferiorly into the pelvis, displacing the bladder to the left (Figure ). Anticoagulation was then withheld and he recovered over the next few days with normalization of serum creatinine and urine output. Prior to discharge, his urethral catheter and ureteric stent were removed and warfarin was restarted.\nThree weeks after the surgery, he presented with reduced urine output and progressive abdominal distension associated with pain and fever. Ultrasound scan revealed a large perigraft collection. Resuscitation and urgent exploration revealed a viable graft with a large urinoma posterior to the kidney. A possible anastomotic leak was suspected and a passive external drain was placed to allow adequate drainage of urine and healing of the anastomotic site. However, the conservative approach failed and there was no reduction in the drain output.

    "original_text": "A 50-year-old man driving a motorcycle at 100 kph crashed at a curve on a racing course. He was transported to our hospital by a physician-staffed helicopter. His only remarkable history was a duodenal ulcer. On arrival, he had a clear consciousness, a blood pressure of 140/88 mmHg, a heart rate of 103 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 20/minute, a percutaneous saturation of 95% under room air, and an axillary temperature of 37.5\u00b0C. His chief complaint was general pain. The only physiological finding was a labile injury without any motor weakness at his extremities. He also did not demonstrate either hematoma or bruising in his neck. An ultrasound, roentgen of the chest and pelvis, and an electrocardiogram were all negative. Whole-body computed tomography (CT) only showed fluid collection at the left maxillary sinus. After suturing his labile wound, he waited on the results of a blood examination in the ER with monitoring. As he had complained of forehead pain and nausea, he received a drip infusion of acetaminophen. After 10 minutes, however, monitoring triggered an alarm due to a reduction in the percutaneous oxygen saturation. When a nurse checked him, he lost consciousness and entered respiratory arrest, showing left conjugated deviation and a palpable radial artery. He immediately underwent bag valve ventilation and indwelling tracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation after physicians arrived.\nA second head CT scan did not reveal any new traumatic lesions.

    "original_text": "A 52-year-old male presented with bilateral hip osteoarthritis secondary to cam type femoroacetabular impingement, particularly affecting the right hip joint. He described symptoms spanning a period of a number of years, slowly progressive in nature with typical features associated with osteoarthritic degeneration. The patient was otherwise well and besides intermittent analgesics and glucosamine was taking no other medications. No other joint pathologies were noted with the exception of previous subacromial bursitis of the right shoulder, successfully treated by arthroscopic decompression.\nPrevious management for his right hip had included central compartment arthroscopic debridement seven months previously. In an attempt to optimise his joint preservation therapies, the patient had also undertaken injectable therapies.

She held a demanding job that involved preparing analytical reports and traveling widely, but found herself no longer able to analyze data or prepare the reports, and therefore was forced to consider quitting her job. She noted that when she would read, by the time she reached the bottom of a page she would have to start at the top once again, since she was unable to remember the material she had just read. She was no longer able to remember numbers, and had to write down even 4-digit numbers to remember them. She also began to have trouble navigating on the road: even on familiar roads, she would become lost trying to figure out where to enter or exit the road.

The condition was severe enough for the patient to undergo a mitral valve replacement.\nAt the start of the procedure, an aortic and bicaval venous cannulation was carried out and tapes were passed around the cannulae. The aorta was cross-clamped with a soft padded clamp. Cold blood cardioplegia was given to arrest the heart. Within 10 minutes after cross-clamping, central venous pressure rose from 5 mmHg to 30 mmHg which coincided with the application of the tapes to the SVC syndrome. Cerebral oximetry values decreased significantly from pre-pump values of 67% in the left and 61% in the right to 44% in the left and 45% in the right shortly after the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine. The perfusionist was alerted to these changes. There were no issues with the functionality of the CPB machine. The patient was noted to have spontaneous bleeding from the left ear.

On examination, his general physical examination was normal. Local examination revealed swelling of left zygoma with discharging sinus just below the left eyelid at the outer canthus of the left eye, with sprouting granulation tissue with thick pus and inflamed and tender surrounding area with mild ectropion (). On intraoral examination, there was oroantral fistula at the area of second molar on left side. Nose, throat, and neck examination was normal. Provisional diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis of maxilla and zygoma with oroantral fistula on left side was done. Dental opinion was taken. Dental caries and periodontitis in relation to upper left canine, 2nd premolar, and molar were involved. Extraction of the above teeth was done under local anaesthesia.

Previous vaccinations had been well tolerated without remarkable skin or systemic reactions. Following the resolution of initial local and systemic symptoms after vaccination, the delayed reaction had an onset on day 10 that appeared near the injection site.

Enhanced computed tomography (CT) detected a hypovascular mass (18 mm diameter) in the pancreatic head (Figures and ). The main pancreatic duct of the distal pancreatic parenchyma was substantially dilated (Figures and ). Endoscopic retrograde and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatographies showed severe stenosis of the main pancreatic duct due to the pancreatic tumor, but biliary obstruction was not observed. The diagnosis of carcinoma of the head of the pancreas was made based on the histopathologic examination of an endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Dynamic CT clearly demonstrated that the carcinoma of the head of the pancreas had invaded the superior mesenteric vein, portal venous trunk, and splenic vein (). The inferior mesenteric vein flowed into the superior mesenteric vein rather than the splenic vein (), suggesting that the inferior mesenteric vein was not a viable splenic venous drainage route. There were no findings indicating cancer at an unresectable site or distant metastases. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not employed, and a subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy with lymphadenectomy was performed. Histopathological assessments revealed that a moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma had invaded the venous wall of the confluence of the superior mesenteric vein, portal venous trunk, and splenic vein. Pancreatic cancer measuring 1 to 2 cm is categorized as T1c, and the cancer categorized as T1cN0M0 stage IA in accordance with the tumor-node-metastasis classification [], although pancreatic cancer growing outside the pancreas and into nearby major blood vessels is categorized as T4 and stage III according to staging system of American Cancer Society [].\nAs imaging examinations revealed that the tumor involved the confluence of the superior mesenteric vein, portal venous trunk, and splenic vein (Figures and ), en bloc resection of the confluence of these veins was performed, with simultaneous venous reconstructions ().

In her medical history there was no record of use of an IUD, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal surgery, intrauterine device, or previous ectopic pregnancy. Laboratory evaluation showed quantitative hCG of 3129.94 IU/L and hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL. TVS examination demonstrated no evidence of intrauterine pregnancy, a normal bilateral adnexa and a large amount of free fluid in the abdomen. Considering the above factors, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed. A 90-mm-long mixed hypodense mass was evident on the upper surface of the right liver lobe. She was diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy implanted in the liver and advised to transfer the patient to tertiary referral center. The patient traveled to our hospital and presented to the emergency room with increasing abdominal pain and weakness. On examination, her pulse was 109beats/minute and blood pressure was 90/50 mmHg. Diagnostic abdominocentesis was performed and found blood uncoagulable. Given the concern for ruptured abdominal pregnancy and hemorrhagic shock, she was taken laparoscopic surgery immediately.

Her pain began suddenly while walking to her bathroom. She specifically denied any trauma at the time pain began or in the preceding 24 hours. Subsequently, she developed weakness in the right arm and leg that was associated with progressing paresthesias in the right leg. Hence, her husband brought her to the emergency department at our institution for evaluation, which was approximately 2 hours after initial onset of symptoms. A CT of the cervical spine without contrast was obtained and demonstrated an acute hematoma in the spinal canal (Figure , ). Our service was consulted at that time for further evaluation and she was given prothrombin complex concentrate for apixaban reversal. An MRI of the cervicothoracic spine with and without contrast was obtained for further characterization after our initial exam, which demonstrated an epidural hematoma causing spinal cord compression and spanning from approximately the C2 level through the upper thoracic spine (Figure , ).

Reportedly, at 21 month of age, he had experienced a fall from the proper high, while riding his scooter that caused subluxation of the primary right and left maxillary central incisors, and partial intrusive luxation of the primary maxillary right lateral incisor.\nClinical and radiographic examination revealed crown discoloration of both primary maxillary right and left central incisors and the maintenance of the intrusion of the primary maxillary right lateral incisor. Also, mobility of the primary maxillary right central incisor and pulp necrosis of the primary maxillary left central incisor was detected. Endodontic treatment was performed in the primary maxillary left central incisor. Extraction of the primary maxillary right lateral incisor was performed, because of the lack of re-eruption. The patient was oriented to regular follow-up every 6 months.\nBy the time the patient had eight years and 5 months of age, developmental disturbances like hypoplasia and crown dilaceration of the permanent maxillary right central incisor were confirmed, as previously observed radiographically (Fig. ). For aesthetic reasons, restorative treatment was performed with resin composite for both labial and palatal surfaces. After 2 years, in another follow-up assessment, the absence of eruption of the permanent maxillary right lateral incisor was diagnosed and cone bean computed tomography was requested.

The patient had a significantly reduced heart function (ejection fraction of 13%, ), severe mitral regurgitation after myocardial infarction, and ESRD on regular dialysis due to diabetic nephropathy. His walking ability was completely preserved, and he has been working. The ankle brachial index (ABI) showed no wave (unmeasurable) in both legs, and his skin perfusion pressure (SPP) was <30 mmHg in the dorsum and plantar surfaces of both feet. He had already undergone patch plasty of the left common femoral artery (CFA) using the ipsilateral great saphenous vein (GSV) at a previous hospital. Computed tomography angiography and intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography demonstrated that both superficial femoral and popliteal arteries were occluded with severe calcifications. The infrapopliteal arteries were also severely calcified, indicating difficulty of revascularization by EVT, and surgical revascularization was preferable (). Bilateral GSV was available for distal bypass surgery (GSV diameter >3.0 mm), but not small saphenous veins owing to their small diameter (<2.0 mm). Ultrasound-guided PNB was applied for the following bypass surgeries to prevent perioperative complications possibly caused by GA. In the first operation in our hospital, the right CFA to peroneal artery bypass grafting was placed in an in situ manner under PNB. In the second operation, the left CFA in below-the-knee popliteal artery bypass grafting was performed 1 month after the first revascularization for contralateral limb. Part of left GSV was poorly dilated, resulting in the use of spliced vein graft. The left graft had been functional for 5 months after the surgery; however, the patient presented with graft occlusion during his regular visits at our institution.

His terminal serum creatinine level was 0.8 mg/dL and his Kidney Donor Profile Index score was 27%. The first recipient was a 45-year-old man with a 20-year history of hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to hypertensive nephropathy, who had received regular hemodialysis for 2 years. In June 2005, at another hospital, single renal transplantation was performed in the right iliac fossa, with a cold ischemia time of 5 h 10 min and a warm ischemia time of 1 h 48 min. After reperfusion, the recipient immediately passed urine. He was administered an immunosuppressive regimen comprising methylprednisolone, cyclosporine, everolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil, and he was discharged 10 days after the transplantation with a serum creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. At regular follow-up over the next 6 months, his serum creatinine levels remained within the normal range.\nOver the following 9 years, the recipient showed no episodes of rejection, and his serum creatinine levels and creatinine clearance rates were within the normal ranges (Fig. ).

These findings strongly suggested a benign cyst in the anal canal; therefore, the patient underwent trans-sacral resection for precise diagnosis of the tumor. The pathological diagnosis of the resected tumor was a mucinous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia (Fig. ) with negative surgical margins. The patient was observed in ambulatory practice. Follow-up CT and MRI 14 months after surgery showed a new cystic lesion near the site of the removed tumor (Fig. ). To evaluate whether the new cystic tumor was a recurrence, the patient underwent trans-sacral resection of the cystic tumor again. Pathological examination of the second resected tumor revealed that the tumor was a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the lower rectum (Fig. ) with a possible remnant tumor at the local site. After providing sufficient informed consent, the patient underwent anal sphincter-preserving intersphincteric resection (ISR) with partial resection of the external sphincter along with prophylactic lymph node dissection. Pathological examination showed that the tumor cells were located at the anal gland under the mucosa of the anal canal and that these cells produced mucin and fibrosis (Fig. ).

After realizing decreased flow in her left renal artery by Doppler ultrasonog-raphy, she received the angiography procedure. The final report of the procedure was that band-like narrowing in the left renal artery gives rise to thought fibromuscular dysplasia with no pathologic finding in vertebral arteries. Two months after establishing the diagnosis of FMD (which was four years ago), she received balloon angioplasty and started captopril to control her systemic blood pressure.\nOcular examination revealed afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/400 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. The examination of anterior segment and ocular pressure were bilaterally within normal limits. Because of the cherry-red spot sign in the macula of the right eye, the patient immediately underwent stereoscopic color fundus photography and fluorescein fundus angiography. Fundus examination revealed that the left eye was normal () but that the right eye contained ischemic whitening with a cherry-red spot area (). Fluorescein fundus angiography demonstrated abnormal retinal arterial and choroidal dye filling in the early phase in the right eye. CRAO was diagnosed from the characteristic appearance ( and ).\nThere were no systemic risk factors such as diabetes mel-litus, hyperlipidemia, or smoking. Hematologic evaluation was also performed and all coagulation parameters were within normal limits.

He was seen by a general practitioner and a topical steroid was prescribed. A few days later, the pain was so intense that herpes zoster was suspected. Gradually, the skin lesions spread all over the abdomen extending to both flanks; the abdominal pain increased to the extent that the patient required opiate analgesia. Exertional dyspnea, of functional class II, developed 2 months prior to admission. Pleural effusion was detected and attributed to heart failure and the patient received diuretics.\nThe patient had a past medical history of urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma diagnosed 3 years previously. This was a poorly differentiated (grade II\u2013III) carcinoma, with invasion of submucosa and no involvement of muscle coat that was treated with transurethral resection of the tumor followed by intravesical BCG therapy. The patient received frequent cystoscopy follow-up, with the last performed 10 months prior to admission, all demonstrating no evidence of recurrent tumor.\nPhysical examination at the time of admission revealed extensive involvement of the abdominal skin with highly tender erythematous and infiltrated plaques. The lesions were mainly located around umbilicus radiating bilaterally toward the flanks, imitating bilateral zosteriform eruptions, and upwards to the epigastrium and lower anterior chest. On the flanks, skin lesions were erythematous plaques with papulonodular components (Fig. ). Chest examination showed reduced sounds at the base of right lung. Abdominal examination was limited due to significant pain experienced by the patient with superficial palpation.

As stated, the patient had climbed a tree to collect woods and while he was chopping a branch of the tree, he suddenly fell from the tree over a wooden [bamboo] fence below and a twig had got broken and entered into his right eye. There was no history of unconsciousness following the injury. No history of any other illness or injury was present except he was diabetic and hypertensive. He had come to our hospital about 13 h after the injury had occurred. On examination, the patient was fully conscious and well oriented. A wooden [bamboo] FB was seen projecting from right palpebral aperture and firmly impacted in an upward direction towards the upper part of the orbit []. Sight was conserved in right eye. There was no apparent distortion or injury in right globe with clear cornea, well-formed anterior chamber, normal iris details, and pupillary reaction. Left eye was within normal limit. Upon movement, dribbling of clear fluid from the projected end of the FB had raised suspicion of intracranial extension. The patient was admitted, given prophylactic Tetanus Toxoid injection, and started on prophylactic broad spectrum intravenous antibiotic Cefotaxime and intramuscular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication Diclofenac. An urgent computed tomography (CT) scan of brain and orbit was advised, which revealed a linear FB piercing the superior aspect of right orbit through superior muscle complex and right frontal sinus and into right frontal lobe of brain by fracturing roof of right orbit.

This pain, evolving for the past one year, was not related to any particular position, oral feeding, or bowel movements. There was no history of weight loss or any gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea-vomiting, diarrhea-constipation, or signs of gastrointestinal bleeding. He denied any abdominal trauma or past surgical operations.\nOn physical examination, a well-defined subcutaneous mass was palpable in the right iliac fossa. The mass was firm, non-tender, and not fixed to the skin or the muscular plane of the abdominal wall. It was sensitive to both light touch and deep pressure. No peritoneal signs or overlying skin changes were found. All routine laboratory tests including blood cell count, CRP (C-reactive protein), serum electrolytes, and hemostasis tests were completely unremarkable. Tumor markers including carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen (CA 19-9) were within the normal ranges.\nAn abdominal ultrasound examination was performed, which showed a solid and heterogeneous mass developed in the right abdominal wall. A basal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 7\u00d75 cm well-circumscribed tissue-mass located in the subcutaneous plane of the right iliac fossa (). After intravenous administration of contrast media, the lesion showed a modest and homogeneous enhancement with a few scattered liquid chambers (). No lesions in the peritoneal cavity or parietal defects were identified.\nSurgical resection of the mass was proposed and the patient was then operated under general anesthesia. The mass was easily enucleated after a direct anterior approach by a selective incision in the right iliac fossa ().\nIt was exclusively involving the subcutaneous plane without any connection to the musculofascial layer or the parietal peritoneum of the abdominal wall.

His medical history revealed that the trauma was in the form of falling on the outstretched hand with the forearm in pronation. He had an operation in an external center almost three months ago and the pain and limitation of movement started due to falling on the wrist one week ago. Physical examination was significant for tenderness on the dorsoradial aspect of the scaphoid of the left wrist. His active range of motion was 30o extension, 40o flexion, 20o radial deviation, and 30o ulnar deviation. Plain X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images at the time of evaluation showed an unhealed proximal pole fracture and a broken headless screw (Figure 1). Also, it was suspected that there might be an ulnar translation of the carpus following the last trauma. Although there was no physical examination finding suggestive of wrist instability, previous radiographs of the patient were requested. Relevant information was obtained based on the previous radiological images, which were performed in another center prior to primary surgery (Figure 2). Accordingly, the carpus gradually moved to the ulna along the fracture line with the first trauma and in follow-up images. The patient was followed with a short scaphoid cast for the first eight weeks and, when the fracture was displaced, surgery was decided. The surgery was performed dorsally with the headless screw, the plaster application was continued for an additional one month. The headless screw inside the scaphoid bone, which did not heal, was broken due to a newly added trauma three months after the operation.

    "cleaned_text": "a 22-year-old otherwise healthy, right-hand dominant machine male technician was referred to our center one week after injuring his left wrist. his medical history revealed that the trauma was in the form of falling on the outstretched hand with the forearm in pronation. he had an operation in an external center almost three months ago and the pain and limitation of movement started due to falling on the wrist one week ago. physical examination was significant for tenderness on the dorsoradial aspect of the scaphoid of the left wrist. his active range of motion was 30o extension, 40o flexion, 20o radial deviation, and 30o ulnar deviation. plain x-ray and computed tomography (ct) images at the time of evaluation showed an unhealed proximal pole fracture and a broken headless screw (figure 1). also, it was suspected that there might be an ulnar translation of the carpus following the last trauma. although there was no physical examination finding suggestive of wrist instability, previous radiographs of the patient were requested. relevant information was obtained based on the previous radiological images, which were performed in another center prior to primary surgery (figure 2). accordingly, the carpus gradually moved to the ulna along the fracture line with the first trauma and in follow-up images. the patient was followed with a short scaphoid cast for the first eight weeks and, when the fracture was displaced, surgery was decided. the surgery was performed dorsally with the headless screw, the plaster application was continued for an additional one month. the headless screw inside the scaphoid bone, which did not heal, was broken due to a newly added trauma three months after the operation. therefore, the patient was referred to our hospital.\nthe patient was placed in a removable long opponens splint and revision surgery was planned, after the informed consent form was obtained from the patient. surgery was performed by two certified orthopedic hand surgeons and follow-",

She complained of a two-week history of progressively worsening orthopnea and shortness of breath that left her unable to perform daily activities. An initial transthoracic echocardiogram obtained at the referring hospital had demonstrated a depressed ejection fraction (35%) as well as mild pulmonary hypertension. The patient was transferred to our institution for further evaluation and management.\nHer past medical history was significant for chronic hypertension, class F diabetes mellitus, super morbid obesity with a BMI of 53, and chronic kidney disease. Two years before, she underwent an emergent cesarean delivery at 35 weeks gestation due to preeclampsia with severe features and nonreassuring fetal status. The patient had no previous history of congenital, ischemic, or valvular heart disease. She had no family history of heart disease and never had an echocardiogram before. On admission she required 2 L/min of oxygen per nasal cannula to maintain an oxygen saturation of 95%. The remaining vital signs were within normal limits. Notable findings on the physical exam were presence of S3 and S4 heart sounds, positive jugular venous distention, bilateral crackles on auscultation, and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities. A baseline electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm. Chest x-ray demonstrated pulmonary interstitial edema and bilateral pleural effusions. A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated a moderately dilated left ventricle, eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and a severely reduced left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 20-25% as well as global left ventricular hypokinesis. Mitral inflow pattern and tissue doppler were indicative of grade 3 diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular function was mildly to moderately reduced. The right ventricular systolic pressure was elevated at 50-60 mmHg and there was a moderate degree of pulmonary hypertension. Complete metabolic profile was significant for hyponatremia of 132 mmol/L, hyperkalemia of 5.6 mmol/L, elevated blood urea nitrogen of 35 mg/dL",
