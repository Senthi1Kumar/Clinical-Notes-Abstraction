Histopathologic examination revealed a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Chest and abdominal computed tomography scan confirmed the presence of the esophageal lesion with enlarged mediastinal nodes and no evidence of distant metastases. The patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, and 46 Gy radiotherapy. The re-staging after neoadjuvant treatment showed a partial response. The patient underwent a Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy with 2-field lymphadenectomy via laparoscopy and right thoracotomy. As usual, the thoracic duct was ligated en bloc with the azyos vein above the diaphragm. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen showed yT2-N1 disease and no evidence of margin infiltration.\nA high-volume serous fluid output (1100-1700 ml/day) from the right chest drain was noted since postoperative day 1. On postoperatively day 3 a left pleural effusion was detected on the chest x-ray and about 2 liters of serous fluid were drained. Biochemical analysis of triglyceride contents from both drains confirmed the diagnosis of chylothorax.

Her medical history included high myopia for more than 50 years, but she had never had diabetes, hypertension, or other systemic illness. On admission, her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg, her visual acuity was light perception, and her intraocular pressure (IOP) was 5 mmHg in the left eye. An ocular examination performed on the left eye showed a flare and was positive for cells in the anterior chamber. A fundus examination and B-ultrasound revealed retinal detachment with choroidal detachment (A, B).\nAll hematological and biochemical tests were within normal limits. After surgical contraindications were excluded, we performed a combined phacoemulsification without intraocular lens implantation and vitrectomy in combination with silicone oil injection. The choroidal detachment (C, star) was clearly visible before phacoemulsification was performed. After phacoemulsification, 20G and 23G vitrectomy cannulas were placed 3.5 mm from the limbus. The 20G cannula was left open, and the infusion line was placed in the anterior chamber through a clear corneal paracentesis with a bottle height of 40 mmHg. As soon as the infusion line was opened, a copious, thick flux of blood flowed out of the 20G cannulas and was followed a yellowish liquid (D). As the blood flow continued, the choroidal detachment visibly recessed.

Random blood glucose test results, ultrasound imaging and magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) confirmed this diagnosis. The man was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in a rural community hospital four years previously. Four months ago, he developed a 1 cm \u00d7 2 cm ulcer on the lateral side of his right lower leg with a small amount of fluid exudate.\nAt the time of admission, the patient was in an acceptable condition, with a temperature of 38\u00b0C, a pulse of 88 beats / min, a respiration rate of 22 breaths / min, a blood pressure of 130 / 70 mmHg, a height of 1.75 m, a body weight of 60 kg, and a BMI of 19.5 kg / m2. Abdominal shifting dullness was positive, both lower extremities were swollen, and multiple fractures were visible on the wound surface on the medial and lateral sides of the right calf and right ankle. The dorsal right foot ulcer was visible and measured approximately 7 \u00d7 8 cm. All ulcers had a significant amount of yellow liquid exudate and odor (Fig. ).

She then underwent an exploratory laparotomy with a bilateral anexectomia.

Chest radiography followed by computerised tomography (CT) showed a stage II left perihilar lung tumour, which was confirmed as NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology by fine needle biopsy. The patient was otherwise well, but had a past history of chronic endometriosis. Her non-smoking mother died of lung cancer at the age of 72, but there was no other family history of cancer. The primary lung tumour and hilar nodes were successfully removed by left pneumonectomy in January 2001. The patient declined adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation, because of concerns about toxicity.\nIn August 2005 the patient returned to her respiratory physician with weight loss, enlarged left neck lymph nodes, and upper left neck and thoracic pains not controlled by paracetamol and codeine. CT scan showed adenocarcinoma (confirmed on needle biopsy) in the left cervical nodes (> 2.5 cm), a 3.3 cm mass at the left pneumonectomy stump, a 1.2 cm right middle lobe lung lesion, and possible liver metastases up to 1.8 cm in size. Transdermal fentanyl patches were commenced for pain relief but the patient again declined cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation because of toxicity concerns. Erlotinib was, therefore, recommended as an alternative to chemotherapy.\nThe patient started oral erlotinib 150 mg/day in September 2005, and within weeks noticed softening of the left cervical nodes, and a decrease in pain, beyond that achieved with opiates. She developed the facial and anterior neck rash typical of EGFR inhibitors, with progression to a grade 3 reaction.

Biopsy of the cervical growth showed a nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma []. Her cystosigmoidoscopy was normal. Final diagnosis was carcinoma of the cervix, FIGO \u2013 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics \u2013 stage 2B. The patient received external beam radiotherapy 50 Gy/27 fractions followed by high dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy (3 sessions each of 7 Gy) from October 31, 2008, to January 23, 2009. The patient was cured on clinical and radiological evaluation and was on regular follow-up.\nFour months after the treatment, on follow-up evaluation the patient gave a history of lump in the left breast. On examination, a lump measuring 8 \u00d7 7 cm was palpable in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast with no evidence of skin or chest wall invasion. Mammographically, a high-density mass with ill-defined margins was noted in the upper outer quadrant; no calcification was noted. On ultrasonographic correlation, the mass was hypoechic with internal vascularity. Tru-Cut biopsy of the lump was done and histopathological examination showed features suggestive of an infiltrating ductal carcinoma with negative estrogen and progesterone receptors. Her primary site was clinically evaluated and was normal.

His past medical history was significant for a stage 1, pT1N0M0, noninvasive, high-grade papillary urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder three years prior, for which he had undergone transurethral resection of bladder tumor. He subsequently was treated with six cycles of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin immunotherapy. Repeat biopsy of the bladder had revealed no evidence of malignancy.

Another grey-white nodule with calcifications (0.3 cm in size) was described in the right lobe, consistent with papillary thyroid carcinoma, with neoplastic cells showing overlapping clear nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm (tall cell variant) (Figure ) (tumor categories were pT2, N+). The patient was discharged without complications and surgical treatment was followed by irradiation of the neck (46 GY of total dose). During follow up calcitonin levels were between 300 and 200 pg/ml. A new scintigraphy with 131I and MIBG was performed on September 1990: it demonstrated a residual neoplasm in the cervical area.

She then noted the stiffness spreading to involve her left lower limb making ambulation increasingly difficult. From about 2009, the muscles of her trunk and lower limbs would go into severe painful spasms in response to unexpected noise, startle or emotional upset. These spasms initially occurred about 1\u20132/month and lasted about 30\u201360 min but over time increased in both frequency and duration. These episodes were associated with drenching sweats and fear. She has had several falls and injuries due to sudden muscle spasms. She also reported generalised anxiety since the onset of the illness in 2002 and specific phobias to open spaces, walking unaided and being among a crowd of people. She had felt depressed at times which she attributed to the disabling nature of the illness which had curtailed her independence. In 2007, she was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, which required insulin to achieve normal glycaemic control. In 2014, she was found to be biochemically hypothyroid and commenced on thyroxine replacement.

Initial pharmacological treatment with Fluoxetine 20 mg (titered up within a few weeks) was combined with individual and family psychotherapy on an outpatient level. Due to lack of response the patient was switch to Fluvoxamine 150 mg after 2 months. Despite this intensified treatment regimen, panic attacks continued and his overall state deteriorated eventually leading to hospitalization to a youth inpatient ward. Treatment was changed to Venlafaxine initially with 75 mg/day in the morning. Almost immediately the patient experienced frequent suicide thoughts along with feelings of despair and hopelessness. The thoughts frightened him to the point of suffering frequent panic attacks. This deterioration was interpreted as a sign of treatment resistance and therefore, Venlafaxine was titered up to 300 mg/day. Subsequently, the patient made his first suicide attempt by drinking acid that was left by a careless hospital worker. No psychosocial factors or stressful life events were detected to have contributed to the suicide attempt.\nFollowing this event, Paroxetine was trialed up to 20 mg/d leading to almost full remission and only rare panic attacks during the following 4 weeks. At that point in time, when the patient was discharged home, his general functioning was normal. In the next 4 years the patient continued on Paroxetine 20 mg/d because when he tried lowering this dose according to his psychiatrist, he felt more anxious.

Chest computed tomography (CT) showed several cystic lesions with niveau formation and consolidation in left S10 (Fig. ), without communication with the bronchus. Three-dimensional CT revealed an abnormal artery branching from the descending aorta and a normal pulmonary vein (Fig. ); thus, our diagnosis was ILS. Laboratory findings were normal without evidence of inflammation.\nBecause of patient desire to preserve pulmonary function for future childbearing, we conducted a sublobar resection of left S10 including sequestration through a thoracoscopic minimally incision (one window, three ports). The window, which length was 4 cm, was placed on middle axillary line in the fifth intercostal spaces, and three ports, two were 5 mm and one was 12 mm in size, were on the anterior axillary line in the sixth intercostal spaces and the middle and posterior axillary line in the seventh intercostal spaces. An abnormal artery was found inside of the lung ligament branching from the descending aorta (Fig. , ). It was cut after double pierced ligature with silk blade. The boundary line was detected between S6 and basal segment by selective inflation from bronchus (B)6 and divided the parenchyma with stapler. The sequestration had a dark red appearance due to developed capillary vessel of visceral pleura (Fig. ) and was completely included in S10 (Fig. ).

    "original_text": "A 74-year-old male with past medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and benign prostatic hypertrophy presented to the emergency department with testicular swelling and pain for four days. Physical exam was notable for an abscess on the inner gluteal fold of the perineal region that was spontaneously draining serosanguinous output. His left hemi-scrotum appeared erythematous and indurated without overt signs of cellulitis. There was mild tenderness to palpation of the scrotal area although no crepitus was felt in the thighs or scrotum. He also endorsed blood-tinged drainage from the wound for several weeks. He was admitted for the management of his scrotal wound. He was evaluated by urology and general surgery who had low suspicion for Fournier\u2019s gangrene. Medical records demonstrated several urological procedures for ureterolithiasis and nephrolithiasis in the few months prior to this admission.

She became aware of a sense of discomfort in the dorsal region without cause 4 days before she visited our hospital. Backache aggravated suddenly, and she had vomiting and difficulty with body movement; she visited the Department of Surgery at our hospital and was admitted for examination and treatment. There were no abnormal findings on thoracoabdominal CT or endoscopy from a surgical perspective, and she was referred to our department.\nIn the initial examination, body temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, blood pressure 192/109 mmHg, and pulse 79/min. The consciousness level was Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (E4, V4, M6), showing mild disturbance of orientation. She complained severe backache without headache. On neurological examination, no hypesthesia or muscle weakness of the lower limbs was noted.

Two days after presentation, she underwent open reduction internal fixation of the right acetabulum fracture via a standard ilioinguinal approach (Figure ).

He had been seizure-free for the past year with an enteric-coated delayed release formulation of VPA (375 mg every 8 hours). Thirty days prior to hospital admission, he was started on LTG 25 mg/day along with VPA, since his seizures were no longer under control with VPA. Two weeks later, the dose was increased (50 mg/day). His morning trough plasma VPA level was measured before LTG was added to the therapy yielding a concentration of 85 mg/L. On admission, he presented macular lesions on the front of the thorax that extend to the back, followed by bilateral eyelid edema and ulcerated lesions at the level of lips, jugal mucosa, and pharynx. He developed erythematosus conjunctivitis with ulcers. He presented skin rash with high fever (39\u00b0C) and respiratory failure type I. History revealed that no such lesions occurred earlier and that was the first time such rashes have occurred. Other personal and family history was not relevant. From a dermatologic point of view and based on the history and clinical presentation, a diagnosis of SJS was made. Since the presumptive cause was LTG, the drug was discontinued immediately. Soon after the patient admission, periofocal and ocular involvement worsened. Intravenous immunoglobulin was administered for 48 hours. Mouth care (oral washes with sodium borate) and eye care (tobramycin ophthalmic drops) were also indicated.\nFrom a hemodynamic point of view, four hours after admission, his condition deteriorated and he developed septic shock with peripheral circulatory failure. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with intravenous fluids and antibacterial therapy due to skin infection by Staphylococcus aureus.

Two mandibular primary incisors had spontaneously exfoliated at 1Y8M. Thereafter, the patient had been diagnosed with childhood-type HPP at the age of 2Y2M due to a low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level (66 IU/I), as well as radiological examination findings of the lower extremities and hands, which revealed rickets, a metaphyseal irregularity. The obvious symptoms were localized in the dental region at diagnosis, though they later extended to other parts of the body such as bone pain. ERT was performed by subcutaneous injections of recombinant bone-targeted ALP at 2 mg/kg three times weekly and commenced at 11Y7M.\nWe previously reported dental findings of this patient at the age of 11Y5M, obtained before initiating ERT therapy []. Briefly, an intraoral examination demonstrated that all incisors and canines, as well as the first molar had emerged into the oral cavity, each of which showed enamel hypoplasia, while all first molars were located in a prominently lower position. Since the maxillary and mandibular molars did not contact when biting, traumatic occlusion was thought to have occurred in areas near the incisors. A periodontal examination revealed deep pockets and severe mobility in the maxillary right central incisor and mandibular left central incisor regions. In an orthopantomographic examination, all permanent teeth except for the mandibular left second premolar were identified, however, permanent tooth root formation was delayed, and the mandible and maxilla bones appeared to be thin.

Most laboratory test results revealed normal limits except for elevated white blood count (11,170/\u03bcL) and serum C-reactive protein level (1.6 mg/dL). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (Fig. ) revealed intussusception at the ileocecal region, which appeared as a \u201ctarget\u201d sign with a tumorous oval mass of 56 \u00d7 41 mm as a leading point of intussusception. An urgent operation was performed because of the risk of colonic ischemia due to intussusception. At laparotomy, the bowels had already spontaneously reduced, and a mass was palpable in the ileocecal region. We performed an ileocecal resection, aiming to avoid the potential of relapse of intussusception due to the residual mass. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on day 16 postoperatively.

The patient came back after 3 years because the symptoms of swallowing and dyspnea were progressively aggravated.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a smooth elevated lesion located 24 to 30 cm from the incisor teeth, and the mucosa was intact (Fig. B). Endoscopic ultrasonography guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA)-mediated histopathologic examination revealed a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells in a fasciculated and disarrayed architecture.

There was history of head trauma; about 2 months prior, he had hit his head on the bathroom sink, but did not lose consciousness. MRI demonstrated acute infarction in the right basal ganglia involving the caudate and lentiform nucleus and extending to the corona radiata, and MRA was normal. He had a left hemiparesis with distal flaccidity in the left upper and lower extremities, but some preserved shoulder abduction and hip flexion. His past medical history was unremarkable. His family history was negative for early stroke and clotting disorders, but positive for anxiety and depression in several family members. Transthoracic echo with bubble study, prothrombotic workup, and infectious workup were all unremarkable. He was treated with aspirin 162 mg daily and heparin, which was transitioned to enoxaparin for about 2 weeks. He was referred to our hospital for rehabilitation 3 weeks post stroke. Both psychiatry and neuropsychology were consulted during rehabilitation, but no major problems with depression or anxiety were noted, though he did have some mood swings.

On examination, she was found to be febrile, tachypnic and hypoxic. On respiratory examination, intensity of breath sound was diminished in right lung field. Along with it, coarse crepitations were heard on the same area. From the history and examination, it was found that she might have had pneumonia involving right lung. This was confirmed by chest X-ray [] and white blood cell count. She was admitted in intensive care and put on oxygen therapy with higher antibiotics. During the course of treatment for approximately 2 weeks, she improved clinically but the radiological resolution was lacking []. It raised the possibility of collapse or postobstructive pneumonia, and computerized tomography (CT) of the chest was performed along with virtual bronchoscopy. From the CT and virtual scopy, it was found that she had right lower lobe obstructive pneumonia [] that might be due to mucous plugging, endobronchial granuloma, or growth []. Finally, flexible bronchoscopy was performed. Bronchoscope had an outer diameter of 6 mm with an inner diameter of instrument channel was 2.8 mm. During bronchoscopy black colored soft foreign body [] with surrounding granulation tissue was observed in right lower lobe bronchus.

He subsequently developed rapid progression of disease with unresectable multiple satellite and in transit lesions, palpable left cervical lymph nodes, and left axillary lymphadenopathy (). His tumor was noted to be BRAF wild-type. His ECOG performance status was 1. Treatment with ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg was started in November 2012, administered immediately after hemodialysis.

At the time of admission, no pathogen was identified from the pus of the liver abscess or the blood culture. CT demonstrated that the low-density, 15-cm mass in the right liver lobe was partially replaced by necrotic solid tissue. There was an emergence of new fluid lesions in the mediastinum and right thoracic cavity (Fig. ). After admission to our hospital, additional percutaneous drainage of both fluid lesions was performed. E. histolytica was detected from the drained discharge of the mediastinal cavity. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with amebic liver abscess. We administered MNZ (1500 mg) orally for 10 days, but his physical condition did not improve. The patient presented with a sustained fever of 38.9 \u00b0C, blood pressure of 117/79 mmHg, heart rate of 117 beats per minutes, respiratory rate of 32 per minutes, and a disturbed consciousness (Glasgow coma scale, 13). The patient had abdominal distention and complained of widespread abdominal pain. Additionally, his laboratory blood tests revealed a high inflammatory reaction and a tendency towards disseminated intravascular coagulation (Table ). CT showed no change in the size of the liver abscess (15 cm). The mediastinal abscess was already well drained. No additional drainage was performed during surgery",

He presented 1-day previously and was found to have a cystic mass in the anterior mediastinum that measured 11 \u00d7 8 cm with pericardial effusion on chest computed tomography (CT) scan but he was hemodynamically stable with no evidence of cardiac tamponade at that time. His symptoms were aggravated until he was transferred to our hospital. His heart rate was 114 beats per minute (bpm) with blood pressure of 130/70 mmHg. His respiratory rate was 23 breaths per minute and he complained of aggravated dyspnea. The jugular vein was not engorged and lung sound was decreased. Laboratory studies were all within normal limits. Chest X-ray showed large amount of pericardial effusion with bilateral pleural effusion. Chest CT revealed a markedly increased pericardial effusion (). This finding could suggest cardiac tamponade due to rupture of cystic mass in the anterior mediastinum. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed cardiac tamponade with large pericardial effusion and dilated inferior vena cava. The emergent pericardiocentesis was done and ~800 cc of dark brown colored pericardial effusion was drained. Analysis of the fluid revealed a pH of 7.50, a WBC count of 1360/mm3 (predominantly neutrophils), a protein level of 3.8 g/dl, an LDH level of 983 U/L and a glucose level of 87 mg/dl. The fluid was negative for bacterial culture, acid-fast bacilli smear, culture and tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction. The cytology of the fluid was negative for malignancy. The patient subsequently underwent anterior mediastinal mass excision via median sternotomy. Intraoperatively, the cystic mass has a severe adhesion with the pericardium and mediastinal pleura. The pericardium was remarkably thickened and the mass was filled with large amount of yellowish materials and hair components. A small hole was found on the pericardium adjacent to the tumor, indicating a rupture of the mass into the pericardial space. En bloc resection",
