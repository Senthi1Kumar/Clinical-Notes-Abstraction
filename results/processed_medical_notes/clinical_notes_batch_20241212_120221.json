A mass in the right nasal cavity was resected under local anesthesia without suspicion of malignancy and histopathologic diagnosis of immature teratoma with a predominant neuroblastomatous component was made. Magnetic resonance imaging after resection showed neither remnant nor metastatic lesions. In May 1998, a gray- to black-colored mass with a foul odor regrew in her right nasal cavity. The recurrent tumor was excised and again showed immature teratoma with a neuroblastomatous component (). Adjuvant radiation therapy to the nasal cavity was administered (60 Gy over 6 weeks, at a daily dose of 2 Gy) and there was no evidence of recurrence until May 1999.\nIn October 1999, she presented with a cough, and subsequent chest computed topography (CT) scans showed two pulmonary masses in the right upper lobe with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Bronchoscopy revealed a beefy mass obstructing the right upper lobar bronchus, and the biopsy specimen showed malignant tumor cells characterized as compact sheets of small round cells, hyperchromatic nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli associated with squeezing artifacts, and a scant amount of cytoplasm; there were no other mature epithelial components or adipose tissue (). All the systemic staging work-ups were negative. These findings led us to the conclusion that the lung mass was a new primary small cell carcinoma of the lung.

The patient was in good general condition, but significant morbidity was noted: chronic renal failure (creatinine value 1.4 mg/dl), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and a recent asymptomatic myocardial infarction. The liver function was normal. At the computed tomography (CT) scan, a 4.3 \u00d7 3 cm neoplastic lesion was found in segments IV and V. There was no macroscopic involvement of portal tree and hepatic artery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the main lesion with a cystic or necrotic central portion and a peripheral enhancement with late pooling; a little satellite nodule was also discovered. Imaging was suggestive either for a peripheral intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or for a liver metastasis from an occult cancer, probably arising from the gastroenteric tract. Tumor markers seemed to support this last hypothesis: CEA, 30 ng/mL; Ca, 19-9 > 12,000 U/mL; and alpha phetoprotein 3 UI/mL, strongly suggestive for a cancer arising from a secretory epithelium.

According to report of the operating room, the repair was done through a midaxial incision and the digit k-wired in extension. There were no particular vascular trauma or intraoperative complications documented in the report. The patient suffered from a temporary episode of digital ischemia on postoperative day 1, which improved upon K-wire removal. The rapid improvement in perfusion in the subsequent days leads us to believe that this episode was not related to a thrombotic event. However, the patient presented to our institution on postoperative day 10 when she suffered another episode of ischemia. At this time, the examination of the ring finger on the right hand revealed no capillary refill and no bleeding upon puncture (, left). Patient denied any additional trauma, previous symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome and had no personal or family history of hypercoagulable disease.\nAngiography showed absent vascularization in the digital arteries of the affected finger, from the level of the middle of the second phalanx. Vasospasm in this setting was unlikely because episodes of reperfusion would have been visualized during the angiographic study. The inflammatory reaction secondary to ischemia can be visualized through the hyperemic appearance of the vessels distally, as opposed to the adjacent fingers (), which also indicates an occlusive disorder rather than vasospasm. The appearance of the digital vessels suggested a thrombotic rather than embolic nature of the occlusion, and after discussion with the patient, intra-arterial thrombolysis was initiated.\nThe thrombolysis was accomplished through a nontapered 4F Glidecath catheter (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), inserted at the level of the right femoral artery. Because of the very distal lesions, in a young patient, with very spastic forearm arteries, it was decided to perform the thrombolytic drip with the catheter tip in the brachial artery.

She first noticed fatigue, weakness, and abdominal swelling three months prior to her admission at the outside hospital. CT of the abdomen with contrast showed cirrhosis and multiple masses with arterial enhancement in her liver. She underwent a liver biopsy. Pathology was reported as a low-grade vascular tumor. She presented to a larger academic center where she underwent an exploratory laparotomy with open liver biopsy to further investigate the liver lesions. There was no visual evidence of omental spread. The pathology was reviewed by multiple tertiary centers specializing in hepatic malignancies and was reported as a low-grade vascular lesion, which was likely small vessel neoplasm. After denial for LT secondary to an unknown low-grade vascular tumor, she presented to our medical center. MRI of the liver showed multiple enhancing liver masses (Figure ).

She would feel that her life is a waste and that it was better to die rather than live such a life. However, there was no history of any suicidal attempt or any self-harm behavior. Her sleep and appetite had also decreased. She also started remaining withdrawn, not talking much, and not taking part in household activities.

In clinical examination, the patient had a slight asymmetry in the right midface as a result of buccal and palatal cortical expansion from the right maxillary canine to the molar region, resulting in depression of the nasal alar and mouth corner (Fig. ).\nA panoramic radiograph showed an increased bone density on the right maxilla and zygoma and obliteration of the right maxillary sinus. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 4.5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4.5 cm, expansile ground-glass opacity lesion involving the right maxillary sinus, right maxillary alveolar process, zygoma, and hard palate. Bone scan revealed an irregularly shaped hot uptake in the right maxilla, and no abnormally increased uptake was observed at any other sites (Fig. ). The physical examination did not show any other lesions, and the patient had no history of pain, trauma, loosening of teeth, or trismus. Based on the typical radiologic findings, the patient was diagnosed with FD, and no additional biopsy was performed.

At the 1-year follow-up, the development of tooth germ within the lesion was normal, and slight expansion of the lesion to the bucco-lingual side was observed.

The chief complaint was narrated by the mother describing the unaware daytime and nocturnal thumb sucking habit of her daughter till the present age. An appropriate habit history and clinical evaluation was done along with the patient pretreatment record including radiographs, study models, and photographs.\nIt revealed that she was the 3rd child to her parents who belongs to a middle class family. The other two elder siblings also had the habit. Her relationship with her peers was good but she was subjected to being cursed upon practicing the habit. Psychological evaluation revealed positive attitude towards discontinuing the habit practice.\nExtraorally, it revealed depression just above the corner of the mouth, and the lips were slightly inwards at the corner of the mouth. Intraorally, there were anterior open bite of 2 mm, proclined upper/lower incisors except left lateral incisor which was palatally locked, unilateral posterior crossbite involving the two premolars with constricted maxilla on the left, compensatory tongue thrust, and mild lisping in her speech.\nA brief treatment plan was formulated comprising initially parent and patient counseling. This was done by discussing the problems or the deleterious effects of a persistent sucking habit with the audiovisual aids. Patient responded positively and was motivated to stop practicing the habit.

His past medical history was significant for recurrent anterior abdominal wall abscesses. The initial abscess occurred five months prior and he was treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics at an outside facility. At that institution, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen was reported as demonstrating significant bowel wall thickening of the TI with adjacent inflammatory stranding. After the antibiotic course was completed, a repeat CT showed resolution of the abdominal wall abscess but persistence of the bowel wall abnormality. Two months later, he developed a second episode of abdominal wall abscess formation that required percutaneous surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin and metronidazole). Aspirated serous fluid contained few leukocytes and was sterile. After this second episode, he underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy at the outside institution. The EGD was normal and colonoscopy revealed erythema with ulcerations in the TI. Histopathology confirmed severe chronic inflammation of TI. He was prescribed an oral 5-aminosalicylic acid for inflammatory bowel disease. He was not compliant with taking this medication. His abdominal pain slightly improved for a brief period of time. A follow-up colonoscopy was planned at the other institution but he was admitted to our hospital with the current presenting symptoms.\nOn admission, his vital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination revealed a soft, non-distended abdomen with mild tenderness in the infraumbilical and right inguinal regions. A small area of erythema and induration, approximately 2 cm in diameter, was present just inferior to the umbilicus. There was minimal guarding but no rigidity or rebound. No umbilical discharge was noted. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated elevated inflammatory markers and normal hemoglobin",

Elevated cardiac enzyme levels were observed, including 0.1 ng/mL of troponin T and 11.1 ng/mL of creatine kinase-myocardial band. Electrocardiography showed that the ST segment was elevated at the anterior lead. A chest X-ray showed pulmonary congestion. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a reduction of the ejection fraction to 35%, with severe hypokinesis of the anteroseptal area. The patient was diagnosed with myocardial infarction accompanied by pulmonary edema. Selective coronary angiography showed 90% stenosis in the proximal to mid-portion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The lesion was long and irregular. We decided to insert two stents into the lesions. The first stent was inserted uneventfully into the proximal LAD artery, after which an attempt was made to insert the second stent into the mid-portion of the LAD artery because of the irregularity of the lesion. However, when the stent was extracted from the balloon, it was trapped and deformed. One part of it floated in the left coronary sinus ().

His remaining physical examination revealed left lower quadrant abdominal pain without signs of peritonitis, ankle deformities bilaterally, pain with hip range of motion, and blood at the urethral meatus. Given his physical examination findings, subsequent imaging confirmed an unstable pelvic fracture with diastasis of the symphysis pubis of 6 cm, widening of the left sacroiliac joint, a left ischial pubic ramus fracture, and a urethral injury (). He also had a left ankle dislocation and a right compound fracture of the distal tibia and fibula. No intraabdominal injuries were identified on CT imaging of the abdomen. The pelvis was stabilized with a binder by the orthopedic surgeons with subsequent emergency irrigation, debridement, and open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the open ankle fracture as well as reduction of the left ankle dislocation.

At the scene, the emergency medical response personnel found him on the ground alert, unable to move his legs, and noting pain all over his body. He was hemodynamically stable in the field. Ground ambulance immobilized the neck with a cervical collar and brought him to a local level 1 trauma center. At arrival to the trauma bay, he had a Glasgow coma scale score of 15. He was primarily complaining of bilateral hand numbness. On further examination, he had no motor or sensory function present in the lower extremities. In the upper extremities, sensation was present but diminished from T1 and above, with no sensation below T1. Motor function in the upper extremities was graded 3 (based on ASIA impairment scale) in all the key muscles on the right and only grade 2 on the left in the deltoid and biceps muscles with no motor further distal. Next, he was taken to the computed tomography (CT) suite for imaging of the head, neck, and thorax. Imaging, from the CT scan, revealed bullet tract through the posterior lateral left upper hemithorax, left scapular body, left lung apex, and base of left neck with bullet fragments terminating in the C6 vertebral body. Initial studies showed no acute intracranial abnormalities; however, there were fractures of the left C5 and C7 transverse foramina and processes and left C6 vertebral body and lamina fractures with bony and bullet fragments in the left aspect of the spinal canal at the C6 level (). As a result, there was a dense left epidural hematoma within the spinal canal at C2 through C7 levels. At the time, CT neck angiogram showed that the left extracranial vertebral artery was occluded, beyond 1 cm from its origin. Subsequently, the patient underwent angiography to further assess the cerebral vascular supply. On the angiogram, occlusion of the proximal portion",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to specify the anatomic relationships and confirm the tumor morphologic features. The MRI yielded useful information about the vital structures of the mediastinum, whether invaded or externally compressed by the tumor. Specifically, the MRI confirmed a round, non-homogeneous, well circumscribed mass of a 12 cm diameter, exerting compression on the mediastinum great vessels and the left hilar structures (vessels and airway) (Figure ). The bronchoscopy found stenosis of the trachea by external compression, and narrowing in the foramen of the left main bronchus resulting in difficulty in the insertion of the bronchoscope. The mediastinal tumor markers (\u03b1-fetoprotein and \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin) were both normal. As the findings of CT and MRI suggested a benign teratoma, a complete resection was contemplated. Since the mass was supposed to be respectable, surgical management was first in the priority list of therapeutic options. The cytological examination through transcutaneous needle aspiration or biopsy of the tumor were considered redundant and were omitted, because of the dispersion risk and the necessity for total removal so as to ameliorate the respiratory function and re-expand the left lung.

    "original_text": "A 50-year-old female patient was referred from a private dental clinic to our hospital for a proper diagnosis and treatment of the left mandibular second molar. Her chief complaint was gingival swelling around the tooth. A sinus tract was traced to the distal aspect of the distal root (). In the periapical radiographs, a toothlike fragment was observed where the sinus tract was traced. She had a surgical extraction of #38 6 months ago, and a class II gold restoration on #37 thereafter. Her prior dentist suspected a distal root fracture of #37. There was no response to cold or electric pulp test on #37. The tooth was not sensitive to percussion or bite tests. There was no abnormal mobility, and a periodontal probing test appeared normal except for apical full-depth probing on the distal root. The initial diagnosis of #37 was pulp necrosis with chronic apical abscess, and the existence of tooth remnants of #38 was also considered as a contributing factor. We decided on a nonsurgical endodontic treatment for the necrotized second molar. The patient was informed that the lesion would not respond to root canal therapy, so a surgical approach should be considered to remove the tooth fragment.\nAfter removal of the gold onlay on #37, root canal treatment was initiated according to the above-mentioned protocol.

    "original_text": "Prior to her presentation with us, the 67-year-old lady had visited a major hospital in the national capital for symptoms of a rapidly progressive mass in the neck with dysphagia. There she had been diagnosed as suffering from ATC [], and recalls having being provided frank and ample information about prognosis and the available treatment options. The patient there had refused all forms of intravenous chemotherapy and surgery. She had also refused RT since she did not want to spend much time in a city away from home.\nShe presented to our department owing to close proximity to her residence. The already well-informed patient made aware to us that her main intention was to spend as much time as possible with her family at home, and that she was unwilling for intravenous chemotherapy, prolonged course of RT, or any form of surgery. Thus, a compromise was made to settle for a short course palliative RT of 20 Gy in five fractions. However, a month later, the patient reported progression of her symptoms, and there was clinical progression of the disease.\nThough intravenous chemotherapy with either of doxorubicin or paclitaxel was again offered as an option, the patient refused the same and requested for a treatment which could be orally had at home.

In view of prematurity and respiratory distress shortly after birth, he was managed as a case of respiratory distress syndrome with surfactant administered on days one and two of life. He was also treated for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia on day three of life for 24 hours with phototherapy alone. No exchange transfusion was required. He was discharged home on day eight after establishing oral feeds and on room air. Discharge neonatal check was normal. He passed the neonatal hearing test, and since birth, his medical history had been unremarkable for significant medical concerns. His parents had a nonconsanguineous marriage, and there was no family history of any significant childhood illness, including speech delays and spontaneous abortions. He was noticed to have abnormal behavior by his mother at one year of age. There were also developmental concerns expressed by the mother. The child did not interact well with his parents and preferred to express his needs with physical gestures rather than verbally, but he could speak bisyllables when coaxed.\nUpon evaluation by a local pediatrician, his thyroid stimulating hormone level (TSH) was found to be raised at 18 months of age, for which he was started on levothyroxine. The abnormal behavior persisted. By now, he was not using any words but made growling noises when upset and throw things around. He was not making eye contact, choosing to look toward the ground or at the ceiling when being talked to.

His past history was also positive for rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes.\nThe first stage of his left hip revision after his first episode of prosthetic joint infection with C. acnes occurred pre-heart transplantation and he was treated with 6 weeks of vancomycin following hardware explantation.

His post-transplant course was otherwise uncomplicated, without any episodes of graft dysfunction, rejection, or infectious complications over the previous nine years. He was maintained on tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil since his transplant without recent corticosteroid exposure.\nWith regard to his present symptoms, along with the pain, he noted occasional night sweats. He reported receiving 2 hip injections for the pain (one into his hip joint and another into his trochanteric bursa, both on his left side) by his outpatient orthopedic doctor about 2 weeks prior to presentation that provided temporary relief. Sterile precautions were reportedly observed during in-clinic procedures. Following the injections, the patient noticed a progressive fluctuant area swelling of his left lateral thigh and hip. Aspiration of that area 4 days prior by his outpatient orthopedist yielded purulent-appearing fluid that was Gram stain negative for organisms, with no growth seen either on aerobic or anaerobic cultures. Three days prior to admission, he underwent hip arthrocentesis that showed cloudy fluid with 65,000 white blood cells per microliter and a differential of 95% polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Gram stain was negative, and no crystals were seen. Culture of the synovial fluid was later finalized as no growth. However, prosthetic joint infection was suspected",

    "original_text": "A 25-year-old gravida 1 para 0 woman at 35.6 weeks of pregnancy who weighed 57 kilograms was admitted to our hospital because of irregular uterine contractions. The patient had been buried for 48 hours in the ruins after an earthquake. She had undergone more than 30 surgical procedures within the previous 6 years. Her legs and abdomen were severely injured in the earthquake. She underwent left, total leg and right below-knee amputations, left hip resection due to clostridial necrotizing fasciitis, transverse colostomy, cystic and vulvar reconstructions, and colostomy reversal surgery approximately 2 years before becoming pregnant. In addition, she also suffered from spinal shock after the accident. Her sensory and motor function below the level of T10 did not recover until 8 months later. In addition, the patient had progressed to a chronic stage in which her reflex activity was regained. This stage was characterized by disuse atrophy, flexor spasms, and exaggerated reflexes.[ To bear the weight of her body, she had to sit, lie down, or lie on her side. As a result, the uneven distribution of the stress caused compensatory changes in her spine, leading to severe scoliosis.\nThis patient had 2 episodes of congestive heart failure during her previous surgical interventions that required hospitalization in an intensive care unit (ICU). When she was admitted to our hospital, the fetal heart rate and movement were monitored closely. Dexamethasone was used to promote fetal lung maturation. At 36.4 weeks of gestation, her uterine contractions became more frequent, and preterm delivery was inevitable. Spontaneous vaginal delivery was not an option because of the patient's incomplete pelvis structure due to the previous left hip resection and extensive keloid tissue over the perineal region (Fig. ). A cesarean delivery was planned after multidisciplinary consultation and meetings with the patient.\nGeneral anesthesia was planned due to the patient's traumatic stress experience. Preoperatively, we ruled out deep venous thrombosis using Doppler sonography. The patient's right internal",
