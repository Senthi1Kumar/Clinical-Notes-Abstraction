Five years previously, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had shown 2 small masses on the right cerebellum and 1 large mass on the left cerebellum. At that time, lateral vertebral artery digital subtraction angiography (DSA) had shown a highly vascular tumor nodule supplied by the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Lateral internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA) DSA had shown no vascular abnormalities. T1-weighted gadolinium enhancement MRI had shown no abnormal findings in the supratentorial region (). The patient had undergone craniotomy, and the left cerebellar tumor was removed. The pathological diagnosis was HB. Abdominal computed tomography, an evaluation of the patient's family history, and genetic screening had been employed to evaluate the presence of VHL disease. Computed tomography had revealed cysts in the pancreas, liver, and both kidneys. Three of the patient's 6 siblings and 1 of her 2 children were diagnosed with VHL disease. Genetic analysis had shown the presence of a VHL gene mutation; thus, the patient's condition had been diagnosed as HB associated with VHL disease.\nFollow-up MRI performed 1 and 12 months after the first operation had shown no evidence of recurrence or abnormal findings in the supratentorial region. However, MRI performed 5 years after the first operation showed a 4.0\u00d73.6\u00d74.0-cm cystic mass with strong enhancement, dural base thickening, and peritumoral edema on the left frontal surface. However, no tumor recurrence was observed in the cerebellum. Left ICA DSA showed pial blood supply to the rim of the tumor. Left ECA DSA showed tumor staining from the middle meningeal artery ().\nThe tumor was completely removed after preoperative embolization. It was a vascular tumor with extensive dural attachment. Histopathological examination with hematoxylin and eosin staining showed lipid-containing vacuoles and abundant vascular cells (). The tumor cells were negative for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA),",

There was no significant family or psychosocial history. He did not take any medications. He was a computer engineer and his job scope was mainly office work. He lived with his wife and one child in a small flat in Istanbul. He was an active tobacco smoker with a 10 pack year smoking history. Currently, he smoked five cigarettes a day. He did not consume alcohol. His physical examination revealed tenderness and swelling in the sacral region. His vital signs were stable with blood pressure 125/65, pulse rate 70/minute, and temperature 36.2 \u00b0C. A systemic examination was normal and no neurological abnormality was detected. Vertebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a pathological fracture in L5. After a Tru-Cut biopsy, he was diagnosed as having chondroid chordoma. He was treated with preoperative stereotactic radiotherapy to L5 vertebra at a total dose of 15 Gray in two fractions with CyberKnife followed by surgery in May 2012. We aimed to reduce surgical complications by preoperative stereotactic radiotherapy. Two years later, in May 2014, he presented with lumbosacral region pain and MRI suggested recurrent tumor involving L4, L5, and S1 vertebrae. He was not eligible for surgery and was treated with definitive radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) mainly for palliative intent. Between 7 July 2014 and 8 August 2014, he received 40 Gray to L4, L5, and S1 vertebrae in 20 fractions 5 days a week for 4 weeks. In January 2016, he presented with paraplegia. Control imaging showed local recurrence, multiple lung nodules, and sternal metastasis.

Her past medical history revealed developmental delay with gait disorder related to premature birth at 31 weeks of gestation. On physical examination, she had mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the cervical group, motor weakness, muscle hypotrophy, loss of sensation and brisk deep tendon reflexes at the lower extremities. Laboratory investigations detected unremarkable peripheral blood cell count, high levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (74 mm; normal up to 20 mm) and C-reactive protein (89 mg/L; normal up to 10 mg/L). A peripheral blood lymphocyte typing was negative for presence of blasts and a bone marrow aspiration allowed to exclude tumor involvement. A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and the spine showed an epidural mass infiltrating the spinal canal via the left neural foramen. The mass, extending from Th12 to L1 with compression and displacement of the spinal cord (Fig. A, B), was causing destruction and collapse at the twelfth thoracic vertebra. To ascertain the disease spread and the correct risk stratification, a total body computed tomography (CT) was performed. The CT confirmed the presence and the extension of the paravertebral mass and revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and cervical groups (Fig. A, B). Staging 18F-fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan detected pathological FDG uptake involving the paravertebral tumor and the lymph nodes detected at CT scan (Fig. ). The patient underwent ultrasound-guided biopsy of the epidural mass.

Conservative management was started considering the case as diffuse axonal injury (DAI).\nThough there was some improvement in neurological status after few weeks, he went on to a vegetative state, i.e. remained unconscious with GCS about 9/15 and without any specific motor and verbal function. He could occasionally open eyes and move limbs spontaneously, but there was no verbal function, no purposeful limb movement, no bowel and bladder control and he did not respond to any verbal command. Finally, he developed generalized spasticity. Considering an appropriate candidate, ITB was planned. Baclofen injection was not available in Nepal and ITB therapy was never used before in this country. Fortunately, Prof. Taira had brought a few ampoules of injection baclofen from Japan and gave them to us as a gift.\nBut, we did not have baclofen pump and other accessories for ITB. Therefore, an epidural catheter, which is used by an anesthetist for spinal anesthesia or for continuous lumbar drainage [], was inserted into the thecal sac at second and third lumbar space and was fixed. The catheter was placed in situ throughout the ITB period and baclofen was injected everyday through it with aseptic precaution. Patency of catheter was confirmed every time before ITB by free flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We injected 50 \u03bcg of baclofen intrathecally everyday for the first 2 weeks and then increased the dose to 100 \u03bcg everyday. Oral baclofen was stopped. Patient was placed in lying position during ITB and bedside physiotherapy was continued. In due",

Then the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and resection of the retroperitoneal metastasis on 22 August 2013. Postoperative pathology revealed that HCC metastasized to adrenal gland. Thus, regular postoperative tumour bed radiotherapy was performed from 14 October 2013. In February 2014, the patient placed biliary plastic stents because of obstructive jaundice derived from biliary anastomotic stoma stricture. After therapy, the serum level of bilirubin gradually recovered. In August 2014, the CT and magnetic resonance images (MRI) showed space occupying lesion in right lobe of liver which was about 31 \u00d7 32 mm in size. Soon afterwards the patient was performed with occupied area resection of abdominal cavity on 20 October 2014. During operation, the surgeons discovered serious adhesion and resected perihepatic mass, mesenteric mass, and intestinal wall mass. Postoperative pathology still showed HCC metastases. And then abdominal cavity perfusion chemotherapy with pemetrexed was performed from 28 November 2014. The therapy discontinued because of 3rd-degree myelosuppression, which improved after conservative treatment. On 20 March 2015, the CT image showed masses in right lobe of liver, seminal vesicle and space occupying mass between the spleen and stomach (Fig. ). In order to receive further treatment, he came to our hospital again in May 2015. We performed endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for liver and seminal vesicle lesions (Fig. ) and postoperative pathology revealed malignancy. Thus, the patient underwent surgery and the diagnosis of seminal vesicle metastasis of HCC was confirmed by pathology and immunohistochemical analysis",

The patient reported that he was well until 4 days prior when he was intoxicated and awoke with the symptoms. For 4 days, slight improvement of weakness occurred. He had no history of antecedent trauma, injury, infection, or mononeuropathy. Neurologic examination revealed weakness of the left wrist and finger extension (Medical Research Council grade II). Finger abduction appeared weak, but strength improved when the hand was passively extended to the neutral position. Wrist and finger flexion was intact. On sensory examination, there was a well-demarcated area of hypoesthesia and a tingling sensation over the lateral dorsum of the left hand between the thumb and index finger extending into the proximal phalanges of the 2nd finger. In addition, reddish skin color and slight edema were observed in the same area (Fig. ). There was no definite change in skin temperature and no pain. Reflexes were normal at the biceps and triceps brachii muscles, but the left brachioradialis reflex was absent. Routine blood analysis showed white blood cell count, C-reactive protein level and uric acid level were normal. According to the clinical information and neurologic examination, he was diagnosed with compressive radial neuropathy. After approximately two weeks of observation without specific treatment, the skin color recovered along with a marked improvement of the weakness and aberrant sensation. A nerve conduction study and electromyography were performed 2 weeks after the onset of the symptoms (Table ). On the affected left side, a normal radial compound motor action potential (CMAP) was recorded over the extensor indicis proprius muscle with the forearm and elbow stimulated. When stimulated above the spiral groove, the CMAP was reduced by 34% compared to that of distal stimulations. The contralateral radial motor nerve study and sensory nerve conduction were normal.

The PET-CT examination in the First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College of Zhejiang University revealed multiple nodules in bilateral lung with increased FDG metabolic abnormalities as the biggest in the middle lobe of right lung and the bilateral hilar lymph nodes enlargement. No distant metastases were detected. The patient denied any other medical history. On hospital admission, physical examination and laboratory test results were normal. A chest computed tomographic(CT) scan revealed a mass in the middle lobe of right lung measuring 3.0 x 2.0 cm, a nodule in the superior lobe of left lung measuring 1.4 x 0.9 cm.

This revealed a 26\u00d722\u00d725 mm nodular lesion originating from the right bladder trigone region, protruding into the bladder cavity. The tumor showed homogeneous soft-tissue attenuation [mean CT value, 40 Hounsfield units (HU)] on a plain CT scan, the density of which was slightly lower than that of the internal obturator muscles. The lesion exhibited intense enhancement (mean CT value, 129 HU) in the arterial phase, which was significantly higher than that of the bladder wall and only slightly lower than that of the right femoral artery. Thickening of the bladder wall near the tumor was not observed (). The primary radiological and clinical diagnosis was bladder carcinoma with no suspicion of extra-adrenal paraganglioma.\nFollowing the preoperative examinations, an elective cystoscopic tumor resection was performed on August 17, 2012. During the surgery, the tumor was found in the trigone region of the bladder. The tumor had a pedicle, smooth surface, edema mucosa and varicose veins. On attempted surgical removal of a small part of the tumor, the blood pressure of the patient suddenly increased to 210/120 mmHg and the heart rate reached 145 bpm. The operative procedure was immediately terminated, and the blood pressure and heart rate gradually returned to",

Sonography revealed a mass of 10.4 \u00d7 6.6 cm2. A computed tomography was done for further analysis, and showed an intra-abdominal located pear-shaped mass of 9.5 \u00d7 7.1 \u00d7 9.1 cm3 along the right ureter and surrounded by small intestines, without invasion of abdominal structures (Figs and ). It further revealed a congenital malrotation of the small intestine. The differential diagnosis included sarcoma, lymphoma and DTF. A sonography-guided biopsy was performed, and pathological examination confirmed DTF with positive beta-catenin nuclear enhancement. Additional analysis were negative for hormonal receptors. Family history, as well as colonoscopy, were negative for colon polyps. The patient was therefore diagnosed with a sporadic form of DTF.

The comments and jeers that he feared referred to questions about his sexual orientation.

The headache was described as sudden in onset, constant in nature, and bitemporal in location. This was associated with development of vision loss 1 day characterized by darkening of his vision, progressing from the superior to the inferior visual fields that lasted approximately 30 minutes with subsequent persistence of blurry vision. Without resolution of his symptoms, he presented to the emergency department.\nOn questioning, there was no prior history of seizure activity or of precocious puberty, or of genital abnormalities at birth. He had undergone corrective surgery for polydactyly of the left hand at 9 months of age. Polydactyly was also reported in his mother and elder brother.\nHis neurological examination was benign without abnormalities of extraocular movements, pupillary reflexes, facial motor strength, or sensation; he did not have papilledema. His genitourinary examination was normal and appropriate for age. Inspection of the left hand revealed webbing between the 3rd and 4th digits, with a well-healed scar on the ulnar aspect over the 5th metacarpophalangeal joint.\nCT scan of the head without contrast identified a 30 mm mass in the suprasellar region. Follow-up MRI of the brain with and without contrast confirmed this, identifying a nonenhancing, 30 x 27 x 30 mm mass along the midline of the posterior aspect of the suprasellar cistern contiguous with the posterior floor of the hypothalamus and tuber cinereum ().

She had presented to the referring hospital eight days earlier, with a two-week history of high-grade fever and a one-week history of a generalized abdominal pain and diarrhea. She had an exploratory laparotomy at the referring hospital. Intraoperative findings include a feculent intraperitoneal collection and a single perforation on the antimesenteric border of the terminal ileum. An intraoperative diagnosis of perforated typhoid enteritis was made, and the perforation was closed in two layers. One unit of blood was transfused postoperatively. On the first day of postsurgery, the patient developed darkish discoloration of the left hand and both feet which were associated with pain. She was not a known sickle cell disease patient and had no past histories suggestive of intermittent claudication. On the second day of postoperation, a purulent discharge from the lower aspect of the laparotomy wound was noted, and there was darkening of the feet and duskiness of the distal one-third of both legs.

In the female patient birth was performed by vacuum extraction and pneumonia was diagnosed on the tenth day of life. The girl and boy started to walk at 1.4 and 1.2 years, respectively, with a peculiar gait. At 7 and 6 years, respectively, the girl and boy started to fall frequently during walking. Later, in both patients progressive deterioration occurred and they had unstable posture and difficulties in walking and required walking aids. Moderate muscular atrophy and weakness of the distal lower limb muscles were also established. They had family members affected by HMSN type I: the mother's sister and the maternal grandmother's sister.\nIn both patients, vibratory sensation was absent in the toes; the median and tibial motor nerve conduction velocities were low, with a markedly prolonged distal latency and low amplitudes; no nerve action potentials were elicited from stimulation of the sural nerves; clinical examination revealed that muscle stretch reflexes were absent in the lower limbs and were decreased in the upper limbs; haematological and biochemical screenings were negative.\nBased on the neurological examinations and nerve conduction studies a HMSN type I was diagnosed in these patients.\nIn both patients bilateral rigid PEV deformity was present in a similar pattern. Bean-shaped foot, prominence of the head of the talus, dorsal callosities on the foot, callosities on the knees, medial plantar cleft, deep posterior cleft, absence of normal creases over the insertion of the Achilles tendon, and calcaneal tuberosity situated at a higher level were established.

Two foetuses joined at the chest and abdomen were identified by two-dimensional ultrasound, and further confirmation was made by three- and four-dimensional ultrasound. There was blood incompatibility between the parents (the husband was A+ whereas the mother was A\u2013). Anti-D was previously administered after delivery of her first child, a single viable healthy male baby. She had no history of abortion or miscarriage. Her height was 165 cm, weight 63 kg, looked normal, was neither anaemic nor hypertensive and had no history of chronic diseases.\nThe last menstrual date of this twin pregnancy was unknown. The mother did experience normal foetal movements. She had no vaginal discharge or hyperemesis gravidarum. Her abdomen was slightly large for the date of pregnancy. There was no family history of twins.\nA Voluson 730 ultrasound machine from GE Healthcare (Waukesha, WI) was used. The transabdominal ultrasound was performed and two conjoined female foetuses were detected; each foetus was with a single head and a pair of arms and legs. The twins were joined at the lower chest and the upper abdomen. Only one functional foetal heart was observed centrally between both the foetuses with slight tendency towards one of the foetuses ( and ). Single anterior placenta was seen with the umbilical cord and a normal amount of liquor. The colour Doppler study showed two aortic arches emerging from the single functional heart ().

On intraoral examination, the patient had a class 1 molar relationship bilaterally with missing maxillary right central and lateral incisors, retained deciduous canine, mandibular arch crowding, and retroclined maxillary left central and lateral incisors (). Routine panoramic radiograph revealed impacted incisors, unerupted canine, and a supernumerary tooth as well. Cone-beam computed tomography scan done to evaluate the shape and exact position of the supernumerary tooth revealed that it was lying between right central and lateral incisors. Cone-beam computed tomography scan also revealed the presence of dilaceration of impacted central incisor root which was curved distobuccally near the apical third (). The cause of impaction was established as an obstruction to the path of eruption due to supernumerary teeth.\nThe treatment plan was the removal of deciduous canine, supernumerary tooth, and surgical exposure of impacted incisors and unerupted canine followed by evaluation at a later date for all first premolar extraction depending on the soft tissue profile.\nAn open coil spring was placed post alignment to create space for the impacted incisor on an 018 round SS wire. An open eruption technique was planned as the tooth was below the mucogingival junction near the alveolar crest along with the extraction of deciduous canine and supernumerary teeth. The impacted incisor and unerupted canine were bonded at the same time as the exposure. Spontaneous eruption of the teeth occurred while space was maintained with an open coil NiTi spring.

On physical examination, bilateral hearing impairment was found. The cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected signal changes consisted with multiple cerebral infarctions and bilateral demyelination in the centrum semiovale. And the cerebral MRA detected atherosclerotic cerebral arteries and bilateral stenosis of the middle cerebral arteries (Fig. a, b). For further diagnosis, the patient underwent DSA subsequently. The total amount of iopamidol (Bracco Imaging Italia S.r.L.) administered during the procedure was 110 ml. The DSA showed that the patient had bilateral embryonic posterior cerebral arteries, 40% stenosis of the left middle cerebral artery and tortuous vertebral arteries bilaterally. There was no obvious calcification of the aortic arch; angiography of the arch using 25 ml iopamidol was performed only once. Ten minutes after the aortic arch angiography, the patient experienced mild headache. The pain was bearable, and the patient could cooperate during the remainder of the procedure. The DSA was completed 20 min later. No haemorrhage or vasospasm was detected during the procedure. The headache was continuous, and the patient suffered nausea and vomiting. The immediate physical examination showed no obvious abnormal sign. The patient was treated with 8 mg ramosetron and 10 mg dexamethasone. After 20 min of observation, the symptoms were relieved.

A careful physical examination at the time of her biopsy revealed a 1-cm pearly pink papule with rolled borders and central atrophy on the right cheek. No other growths were noted in the immediate vicinity of the site (, A). Histopathologic examination of the biopsied lesion was consistent with BCC with both nodular and infiltrative growth patterns (, A). The patient was referred for MMS given the tumor size, location, and aggressive tumor histology. The primary Mohs layer revealed 2 focal areas with small irregular folliculocentric islands of basaloid cells initially thought to be infiltrative BCC. The Mohs map was marked accordingly, and the second layer was taken from the areas of concern. The above process was repeated 2 more times. On the third layer, more foci of basaloid cells forming duct-like structures involving the papillary and mid dermis were encountered. At this stage, it became clear that these proliferative foci had a more definite syringomatous appearance and were much more widespread than in the previous layers (, B). They did not extend beyond the dermal plane or exhibit perineural invasion. No cellular atypia was noted. As such, microcystic adnexal carcinoma or remaining infiltrative BCC was not favored. Upon careful intraoperative examination of the patient, no clinical lesion was visible that would correlate with the findings seen microscopically. As this proliferation was subclinical and displayed benign histopathologic features suggestive of a folliculocentric syringoma-like hamartoma, which was confirmed by an intraoperative consultation with our dermatopathologist, further resection was not performed (, B).

She had been receiving this therapy for the preceding 12 months but reported 3 months of similar intermittent chest pain. She described her pain as localized, central chest tightness with radiation to her right arm and the right side of her neck. The pain would typically last 5\u201310 min before spontaneously resolving. This could occur at rest or with exertion and did not have diurnal variation. She also described associated dyspnoea on exertion for the preceding 3 months without orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, or leg swelling. She had no traditional cardiac risk factors but was referred for cardiovascular assessment given the nature of her presentation. Clinical examination revealed a slim, normotensive woman with a normal cardiopulmonary exam.\nIntercurrent medications included dexamethasone, thalidomide, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in addition to carfilzomib as part of her treatment for multiple myeloma. She was on no other regular medications.\nThe differential diagnosis at this time included obstructive coronary artery disease, disorders of coronary vasomotion including microvascular and/or vasospastic angina, congestive cardiac failure, and pulmonary emboli.\nAn electrocardiogram while pain free in the emergency department demonstrated sinus rhythm at a rate of 70 b.p.m. There was poor R wave progression and ischaemic T wave inversion through the anterior leads without conduction abnormalities (Figure ). High sensitivity troponin T was 8 ng/L (reference range <16 ng/L). A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated normal left ventricular size and function with no regional wall motion abnormalities.

Due to close surgical margins and inguinal nodal involvement, the patient received adjuvant intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to the right thigh and right pelvic and inguinal nodal region to a dose of 50 Gy delivered in 25 fractions (), as well as consolidative carboplatin and etoposide post-operatively.

Patient complains of discolored, irregular front teeth and carious teeth [Figures and ]. The patient gave a history of gradual wearing away of teeth and increased sensitivity in his back teeth. During last couple of months she had to undergo multiple fillings in many posterior and anterior teeth due to attrition and carious fracturing. There was no history of loosening of teeth or any other systemic problem.\nExtraoral examination revealed an obvious overclosure from the frontal aspect indicative of reduced vertical dimensions. Intraoral examination revealed a full complement of the permanent dentition. The upper and lower front teeth had undergone gradual attrition and fractured over a period of time. Incisal aspects of mandibular anteriors were completely worn away exposing the pulp chambers []. Faulty veneering was present in upper anteriors []. The occlusal aspects of all the posterior teeth were also severely worn. Loss of vertical height was to an extent that lower anterior teeth were touching the upper palate. Multiple restorations were present in posterior teeth. Examination of the periodontium revealed the presence of chronic, generalized, marginal, and papillary gingivitis, with calculus deposition and unsatisfactory oral hygiene.\nThe enamel of all teeth was hypocalcified and yellow brown in color. The surfaces of the teeth were rough, and the enamel was either not visible or easily friable. The dentin, where it was exposed, was brown and hypersensitive. Cervical and proximal enamel was found to be normal. The attrition of the molars resulted in a decrease of the vertical dimension of occlusion.

She had delivered a healthy baby 3 weeks ago through normal vaginal delivery. There was no history of pre-existing cardiac illness. On general examination, pulse rate was 110 per minute, blood pressure 120/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 per minute and jugular venous pressure was raised. Cardiac auscultation did not reveal any significant finding and chest examination showed bilateral basilar fine crepitations. The blood investigations including complete blood count, renal function test and liver function tests were within normal range. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly along with features of raised pulmonary venous pressure. Evaluation by 2D TTE (, ) showed dilatation of all four cardiac chambers and global hypokinesia of the LV. The LV ejection fraction was 32%, LV end diastolic dimension index was 3.05 cm/m2 and M mode LV fractional shortening was 15%. There was a highly mobile pedunculated mass (2.5 \u00d7 2.0 cm) attached to the interventricular septum protruding into the LV cavity. There was no history of diabetes, hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, family history of cardiomyopathy or any metabolic disorders that could lead to cardiomyopathy. Hence the diagnosis of PPCMP with intra-cardiac thrombus was considered. 3D TTE evaluation (, ) was done to further delineate the anatomy of the LV mass. 3D TTE clearly delineated the attachment of the mass as well as the internal echolucent areas within the mass. Based on the clinical scenario and the 3D TTE finding the mass was suspected to be a thrombus. However, the possibility of cardiac tumour could not be excluded. Because of the mobility of the mass and uncertainty of its nature, the risk of embolization was considered to be high. The patient was advised surgical removal of the mass, but she opted for oral anticoagulation therapy.",

Before the colectomy, she had been found to have a tumor measuring approximately 25 mm in the left lobe of the thyroid that was diagnosed as an adenomatous goiter by fine-needle aspiration. Two years after her surgery, a 6-month follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan revealed enlargement of the thyroid tumor, but she remained asymptomatic. Blood tests revealed a small increase in CA 19-9 (from 3.5 ng/ml 6 months earlier to 8.9 ng/ml) and in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (from 1.7 ng/ml to 4.6 ng/ml). Her thyroid function tests were normal. Physical examination and laryngoscopy revealed a firm elastic nodule in the thyroid gland and left vocal fold paralyzed in the midline position. The maximum phonation time (MPT) was 10 seconds. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Ultrasonographic examination of the neck revealed a solid tumor in the left thyroid lobe with a diameter of 35 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 20 mm. CT showed spread of this mass to the tracheoesophageal groove, suggesting invasion of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN; ). Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid tumor showed a few clusters of elongated tumor cells with hyperchromatic dark nuclei on a background of benign hepatocytes, and the mass was reported as metastatic adenocarcinoma. Positron emission tomography-CT showed focal uptake in the left thyroid lobe with no evidence of distant metastasis (). Therefore, the diagnosis was metastasis of adenocarcinoma to the left thyroid gland.

She underwent resection with left nephrectomy, left oophorectomy and partial colectomy for a well-differentiated liposarcoma. Clear margins were attained. In 2003 recurrence in multiple sites was seen within the abdomen. She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and right oophorectomy, cholecystectomy and resection of retroperitoneal metastases with clear margins. In 2005 a second recurrence was noted in the region of the left flank requiring removal of recurrent liposarcoma from the left psoas and resection of small bowel with anastomosis and removal of retroperitoneal and peritoneal lesions. A third recurrence in 2011 necessitated resection of the right ureter, distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy and pelvic and retroperitoneal resections of tumor. Pathology review at this time showed both well-differentiated and de-differentiated liposarcoma. The patient experienced a partial small bowel obstruction as a consequence of her surgeries necessitating surgery for lysis of adhesions in 2014. In the subsequent year, she again had multifocal disease recurrence. Imaging showed a 4.7 cm mass at anterior abdominal cavity, a 2.6 cm mass at right lower quadrant inferior to the kidney, a 2.4 cm mid-abdominal wall lesion and other smaller lesions near the common bile duct, within mesentery and at left hemidiaphragm. The latter posed concern for herniation across the diaphragm. Three surgical opinions were sought and all recommended against resection with concern for margins, adjacent structures and short disease recurrence. She began systemic gemcitabine with a local oncologist. She tolerated three cycles but had disease progression. She was interested in second-line systemic therapy with trabectedin on a clinical trial prior to US FDA approval.

    "original_text": "A 51-year-old female patient presented to our orthopedic outpatient department with a rapidly enlarging ulcerated right upper arm swelling which was growing gradually over the past six months. She recalled that it had been a pea-sized lesion and had remained the same size over the past 30 years. No history of preceding episodes of trauma or local irritation was found. The initially asymptomatic lesion had recently become painful and pruritic with slight bleeding. On examination, a large nodulo-ulcerative plaque was noted on the right upper arm, measuring approximately 12 cm \u00d7 6 cm in size (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a mass measuring 12 cm \u00d7 6 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm, invading the deltoid and triceps brachii muscles (). Examination of the needle biopsy specimen demonstrated the proliferation of spindle cells in a storiform arrangement in the dermis. Results of tests for CD34 and factor VIII were negative, suggesting the possibility of a benign tumor. However, the clinical findings, which included muscle invasion, large tumor size, and rapid enlargement, suggested the possibility of malignancy, prompting the need for wide resection and myocutaneous flap-plasty. Intraoperatively, the tumor was found to have invaded the deltoid and triceps brachii muscles, as well as the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. Wide resection was achieved with a 3 cm margin. A latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap was needed to close the skin defect. The postoperative period was uneventful. Histopathological examination following hematoxylin and eosin stain revealed spindle cell proliferation with a vague storiform growth pattern and basal cell hyperplasia in the overlying epidermal cells ().

    "cleaned_text": "a 51-year-old female patient presented to our orthopedic outpatient department with a rapidly enlarging ulcerated right upper arm swelling which was growing gradually over the past six months. she recalled that it had been a pea-sized lesion and had remained the same size over the past 30 years. no history of preceding episodes of trauma or local irritation was found. the initially asymptomatic lesion had recently become painful and pruritic with slight bleeding. on examination, a large nodulo-ulcerative plaque was noted on the right upper arm, measuring approximately 12 cm \u00d7 6 cm in size (). magnetic resonance imaging (mri) revealed a mass measuring 12 cm \u00d7 6 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm, invading the deltoid and triceps brachii muscles (). examination of the needle biopsy specimen demonstrated the proliferation of spindle cells in a storiform arrangement in the dermis. results of tests for cd34 and factor viii were negative, suggesting the possibility of a benign tumor. however, the clinical findings, which included muscle invasion, large tumor size, and rapid enlargement, suggested the possibility of malignancy, prompting the need for wide resection and myocutaneous flap-plasty. intraoperatively, the tumor was found to have invaded the deltoid and triceps brachii muscles, as well as the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. wide resection was achieved with a 3 cm margin. a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap was needed to close the skin defect. the postoperative period was uneventful. histopathological examination following hematoxylin and eosin stain revealed spindle cell proliferation with a vague storiform growth pattern and basal cell hyperplasia in the overlying epidermal cells (). the tumor tested negative for cd 34 on immunohistochemical staining but tested positive for sma, cd 68, and factor xiiia (figures \u2013). mitoses were inconspicuous in the lesion, and the ki 67 labeling index was also low, at 1 to 2%. these findings were consistent with a diagnosis of dermatofibroma. in 5 years of follow-up,",

His presenting visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/20 OS. Examination revealed mild proptosis and chemosis of the right eye with restrictive eye movement. CTA demonstrated no evidence of carotid-cavernous fistula. The presence of his cochlear implant made MRI not advisable. Head CT demonstrated right retrobulbar inflammatory stranding associated with mild proptosis and enlargement of the right inferior rectus and medial rectus muscles. Thyroid profile was normal. Peripheral blood work, bone scan, and CT of the chest and neck were also normal. To evaluate for possible infection or malignancy, ophthalmology service performed a needle biopsy. After the needle biopsy was negative for suspicious histology and negative on flow cytometry for lymphoma and leukemia, IOP was tentatively diagnosed and steroids were started. Despite corticosteroids, his clinical condition continued to deteriorate and he soon developed constant holocranial pain, proptosis, chemosis, disc edema, and decreased visual acuity to 20/400 OD without change in the left eye. Because of his rapid clinical decline, he underwent an MRI evaluation despite his cochlear implant. MRI demonstrated a marked increase in size of the mass in comparison to the original CT, as well as findings indicative of extension of the mass into the right cavernous sinus, involvement of all of the extraocular muscles, and marked compression of the globe with stretching of the optic nerve (Figures and ). He underwent a right modified orbitofrontozygomatic craniotomy to decompress the optic canal, superior orbital fissure, and orbit. Biopsy of the superior rectus muscle was also performed (). Postoperatively, he reported decreased pain and improvement of his vision. Further examination revealed decreased proptosis and improved extraocular mobility. Pathological findings demonstrated MS. Bone marrow biopsy and peripheral blood smear were negative but LP demonstrated AML cells. Treatment with 24 Gy of radiotherapy to the brain and eye",

    "original_text": "A fifteen year old boy presented with a three day history of left sided abdominal pain, constipation and vomiting to the pediatricians. Over the preceding year he had several episodes of intermittent abdominal pain. There was no other significant past medical history. Examination revealed mild tenderness in the epigastrium and left side of the abdomen with moderate distension. Blood investigations revealed normal full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, and clotting profile. The C-reactive protein (CRP) was four. An abdominal X-ray (AXR) [Fig. ] revealed a dilated transverse colon. The distribution of the large bowel dilatation should have raised the possibility of proximal descending colon obstruction. However a computer tomography scan (CT) [Fig. ] was organised. This revealed dilatation of the proximal transverse colon with a cut-off near the splenic flexure. The appearance was suggestive of a colo-colic intussusception or a volvulus. A surgical review was sought following which a water soluble gastrografin enema was performed for both a therapeutic and diagnostic purpose. This highlighted an obstructive lesion in the proximal descending colon [Fig ]. No contrast passed beyond this point, and the intended therapeutic benefit was not achieved with the procedure. An emergency laparotomy was performed for large bowel obstruction. Intra operative findings were of a transverse colon volvulus [Fig ] rotated in a three hundred and sixty degrees clockwise direction. The point of twist was found in left upper quadrant [Fig ], in keeping with the pre operative imaging. The transverse colon was mobilised, resected at the splenic flexure and just short of the hepatic flexure. A side to side anastomosis was performed for establishing bowel continuity because of significant disparity in the size of the obstructed proximal and collapsed distal colon to the site of the volvulus. A loop defunctioning ileostomy was fashioned.\nA prolonged post operative ileus developed. This was partially attributed to initial difficulty in adequate pain",
