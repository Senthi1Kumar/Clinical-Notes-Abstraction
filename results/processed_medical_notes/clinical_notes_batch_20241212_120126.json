He frequently visited hospital in 3 months about chronic abdominal pain with unidentified cause\u2014recurrent hyponatremia. He underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and ultrasonography of upper abdomen but showed within normal limit of both examinations, so he was treated as chronic dyspepsia and symptomatic treated about hyponatremia but he still not improves. In admission day, he re-visited hospital with abdominal pain and his blood chemistry showed hyponatremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, so gastric outlet obstruction was provisional diagnosis. Saline loading test showed delayed gastric emptying time. Patient was sent for computed tomography of abdomen because previous upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed normal study. Computed tomography resulted in 5 cm long, enhanced wall thickening at duodenojejunal junction in left lower abdominal region, abutting adjacent sigmoid colon with preserved fat plane separation and markedly dilatation of the proximal duodenum and stomach is detected as in Fig. . The diagnosis of obstructed proximal jejunum was made and exploratory laparotomy was decided. In operative field, a 5 cm Cauliflower mass at proximal jejunum, 15 cm distal to ligament of Treitz, causing proximal duodenal dilatation and distal small intestines collapse was found as in Fig. . No liver, omental or peritoneal nodule was found. Radical segmental proximal jejunal resection (with 5 cm proximal and distal margins, with mesentery that vascular supplied resected jejunal segment) with primary small intestinal anastomosis was done. Operative time was 48 min and estimated blood loss was 50 mL. After operation, patient fully recovered but superficial surgical site infection was found and pus culture showed Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Pathologic examination showed well differentiated adenocarcinoma of jejunum with extension into perienteric fatty tissue, free all resected margins, and reactive hyperplasia of three lymph nodes. The diagnosis of Adenocarcinoma of the jejunum (pT3N0M0\u2014stage II) was made and patient was referred to the oncologist for possibility of adjuvant therapy but the oncologist decided",

The patient was admitted for 50 days including neonatal period and treated with O2 for the first 4 days after birth due to pneumonia. There was no evidence of hyaline membrane disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) also. On the physical examination, bronchial breathing sounds were increased with rhonci. Regular heart beats were heard with grade 2 systolic murmur on left upper sternal border. He was diagnosed as secundum ASD in the neonatal period. Echocardiography confirmed secundum ASD (diameter 7\u00d712 mm), right-sided volume overload, tricuspid regurgitation (TR) with a peak pressure gradient of 55 to 60 mmHg, dilated main pulmonary artery (diameter 19 mm) and both pulmonary artery (diameter 11 to 12 mm). When the systolic pulmonary artery pressure was estimated from the peak flow velocity in the TR jet by using the modified Bernoulli equation, his pulmonary artery pressure was 58 to 65 mmHg.\nAt first admission, he was intubated and ventilator care was needed because of progressive respiratory distress.

The patient reported that his symptoms began earlier in the morning while he was running with his unit during physical fitness training. Throughout the course of the three-mile run he described being unable to maintain pace and felt weighed down by his legs. At the completion of the training his symptoms worsened and when he attempted to get out of his car, he could not move his legs. Specifically, he reported that he could not move either of his thighs or lower extremities, but maintained motion of his feet and toes. Unable to move, bystanders assisted him to his local clinic where he was assessed and then emergently brought to the ED for continued evaluation.\nUpon initial assessment the patient had a mild tachycardia but with otherwise normal vital signs. Neurological assessment demonstrated intact cranial nerves, absence of cerebellar signs, and preserved upper extremity motor and sensory exams. On examination of his lower extremities, he had 2/5 strength of hip flexion, hip extension, and knee extension. Dorsi- and plantar-flexion of the feet were intact bilaterally. Sensory exam was intact to light touch throughout his lower extremities. Gait was unable to be assessed secondary to his inability to ambulate or stand without assistance.\nHis past medical history was significant only for a dermatitis that was treated with triamcinolone and over-the-counter medications. He did admit to using multiple supplements two to three times daily to boost muscle strength, but took no prescribed daily medications. He denied any other symptoms, recent illnesses, vaccinations, travel, military deployments or prior neurologic symptoms. Family history was significant for systemic lupus erythematosus and an unknown thyroid disorder in his mother, as well as an unknown thyroid disorder in his younger brother. Laboratory investigations were significant for a urine specific gravity of 1.032, a thyroid stimulating hormone level",

The tumor, about 3 cm in diameter, was located on the right side of the lower rectum 3 cm above the anal verge. The pathological analysis of the biopsy sample revealed that the tumor was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that the rectal cancer invaded into the muscularis propria without distant metastases and that lateral pelvic lymph node (LPLN) was not enlarged with a maximum long-axis diameter <3 mm. The most important problem was that the patient had a huge benign prostatic hypertrophy, the size of which was 85 \u00d7 80 \u00d7 70 mm (Fig. a\u2013c). To achieve complete TME with negative CRM, a hybrid transabdominal-transanal approach for ISR was conducted.\nFirst, vascular division and mobilization of the left colon were performed laparoscopically. The transabdominal approach was continued until the anterior dissection of the rectum became difficult due to a huge prostatic hypertrophy. Next, the circumferential rectal incision and subsequent intersphincteric dissection were performed under direct vision to enable attachment of a single port device (GelPoint Mini; Applied Medical). After closure of the anal orifice, the GelPoint Mini was placed to start the transanal approach. Posterior side of the rectum was first dissected until the transanal approach was connected to the dissection layer made by the transabdominal approach. The dissection procedure was extended to the lateral side. Bilateral pelvic splanchnic nerves were identified at the 5 and 7 o\u2019clock positions. At the anterior side, the proper dissection layer cannot be easily identified because of the perineal body and the enlarged prostate. Once the dissection plane between the rectum and the prostate could be identified, it was relatively easy to continue along the same plane. The assistance provided by the laparoscopic approach was useful to determine the appropriate dissection line in the transanal approach.",

He had been followed up for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of the left upper lobe (T2aN1M0), which was treated by the SBRT (50 Gy in four fractions) 4 years prior to the current visit. SBRT was effective enough to achieve complete response of the disease, and the patient had developed no evident recurrent disease so far. After the completion of SBRT, he occasionally complained about postprandial soreness in the upper chest for 4 years until the evaluation by the following clinical examinations.\nThe blood examination revealed marked leukocytosis and elevated level of C reactive protein (CRP) (\nTable\n).

The patient was asymptomatic otherwise. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained first time in 2015, which demonstrated pelvic and abdominal lymphadenopathy. He was referred to surgery for an excisional biopsy, which revealed follicular lymphoma World Health Organization Grade I-II (). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was positive for IGH/BCL2 translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21). It was negative for MYC/IGH translocation and BCL6 rearrangement. It was determined at the time of diagnosis that the optimal therapy would be observation. One year later, the patient complained of generalized weakness as well as difficulty urinating due to obstructive uropathy secondary to lymph nodes that were identified on a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.

She was tender in the left costovertebral angle and had frequent voiding symptoms without gastrointestinal problems. Routine urinary analysis showed many red blood cells and 20-29 white blood cells per high power field of microscopy indicating renal stone disease. Other laboratory tests were unremarkable. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed for evaluation of a nodular lesion in the right lower lung field that was detected on routine chest radiography leading to the incidental discovery of a low-density lesion in the left hepatic lobe. While she was admitted to the hospital for treatment of left renal stone disease, further evaluation of the incidental low-density lesion in the left hepatic lobe was performed. Ultrasonography (US) of the upper abdomen demonstrated a 3.1 cm-sized mixed-echoic nodular lesion in segment IV with a hyperechoic rim (). The right portion of the lesion was anechoic (solid arrow) while the left was hyperechoic. An abdominal CT scan revealed a lobulated mass with a cystic component in the right portion of the mass and delayed enhancement in the left which was thought indicate solid component (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver was performed for further evaluation of the mass. The right side of the mass was seen as low signal intensity while the left side was enhanced on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image (), thus matching to the CT features. However, T2-weighted images showed bright high signal intensity throughout the whole lesion () suggesting that the lesion was composed of aggregated cysts rather than solid tissue.

The patient admitted receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine for persisting gout crisis and diffuse articular pain. He was afebrile and physical examination revealed mild tenderness to deep palpation in all four abdominal quadrants. Rectal examination revealed an enlarged prostate. On laboratory tests there were marked leukocytosis of 48,000/mm3, international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5, and C-reactive protein of 48 mg/l. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.21, base excess of 13.6 mEq/l, and pCO2of 33 mmHg. At the time of the initial presentation the patient was judged by a surgeon as not having an acute abdominal disease.\nThe plain abdominal X-ray did not show any pathology. An ultrasound showed a simple left renal cyst. A computed tomography scan showed dilatation and edema of the jejunal loops close to the gastrointestinal anastomosis and a minimal quantity of free fluid in the peritoneal space. The radiology report suggested possible localized peritonitis in the proximity of the gastrointestinal anastomosis. Within 2 h of the first surgical examination the patient developed respiratory failure and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient rapidly became severely hypotensive (60/40 mmHg), and oliguric and inotropic support was initiated. Macroscopic hematuria was also noted. At this point the patient received inotropic support. Since the possibility of an intra-abdominal collection was not ruled out on computed tomography scans and no other source of septic shock was identified, an emergency explorative laparotomy was decided on. On laparotomy, no anastomotic leak was found and no other source of abdominal sepsis identified.

She had a history of childhood trauma resulting in nasal septum deviation and external nasal deformity. Four months after a successful and uneventful septorhinoplasty, she presented to the emergency department with blunt nasal trauma resulting in a septal hematoma, which was drained successfully; the patient was discharged with no adverse sequelae.\nFour months later, the patient sustained nasal trauma again, this time accompanied by clear nasal discharge, raising suspicion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The patient was discharged after managing the nasal injury, as the CT brain showed an intact cribriform plate with no evidence of a CSF leak. Ten days later, she presented at the emergency department with dizziness and an unstable gait. She also had complaints of paresthesia for the past two months, beginning in her right hand and progressing to the right shoulder, arm and leg, associated with some difficulty in the execution of movements in the first and second finger of the right hand. Her right leg was quite stiff with difficulty in walking. On close inquiry, she gave history of pain in the right eye and double vision many months back, which had resolved spontaneously. Examination showed a positive Romberg\u2019s and Lhermitte\u2019s sign, with right-sided sensory impairment.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, cervical and thoracic spine demonstrated demyelinating lesions in the brain and cervical segment of the spinal cord (Figure ). Some of the lesions demonstrated enhancement on post gadolinium administration sequences, suggestive of active demyelinating diseases like MS. A lumbar puncture was performed which demonstrated the presence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF.

He had the first episode of acute pancreatitis two years ago and received conservative treatment for it. The second episode of acute pancreatitis, about one and a half years ago, was accompanied by retroperitoneal cyst and splenomegaly along with dilation of the pancreatic duct.

Patient's symptoms were relieved after symptomatic treatment, but pseudocyst had not been treated. Nearly two weeks ago, the patient had recurrent upper abdominal pain, which was persistent and radiating to the left shoulder and back. He was admitted to local hospital. The routine blood test showed hemoglobin 102 g/L and serum amylase 139 U/L. Abdominal CT showed a large pseudocyst in the body and tail of the pancreas with signs of bleeding, a large subcapsular hematoma of the spleen, and cholecystitis with gallstones.

    "original_text": "A 74-year-old female patient who had been followed at our private clinic for AD for the past two years, recently presented to her follow-up visit with the complaints of displaying hypersexual behavior to the females around her, including her female caregivers and adult granddaughters. According to the history obtained from her caregivers, this hypersexuality involved not only flirtatious remarks to females but also included attempts to touch their breasts and genitalia. The family was at first terrified and baffled by these new symptoms and preferred to ignore when they first became apparent in the past few months, but later on wanted to seek professional help as it was getting harder for them to find professional female caregivers to take her on; and also leading to social isolation of the family members. Eventually she was taken to a nursing home, where she continued to display ISB toward the female staff. During the clinical visits, she also made compliments to the female staff members and expressed a desire to be physically intimate with them.\nPast history obtained from her son and daughter-in law revealed that she married with her first boyfriend when she was 17 years old and stayed married for 43 years until her husband passed away 14 years ago. Both of them were born and raised in Romania, but then immigrated to Turkey when she was at the age of 40. Reportedly, she had a decent and happy marriage and raised three children with her husband.

Physical exam revealed a well-healed surgical scar on her right buttock. She had no motor deficits and no abnormality on rectal or vaginal exam. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a cystic mass in the retrorectal space. MRI was done to further characterize the lesion and this showed a 6.0 \u00d7 5.8 cm cystic mass in the retrorectal space extending from the coccyx across midline into the region of the right piriformis and acetabulum and it was deep to the right gluteal musculature ().

The patient had been on APD since 2014 due to end-stage renal disease and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and was on a waiting list for kidney transplantation. The patient had never experienced dialysis-related infections or other complications before the hospitalisation described in this report.\nThe patient had a prior history of hypertension and psoriasis, but no history of liver cirrhosis.\nIn April 2016, the patient was hospitalised with pyelonephritis and was treated with intravenous cefuroxime. She was also treated empirically with intraperitoneal gentamicin (80 mg) and vancomycin (2 g), because peritonitis could not be excluded at the time of admission. Peritoneal fluid was collected and did not show any growth, therefore the intraperitoneal antibiotics were discontinued. The cause of the infection was not determined, but it was likely related to an infected cyst in her kidney. On the 12 April, the patient was discharged with oral ciprofloxacin.\nFive months later, on the 10 October 2016, the patient was hospitalised reporting of constant abdominal pain for 4 days prior to hospitalisation. She had a 39.4\u00b0C fever, nausea and had vomited once. Her vital signs were blood pressure of 152/87 mm Hg, heart rate of 78 beats per minute and 96% oxygen saturation without supplementation.\nThe peritoneal fluid was cloudy and turbid and a urine test strip was positive for leucocytes. These findings raised the suspicion of peritonitis and prompted the clinician to send the peritoneal fluid for microbiological examinations. The patient\u2019s dry body weight was 87.5 kg. At admission, the weight was 89.2 kg. The patient was treated empirically with vancomycin (2 g) and gentamicin (80 mg) intraperitoneally as in the previous hospitalisation.

He was brought to his local hospital, where a knee radiograph was performed, which did not disclose any abnormality. A diagnosis of traumatic arthropathy was made. A few days of weight-bearing avoidance and ice-pack application led to quick reduction of joint swelling, which, however, did not resolve completely. Indeed, over the following months the right knee always appeared to the parents slightly more swollen than the contralateral. Moreover, recurrent exacerbation of swelling, often following a minor trauma, was noted. One year after the onset of symptoms, the child was hospitalized elsewhere to investigate the cause of persistent right knee swelling. All laboratory tests, including acute phase reactants, antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor, and a further plain radiograph were negative. A diagnosis of JIA was made and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) therapy with ibuprofen was prescribed, which had no appreciable effect. The boy was seen at the outpatient clinic of our unit at the age of 3 years, shortly after a further episode of knee swelling, preceded by a mild local trauma. On clinical examination, the right knee appeared swollen, but was modestly tender and painful on passive motion; considerable joint effusion and slight restriction of flexion were detectable.

Knee ultrasonography revealed a bulk of hyperechogeneic material in the supra-patellar region, suggesting prominent synovial hypertrophy, and marked effusion.

His gait disturbance and falls gradually grew worse. At the age of 80 years, he visited our hospital due to difficulty with walking. Neurological examinations showed cognitive impairment, parkinsonism, and oculomotor abnormalities. His cognitive impairment included slowing of cognition and frontal release signs. His parkinsonism consisted of masked face, bradykinesia, moderate rigidity of the neck, mild rigidity of both legs, and postural instability. His oculomotor abnormalities were vertical supranuclear palsy, including downward gaze limitation and loss of eye convergence. At this time, his eyes were in the normal middle position. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated severe atrophy of the midbrain and moderate atrophy of the frontotemporal lobes. Carbidopa-levodopa 300 mg per day was prescribed but was not effective. He was diagnosed with PSP according to the clinical criteria []. Thereafter, he became unable to walk without assistance. At the age of 81 years, he became bedridden due to parkinsonism and had difficulty eating due to dementia and dysphagia. He was admitted to our hospital for gastrostomy. His medical and family histories were unremarkable.\nNeurological examinations again showed cognitive impairment, parkinsonism, and oculomotor abnormalities. The cognitive impairment and parkinsonism had become worse compared to the previous year, and the oculomotor abnormalities included new findings. In addition to vertical gaze palsy and loss of eye convergence, the oculomotor abnormalities included, in his right gaze, adduction paresis of the left eye and rightward nystagmus of the right eye, and, in his left gaze, adduction paresis of the right eye and leftward nystagmus of the left eye.

With consideration of the possibility of insufficient cardiac functions, the patient was admitted to the Cardiovascular Department for heart failure treatment. Examinations upon admission revealed shortness of breath, thick breath sounds in both lungs, decrease in breath sounds on both bottom sides of the lungs, small number of dry and wet rales, and no pleural friction sounds. The apical pulse moved slightly to the left; the border of cardiac dullness expanded to the left and right, with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute and arrhythmia. In the aortic valve, 3/6-degree diastolic respiratory murmur can be heard in the left armpit, with no pericardial fricative sound. The related examinations were improved after the patient's admission to our hospital. Myocardial markers, cardiac enzymes, and B-type brain natriuretic peptides did not increase. Temporarily, the symptoms were not considered to be caused by cardiac insufficiency.

However, the patient complained of pain in his right lower extremity, especially when moving downhill or down stairs, and experienced a limping gait and obvious tenderness at the fracture end. Three years after originally presenting at Lhasa Hospital, the patient was experiencing persistent pain in the right lower extremity, and his daily activities were severely affected. Thus, he was re-diagnosed with nonunion of the right tibial fracture after internal fixation (Fig. ). The main causes of the nonunion of the fracture were considered to be the excessively thin intramedullary nails and unstable fixation of the fracture. The operation was repeated with replacement of the crude intramedullary nails and grafting of iliac bone (Fig. ). Three months after the operation, the tibial fracture had failed to heal, and further surgical treatment was performed. The proximal locking screw of the intramedullary nail was removed with an expectation to eliminate the stress shielding effect and to promote fracture healing by increasing the microdynamic force while retaining the static interlocking nail.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that the rectal cancer invaded into the muscularis propria without distant metastases and that lateral pelvic lymph node (LPLN) was not enlarged with a maximum long-axis diameter <3 mm. The most important problem was that the patient had a huge benign prostatic hypertrophy, the size of which was 85 \u00d7 80 \u00d7 70 mm (Fig. a\u2013c). To achieve complete TME with negative CRM, a hybrid transabdominal-transanal approach for ISR was conducted.\nFirst, vascular division and mobilization of the left colon were performed laparoscopically. The transabdominal approach was continued until the anterior dissection of the rectum became difficult due to a huge prostatic hypertrophy. Next, the circumferential rectal incision and subsequent intersphincteric dissection were performed under direct vision to enable attachment of a single port device (GelPoint Mini; Applied Medical). After closure of the anal orifice, the GelPoint Mini was placed to start the transanal approach. Posterior side of the rectum was first dissected until the transanal approach was connected to the dissection layer made by the transabdominal approach. The dissection procedure was extended to the lateral side. Bilateral pelvic splanchnic nerves were identified at the 5 and 7 o\u2019clock positions. At the anterior side, the proper dissection layer cannot be easily identified because of the perineal body and the enlarged prostate.

    "original_text": "A healthy 36 years old woman who had pregnancy complicated by placenta previa and placenta accreta was referred to our hospital. She had a history of twice caesarean section which one of them was due to placenta previa. In ultrasonographic examination the internal cervical os was covered completely by placenta. In addition the sonographic examination of placenta revealed multiple hipoechoic spaces (lacunae), turbulent internal flow and thinnig of the myometrium []. These findings were interpreted in favor of total placenta previa and abnormal placental invasion.\nThe patient was scheduled for an elective Caesarean section at 38 weeks. The patient was informed the type of operation and possible complications which is related with procedure. Preoperatively hemoglobin was calculated as 10.2 g/dl. All the coagulation profiles were found within normal range. Against the risk of bleeding and disseminated intravascular coagulation, four unit erythrocyte, eight unit platelet and eight unit plasma suspensions were prepared.\nIn the operating room the abdomen was penetrated by vertical incision. For the uterus high vertical incision was preferred instead of uterus Kehr incision in order to avoid bleeding of placenta. Subsequent to the removal of fetus; we waited 15 minutes to see normal placental seperation.At the end of this time normal separation could not be seen. Gentle traction was applied to remove the placenta but it could not be extracted from the uterine wall.\nBy this step preoperational diagnosis of placental invasion anomaly was confirmed surgically.

At the time of referral patient still received hormonal therapy. At baseline (T0), before intake and start of treatment, patient B had a score of 44 on the subscale fatigue severity of the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS), indicating presence of severe fatigue (see ).\nPatient B completed the first EMA after intake. Patient B completed 68 of the 70 offered assessments. In the fatigue scores of patient B during the first EMA is plotted (E0, blue line). In the scores on the maintaining factors of patient B at E0 are shown. Six variables had a mean successive difference (MSSD) of less than 50. Based on the analyses, three variables Granger caused fatigue. These variables were: social activity, mental activity and physical activity. The three factors were not associated with one of the four optional treatment modules. The factor that predicted fatigue in the most valid VAR models (highest percentage) was social activity (see association in ). Higher scores on the social activity item predicted higher scores on the fatigue item ().\nAs the individual time series analyses showed that no factors associated with one of the optional treatment modules Granger caused fatigue, we used the questionnaires to determine which optional module to assign first. Based on the questionnaires, one optional module was indicated for patient B (see ). This treatment module was helpful thinking.

She was otherwise healthy with no other relevant history. Physical examination revealed a large, non-tender, freely movable mass in the left breast and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla. Our patient reported no systemic B symptoms such as fever or weight loss. A biopsy of her left breast mass revealed a DLBC lymphoma. Our patient was then referred for staging with F-18 FDG PET/CT that was acquired from base of skull to upper thigh with the CT being low-dose and unenhanced. The PET/CT scan revealed a 8 \u00d7 10 cm hyperdense and intensely FDG-avid mass occupying almost the entire left breast with maximum standard uptake value (SUV) of 21 (Figure ). In addition, several left axillary lymph nodes measuring up to 5 cm in size and several left sub-centimeter internal mammary lymph nodes showed intense FDG avidity (Figure ), with SUV values of 33 and 3.3. However, PET/CT findings were suggestive a breast carcinoma rather than a lymphoma, based on the location and distribution of the lesion. Because of the rarity of breast lymphoma, it would be unusual to consider metastatic breast lymphoma in the differential diagnosis of breast tumors. As a result, it would have been impossible to distinguish breast lymphoma from breast carcinoma through PET/CT. An incidental finding of intense FDG uptake in the uterine cervix, SUV of 8, led to the subsequent pathologic diagnosis of a previously unsuspected squamous cell carcinoma (Figure ). The lesion appeared to involve the proximal third of the vagina and the corpus uterine, but a tumor extension to the parametrial soft tissue was not noticed.\nOur patient underwent chemotherapy for NHL of the breast and cervical cancer as well as afterloading brachytherapy to the uterine cervix.

Local examination revealed a non-tender soft 5 \u00d7 10 cm sized swelling over the left frontal region, fixed to the underlying skull. There was no sign of inflammation or tenderness over the lesion. In general examination, no focal neurological deficit, lymphadenopathy or organomegaly was noted.\nSkull radiographs showed a relatively well-defined soft tissue density over the left frontal bone, without evidence of calcification, or obvious bone erosion or sclerosis (). Noncontrast CT demonstrated a slightly hyper-dense mass emanating from the calvaria extending both intracranially and extracranially with minimal underlying morphological changes in the bone as mild increase in bone thickness (hyperostosis) (). On MRI, T1 and T2-weighted images revealed lesion isointensity to gray matter (). Following gadolinium injection, intense homogeneous enhancement of the lesion and the dural tail beneath was noted ().

    "original_text": "A 78-year old male patient with recent contralateral right below-the-knee amputation initially presented in July 2019 with ischaemic rest pain and dry gangrene involving his left heel and his first and second toes. His comorbidities included type II diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke and hypercholesterolaemia. Duplex ultrasound showed a focal stenotic lesion in the distal SFA and heavily calcific occlusive tibial disease. He was classified as Rutherford category 5 with a Society for Vascular Surgery WIfI \u201cwound, ischemia and foot infection\u201d score of 2\u20133-0, which meant he was at high risk of major amputation within the year. The patient initially underwent balloon angioplasty of the SFA but angiography revealed poor outflow to the foot with no suitable target for distal angioplasty or bypass (Fig. A). The lower limb multidisciplinary team at our institution reviewed the case and agreed to proceed with pDVA as the only possible treatment apart from major amputation.\nThe patient underwent vein assessment prior to the procedure and this included duplex scan imaging of the superficial and deep venous system of the foot.

    "original_text": "A 27-year-old male was admitted to hospital emergency due to 4 h of chest pain in 13 January 2016. In fact, he had suffered from fatigue after activity for more than 10 days and felt chest tightness and chest pain for 4 days before admission. The patient, a taekwondo trainee, had a healthy body, and his family history was unremarkable. Emergency aortic computed tomographic (CT) scan showed a thickened aortic wall, bilateral pleural effusion and pericardial effusion (Figs. a and b). Cardiac colour ultrasound suggested aortic hematoma or dissection (Fig. ). On the basis of the condition and the results of auxiliary examination, the formation of aortic dissection should be considered. The next day, after excluding surgical contraindications, the patient was performed an emergency operation. Cardiac surgeons underwent ascending aortic replacement and aortic arch replacement. They developed postoperative comprehensive treatment measures, including anti-infection, adjustment of cardiac function, nutritional nerve and symptomatic supportive treatment, and the patient recovered well and was discharged after 15 days. The cause of aortic dissection was unclear, although the surgeons extracted arterial tissues and pericardial tissues and sent them for pathological examination. In fact, postoperative pathology of the aortic wall tissue showed aortitis, such as visible necrosis, granulation tissue hyperplasia and a large number of acute and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration (Figs. b, c and d). However, the surgeons and the pathologist at the time did not consider the cause of aortitis or aortic dissection due to GPA because of a lack of understanding of GPA-induced aortitis or aortic dissection. This event is one of the starting points of our study. We want to attract the attention of clinicians. GPA is also a common cause of aortitis and even aortic dissection.\nOn the first day of 2017, the patient was re-examined for aortic CT because of a 6-day fever and right chest pain.

He reported episodes of loss of consciousness and falling on his wife immediately after ejaculation. It was followed by tonic clonic movements in all four limbs as reported by his wife. Each episode lasted a few minutes. He would feel the heaviness in his head and dazed feeling after regaining his consciousness. He did not report feeling any discomfort during foreplay and the initial part of sex. This continued after every act of sexual intercourse and ejaculation leading to a gradual reduction in the frequency of sexual intercourses. It led to marital strain and feeling of frustration and helplessness in the patient. These seizures were seen exclusively after sexual intercourse initially, and 3 years later he reported experiencing 5\u20136 episodes during which he dropped objects held in hand, was unresponsive and slumped to the ground, each lasting few seconds. It happened at different times of the day and was not associated with the sexual interaction. His neurological examination did not reveal any significant finding. There was no history of any head trauma in the past. He never consumed alcohol or any other substance of abuse, and he was not taking any other medication other than antiepileptic.\nInterictal electroencephalograms done during earlier consultations at different places were normal. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging (T-3) testing of the brain revealed no structural abnormality. His blood examination findings were normal. At various places, he was treated with phenytoin sodium and clobazam with no change in frequency of the seizures.
