Physical examination revealed that the 3-cm movable neck mass was firm and slightly tender on palpation and had a distinct margin from surrounding tissues. An ultrasound examination showed that the well-defined oval mass was 31 \u00d7 23 \u00d7 17 mm in size and exhibited heterogeneity. Furthermore, a non-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck revealed that the distinct neck mass in the subcutaneous tissue had a mixture of soft tissue and fatty components (Fig. ). Based on these findings, the cervical tumor was clinically diagnosed to be an unusual lipoma with degeneration; however, we could not exclude the possibility of it being a malignant tumor such as liposarcoma. Thus, fine-needle aspiration cytology of the tumor was performed, but no diagnosis of malignant cells was obtained. Further examinations were conducted to address concerns related to her menstrual pain, and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral ovarian cysts in the lower abdomen. Under general anesthesia, the patient underwent neck mass extirpation and bilateral ovarian cystectomy; pathological examination of the cysts resulted in a diagnosis of ovarian endometriotic cysts. During the surgery, the cervical mass was well demarcated and did not adhere to the surrounding tissues. The postoperative course was uneventful. The gross pathology report showed that the neck mass measured 3.0 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 2.0 cm. The cut surface of the specimen was heterogeneous, solid, whitish, and yellowish (Fig. ).

A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) on admission showed an enlarged necrotic pancreas and peripancreatic inflammation and fluid (Figure ). As she suffered from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and required mechanical ventilation, a NJT was placed on the fifth day after admission at bedside by transnasal endoscopic technique. The tube position was not determined by an abdominal radiography. We initiated a D5W solution feeding after intubation. No initial discomfort was noted as the peptisorb liquid (of up to 50 ml per hour) was administered. The patient tolerated this for 15 days, and was weaned from mechanical ventilation on the 10th day. However, on the 21st day after hospitalization, she again had a high fever and abdominal distension. So we checked her using an ultrasound (US) at bedside and performed a US-guided percutaneous catheter drainage of the doubtful retroperitoneal abscesses. The left abscess was demonstrated by the aspirate, but the aspirate from the right retroperitoneal abscess was similar to the peptisorb liquid. We injected 20 ml of methylthioninium chloride through the NJT and found it effusing immediately via the right drainage catheter. At first we thought that the right drainage catheter had penetrated the duodenum or superior segment jejunum. An abdominal radiography was performed and showed that the NJT was kinking on the third portion of the duodenum. The duodenum was not visualized when meglumine diatrizoate was injected via the right drainage catheter (Figure ). Meglumine diatrizoate was injected via the NJT and showed that the tip of the NJT was inserted into the right retroperitoneal abscess on the second portion of the duodenum (Figure ). This demonstrated that the duodenal perforation was caused by the NJT. The position of the NJT was adjusted using fluoroscopic guidance and the tip was exactly beyond",

She has no history of a prior fragility fracture. She was initially treated with oral alendronate, but after a few weeks of intermittent use, this drug was discontinued due to upper gastrointestinal intolerance. She was subsequently treated with Strontium ranelate, but stopped this after a few days due to lower gastrointestinal intolerance. She has also had great difficulty tolerating oral calcium and vitamin D supplements. Other relevant drug therapies on admission included Omeprazole 20 mg once daily, which she had been taking for two years. She was commenced on Denosumab in September 2011.

His vitals were blood pressure of 139/71 mmHg, Temperature of 35.8\u00b0C, oxygen saturation of 95% on room air, respiratory rate of 18 cycles per minute and a pulse rate of 73 beats per minute. He had a scaphoid abdomen with tenderness on the right lumbar region. Fine crepitations were heard with reduced air entry on the right side of his chest. Full blood picture was done which was normal with a haemoglobin of 11.3 g/dl, other investigations including renal function tests and liver enzymes were normal. Chest X-ray done showed signs of metastasis (). CT-scan of the abdomen done at the referring hospital with both oral and intravenous contrast reported structures above the diaphragm showing dilated oesophagus measuring 41 \u00d7 38 mm due to distal retro-cardiac concentric oesophageal wall thickening amounting to 18 mm with luminal narrowing with possibility oesophageal fistula tract. The gastric cavity was normal without focal lesions. OGD revealed the oesophageal mucosa was hyperemic with a blocking mass at 29 cm from the upper incisors. The scope was able to pass beyond the lesion. The cardiac, fundus and body mucosa was atrophic. There were metaplastic changes at the antrum and pylorus. Multiple biopsies were taken. Histology results revealed oesophageal well differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma.\nThe patient was scheduled for GFT insertion.

The patient in question was a rear seat, nearside passenger.\nAt the scene of the collision, the passenger-side front seat trapped the patient for approximately 1\u00bd h. Once released the patient was then transferred by helicopter to a local trauma center.\nUpon arrival, the patient was stable despite tachydcardia with Glascow coma scale of 15/15. Primary and secondary surveys were performed, and trauma team noted open wounds in both right forearm and left thigh. There were bruises and patient was complaining of pain and difficulty in using his jaw. The abdomen was soft and normal oxygen saturations were maintained. The extremities were neurovascularly intact distally, and the patient was complaining of pain in the right leg.\nHe had been administered opiate analgesia, oxygen and tranexamic acid. Once stabilized the patient was transferred for an urgent computer aided tomography (CT) scan, which revealed the following injuries: Subcondylar fracture of the mandible, open fracture of the right ulna and radius, open fracture of the left femur, inferior dislocation of the right hip joint, small splenic laceration, and contusion of left pulmonary base.\nThe same day as admission the patient was taken to the operating theater for reduction under general anesthesia of the inferior dislocation of the right hip joint. With hip abduction traction, external rotation and flexion of the hip joint multiple attempts were made to reduce the hip joint, but unsuccessfully.

The patient denied alcohol consumption and reported to have quit smoking 41 years ago. Liver chemistries, serum bilirubin, serum triglycerides, and immunoglobulin subclasses were within normal limits (). Abdominal CT scan demonstrated peripancreatic haziness consistent with noncomplicated acute pancreatitis (). Home medications included atorvastatin for several years and the addition of 160 mg fenofibrate six months prior to admission. These medications were held upon admission but resumed at discharge. Full medication lists on admission and at discharge are shown in (). The patient was managed with fluid resuscitation and pain control. The patient recovered well and was able to tolerate regular diet without any pain or nausea. The patient was discharged in a stable condition after three hospital admission days, and lipase level at the day of discharge was 307 u/l.\nThree days later, the patient returned with similar symptoms. Lipase levels were >30,000 u/l (), and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis ().

There was no history of accompanying chills and rigor or rash. There were no ear, nose, and throat (ENT) or tooth complaints. There was no history of night sweats, loss of weight and loss of appetite. His past medical and family history was unremarkable. He had no history of tuberculosis (TB) or TB contacts. There was no recent history of foreign travel, insect bites, exposure to cats or other animals.\nOn presentation, his general condition was good, with an axillary temperature of 38\u00b0C. On physical examination, he had multiple lymph nodes located in posterior triangle of the neck on left side; the largest being approximately 2 \u00d7 1.5 cm in diameter. The lymph nodes were tender, mobile and firm in consistency with a smooth surface. He did not have any other site of significantly enlarged lymph nodes. Thyroid gland was not palpable. ENT examination was normal. Physical examination revealed no other abnormalities. A cervical ultrasound scan confirmed the examination findings and also demonstrated few subcentimetric lymph nodes in the posterior triangle of the neck on right side. Abdominal ultrasound revealed no abnormalities. He was given a course of oral amoxicillin/clavulanate combination, antipyretics, analgesics and was reviewed at the end of a week. There was no change in the symptoms or size of the lymph nodal mass. Hence, a fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was performed.

Her history comprised of atraumatic pain without any signs or symptoms of infection and without any subjective weight loss or systemic features. She was an ex-smoker for 16 years. She had attended her general practitioner (GP) multiple times for the same pain over the preceding month. The GP organised an MRI of the left knee which was performed eight days before presentation to the ED. The MRI revealed a subcutaneous fat collection at the level of the left tibial tuberosity with no bony or ligamentous injury. Concerned about her symptoms, the patient attended a private orthopaedic consultant who, considering the MRI results, discharged her with simple analgesia. She subsequently decided to present to the ED for further clinical input due to worsening pain.\nOn examination, her vital signs were normal. Systemically, she seemed well without any further symptoms. A focused examination of the left lower leg revealed mild erythema of the medial aspect of the proximal tibia without any swelling, bruising, or deformity. She had point tenderness over the medial aspect of the proximal tibia. Her gait was normal, and she had a good range of motion in her knee and ankle joint. Neurovascular examination of the lower limb was normal. No knee tenderness was elicited.

She denied any other surgical history and also denied any workup for recurrent first trimester miscarriages. She was currently trying to conceive for the last two years. Patient is a nonsmoker and denied any personal or family history of bleeding or thrombotic disorders.\nUpon examination, her abdomen was nontender, nondistended, and without any palpable masses. The rest of the physical examination including inspection of surgical wound, Homans' signs, and Moses' sign was negative. The pelvic examination revealed an anteverted, normal size, nontender uterus, without any adnexal tenderness or palpable masses.

The event had been investigated by two different gastroscopies, a colonoscopy and a MDCT, which produced inconclusive results. Ten months later he was newly admitted because of abdominal pain and fever at 38.0 C\u00b0, with valid urination and defecation. A CT of the abdomen was performed, which confirmed the colonic diverticulosis and revealed the presence of multiple diverticula of the small intestine, fat stranding, signs of inflammation as well as a small amount of free liquid in the abdomen. The patient was hence diagnosed with jejunal diverticulitis and managed conservatively with intra-venous antibiotics, with an apparent complete recovery.\nHe re-presented to the emergency department two months later with acute abdominal pain. The pain was described as severe and constant, localized mainly in the lower abdomen with clinical signs of peritonitis. No change in bowel habits nor urinary symptoms were complained. His vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C\u00b0; he appeared fully oriented and not in any acute distress. Laboratory examination reported a hemoglobin of 121 g/dL, a WBC count of 12.2 \u00d7 10E9/L and a CRP of 249 mg/L. Other laboratory data were within normal limit. An abdominal and pelvic contrast-enhanced computed tomography, with administration of oral contrast, was performed.

She was on warfarin after aortic valve replacement surgery with a mechanical prosthesis for 26 years and in the state of right hemiplegia due to subacute subdural hematoma for 2 years. One year ago, multiple bullous lesions occurred on whole body, and the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid was made after skin biopsy. The bullous lesions had never been hemorrhagic, and they had been well controlled with prednisolone 20 mg once a day and methotrexate 10 mg a week. Upon examination, she had a large hematoma on right buttock area and laboratory test revealed low hemoglobin, 7.1 g/dL and prolonged prothrombin time, >120 seconds, <10%, >17.8 international normalized ratio (INR). One week before visiting our hospital, generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurred and valproic acid was started by a neurologist. Because there was possibility of drug interaction between warfarin and valproic acid as a cause of increased prothrombin time, valproic acid discontinued. In addition, fresh-frozen plasma and vitamin K were administered and prothrombin level was normalized.\nOn the 10th day of hospitalization, enoxaparin sodium (40 mg every 12 hours by subcutaneous injection) was started for anticoagulation. Three days after starting enoxaparin therapy the patient developed several tense hemorrhagic bullae on distant sites: the right forearm, the dorsum of the right hand and the left foot. The most severe lesion was on the right forearm (), 2 days later, bleeding occurred due to a rupture of hemorrhagic bulla (). The patient was referred to an allergist. Bullous hemorrhagic dermatosis related to enoxaparin use was suspected. Enoxaparin was stopped from that day and readministrated with caution 4 days later after improvement of the hemorrhagic bullae because of the high risk of thromboembolic event due to the artificial valve and previously too prolonged prothrombin level. However, as hemorrhagic bulla worsened again, enoxaparin was discontinued. Methylprednisolone 40",

Any contact with the upper eyelid could lead to pain outbreak. Apart from the allodynia on the skin of upper eyelid, no abnormality was found in neurological examinations. Also, the ophthalmologic exams including funduscopy, intraocular pressure, visual field testing was normal. The head CT and MRI scan were also normal. The patient had no history of surgical operation and trauma, no history of diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, chronic heart diseases, hepatitis, and some other relevant chronic diseases. The patient was diagnosed as primary TN.\nThe treatment was initiated by oral carbamazepine. The pain could be relieved by carbamazepine 200 mg daily at first. Gradually increasing dose of carbamazepine was reported during the medication period. About 2 weeks prior to the treatment, the pain could not be controlled by carbamazepine 800 mg daily, and dizziness and vertigo developed simultaneously.\nPeripheral branch neurolysis was planned. Firstly, right supraorbital nerve block was implemented as a diagnostic test.

Ten minutes later, hypoaesthesia in the skin of the forehead instead of the upper eyelid was observed, and the pain continues. This result indicated that supraorbital nerve was not involved. Then, diagnostic blocks to lacrimal, infratrochlear and supratrochlear nerves were successively performed.

His symptoms were not accompanied by any other ocular symptoms. The patient had no relevant family history or prior ophthalmological problems or head trauma/injury. He had no significant medical history, including diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and no history of smoking. He had been treated with clomiphene citrate 100 mg for 2 wk for infertility issues. The patient presented with a sudden decrease of visual acuity in the right eye on the 14 day of taking the treatment and subsequently developed complete loss of inferior visual field in a few days. He had no history of other medicine or herbal intake.\nAt initial presentation, his best-corrected visual acuity was 6/20 in the right and 20/20 in the left eyes, with a right relative afferent pupillary defect and decreased red color saturation.

He underwent total 9 cardiac surgeries including Bentall operation, total arch and descending thoracic aorta replacement with tricuspid and mitral annuloplasty. Among these surgeries, two were performed for treating graft infection with abscess formation and the other surgeries were performed for repair of aortic dissection. The serial chest computed tomography (CT) scans showed that the diameter of PsA was increased from 30 mm to 33 mm in a year and that it was located just below the left main coronary arterial opening (). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed communicating flow across the PsA. Through the preoperative meeting among pediatric cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and anesthesiologists, percutaneous intervention was chosen for the treatment of this patient because surgical repair was expected to carry a very high risk.\nOn arrival at the hybrid operating room, anesthesia was induced using thiopental rocuronium bromide. Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane in a mixture of oxygen and medical air. After anesthesia induction and orotracheal intubation was performed, a TEE (iE33 xMATRIX Echocardiography system, Philips, NV, USA) probe was placed and continuous TEE monitoring was performed during the whole procedure by well-experienced cardiac anesthesiologists. Pre-procedural intraoperative TEE examination showed good left ventricular contractility with mild aortic and mitral regurgitation and the location of PsA, adjacent to the aorto-mitral junction and it was communicating with the LVOT ().

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, which was interpreted as right-sided pneumonia with right parapneumonic effusion. He was sent to his local emergency department, where he was admitted for antibiotics and thoracentesis, the latter which demonstrated the presence of atypical mesothelial cells with inflammatory cells. He was readmitted two weeks later for progressive thoracic pain, was found to have a recurrent right-sided pleural effusion, and was managed with partial right pleurectomy with pleural biopsy, and talc pleurodesis. Right pleural pathology demonstrated atypical mesothelial proliferation at the pleural surface, without true invasion or definitive pathologic evidence of malignancy. Following surgery, he felt substantially better, such that he could sleep in the bed again, and he was able to return to his baseline activity levels. He underwent repeat chest CT five months later, which showed right pleural thickening and a small loculated pleural effusion, favored to represent a combination of calcification, pleurodesis, and atelectasis. He remained clinically well for another five months until he presented with cough and sinus congestion unrelieved by guaifenesin, dextromethorphan, and antibiotics. He underwent repeat chest CT that showed extensive mass-like pleural thickening completely encasing the right lung, with prominent involvement of the mediastinal pleura, and probable mediastinal extension into the right paratracheal and precarinal space, with pericardial effusion and probable pericardial metastases.

Tracheal extubation was done after 36 h of mechanical ventilation. Before tracheal extubation, the baby was comfortable, generating about 5 ml/kg tidal volume on synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation with a backup respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.3, and a pressure support of 8 cmH2O. As the arterial blood gas reports were satisfactory on these settings, tracheal extubation was done, and within a short span of time, the child had complete left lung collapse. This did not improve despite administration of high-flow humidified oxygen-enriched air through a nasal cannula that was delivered at a rate of 2 L/kg. This flow through the nasal cannula was to generate a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of about 5\u20136 cmH2O. The lung collapse was attributed to paresis of the left dome of the diaphragm as ultrasound of the chest suggested decreased diaphragmatic movements although they were not paradoxical.\nFollowing tracheal reintubation, fiber-optic bronchoscopy was performed, which showed left bronchial obstruction due to external compression [ and ]. The fiber-optic bronchoscope was advanced beyond the obstruction, and it was found that the bronchial lumen was patent with no significant secretions or mucus plugging. On withdrawal of the bronchoscope, posterior indentation of the left main bronchus was seen in the form of transmitted pulsations from the aorta [].

Antenatal ultrasound done at 28 weeks detected polyhydramnios and foetal anomaly, where a huge mass of mixed cystic and solid echogenicity was detected arising from the left side of his face, measuring more than 10 cm in its maximum dimension. The baby was born by Caesarian section after foetal distress was detected. He developed respiratory distress at birth which required intubation and assisted ventilation.\nPhysical examination revealed a large spherical mass at the left cheek measuring approximately 8 cm x 10 cm in size. There was significant displacement of his mouth to the right, his nose superiorly and his left eye superolaterally, due to the sheer size of the mass (). The overlying skin appeared healthy, with no ulceration or discolouration. On superficial palpation, the mass had a mixed soft to hard consistency. There was a haemangioma measuring 3 cm x 1 cm in size over his right nipple. Further examination showed that the other systems were normal. Maturity scoring of the baby was appropriate for age. The differential diagnoses from physical examination included teratoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET) and embryonal sarcoma.\nHaemoglobin, white blood cell count and platelets were normal. Serum \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) measured 56852 IU (normal 0-8 IU) and \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2 hCG) 14 IU (normal <10 mIU). The high levels were in keeping with a teratoma. A plain radiograph of the face and skull showed a wide opened oral cavity, poorly developed left temporomandibular joint and calcifications within the large soft tissue density mass ().

This tumor was classified as cT3N0M0, or subtype I, according to the Bismuth classification. A surgical resection was performed with Whipple\u2019s duodenocephalic pancreatectomy. Two years later, he presented with postprandial pain, and he had lost approximately 20 kg in 1 year. These symptoms were found to be associated with recurrence in the liver and lung. The patient began chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine (cisplatin at a dose of 30 mg/m2 and gemcitabine at 1,000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, respectively, every 3 weeks). Given the excellent therapeutic response after nine courses, the patient continued monotherapy with gemcitabine alone. Despite the stability of persistent lesions in the liver and lymph nodes, this medication was discontinued, due to the appearance of a discrete pulmonary infiltrate, which suggested gemcitabine toxicity. At the 5-month follow-up examination, the patient reported pain around his left shoulder without any other symptoms. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed an increase in the size of a lung nodule. F18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT confirmed recurrence of the cholangiocarcinoma. Moreover, there were two other suspicious lesions: one was in the anterior portion of the vertebral body of L2 and the other was located intramedullary at the C4 level (Figure ). When the patient returned to learn the results, he reported that, within the last 36 h, he had developed a motor deficit in his left arm. The pain in the upper part of the left shoulder had also persisted.

Pain was of moderate intensity and localized to right iliac fossa without any shifting, radiation or referral. Fever was low-grade 99\u00b0F to 100\u00b0F without chills and rigors. He had 2 episodes of nonbilious vomiting immediately after forced feeding by mother. His bowel and bladder habits were normal. There was no past history of similar attacks. He had not undergone any surgical intervention before nor had any contact history with tuberculosis, drug intake or significant medical or surgical disorder. He was taking oral antibiotics and analgesics from their family physician.\nOn examination, the baby had fever of 100\u00b0F and tachycardia. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness with guarding in right iliac fossa.\nBlood investigations revealed leukocytosis (12,000/cc) with neutrophilia (85%). Rest of blood and urine investigations was normal. His X-ray abdomen was also normal. However, ultrasonography of abdomen was reported as acute appendicitis with inflammatory mass formation measuring 6.1 cm \u00d7 1.4 cm and minimal collection at right iliac fossa along with mesenteric lymphadenopathies. The appendix was not visualized sonologically. It was the mass formation that was interpreted as appendicular lump due to its position.\nWith the provisional diagnosis of appendicular lump, the baby was managed conservatively with intravenous antibiotics, intravenous fluids and bowel rest for 1 week. However, due to the persistence of pain in spite of the conservative management laparoscopic appendectomy under general anesthesia was planned after 1 week.\nOn laparoscopy omentum was seen in right iliac fossa.

His past medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and nerve impingement of his left shoulder. On physical examination, a mass was noted on the left side of his neck just superior to the sternoclavicular joint measuring 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1 cm. He had ptosis and miosis of his left eye. His speech was hoarse, indicative of recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement. His breath sounds were decreased and coarse at the left apex. The strength of his extremities exhibited 3/5 weakness in his left arm, with the remainder of his limbs normal. There was positive muscle atrophy of his left upper extremity. Otherwise, the remainder of the physical examination was benign in nature.\nAn ultrasound performed on the neck mass showed an ill-defined heterogeneous mass lateral to his left thyroid lobe, resulting in mild mass effect. Further investigation was warranted with radiological studies including chest X-rays and a computed tomography (CT) scan of his chest. A chest X-ray exhibited a mass extending from the hilum of his left lung with gross deviation of his trachea and elevation of his hemidiaphragm. A CT scan of his chest showed a large multiloculated pleural-based mass in his lungs surrounding his left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery, which interfaced broadly with the aortic arch and extended into the left neuroforamina of C4/C5 through T1/T2 (Fig. ).\nPercutaneous needle core biopsy was performed on his neck and showed fibrohistiocytic tissue with mild chronic inflammation but was negative for malignancy. A left thoracotomy with biopsy was performed of the pleura",

Serum creatinine level was within normal range at that time and therefore the anti-GBM antibody was not tested. The first renal biopsy revealed mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with fibro-cellular crescents in one out of 18 glomeruli, excluding one global sclerotic glomerulus (Fig. ), and deposition of IgA and C3 in mesangial areas by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. ). Weak but significant IgG deposition was also observed in glomeruli in the distribution somewhat different from IgA or C3 (Fig. ). The electron-dense deposits were observed in mesangial areas by electron microscopy. Therefore, the diagnosis was IgA nephropathy. Antihypertensive therapy was initiated, mainly with an RAS inhibitor. Eight months later, the patient\u2019s serum creatinine suddenly rose to 4.53 mg/dL (it was 1.04 mg/dL from the routine blood test 1 month before). Urinalysis showed 100 red blood cells per high power field and urinary protein excretion of 12.3 g/gCr (Fig. ). The serological tests that were performed to differentiate the cause of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis revealed the presence of anti-GBM antibody at the titer of 116 IU/mL and the absence of anti-nuclear antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. Laboratory findings on admission are summarized in the Table .\nAfter admission, treatments with hemodialysis, plasma exchange, and intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by oral prednisolone at the dose of 50 mg/day were initiated. The second renal biopsy was performed at 4 weeks after admission in order to assess the probability of renal recovery and to make the final diagnosis. It revealed cellular to fibrocellular crescents in 18 of 25 glomeruli, excluding six global sclerotic glomeruli by light microscopy. By immunofluorescence study, linear IgG deposition along the glomerular capillary walls and mesangial staining for IgA were observed. On the other hand, C",
