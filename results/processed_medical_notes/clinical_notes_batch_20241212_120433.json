He had been admitted to the hospital for the complaint of pruritus in January 2012, while he was on routine follow-up for hypothyroidism but otherwise healthy. In March 2012, he had been hospitalized in general surgery department for further investigation upon findings of elevated liver enzymes and hyperbilirubinemia on laboratory tests (). No pancytopenia or bicytopenia was observed during the clinical course and ferritin levels were mildly elevated (not listed). Briefly, based on magnetic resonance cholangiogram findings suggestive of Klatskin tumor (), following first percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography for drainage, he underwent cholecystectomy + T tube drainage + choleduct exploration, while no evidence of tumor was detected. Given that laboratory findings consistent with cholestasis persisted after surgery, an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed, while revealing no bile duct obstruction or extrahepatic causes of cholestasis. Therefore, one month later the patient was referred to our department of internal medicine without any established diagnosis.\nOn admission to our department, physical examination findings revealed body temperature of 38.2\u00b0C along with 1 \u00d7 2 cm left inguinal lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly.

The patient had similar episodes infrequently for 3 consecutive years and had multiple changes in the antiepileptic medication regimen under the care of a neurologist, after which she was seizure-free for 1 year.\nIn 2017, she had another episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure and she was referred to the neurosurgery outpatient department (OPD). MRI showed similar cranial findings to those seen in the 2011 scan, with cervical cord syrinx at the C2 and C3 levels (). The patient reported no high cervical cord or posterior fossa symptoms. Considering the presence of a Chiari I malformation with a large syrinx, the patient was advised to undergo posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty, but the patient was not willing to do so and was lost to follow-up.\nThe patient returned to our OPD after 1 year (in 2018) and was willing to undergo surgery. The patient had been asymptomatic for syrinx/Chiari malformation since her index visit. A cervical spine MRI was ordered according to the routine preoperative imaging protocol. To our surprise, MRI showed persistent tonsillar herniation, as seen in 2017, but no syrinx in the cervical cord (). We retrospectively reviewed all the radiological investigations and found a fissure in the substance of the spinal cord anterior to the syrin",

Her medical records showed that she had been diagnosed with neonatal withdrawal syndrome, which required long term treatment with phenobarbital. At the outpatient center, she had been diagnosed with repeated bronchiolitis and she needed health care services from a pediatric pulmonologist, who prescribed treatment with fluticasone. She had no other relevant medical or pathological background.\nMedical records informed us that the child's mother had a medical history of substance-related disorders and she was receiving treatment for heroin dependence with methadone. No other pharmacological treatment was prescribed for cannabis and tobacco abuse.\nWhen attending our department, the mother presented an unhealthy aspect and abnormal behavior. A physical examination of the child showed a minor asthma attack with respiratory difficulties and clinical features refractory to the outpatient bronchodilator treatment (salbutamol) over the past 15 days. The examination also revealed use of her accessory muscles for respiration, wheezing and bilateral hypoventilation. Her blood oxygen saturation level was 98% and cyanosis was not observed. Her vital signs revealed tachycardia and tachypnea without fever (her heart rate was 148 beats per minute, her respiratory rate, 60 breaths per minute and temperature 36\u00b0C). A neurological examination did not show a focal neurological deficit (15/15 Glasgow Score Scale) and the remainder of the physical examination was normal. The child received respiratory support and pharmacological treatment with gradual clinical improvement. Her blood cell count and serum biochemistry were normal. Under suspicion of exposure to drugs of abuse, urinary toxicology screening for commonly used drugs of abuse by cloned enzyme donor immunoassay (CEDIA, Microgenics, Barcelona, Spain) was done.

The pain was intermittent over the 48 h and felt similar to the pain he experienced in a prior episode of pleurisy. It did not localize to any specific region of the chest and did not involve the left arm. It was partially relieved with NSAID use and resting on his left side. The patient had a 30 pack year smoking history as well as a history of illicit drug use. He had history of hypertension that was controlled with lifestyle changes and did not show any signs of end organ damage. The previous clinic visits showed his blood pressure to be under control and on admission it was 100/78. A review of systems and physical examination did not show any signs of paresthesias, numbness, weakness, or ataxia. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurologic physical exams were normal. The patient was given nitroglycerin and fentanyl, which eased the pain. Because of both his history of smoking and hypertension as well as his clinical presentation, a chest X-ray, EKG, and blood work-up including troponin I and D-dimer were performed which returned normal results.\nDue to high suspicion for coronary ischemia and other cardiac etiologies related to his history of smoking, hypertension, and illicit drug use, the patient was admitted to further investigate his chest pain. At this point, his pain was completely resolved with fentanyl. As part of expanding the differential diagnosis for chest pain, to rule out pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection, a CT angiogram of the chest was performed and revealed a 4.4 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2.1 cm soft-tissue mass compressing the spinal cord at the level of T8-T9.

She had no history of migraine headaches or cardiac diseases. She had never smoked cigarettes, never had high blood pressure, and never been overweight. Her only medication was 20 mg sinvastatin once a day, and her last lipid profile, and all blood tests were normal. Except for the large varicose veins in her left lower limb, physical examination was normal, including normal peripheral pulses and absence of bruits. The patient was treated in the Trendelenburg position with a total of 10 ml of 3% polidocanol foam via direct punctures, 5 mL into an 8 mm diameter great saphenous vein and 5 mL into large collaterals in the leg. Foam was prepared with a 1:4 ratio of liquid to room air, using the Tessari technique involving 40 passes of agitation through a three-way stopcock using one 5 mL syringe and one 3 mL syringe. With ultrasound guidance, foam was injected immediately after each of three preparations, 5 mL, 2.5 mL, and 2.5 mL. No air boluses occurred. Ultrasound scanning showed no foam in the deep venous system. The patient remained lying down for 10 minutes after the injections, before being discharged wearing compression stockings. Less than 1 hour after leaving hospital, impairment of speech capacity was observed. She encountered difficulties when she tried to talk, with incomplete and incomprehensible words. No other alterations were noted. She was taken to another hospital, where the clinical presentation was misdiagnosed as an allergic reaction.

Thirteen years ago, she has experienced sudden hearing loss in the right ear. The hearing threshold of the right ear was 80 dB HL, and speech discrimination score was 40%. MRI results showed normal inner ear structures. After oral prednisolone medication, low tone hearing impairment was improved up to 40 dB HL (). During 13 years of follow up, there was no episode of hearing fluctuation or dizziness, she only complained of intermittent tinnitus.

MRI scans were performed to rule out a retrocochlear lesion, and showed strong signal intensity in the right vestibule, especially on the pre-contrast T1-weighted image () and also maintaining on the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image (). The signal intensity was equally high in both labyrinth and vestibule on the enhanced T2-weighted image (). This signal change was confined to the right vestibule and semicircular canals and right cochlea appeared normal. These radiologic findings supported the diagnosis of ILH and the patient was prescribed to stop aspirin in order to reduce the risk of ongoing hemorrhagic condition in the labyrinth. Also, high dose prednisolone (60 mg/day) was added.\nThe hearing threshold was same after 6 months later and the results of coagulation test, antinuclear antibody test and rheumatoid factor test were within normal range. Because the follow-up hearing did not show any improvement, a cochlear implantation was performed after 22 months since second onset of sudden hearing loss.

    "original_text": "A 7-week-old healthy female infant was admitted to an outside hospital with vomiting of two-week duration along with poor feeding and cold extremities noticed by her parents on the day of admission.\nAn initial diagnosis of SVT with left bundle branch block was made []. There was no evidence of either pre-excitation or non-conducted P waves on the electrocardiogram during brief periods of sinus rhythm, suggesting that it was due to an AV node-dependent mechanism. The presence of P waves suggested that it was likely due to a concealed accessory pathway []. The SVT briefly responded to multiple administrations of adenosine with immediate recurrence. Electrical cardioversion was not attempted because it was clear that \u201cconversion\u201d to sinus rhythm was not the limiting factor for this patient, and that the focus needed to be on the maintenance of sinus rhythm. Therefore, she was started on an esmolol infusion, after which she developed hypotension. At the same time, she was noted to have metabolic acidosis. At this point, she was intubated, started on mechanical ventilation, and transferred to our centre for further management.\nDuring transport esmolol infusion was discontinued secondary to bradycardia and hypotension and with this, the SVT recurred. Upon arrival at our institution, the esmolol infusion was restarted, but she again developed hypotension with bradycardia; therefore, it was discontinued and an amiodarone bolus of 5 mg/kg was given IV over 60 minutes.

She was noted to have irregular breathing that alarmed the mother who was sleeping next to her. She called for help and the brother then tried to wake her up but she was not arousable. According to the account, she was sweating profusely and had labored breathing. She spontaneously started breathing normally and started coming around. At this point, she felt very weak, experienced nausea and vomiting, and felt like her \u201cstomach was upset\u201d. Her post-event recovery was less than five minutes. She was brought to the hospital. She is a nurse by profession and was doing her normal ward duties and reports no remarkable event in her history that would have suggested volume loss or prolonged hemodynamic stress. Her examination was unremarkable and there was no postural drop in blood pressure (BP). She was admitted under neurology; her blood and electrolyte work-up was normal and she underwent a complete neurological work-up.

    "original_text": "The patient is a 50 year old male who received a LURT 8 years prior to presentation. He had previously undergone bilateral native nephrectomies 2 months prior to transplant for PKD. His early course was complicated by biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection, vascular type, 5 days after transplant, which was effectively treated with anti-thymocyte globulin and intravenous immunoglobulin. He subsequently went on to enjoy excellent graft function. Initially, he was maintained on standard triple immunosuppression with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and prednisone.\nTwo years prior to presentation, he developed numerous squamous cell carcinomas of the skin treated with resection and radiation. One of these lesions was an invasive poorly differentiated SCC (Bowen\u2019s type) of the left auricle, requiring auriculectomy and reconstruction. Tumor margins were negative. His immunosuppression was reduced by stopping his MMF.\nOne year prior to presentation he developed a parotid mass found to be SCC by fine needle aspiration. It was felt that this was a metastatic lesion from the auricular tumor. At this time, he was switched from a dual immunosuppressive regimen of tacrolimus and prednisone to sirolimus (SRL) and prednisone. He underwent a left parotidectomy and neck dissection with pathology showing invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated. The tumor was 4.6 cm with lymphovascular and perineural invasion. Surgical margins were negative, but 5 out of 23 periparotid and cervical LNs were positive for metastasis with focal extranodal extension. He underwent radiation therapy and cetuximab. A surveillance PET CT performed 6 months after treatment revealed 5 bilateral pulmonary nodules, which grew over 2 months from 6 mm to 10 mm.

Thompsons test and Matles test was positive. X-ray of the left ankle anteroposterior and lateral view showed no bony injury, the local ultrasound showed TA tear near the tendon insertion (1 cm of the stump was present at insertion) with a defect of 3.5 cm between the two torn edges of the tendon.\nThe patient was operated in prone position under tourniquet, the Achilles tendon was exposed using posteromedial incision extending up to 1 cm below the calcaneal insertion (). Paratenon was carefully incised and the sural nerve was identified and retracted. Tendon ends were debrided to remove calcifications. The prominent posterosuperior calcaneal tuberosity was excised using the small osteotome. FHL was dissected by protecting the neurovascular bundle (). The FHL tendon was pulled up as far as possible with simultaneous plantar flexion of the ankle and first toe and was transected at the level of the calcaneum.

Thereafter, she continued with moderate aortic stenosis and insufficiency resulting in progressive left ventricular dilation and dysfunction, ultimately necessitating OHT at 14 years of age. Prior to OHT, magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated an ascending aorta aneurysm measuring approximately 5.5 cm, with a second aneurysm in the isthmus region. In addition, significant tortuosity was present in the head and neck vessels. As a result of the aortic vasculopathy, the aortic arch was replaced with a branched Dacron aortic arch graft at the time of OHT. During the aortic arch surgery, the branch graft was sized to fit the tortuous neck vessels, dilated descending aorta, and the donor ascending aorta. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was noted to have diminished pulses in the lower extremities. An urgent catheterization demonstrated an acute angulation of the distal aortic graft to descending aorta anastomosis believed to be the etiology of the pulse findings. As a result, the patient was taken back to the operating room where plication of the graft was performed. The patient convalesced and was discharged 3 weeks post-OHT after repeat catheterization demonstrated no evidence of aortic obstruction. Five days after discharge, the patient presented with the upper extremity weakness, ptosis, and asymmetric pupils. A CT angiogram demonstrated dissection of the descending aorta from the level of the aortic isthmus to the renal arteries with scattered intramural hematomas along the thoracic aorta []. The risk of surgical intervention was deemed so great as to preclude attempted surgery, and she was placed on a \u03b2-blockade infusion.

He was apparently well 7 weeks back and experienced headache, faintishness and vomiting at 2 am while doing a night shift in his work place. After the patient has lost consciousness and become unresponsive. The following day morning, other workers who came for the morning shift found him drowsy and less responsive and took him to the nearest hospital after 6 hours of initial symptoms. On admission, his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 9/15 and there were no any focal neurological signs. He was haemodynamically stable and respiratory examination was normal with normal pulse- oximeter finding. He continued to have vomiting and diarrhoea over the next 48 h. His full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), liver and renal profiles were normal. He was treated with 6 L of oxygen via a face mask and was managed as food poisoning.

    "original_text": "An 88-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our orthopedic unit following a simple trip on the stairs leading to a locked knee at an 80\u00b0 angle. In the fall, the quadriceps muscles were forcefully contracted on her bent knee. Prior to the incident, she was independently mobile with the use of a stick. Her medical history included osteoarthritis affecting both knees and mild, generalized, right-sided weakness following a subdural hemorrhage secondary to an RTA. The physical examination of her right knee revealed a closed injury with minimal swelling. We noted a tender, inferiorly displaced patella. Her range of movement of the knee was 80\u00b0to 115\u00b0 with a definite block to extension.\nThe initial plain radiographs of her flexed knee revealed inferior displacement of the patella (Figure ).\nUnder patient sedation, the patient\u00b9s patellar swelling was reduced by hyperflexing the knee, placing downward pressure on the inferior pole of the patella, and then slowly extending her leg. Her knee was then placed in a camp splint and allowed to mobilize. The following day the patient was able to raise and straighten her leg with a relatively pain-free range of movement of the knee and was able to mobilize independently on the ward. While in the hospital, she was unable to tolerate the splint and abandoned it. Her knee then locked again following flexion past 90\u00b0. A computed tomography scan of her right knee was performed, which showed a superior patellar osteophyte embedded in the lateral femoral condyle (Figure ).\nThe patient's knee was examined while she was under general anesthesia. When her knee was flexed past 90\u00b0, the patella locked into the lateral femoral condyle.

Histopathological examination of the resected mass was reported as angiofibroma. After remaining asymptomatic for 5 months, the patient presented with the similar complaints as before for duration of one month. The patient was now evaluated in our multidisciplinary clinic by a team of head and neck surgeon, radiation oncologist, and a medical oncologist. Physical examination revealed swelling of 8 \u00d7 6 cm size over the left cheek involving the nasolabial fold. There was no abnormality seen on the overlying skin. No sensory deficit was seen in the region of the trigeminal nerve distribution. Oral cavity examination revealed a polypoidal friable mass lesion arising from the left upper alveolus. A similar mass lesion was seen filling the left nasal cavity. A bulge was seen in the region of the hard palate with prominent overlying vessels. The patient did not have any signs of neurofibromatosis.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the PNS and neck was performed which revealed an ill-defined soft-tissue mass lesion in the left maxillary sinus. The lesion showed isointense and hyperintense appearance on T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively. A few hypointense areas were noted in the mass lesion suggestive of spicules of destroyed bone.

Physical examination was significant for a 5-mm open wound of the mandible, slightly to the right of the midline of his chin (Fig ). The area was tender and a small amount of murky fluid was expressed. The wound probed to bone, using a sterile hemostatic clamp. There was no palpable regional lymphadenopathy. Computed tomography revealed a large bony cavity eroding through the inferior cortex of the mandibular symphysis anteriorly and abutting the lingual cortex.

    "original_text": "A 43-year-old female was admitted to our hospital complaining of numbness in the left limb for one week. Past medical history was notable for the diagnosis of NMO and intracranial hemorrhage. The patient was diagnosed with NMO ten years ago due to repeated episodes of blurred vision and numbness and weakness in the limbs. Brain and spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at that time indicated lesions in the brain white matter as well as spinal cord involving cervical and thoracic regions. AQP4 antibody test was not performed. Considering the potential diagnosis of demyelinating disease, steroid pulse therapy was initiated and the patient improved after the treatment. After discharge, corticosteroid was gradually tapered and the patient was maintained at a low-dose corticosteroid and azathioprine in the long term. The patient was also diagnosed with left basal ganglia hemorrhage three years ago, presenting as right-sided hemiplegia and confusion. Brain angiography was not performed at that time, and the patient recovered after symptomatic treatment. Family members exhibited no sign of the case pathology. Upon examination, the patient appeared lethargic and sluggish, with normal vital signs. Visual acuity was impaired in the right eye with a score of 20/200 on testing. Pupils were 3 mm bilaterally, round and reactive. Regarding motor function, muscle strength was decreased in the left extremities (Medical Research Council strength score, grade 3). Hypoesthesia of the left side was also observed. Babinski sign was present bilaterally. Further investigations revealed a positive AQP4 antibody in the serum, with an elevated titer of 1:32. An initial diagnosis of NMOSD was made considering her medical history and radiological findings. Other tests including complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, serum glucose, and anti-nuclear antibodies were all normal.

Regarding prior diagnoses, the patient was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder in early childhood after neuropsychiatric testing and held this diagnosis when he was first evaluated by our psychiatrists in his 20s. Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder was also diagnosed prior to hospitalization based on his rigid routine and only eating prepacked foods. The diagnosis of schizophrenia was made in the months prior to hospitalization as the patient developed paranoia and isolation over the previous 6 years, with a significant decline in executive, social, and occupational function over the last year. In high school, he was noted to be social and cheerful, and he gradually became more isolated and withdrawn, stopped using technological devices such as a TV or phone, and had a 70 lb weight loss over 1 year as a result of eating only small portions of prepackaged food from a particular store and skipping dinner.

He recalls being struck by a heavy object on the posterior aspect of a flexed elbow as someone was attempting to pull him away from the situation by the arm. This was an isolated injury. There was some paraesthesia in the median nerve distribution initially, but this settled after reduction. He had no sensory or motor deficits of the median, radial or ulnar nerves.\nHe had no significant medical history, and had no personal or family history of connective tissue disorders or hypermobility.\nA radiograph was performed on presentation (Figure ). This showed an anterior dislocation of the left elbow, with no obvious periarticular fractures. The dislocation was reduced under sedation in the ED. The maneuver used to achieve this reduction was applying traction at the flexed elbow while an assistant held the humerus stable, before posteriorly translating the forearm and flexing the elbow. There was no obvious clunk during reduction, but the clinical deformity resolved. He was placed in an above elbow backslab in a flexed position and X-ray confirmed that the elbow was reduced. He was admitted under the orthopedic team while CT and MRI were being arranged.\nOn Day 1 postadmission the patient started to complain of increasing pain, and his elbow was found to have re-dislocated while being in the backslab. At this stage he underwent closed reduction with the aid of a full general anesthetic and muscle relaxant, as well as an examination under anesthesia (EUA). During EUA the elbow was found to be highly unstable and dislocated if extended past 100 degrees. The elbow was very unstable on valgus stressing, with no firm end point of medial collateral ligaments. The patient was placed in an above elbow cast, flexed to 80 degrees, until further imaging",

An angiogram showed the entry point of the misplaced catheter in his proximal right subclavian artery, just beyond the origin of his right vertebral artery (Figure ). An angiogram of his right vertebral artery revealed a dominant vessel with prominent spinal arterial feeders.

She also had a painless lump on her sternum. The lesion in the scalp had been growing during the past 4 months, and the lesion on the sternum had been present for the past 2 months. She denied any head or thorax trauma history. Her medical history was unremarkable except for warfarin therapy due to atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Her neurological examination was intact, and the infection markers were negative. The patient was referred to the neurosurgery outpatient clinic. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lesion in the right temporoparietal area which caused local bone erosion.

On physical examination, there was lateral joint line tenderness, and 40 cc of bloody discharge was aspirated by hemarthrosis. The patient was a courier driver, and he had no history of alcohol or tobacco use. There were no underlying diseases such as hypertension or diabetes. The patient's height was 180 cm, his weight was 118 kg, and his body mass index (BMI) was 36.4, which was class III obesity.[ On magnetic resonance imaging, a lateral meniscus flap tear was observed, and surgery was scheduled. The operation was performed with tourniquet inflation up to 300 mm Hg under general anesthesia. The patient's obesity was so severe that it was not easy to secure the joint space, and the operation took longer than expected. Tourniquet time was 62 minutes and total operation time was 80 minutes. A complex meniscal tear with horizontal and radial tears from the mid body to the posterior horn was observed (Fig. ), and repair was performed after marginal debridement using both inside-out and all-inside techniques (Fig. ). The patient had no comorbidities other than high BMI, no vascular diseases, and did not take antithrombotic drugs or hormones. None of his family members had a history of VTE. After surgery, a long leg splint was applied, and a nonweight bearing position was maintained. Straight leg-raising exercises were performed from the day after surgery to strengthen the quadriceps muscle.

Clinical and radiological examination revealed an atypical subtrochanteric fracture of her right femur. She had a history of tibia fracture when she was twenty years old and treated by intramedullary nail. The patient was of short stature (138 cm) with typical facial features due to micrognathia, abnormal dentition, and a prominent nose. She had no abdominal organomegaly and denied consanguinity in her parents.\nLaboratory investigations revealed no evidence of systemic, metabolic, or endocrine disorder. Her blood count and blood chemistry were normal. Other bone turnover markers, such as bone ALP and N-terminal telopeptide, were also normal.\nRadiographs of the right femur confirmed a noncomminuted, transverse subtrochanteric fracture with both lateral and medial cortical thickening, but without obliteration of the medullary canal, consistent with radiologic features of an atypical subtrochanteric femoral fracture [] (). Pelvic views demonstrated asymptomatic stress fracture in the left femur that involved the lateral cortex. A subsequent skeletal survey revealed cortical thickening of all long bones and an incompletely fused anterior fontanelle ().\nFor the treatment of fracture, open reduction and internal fixation with a plate and screws were performed. Drilling, particularly in the femoral neck, was quite difficult as bone was sclerotic. For the opposite sided stress fracture, prophylactic operation, an internal fixation with a plate and screws, was performed (). 10 days after operation of the left femur, fracture occurred at the distal screw and reoperation was performed using a long plate (). Fracture healed well in 3 months and then the patient was able to bear full weight.\nOne year and 4 months after operation, she was suffering from right hip pain and could not walk.

On examination, patient was moderately built, and abdominal fullness was apparent on inspection, more so in the left lower abdomen. A vague mass of approximate size of 20 \u00d7 15 cm was palpable, extending from left iliac and left hypogastrium to umbilical region, crossing the midline and reaching up to right midclavicular line at the level of iliac crest. The lump had a smooth surface, ill-defined margins and lower margin could not be reached on palpation. The lump was nontender with firm, cystic consistency, and restricted mobility in all the directions. There was no inguinal lymphadenopathy and digital rectal examination was unremarkable. Patient was further investigated for differential diagnoses of mesenteric cyst, pancreatic pseudocyst, duplication cyst, or cystic metastasis. Ultrasound abdomen showed a large cystic lesion with multiple septae, left to the urinary bladder in the pelvis. Liver, spleen, pancreas, and bilateral kidneys were within normal limits.
