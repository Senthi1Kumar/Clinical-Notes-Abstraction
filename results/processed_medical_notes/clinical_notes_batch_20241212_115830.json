He had complained of this neuropathic pain during rehabilitation since undergoing a craniotomy 9 years ago for multiple brain injuries caused by a motorcycle accident. Several back surgeries had been performed over the past few years to correct the cause of this neuropathic pain after it was misdiagnosed as being caused by lumbar spinal lesions. However, after these spinal operations, the patient remained in pain. He was then referred to the neurosurgical department with intractable neuropathic pain. The patient was assessed by a pain specialist, and eventually was diagnosed with central neuropathic pain syndrome caused by the previous traumatic damage done to the sensory pathways of the central nervous system. Testing for SEP revealed prolonged latency in the left tibial nerve above the T12 level. Based on several published reports suggesting that SCS may effectively treat central neuropathic pain syndromes, this modality was proposed to alleviate his significant refractory pain that was resistant to various medications. To maximize pain-control effects, a 5-column Penta lead to the T9 level and a rechargeable neurostimulation system (Prodigy, Abbott, Plano, TX) were surgically placed (Fig. ), and stimulation was delivered to the patient in an alternating pattern between traditional tonic and burst waveform. For tonic stimulation, the pulse width was programmed in the range of 100 to 500 ms, with frequencies typically between 30 and 100 Hz, and at amplitudes producing comfortable paresthesia according to the patient's perception. Through the first 6 months of stimulation, the patient's pain relief was maintained at about two-thirds his prestimulation levels. However, his pain gradually returned to its prestimulation state, and about 3 years after the initial surgery, both stimuli were again used alternatingly, which resulted in about a one-third improvement in the patient's pain.

She had history of drug intoxication from a suicidal attempt 2 months prior. At that time she had been intubated and had a gastric lavage, after which she had a nasogastric feeding tube. A tracheotomy was necessary because of prolonged intubation (longer than 20 days). During the hospital stay her T-cannula was recurrently obstructed by crust and secretion and her symptoms seemed to be relieved after T-cannula change. On endoscopic examination, performed by an ENT resident, it was apparent that the right side of her vocal fold seemed to be paralyzed, and injection laryngoplasty was initially planned to solve her aspiration problem.\nOn detailed examination of her airway, however, a glottic scar band was found at the posterior glottis, which seemed to be the cause of the limited mobility of her right vocal fold (). Moreover, there was a TEF on the left posterior wall of the trachea, 1 cm above the level of tracheostoma (). We confirmed that it was a TEF by verifying leakage through the fistula on oral intake of water. Surgical intervention was planned for her problems.\nThrough an anterior cervical horizontal incision, the skin, subcutaneous fat, and platysma were elevated as one layer and the flap was raised to the level of the suprahyoid region. The sternohyoid muscles were divided in the midline and the thyroid isthmus was divided and ligated to expose the anterior surface of the trachea. The trachea was freed circumferentially only above and below the site of the fistula, and care was taken to maintain the dissection as close as possible to the outer tracheal surface, thereby avoiding injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerves and to preserve the lateral blood supply to the unresected trachea.

On history taking there were episodes of intermittent pain for the past 15 days. Pain was moderate in nature, nonradiating, aggravates on taking sweets and chewing foods, and relieves on taking medication. On clinical examination a deep carious lesion was seen with respect to 46. Exaggerated response was observed during pulp testing with electric pulp tester and lingering pain was observed with cold pulp test compared to contralateral teeth. IOPAR revealed radiolucency involving enamel, dentin, and pulp with no periapical changes in relation to 46 (). It was diagnosed as acute irreversible pulpitis. Root canal treatment was decided and explained to the patient. After securing local anesthesia (2% lignocaine, inferior alveolar nerve block on the right side) rubber dam was applied and endodontic treatment was initiated. After gaining the proper access four canals were located, two in the mesial and two in the distal. It was evident under magnification that the MB and ML were placed well apart with an isthmus joining two canals. Hence, the possibility of MM canal should be anticipated in the isthmus. On exploration with DG-16 probe, we found 2 additional canals between MB and ML (). IOPAR revealed one MM joining the MB canal and another joining the ML canal in the middle third. To confirm this we advised a CBCT of the right mandibular molar. CBCT revealed four canals in the mesial root and two canals in distal root (Figures and ). Access was refined and orifices were enlarged using orifice openers. The working length was determined with radiographic technique and apex locator (). Both the mesial and distal canals were enlarged up to the size of 25/6% taper (M two, VDW) followed by an intracanal medication with calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine was placed for 1 week.

No relevant disturbances of the menstrual cycle were referred by the patient. Physical exam showed an abdomen entirely occupied by a pelvic mass reaching the xiphoid process, which was especially evident when the patient laid supine (Fig. ).

    "original_text": "A 49-year-old female was initially referred by her GP 6 years ago with a history of intermittent abdominal pain for 2 years and iron deficiency anaemia. Abdominal pain was mild and located mainly in the centre but with some generalization throughout the abdomen. It was associated with mild nausea at times but no vomiting. She has a history of longstanding constipation, and pain would get worse during days of constipation. There was no history of weight loss. There was no other significant background history apart from some non-specific pelvic and knee joint pains for which she takes ibuprofen on and off. She does give an account of some irregular menstrual cycle but not massive bleeding. She underwent a gastroscopy, which was normal, but colonoscopy failed due to inadequate preparation. The impression was that her irregular menstrual cycle contributed to her anaemia and that she was suffering from slow-transit constipation, which resulted in poor bowel preparation.

The ulcer was tender on palpation, exhibiting irregular margins with ill-defined borders surrounded by erythematous area. Oral hygiene was poor with generalized stains and calculus. Generalized attrition was present. No limitation of mouth opening was seen. Tongue movements were within normal limits. Left submandibular lymph nodes were palpable, hard, tender, and were fixed to the underlying structures [].\nBased on the clinical features, a provisional clinical diagnosis of carcinoma of the base of the tongue was given.

His detailed medical history revealed that he had no risk factors for coronary artery disease, however, BD had been diagnosed 10 years earlier and he was on colchicine 1 mg/day. Oral aphthous ulcers were exacerbated during coronary artery events. Eye examination was normal. He had an episode of thrombophlebitis of his left leg in 2004 and had been taking warfarin but had discontinued the medication.\nMedical examination revealed blood pressure of 130/70 mmHg and heart rate of 85 beats/minute and the patient was pale and perspiring. Chest auscultation revealed no abnormalities. His electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with ST segment elevation on II, III and aVF and reciprocal ST segment depression on V1-V6. Laboratory tests showed elevation of plasma total creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and CPK-MB activities. There were no findings consistent with coagulation and fibrinolysis disorders. He was diagnosed as having an acute inferior wall myocardial infarction, therefore nitroglycerin, heparin, aspirin and beta blocker therapies were started immediately followed by thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase within 1 hour. After 40 minutes, his chest pain was relieved and there was a significant reduction of ST segment elevation along with increased cardiac enzyme levels. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild apical hypokinesia and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%.\nOn the third day of hospital admission, he underwent coronary angiography. Coronary angiography revealed an 8 mm giant aneurysm of the proximal left anterior descending artery, an 8 mm aneurysm of the proximal left circumflex coronary artery (Figure ) and a 9 mm aneurysm of the proximal right coronary artery (Figure ). Based on clinical evidence, electrocardiogram and coronary angiography, we considered that the acute myocardial infarction in our patient was due to a coronary aneurysm.

This nodular swelling was present for 3 months prior to the presentation and it gradually increased over a period of 2 months, and then it became soft and burst open one day with thick serosanguinous pus. Over a period of next one month, the discharge from this open ulcer continued and it became bigger and also extended deep into the skin involving the subcutaneous tissue. This ulcer was painless and had produced a big defect in the chest wall. He was being treated with local applications of antibiotics and oral antibiotics without much relief. There was history of intermittent fever initially for about 15 days. There were no respiratory complaints and no history of anorexia or weight loss. There was no history of tuberculosis either in childhood or adulthood. He was a nondiabetic and nonalcoholic.\nExamination showed averagely built male with BMI of 23.5, no clubbing and lymph adenopathy. Respiratory system examination was normal. Local examination revealed a large solitary oval ulcer over left lower chest in 6th intercoastal space in the midclavicular region of 6.5cms X 4.5 cm in dimensions, with undermined edges, having yellowish slough with scanty serous discharge (). The ulcer was extending deep into the skin almost to an extent of 2.5cms involving subcutaneous tissue with raised edges and had vegetations and crusts; it was slightly tender, and surrounding skin was indurated. There was no involvement of the regional lymph nodes. Tuberculosis was kept in mind in investigating this ulcer as it was progressing over a period of 3 months. His hemogram was normal, HIV and VDRL were negative. Chest radiograph was normal with no evidence of hilar adenopathy (). CT Scan of the thorax was also performed, which revealed no parenchymal infiltrations or cavity, and also there was no evidence of any mediastinal lymphadenopathy",

He underwent a subtotal gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma 7 years ago. Three months prior, he had a similar admission with anuria which required temporary hemodialysis. At that time, a computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of his abdomen revealed an atrophic right kidney, extensive intra-abdominal metastasis, and retroperitoneal involvement causing bilateral hydronephrosis. A temporary double lumen dialysis catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein for acute hemodialysis. A double J stent was placed in the left ureter. His urine volume gradually returned. The dialysis catheter was removed after 7 days. During his second admission with acute oliguric kidney injury, ultrasonography of his bilateral femoral and iliac veins revealed no stenosis or thrombus in femoral and distal iliac veins.

After consultation with her surgeon, oncologist, and radiation therapist, she underwent lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The cancer was estrogen receptor negative, and the sampled lymph nodes were negative. The tumor was estrogen and progesterone receptor positive.

The trachea was deviated to the left side and there was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Fibre-optic laryngeal examination showed reduced mobility of the right vocal cord. Blood test showed a normal blood cell count and calcium and thyroid function tests, negative thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 95 mm/hr.

Neurological examination revealed a dysdiadochokinesia on both sides, no further neurological deficits. The scalp was soft. A bone resistance was not palpable. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an extensive growing, contrast enhancing lesion expanding at the supra- and infratentorial convexity, infiltrating and destroying large parts of the skull, and infiltrating the skin (). CT scanning and 3D-reconstruction images stress out the massive destruction of the calvarian bone (Figures and ).\nA surgical procedure with the aim of complete tumor resection in a curative manner was not possible, so that a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was done to identify the arterial blood supply of the tumor. The tumor was fed by branches of both internal and external carotid arteries and additionally by the right vertebral artery. The feeding branches were embolised to induce decrease of tumor size and growth.

The results of his physical examination and laboratory tests were normal, and he did not show any verrucous lesions or pigmentation of the skin, alopecia, or onchyodystrophy.

Biopsy analysis showed that the colonic polyps and the obstructing mass were sites of chronic inflammation, and they showed no signs of malignancy. CT scans showed no evidence of malignant disease in other organs.

She had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, allergic rhinitis, and chronic lower back pain. Patient has a family history of arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus; she denies ever using alcohol or tobacco.\nWith the onset of elevated alkaline phosphatase level and vague abdominal pain in 2013, an abdominal ultrasound performed in December showed hepatic steatosis. Viral serologies for hepatitis during 2013 were negative, as a gastrointestinal consult was required to determine the need for a liver biopsy. A liver biopsy was subsequently performed, which showed focal mixed micro and macrovesicular steatosis. Portal tracts showed minimal focal chronic inflammation, no significant fibrosis, and no iron deposition.\nThe vague abdominal pain that she was experiencing waxed and waned for two years. Additionally, the patient experienced some vague chest pain and dyspnea that prompted an echocardiogram in February of 2015, which demonstrated a left ventricle ejection fraction of 44%. Consequently, a left heart catheterization in the following month showed no significant coronary disease with a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 50%. A 2-year follow-up in July of 2015 showed suspicious cirrhosis by Computed Tomography (CT) scan (), possibly due to granulomatous changes and chronic inflammation. A CT scan was determined to be necessary for our patient because of rising alkaline phosphatase without other explainable etiologies, in addition to the patient's appetite suppression and vague abdominal pains. Patient's weight during this time was 207 lbs (93.89 kg) and was advised to diet and exercise. After 4 months of continuous symptoms, especially with abdominal pain, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed with a liver biopsy that showed subsequent granulomatous changes in September of 2015.

The nodules had been present for 4 years, and the patient reported neither growth nor change of morphology over time.

Neither signs of inflammation nor local lymphadenopathy was present, and the physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. Basic laboratory investigations (including differential blood count, C-reactive protein, and liver function tests) were all within normal limits. Because the clinical presentation suggested a benign soft tissue process, imaging was dispensed under the assumption that definite diagnosis would be established by surgical excision and histological examination. Hence, the patient was referred to a plastic surgeon. On incision of the first nodule, a whitish, thin, flattened, worm-like object (\u223c0.3 \u00d7 15 cm) was pulled out. On incision of the second nodule, a morphologically similar structure was removed (). (Note: Because of the unexpected findings at incision of the first nodule, the second nodule was operated on 10 days later, after our laboratory had been consulted and a provisional diagnosis had been established.)\nBecause the findings were suspicious of a helminth, two samples (one from the first resected worm fixed in formalin and the other one from the second resected worm stored in normal saline solution) were sent to the National Reference Center for Human Parasitic Diseases at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel. Macroscopic and microscopic investigation of the sample stored in normal saline solution showed an amorphous structure exhibiting slow, undulating movements.

(note: because of the unexpected findings at incision of the first nodule, the second nodule was operated on 10 days later, after our laboratory had been consulted and a provisional diagnosis had been established.)\nbecause the findings were suspicious of a helminth, two samples (one from the first resected worm fixed in formalin and the other one from the second resected worm stored in normal saline solution) were sent to the national reference center for human parasitic diseases at the swiss tropical and public health institute in basel. macroscopic and microscopic investigation of the sample stored in normal saline solution showed an amorphous structure exhibiting slow, undulating movements. an anterior end was identified by finding an oral opening of a helminth, whereas the posterior end was disrupted. a part of the sample was embedded in paraffin and used for histological investigation,",

Viral serologies for hepatitis during 2013 were negative, as a gastrointestinal consult was required to determine the need for a liver biopsy. A liver biopsy was subsequently performed, which showed focal mixed micro and macrovesicular steatosis. Portal tracts showed minimal focal chronic inflammation, no significant fibrosis, and no iron deposition.\nThe vague abdominal pain that she was experiencing waxed and waned for two years. Additionally, the patient experienced some vague chest pain and dyspnea that prompted an echocardiogram in February of 2015, which demonstrated a left ventricle ejection fraction of 44%. Consequently, a left heart catheterization in the following month showed no significant coronary disease with a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 50%. A 2-year follow-up in July of 2015 showed suspicious cirrhosis by Computed Tomography (CT) scan (), possibly due to granulomatous changes and chronic inflammation.

On that occasion, an extensive expansive lesion bilaterally and frontally was observed, predominantly on the left side with propagation to the left temporal and left parietal lobe, measuring 90 \u00d7 80 mm (Fig. ). On 27 March 2012, a maximum tumor resection was performed. Extempore analysis of tumor tissue established that it was glioblastoma [bihemispheric glioblastoma (butterfly glioma)], and the opinion of a pathologist given a few days after the surgery suggested that it was a diffuse astrocytoma (gr II). Following the surgery, the patient was hospitalized in the radiology ward, where 3D conformal radiotherapy was performed by using a linear accelerator with a power of 6 MW. A therapeutic dose of 46 Gy was administered in 23 fractions, followed by radiation of the tumor base with a therapeutic dose of 8 Gy in 4 fractions. With this, the oncological treatment was completed. In August 2012, the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated. At an emergency MRI imaging on 23 August 2012, the progression of the tumor was established, and the dimensions were 46 \u00d7 36 mm (Fig. ). After her physician informed her about the options of tumor treatment at this stage, the patient refused further oncological treatment and applied for phytotherapy (PT) on 26 August 2012.\nStPT was introduced, and she used it in the course of following 6 months. The control MRI imaging performed 3 months after the introduction of StPT (on 21 November 2012) found that tumor progression had stopped (Fig. ); therefore, the patient continued to use the combination of herbal medicines.

Her abdominal pain has previously been attributed to underlying chronic constipation and possible irritable bowel syndrome. Workup for her abdominal pain included serologic testing for celiac disease, which showed increased anti-gliadin IgA and IgG but normal tissue transglutaminase IgA. On presentation to the emergency department, an abdominal X-ray was done due to suspicion of constipation, and a chest X-ray confirmed left lower lobe pneumonia. She was treated for presumed pneumonia with oral antibiotics. She then returned to the hospital due to persistent fevers and abdominal pain and was admitted for 5 days for intravenous antibiotics. On serial chest X-rays during the hospitalization and after discharge, she seemed to have persistent left-sided and perhilar infiltrates that remained essentially unchanged in appearance. A pediatric pulmonologist was consulted, who felt that she had no symptoms suggestive of asthma, aspirated foreign body, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia or immunodeficiency.\nA chest computed tomography (CT) scan was done that showed multiple noncalcified pulmonary nodules bilaterally, mainly peripheral in location.

His blood glucose was elevated. Liver function tests, serum amylase, bilirubin; CEA and CA 19-9 were within the normal limits. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen revealed a large mass at the region of the pancreatic head.

The tumor was surgically removed on 7 November 2013, with re-excision because of an unclear resection margin on 13 December 2013. The tumor was histologically confirmed as a leiomyosarcoma of 4 cm in size, with a mitotic rate of between 30 and 40 mitoses per 10 high-power fields. Assessment of the medical history of the patient revealed arterial hypertension (treated with a \u03b2-blocker and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), diastolic forms of heart failure with mild cardiac decompensation (treated with furosemide), hyperuricemia with intermittent gouty arthritis of the right large toe (treated with allopurinol), a struma resection in 1990, and diverticulosis of the colon. On 25 November 2013, a computed tomography (CT) of the thorax and abdomen was conducted to assess tumor staging and no metastases were identified. The case was brought to the tumor board and adjuvant radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy was recommended. Between 20 January 2014 and 28 February 2014, 60 Gy of adjuvant radiotherapy were administered, followed by 6 cycles of doxorubicin 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks between 19 March 2014 and 2 July 2014. Ten months after the end of chemotherapy, a follow-up CT revealed hepatic metastases (30 April 2015), which were confirmed as 6 liver metastases between 1 and 14 mm in size by magnetic resonance imaging on 11 May 2015. At the patient's request, oral therapy with pazopanib 800 mg once daily was administered for approximately 3.5 months between 29 May 2015 and 10 September 2015. Pazopanib was subsequently stopped due to disease progression (Fig. ). A CT of the abdomen confirmed increasing size and number of hepatic metastases.",

The patient had more than six caf\u00e9 au lait spots on the trunk and extremities, axial and inguinal freckling and several cutaneous tumors that were slightly raised above the level of the skin. The patient had no physical discomfort, no motor or sensitive deficits. The patient stated that he had been operated 2 years earlier on a tumor of the back in another hospital. More detailed information was not available. Despite this previous treatment of the tumor, the remaining tumor mass disturbed him both physically and in his self-perception. The patient stated that the tumor had been growing again since the first operation.\nOn the back there was a tumorous protrusion of the intact skin with a maximum above the spine, which extended from the lower thoracic region close to the edge of the pelvis (Figure 1 A ). The tumor was clearly prominent under tight-fitting clothing. The skin in this area was darker pigmented throughout the lumbar region and showed hirsutism. The tumor was insensitive to touch and pressure, showed no fluctuation on palpation, and the covering skin moved with the tumor.\nB-scan ultrasound revealed an inhomogeneous mass with focal, partly string-like reflections inside the space occupying lesion. Borders were poorly defined and the tumor mass reached to the spinous processes of the spine. The tumor appeared as solid mass and contained no cavities suggestive of necrosis. The tumor was resected in general anesthesia. When the lesion was exposed, a black pigmentation became apparent, which was partially arranged in a stripe-like pattern and frayed at the edges (Figure 2 ).

    "cleaned_text": "this 18-year-old male patient presented at the oral and craniomaxillofacial surgery clinic to consider surgical treatment options for reducing an enlarged tumor of the back. the patient had more than six caf\u00e9 au lait spots on the trunk and extremities, axial and inguinal freckling and several cutaneous tumors that were slightly raised above the level of the skin. the patient had no physical discomfort, no motor or sensitive deficits. the patient stated that he had been operated 2 years earlier on a tumor of the back in another hospital. more detailed information was not available. despite this previous treatment of the tumor, the remaining tumor mass disturbed him both physically and in his self-perception. the patient stated that the tumor had been growing again since the first operation.\non the back there was a tumorous protrusion of the intact skin with a maximum above the spine, which extended from the lower thoracic region close to the edge of the pelvis (figure 1 a ). the tumor was clearly prominent under tight-fitting clothing. the skin in this area was darker pigmented throughout the lumbar region and showed hirsutism. the tumor was insensitive to touch and pressure, showed no fluctuation on palpation, and the covering skin moved with the tumor.\nb-scan ultrasound revealed an inhomogeneous mass with focal, partly string-like reflections inside the space occupying lesion. borders were poorly defined and the tumor mass reached to the spinous processes of the spine. the tumor appeared as solid mass and contained no cavities suggestive of necrosis. the tumor was resected in general anesthesia. when the lesion was exposed, a black pigmentation became apparent, which was partially arranged in a stripe-like pattern and frayed at the edges (figure 2 ). the tumor was resected and the contour of the back reshaped. despite dense suturing of the wound margins a hematoma developed, which was emptied. secondary wound healing took 21 days and led to a stable healed wound (",

    "original_text": "A 30-year-old female had reported to our department with a chief complaint of a swelling on the inner side of lower left posterior region of the mandible since 8 years. Her history revealed that 8 years back she developed a small swelling measuring around 5 mm in diameter which slowly progressed to current size. The swelling was asymptomatic, but, as the swelling had increased in its size, now the patient experiences discomfort while chewing food and wants to have it removed. The patient did not have any significant medical and family history and also gave no history of trauma. Physical examination did not reveal any kind of similar swelling in any other region of the whole body and also patient did not have any significant family and medical history of such swellings so Gardner's syndrome was ruled out.\nIntraorally a solitary oval shaped well defined pedunculated swelling was present on the lingual aspect of teeth 36 and 37 which measured 1 cm in diameter (). The overlying and surrounding mucosa was normal. On palpation it was lobulated, nontender, and bony hard in consistency.\nMandibular occlusal cross-sectional radiograph showed a well defined irregular shaped radiopacity attached to the lingual cortex of 37 with a stalk (). Its radiodensity was equivalent to that of the adjacent body of the mandible. Differential diagnoses of exostosis, peripheral ossifying fibroma, osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma, and osteosarcoma were included. Patient consent was taken after careful explanation of the surgical procedure used and the risks and benefits. Excisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia. Intraoral incision was performed with periosteal elevation. It was removed completely with the help of rotary instrument and chisel.\nThe histopathological evaluation of the excised specimen showed that the lesional tissue was composed of dense compact bone tissue exhibiting concentric lamellae and osteocytes within osteocyte lacunae (). These microscopic findings along with clinical and radiological features guided us to arrive at the final diagnosis of Compact Type Osteoma.",
