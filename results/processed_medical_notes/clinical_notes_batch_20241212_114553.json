The baby was delivered with a cesarean section for the indication of fetal distress. In view of respiratory distress, the baby received single dose of natural bovine surfactant within half an hour of birth and was ventilated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. A PICL (Vygon, Germany) was inserted electively on the 5th day of life through the right saphenous vein. The chest X-ray confirmed the position of the catheter tip at the junction of inferior vena cava and right atrium just above the diaphragm.

The overlying gingiva of the right mandibular area showed swelling and inflammation clinically. On palpation, bilateral buccal bony expansion was noted on the posterior mandible and maxilla (). She had a complete denture, however her denture was out of use due to the gingival swelling and pain.\nPanoramic radiograph showed diffuse, lobular, and irregularly shaped radiopacities or cotton-wool appearance throughout the alveolar process of both quadrants of the maxilla and mandible.

Physical examination and laboratory findings were normal except for a body temperature of 37.8\u00b0C. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a 3 \u00d7 3 cm mass in the right middle lobe along with multiple nodules in both lungs (fig. ).

Chest CT scan indicated an emerging nodular lesion in the left lower lobe (fig. ), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bony destruction in the L5 vertebral body and L2/3 pedicle (fig. ).

Meanwhile, tissue sections of lung specimens were rechecked and the suggestion was suppurative inflammation probably caused by Nocardia. However, no further pathogenic evidence was provided.

A 2 \u00d7 2 cm soft mass was palpable in the right paravertebral area. Muscle strength was 4/5 for both lower extremities. A new MRI showed deterioration of the imaging findings (fig. ).

Symptoms included pruritus, burning paraesthesia and pain.\nThe patient was initially treated with a combination of topical corticosteroids and antibiotics for two weeks without improvement. This was followed by topical imiquimod 5% cream for about 4 weeks with out benefit.\nOn physical examination, the lesion in the left axilla measured 4 \u00d7 4 cm and the other side one was much bigger, measuring 12 \u00d7 10 cm. Both of them appeared as pink erythematous patches with irregular borders and with localised desquamated erosions together with leukokeratotic foci [].\nBilateral breast examination revealed normal breast consistency without any nodules, nipple modification, excoriation or discharge; mammograms showed a normal breast parenchyma confirming the nodules absence.

For the left lesion the patient was positioned on the contralateral side; left arm was abducted in 90\u00b0. After excising the skin lesion with an apparent tumour-free margin of 2 cm, we provided the skin defect reconstruction using a thoraco-dorsal perforator flap, according to Limberg's design [Figures and ].\nDuring the operation we removed two lymph nodes appearing lightly enlarged and of increased consistency: Histopathological examination revealed no tumour invasion but just signs of reactive histiocytosis secondary to sovra-infections of the lesion.\nThe excision specimen of the cutaneous lesion was sent for histopathological examination: There were nests of atypical cells with melanin pigmentation within their cytoplasm showing pagetoid involvement of the epidermis together with cells with abundant basophilic cytoplasm",

No obvious change in size and internal density of uterine fibrosis had been observed during these 5 years (Fig. b). She had no previous history of alcohol or drug abuse. Ultrasound revealed a well-defined, non-calcified tumor between the gallbladder and liver (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a hypointense tumor that compressed the gallbladder and liver on precontrast T1 mapping (Fig. a).

Clinical evaluation and laboratory results were nonspecific, and serum tumor markers including carcinoembryonic antigen, cancer antigen (CA) 19-9, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen were within their normal ranges. The findings were consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) or another benign tumor originating from the liver or gallbladder. Accordingly, we planned firstly laparoscopic partial hepatectomy concomitant with gallbladder resection. Lymphadenectomy among the hepatoduodenal ligament were also planned under the situations where malignant tumor was suspected intraoperatively. Under the laparoscopic view, a soft tumor had expansively progressed behind the gallbladder, with dorsal compression of the liver (Fig. ). The tumor was easily separated from Laennec\u2019s capsule of the liver at the gallbladder neck and body without adhesion, which indicates the tumor is benign. Therefore, operative policy changed to tumor enucleation with cholecystectomy. Frozen sections including the surgical margin of the cystic duct were negative for tumor cells.

She had no known past medical conditions or any family history of chronic disorders or similar illnesses. She was a housewife who frequently engaged in gardening and had no history of visits to forest areas or working in paddy fields. She was not alcoholic and was a nonsmoker.\nAt the beginning, she had been hospitalized, had undergone investigations, and had received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Due to the nature of the protracted illness with fever, and because she had an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) above 100 mm/h and increased C-reactive protein (CRP), a course of antituberculous antibiotics had been given over 2 weeks without definitive confirmation of the diagnosis of tuberculosis. While on antituberculous medications, instead of clinical improvement, she showed further deterioration of her illness and developed new problems, including appearance of a tender lump over the right temporal area over the course of 1 week and another similar lump over the anterior aspect of the left thigh of 5 days\u2019 duration. At this juncture, she left the first hospital at her own wish and secured admission to Teaching Hospital Peradeniya (THP).\nOn admission to THP, she looked very ill and feeble and was febrile and tachypneic. She had a tender lump resembling an abscess over the right temporal area. Furthermore, she had similar lumps over the anterior aspect of the left thigh. She had an inflamed, swollen knee and wrist joints with a tender erythematous rash over both shins that resembled erythema nodosum.

    "original_text": "Patient 5 was a 23-year-old man who sustained a left ankle fracture in a motorcycle accident. Because of direct injury to the medial side of the ankle, the soft tissue was too poor for immediate surgery. Images showed a severely comminuted MMFx of the tibia (). The images showed no malalignment of the talus, but its protection by the medial malleolus of the tibia was gone, which means a medial subluxation of the talus could have occurred. Surgical restoration was planned for anatomical reduction of the medial malleolus of the tibia. Due to the poor soft tissue condition, the operation was delayed for 16 days. Despite confirmation of skin necrosis, a surgical approach to the fracture was planned. A skin incision was performed by avoiding the necrotic area (). The L-shaped incision allowed access to the fracture site. The surgical procedure for the fracture was performed as described above. We first fixed the fracture in the deep area of the joint cartilage. Then, the large fracture fragments were fixed using mini-screws. Stability of the talus was confirmed through intraoperative fluoroscopy. It was possible to cover the area over the screws with healthy skin. The area not covered with skin was covered with a negative pressure wound treatment. Immobilization was performed using a posterior short leg splint (). Union of the medial malleolus was achieved at 7 months postoperatively ().\nThe exfoliated skin area was covered with a split-thickness skin graft 16 days after the first surgery. There were no infections or other problems despite soft-tissue damage. The patient began to walk with crutches with partial weight bearing 3 months after surgery.

Laboratory examinations revealed white blood cell count of 15,400 cells/\u00b5L, hemoglobin level of 13.3 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein level of 0.05 mg/dL.

From the aneurysm, unidentifiable vessels branched to both cranial and caudal sides of the aorta (). The vessel branching off on the cranial side of the aneurysm ran along the aorta, and seemed to be connected to the left subclavian artery. The patient was diagnosed with aneurysm rupture attributed to an unusual vessel leading to the aneurysm. After obtaining informed consent from the patient, we performed emergent angiography to embolize the ruptured aneurysm. The procedure was performed under local anesthesia as follows: A 5-Fr sheath was introduced via the left radial artery, and a 6-Fr sheath via the right femoral artery. At first, to identify the unusual vessels branching off the aneurysm and the point at which the rupture had occurred, an angiogram of the left internal thoracic artery (LITA) was obtained to prevent the sheath from passing through the aneurysm. However, the angiogram obtained from the LITA and left common carotid artery (LCCA) showed neither an unusual vessel nor the aneurysm. However, in the venous phase, the vessel, which was considered to be unusual on a CT image, could be confirmed. Thus, a 6-Fr sheath was introduced from the right femoral artery, and a 4-Fr CXI support catheter (Cook Medical in Japan, Tokyo, Japan) was advanced to the aneurysm",

She had no history of previous abdominal surgery. On examination she looked healthy with no clinical jaundice or pallor. An abdominal examination revealed a large upper abdominal mass with thinned overlying skin. It had minimal mobility and was not tender. The rest of the examination was normal. Her hemoglobin, on admission, was 7.0g/dL. She was transfused and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which revealed a submucosal tumor at D2 and D3. A biopsy was obtained but was reported as nonspecific. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a 12\u00d713cm retroperitoneal mass in the region of the head of the pancreas (Figure ). There was no evidence of metastases to her liver or lung. From these radiographic findings, we diagnosed a submucosal tumor of the duodenum. The patient underwent an elective exploratory laparotomy. No evidence of local invasion of the pancreas or of distant metastases was found. The tumor had greatly decreased in size, and it was thought that the liquid of the tumor had probably emptied into the duodenum through a fistula between the tumor and the duodenum. Considering that the pancreas and major papilla were not involved, a local resection was performed, with a 1cm disease-free margin. A retrocolic Roux-en-Y loop was then created and the edges of the defect in the duodenum joined to the jejunal limb of the Roux-loop by a hand-stitched side-to-side duodenojejunostomy anastomosis using a 3-0 Vicryl.

    "original_text": "Patient B, a 75-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department because of recurrent syncope in the last 2 months. His medical history included hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, left ventricular hypertrophy, and angina pectoris. Laboratory evaluation and echocardiography showed no abnormalities. His electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia with a left heart axis and a first degree AV block (PQ duration: 380 ms), as well as a right bundle branch block (QRS duration: 146 ms). A pacemaker was implanted because of this trifascicular block. Postimplantation, a cardiac MRI was performed as part of a clinical trial (Fig. ). Unexpectedly, this MRI showed an endocardial tumor in the right atrium and right ventricle. The tumor also involved the tricuspid valve, thus restricting blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. The patient's syncope was probably caused by this obstruction of blood flow, but arrhythmias could also have played a role. No other tumor localizations were found on FDG-PET/CT. He subsequently underwent intracardiac echocardiography-guided biopsy of the tumor. Cytologic examination showed blast-like cells with nucleoli. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD20 and PAX5 confirming the diagnosis of DLBCL. There was not enough tissue for FISH analysis. A staging bone marrow biopsy showed no localization of lymphoma; therefore, he had a stage IE primary cardiac lymphoma. HIV status was negative. The patient had a good left ventricular ejection fraction and was treated with six cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) followed by two cycles of rituximab alone. He achieved a complete response.\nTwo years after the initial presentation he experienced rapidly progressive cognitive decline as a result of central nervous system (CNS) relapse with multifocal parenchymatous lesions on MRI. He quickly recovered after starting dexamethasone and subsequently received high-dose methotrexate (3 g/m2). Although initially responding to therapy, he died 2 months after initiation of chemotherapy due to progressive disease.",

The carotid pulse had a weak and delayed upstroke. There were no significant findings on respiratory auscultation, but she had jugular vein distention indicating high-central venous pressure. Her cardiac symptom was shortness of breath classified as New York Heart Association II. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a preserved ejection fraction with severe aortic stenosis; aortic valve area of 0.4 cm2, peak velocity of 4.4 m/s, and mean gradient of 47.0 mmHg. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 4.0% and the Logistic Euro Score was 32.1%. After multidisciplinary team discussions, the patient was deemed inoperable for heart surgery because of old age, and considered as a candidate for TAVI. Computed tomography showed no significant coronary artery disease. It revealed a 377 mm2 annulus and compatible iliofemoral arteries; thus, transfemoral TAVI using a 23 mm Sapien 3 was performed. The procedure was under general anaesthesia because our institute was in early experience of TAVI and chose it as a routine method.

CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy was performed and metastasis of squamous lung cancer was confirmed. Other distant metastasis in liver, bone or brain was not found. The specimen was submitted for detection of EGFR mutation, ROS1 fusion gene rearrangement and ALK fusion gene rearrangement, yet neither mutation nor gene rearrangement was detected.

For this current pregnancy, antenatal care (ANC) was started at 18 weeks with a booking blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg. She did four ANCs and all were uneventful.

She refused neurological symptoms such as headache during pregnancy. She has a history of gestational hypertension in her third pregnancy. There was no family history of chronic hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney diseases. On examination she was afebrile with a blood pressure of 182/126 mmHg and pulse of 112beats/minute. Neurological examination revealed Glasgow coma score of 13/15, right sided hemiparesis and expressive Broca\u2019s aphasia, no signs of meningeal irritation. The abdomen was distended by a gravid uterus with a fundal height of 35 cm, foetus in a longitudinal lie and cephalic presentation.

The lesion was 1.0 cm in size. It was round shaped, circumscribed elevated and had brown pigmented color (Figure 1 ). The appearance was typical of a seborrheic keratosis. Her visual acuity and eyelid movements were normal.\nThe procedure is performed under local anesthesia with intravenous sedation and magnification. Upper eyelid tumor is marked with 2 mm margin. A line is drawn on the eyelid at the level of the lid crease. Then, the advancement flap of the anterior lamella is outlined with two Burow\u2019s triangles marked for excision, one triangle medial or lateral to the defect and the second diagonal to the first, above the lid crease (Figure 2 ). An incision is then made through the skin and the subcutaneous tissue of the lesion. The lesion was excised with a 2 mm free margin. The triangles\u2019 boundaries are cut with a scalpel, dissected, and mobilized with blunt scissors (Figure 3A ). The subcutaneous tissue at the edges of the defect is undermined in the subdermal plane to minimize the tension at the suture lines. An advancement flap of the skin and orbicularis of the upper eyelid was undermined, elevated, and advanced inferiorly over the defect (Figure 3B ). Interrupted buried 6/0 nylon sutures are used to approximate the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and close the defect completely (Figure 4 ). Topical antibiotic ointment is applied twice daily for 7 days. The sutures are removed in 10 days.

The specialist endocrinologist established the indication for surgical treatment and the present euthyroid status of the patient.\nThe clinical exam revealed a rubberlike, rather irregular and big goiter, developed predominately on the left side, apparently going beyond the anterior margin of the sternomastoid, but with no signs or symptoms of local compression. No notable co-morbidities were present.\nThe operating team consisted of one consultant with special interest in endocrine surgery and medium \u2013 high volume of thyroid and parathyroid cases (50 \u2013 60 operations per year) and 2 registrars.\nUnder general anesthesia, the surgical team proceeded to total thyroidectomy with routine identification of the inferior laryngeal nerve and, at least, superior parathyroid glands, with the vascular cutting and sealing done with Harmonic Ace CS14S. Although the left lobe was significantly bigger (), the dissection and identification of the recurrent laryngeal nerve were straightforward. On the right,we first mobilized the lobe anteriorly and medially by severing the middle thyroid vein and the vessels of the upper pole. We identified the inferior thyroid artery and its branches and, as we usually do, we commenced the search of the ILN, first cranially and then caudally, being unable to find any nervous structure resembling ILN in the tracheo-esophageal groove. Therefore, we thought of the possibility of the ILN being non-recurrent, identified the vagus nerve and followed it cranially.

He had been diagnosed with a large amount of CSDH in the left frontoparietal lobe and a midline shift to the right hemisphere (). A neurosurgeon at the local hospital had performed burr hole trephination in left frontal bone and he had failed to drain the hematoma sufficiently (). The hematoma was made up of yellow, mud-like material, and it had been misdiagnosed as subdural empyema in the operative room. The doctor immediately transferred the patient to our hospital in order to treat subdural empyema. A neurological examination at admission revealed drowsy mentality with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13. Hemiparesis of the right arm and leg was not detected. He could not recall any incident of head trauma. He had hypertension, diabetes, angina, and he had been taking clopidogrel for treatment of angina. A brain computed tomography (CT) scan showed many high density areas in the hematoma and the membrane, compared to usual CSDH. Focal calcifications were found in the membrane. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large amount of CSDH with a low, heterogeneous signal on T2-weighted images (WIs), an isodense signal on T1-WIs, and a low, homogeneous signal on diffusion-WIs (). There was no dense enhancement as with a subdural empyema. The membrane surrounding the hematoma was enhanced in a line. He was diagnosed with OCSH based on brain images and previous operative findings. We decided to treat by performing craniotomy, followed by removal of the organized hematoma and the thick membrane.

This was the patient's first exposure to contrast medium. The contrast material was injected into the left and right carotid artery, as well as in the right vertebral artery, with no side effects noted. During injection of the contrast material into the left vertebral artery, the patient complained of blurring of vision which deteriorated to near-total blindness within minutes.

She was undergoing dialysis for her chronic renal failure caused by familial polycystic kidney disease. She had a history of neck clipping of unruptured left middle cerebral artery aneurysm some 13 years ago at another institution. Her GCS was E4V5M6 so WFNS grade was I. Head CT scan demonstrated small amount of SAH in the interhemispheric fissure []. CT angiography revealed 6 mm ACoA aneurysm, as well as complete clipping of left middle cerebral artery aneurysm []. Endovascular surgeons were reluctant from coiling because of wide neck of the aneurysm.\nOperation was performed via anterior interhemispheric approach. Dissection of interhemispheric fissure between rectus gyrus and genu of corpus callosum provided sufficient exposure of the ACoA aneurysm. During dissection, left olfactory nerve was missing and A1 segment of left ACA adhered to surrounding brain tissue, suggesting ACoA had been explored in the previous operation. The adhesion was more prominent around the aneurysm, and hypothalamic artery was encased in the aneurysmal wall with glue material []. Gentle and meticulous dissection was performed, but minor leak of blood occurred from the neck of the aneurysm adjacent to right A2. Any attempts for neck clipping only enlarged laceration of aneurysmal neck. Trapping of the aneurysm including the neck laceration was unavoidable to secure the aneurysm, with simultaneous revascularization of right A2 because right A1 was aplastic on initial CT angiography []. Temporary hemostasis of lacerated neck was obtained by compression with cottonoid under flow control for a few minutes. Back to A3 segment of ACA, A3-A3 side-to-side anastomosis was performed with bilateral A3 cross-clamping time 37 min [].

The patient was a non-smoker and had no underlying disease. He had first noticed the lesion about one year prior. On extra-oral examination, facial asymmetry with swelling involving the left side of the mandible was observed at the time of admission. Intraoral examination showed a discharge of pus in the posterior region.\nX-ray radiographs (panoramic radiograph and computed tomography [CT]) were performed.() Axial CT showed a fairly large (27 mm\u00d734 mm\u00d723 mm) and well-defined rounded cystic destructive lesion involving the left mandibular body. Absorption of the roots of #36 and #37 had occurred. Incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia, and the tissue was sent for histopathological examination, which revealed a suggestive benign cyst. Endodontic treatment of #36 was performed.\nAt the time of operation, extraction of #37 and #38 and enucleation of the lesion were carried out under general anesthesia. The iliac bone graft took place at the same time. After surgery, a newly excisional biopsy was performed, and the results did not show a benign cyst but instead were suggestive of unicystic ameloblastoma, mural type.() A follow-up check was done at three months, six months, nine months, and one year after surgery. Nine months postoperatively, a panoramic radiograph revealed favorable healing of the iliac bone graft in the left mandibular body.()\nAt one year and five months after surgery, implantation of #37 was performed. The implantation was done using a one-stage technique because the initial torque was favorable.

One week later she developed generalized muscle weakness and acute respiratory distress. She was transferred to the ICU where mechanical ventilatory support was given after intubation. Clinically she had bilateral lower motor neuron facial palsy and quadriparesis. The upper limb power was 3/5 bilaterally and lower limbs were 0/5 proximally and 2/5 distally. She had total areflexia of all four limbs and the plantar responses were mute. She was assessed by a neurologist and a diagnosis of acute GBS was suspected. Nerve conduction study (NCS) showed prolonged distal latencies, absent H reflex and reduced conduction velocities suggestive of acute demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. The blink reflex was abnormal with prolonged motor latency of both facial nerves. The patient refused lumbar puncture, hence cerebrospinal fluid examination was not done; as she complained of back pain. Other investigations including full blood count, blood biochemistry, autoimmune screen, protein electrophoresis, and porphyria screening were negative. Serological tests for Mycoplasma pneumonia, Epstein-Barr virus and hepatitis virus were negative. The clinical picture and electrophysiological findings were consistent with GBS. She was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; 0.4 g/kg for 5 days). While in the ICU she developed severe bulbar weakness. After the first course of IVIG, she started to improve slowly. The facial weakness and motor power in her limbs improved slowly. However, weaning from the ventilator was delayed due to bulbar weakness and inter-current respiratory tract infection. A second course of IVIG was given after 2 weeks. Chest infection was treated with piperacillin and tazobactam along with chest physiotherapy. Subsequently she recovered and after 3 weeks of ICU care, she was extubated. This patient improved well and was able to walk with minimum support and eventually discharged from the hospital.",

The patient quickly decompensated and suffered a cardiac arrest necessitating advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS). The patient was intubated, received epinephrine 1mg, and calcium chloride 1g, yielding return of spontaneous circulation. In the intensive care unit, labs revealed a potassium level of 8.5 mEq/L, for which she received emergent dialysis. She was extubated on hospital day 4 and transferred to the progressive care unit and started on her routine home medications.\nShortly after being restarted on Lisinopril, the patient complained of shortness of breath, developed stridor, and severe angioedema. Concern of lost airway prompted re-intubation. She was transferred back to the intensive care unit for further medical management. Upon meeting criteria, the patient was extubated on day six, only to be intubated again for stridor. After 9 days of intubation, it was determined that the patient required a tracheostomy. Imaging studies prior to surgery could not rule out subglottic narrowing due to the presence of an endotracheal tube, however, paratracheal edema was noted ( and ). Clinically, her minimal air leak following deflation of the endotracheal tube cuff provided evidence for the latter finding. Intra-operatively, the Otolaryngology (ENT) surgeon noted that the posterior wall of the tracheal mucosa appeared grey and friable. The distal tracheal wall was inflamed and excoriated. The surgery was successful and there were no complications with ventilation in the operating room. Tracheal positioning was confirmed using end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring.
