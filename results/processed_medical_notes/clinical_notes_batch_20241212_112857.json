Abdominal CT identified a shadow defect of 35 mm in diameter in the IVC continuing posteriorly to a 35 mm mass of retroperitoneum (Fig. ). Physical examination revealed no mass in the abdomen. The results of complete blood count, chemistry, and urinalysis were all within the normal including carcinoembryonic antigen, CA19-9, CA125, neuron-specific enolase, sIL-2R, and IgG4. The mass showed an early phase strong enhancement followed by a delayed enhancement. By the abdominal MRI, the tumor showed a high signal intensity at T2-weighted images and slightly high signal at the diffusion-weighted images. The laboratory and image diagnosis indicated a tumor of vascular origin. However, we could not exclude angiosarcoma or tumor thrombus originated from prior cancer; therefore, we performed a tumor removal. During the surgery, we identified an intravascular tumor of dumbbell like shape presenting in right ovarian vein extending to IVC. With the aid of vascular surgeon, we removed the mass together with the wall of ovarian vein and IVC. The defect of IVC was closed by using a graft of saphenous vein. Though we prepared extracorporeal circulation before surgery, the temporary blocking of IVC beneath the renal veins derived no reduction of blood pressure and we did not use the equipment.\nMicroscopically, the tumor consisted of microcapillaries which formed reticular structure.

He brings an ultrasound, which shows a 4 cm heterogenous mass in segment 8. His alfafetoprotein level is elevated to 76 ng/mL. He has no symptoms and looks in good performance status. We scheduled him for a triphasic CT scan, which shows a lesion of 4.3 cm with brisk arterial contrast and venous washout. According to the LIRADS classification, this lesion could be considered a class 5 with diagnostic features of hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient was discussed in our multidisciplinary tumor board including hepatobiliary and transplant surgeons, hepatologists, radiologists, pathologists, oncologists, and interventional radiologists. The plan was to submit the patient to curative intent treatments given his early presentation according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging System (BCLC), namely surgical resection or liver transplantation; radiofrequency ablation was excluded given the tumor\u2019s dimensions. Given the good performance status, the position of the lesion (which was right below the Glissonian capsule) and the liver function of the patients, the MDT decided to schedule the patient for surgery.

Laboratory values included a WBC of 22 900 /ul, with 25% bands and 10% eosinophils. Serum creatinine was 2.6 mg/dl, which increased from his baseline of 1.1 mg/dL. Urinalysis revealed 3+ leukocyte esterase, >100 RBC, and >100 WBC. Liver function tests revealed an elevated total bilirubin of 3.0 mg/dl, and a renal ultrasound showed bilateral hydronephrosis.\nOn the second day in hospital the patient underwent cystoscopy to evaluate the etiology of the obstructive renal failure and for prostate biopsy, which revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma. On day three, a liver ultrasound revealed marked heterogeneity concerning for metastatic disease. A left-sided percutaneous nephrostomy was performed on day four to relieve the obstructive hydronephrosis. On day nine, an abdominal MRI demonstrated diffuse metastatic disease of the liver and therefore a liver biopsy was performed. On hospital day 11, the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was found to be 4155 U/ml, but PSA was undetectable. A noncontrast CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules consistent with diffuse metastases as well as enlarged lymph nodes in the chest and retroperitoneum.

The patient was discussed in our multidisciplinary tumor board including hepatobiliary and transplant surgeons, hepatologists, radiologists, pathologists, oncologists, and interventional radiologists. The plan was to submit the patient to curative intent treatments given his early presentation according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging System (BCLC), namely surgical resection or liver transplantation; radiofrequency ablation was excluded given the tumor\u2019s dimensions. Given the good performance status, the position of the lesion (which was right below the Glissonian capsule) and the liver function of the patients, the MDT decided to schedule the patient for surgery.

She was therefore referred to our hospital for further assessment.\nThe patient had no relevant past medical history. At 13 weeks of gestation, she was admitted to the hospital due to vaginal bleeding and treated for abruptio placentae, with discharge at recovery. Then at her routine prenatal visit for her 20th (T0) week of pregnancy, she was found to have a uterine fundus greater than her gestational age, for which she was referred to our hospital to discard polyhydramnios. A pelvic ultrasound was performed, finding a normal intrauterine pregnancy of 25 gestational weeks with cephalic diameter consistent with gestational age, normal cardiac activity, and an adequate amount of amniotic fluid. The ultrasound showed bilateral enlarged ovaries with heterogeneous echogenicity. Due to these findings, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, which showed occupation by an intrauterine pregnancy (Fig. ), as well as a left tumoral lesion (Fig. ) with dimensions of 22.1 \u00d7 13.6 \u00d7 16.3 cm, with regular lobulated contours which caused right confinement of the uterus, as well as eccentric displacement of the small intestine, peripheral vascular structures, and mild compression of the bladder, without infiltration. There was left ureteral compression with mild pyelo-ureteral dilation, as well as mild compression of the inferior vena cava.

Upon further review of history, the patient endorsed worsening shortness of breath over the past year and occasional palpitations with exertion, but denied symptoms with normal activity. She had recurrent pulmonary infections and asthma/allergy episodes throughout childhood and adult life. Physical exam showed normal jugular venous pressure (JVP). She had a parasternal heave but her apex was not localized. The heart sounds were normal and she did not have any murmurs.\nEchocardiogram showed dilatation of the right atrium and right ventricle with and interatrial shunt consistent with a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Ejection fraction was normal.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the chest () showed a hypoplastic right upper lobe and compensatory large right lower lobe. There was a large right pulmonary artery with a large arteriovenous malformation (AVM) from the pulmonary artery into the anomalous scimitar vein which attached to the inferior vena cava. The majority of the right lung pulmonary venous return was to the inferior vena cava via the scimitar vein. A single small vestigial inferior pulmonary vein on the right extended to the left atrium. The left pulmonary veins drained normally into the left atrium.\nTransthoracic echocardiography (TEE) confirmed right atrial and right ventricular dilatation and normal left pulmonary venous return into the left atrium.

    "original_text": "A woman in her 80s with a 5-year history of worsening motor symptoms presented to the Movement Disorders Clinic. Her initial symptoms included difficulty walking that progressively worsened alongside presence of choreic movements, involving head bobbing and extremity tremors. There were no symptoms of numbness, urinary incontinence or memory impairment (mild forgetfulness was noted and attributed to age). No significant alcohol intake history was elicited.\nFamily history was significant for a sister with HD that developed in her 40s, with no relevant history in parents or grandparents. Her children were not known to have developed any signs of Huntington chorea and have not received genetic testing to date.\nOn general physical examination there was no distress or abnormality identified. Her neurological assessment revealed mild abnormal movements in her mouth/face, upper and lower extremities. Asymmetric bradykinesia was present on the left greater than right side as well as mild symmetrical rigidity. Her stance was normal with slow gait and mild shuffling. Long tract signs were absent, along with negative Romberg sign, no cerebellar dysmetria or truncal ataxia.\nGenetic testing revealed a 28-repeat CAG expansion in the huntingtin allele on chromosome 4.\nFollowing a clinical diagnosis of HD, she was started on tetrabenazine therapy 12.5 mg two times per day that was gradually increased to three times per day. A remarkable improvement was noted on follow-up and near complete resolution of her abnormal movements.

    "original_text": "A 68-year-old man was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) with the primary lesion in the left lower lobe and metastases to lymph nodes, bones, and the adrenal glands. He had experienced symptoms of left chest wall pain and dyspnea for a month. He had undergone an upper GI endoscopy as a regular health-screening test a few months before the diagnosis of cancer, and the initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed no specific abnormalities.\nThe patient was referred to Seoul National University Hospital for further work-up and treatment, and he underwent chemotherapy for metastatic lung cancer, along with radiotherapy for spinal metastatic lesions.\nDuring a regular visit to the outpatient clinic, the patient complained of newly developed melena and dysphagia. To evaluate the GI tract, EGD was performed, and this revealed multiple lesions in the esophagus and stomach. Geographic erosion with epithelial break and mild hemorrhagic change without evidence of active bleeding was discovered at the distal esophagus, 35 cm from the upper incisors. Multiple volcano-shaped sessile masses with umbilication at the central portion were scattered through the entire stomach, from the fundus to the proximal antrum, measuring 0.5 (the smallest) to 5 cm (the largest) ().\nEndoscopic biopsies were performed at each lesion location, and the histopathological results showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas in both. The histologic patterns of the esophageal and gastric metastatic lesions were similar to those of the right lower paratracheal lymph node (4R) lesions, but to determine more precisely whether the lesions were primary esophageal and gastric cancer masses or metastases from the lung cancer, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was additionally performed. The IHC results showed positive staining for thyroid transcriptional factor-1 (TTF-1) ().

The mass was initially the size of a pea and asymptomatic. In the most recent 7 years, the tumor gradually increased to about the size of an egg, without tenderness and occasionally with acid swelling. He had no previous history of surgery and had a history of hepatitis B, heavy smoking, and alcohol consumption. Physical examination showed that the tumor of the left parotid gland was tough, about 4.0 \u00d7 3.0 cm in size, with good mobility, no tenderness, clear boundaries, and no symptoms of facial paralysis.\nUltrasonography of the parotid gland suggested a mixed mass of the left parotid gland, with a size of about 3.29 \u00d7 2.48 cm, unclear boundaries, regular shape, slightly lower echo inside the parenchyma, uneven distribution, a large number of thick and small calcified plaques, and sparse blood flow signal. Ultrasonography thus indicated the presence of a mixed parotid gland tumor. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the parotid gland showed a lumpy, mixed-density shadow in the left parotid gland area, with a size of 3.1 \u00d7 2.5 cm, uneven enhancement with gadolinium contrast, and unclear boundaries. In addition, the density of the internal center of the mass was low, and a small calcification shadow was observed (Fig. A). Therefore, the patient wished to remove the parotid gland mass by surgery. However, preoperative routine pulmonary CT showed a local ground glass shadow in the lower lobe of the right lung, about 2.3 \u00d7 2.0 cm in size, with small solid nodules and empty bubbles, and local traction of the adjacent pleura.

Although angiography showed a suspected pseudoaneurysm originating from the common hepatic artery, the origin of bleeding could not be clearly identified (Fig. ). Because the bleeding point was not clearly identified, the decision was made to proceed with an urgent explorative laparotomy.

The right maxillary sinus was obliterated with the lesion, which also invaded the sphenoid bone. It extended into the middle crust in the nasal cavity and to the orbital cavity, eroding the bony structures of the apex and the medial wall of the orbit but not infiltrating the orbital muscle tissues. There was also an inferior temporal fossa extension. A biopsy was performed and the pathology was reported as a \"basaloid type SCC.\" He refused surgery and received three cycles of docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (DCF) induction chemotherapy. The imaging studies showed minimal response to chemotherapy.\nHe received HSRT to a total dose of 36 Gy with 7.2 Gy/fraction to the primary site. Follow-up images revealed minimal regression. He was followed without any medication with MRI performed every three months, and the disease was stable. Eight years after radiotherapy, the MRI showed progression in the intracranial and infraorbital compartments and the patient had a complaint of progressive exophthalmos. The MRI revealed a lesion extending into the orbit and the optic nerve swirled all the way, the temporal lobe compartment infiltrated the large wing of the sphenoid sinus, the cavernous sinus, and the Meckel cavity (Figures -).

He was found to have a 6.6 x 6.1 x 5.9 cm (CC x TR x AP) mass in the right kidney on CT imaging (Figure ).\nOne week later, he underwent a laparoscopic nephrectomy, where a 5.5-cm renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was found on pathology. Histologically, it was a clear cell carcinoma with a Fuhrman grade of 3/4. Resection margins were widely negative.\nIn May 2015, he was admitted to hospital for diverticulitis. A CT scan performed incidentally showed multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules. These were biopsied, confirming recurrence of his RCC. No other sites of metastasis were observed.\nHe was referred to the regional cancer center and a decision was made not to initiate systemic therapy after discussion with the patient, who was completely asymptomatic at the time. Instead he was scheduled for monitoring.\nIn January 2016, surveillance imaging showed progression of the lung metastases and evidence of bone metastases. The patient also reported lower back pain consistent with his imaging findings.

After the first symptom, she visited a local clinic and her symptom was managed under the impression of cardiac arrhythmia. But one year later, she discontinued anti-arrhythmic medication on her own. Until two months before admission, she had experienced intermittent palpitation again but it did not interfere with her life. Afterwards, palpitation became more severe suddenly and squeezing anterior chest tightness radiating to the left axilla developed and continued for about 10 minutes.\nThe patient was a housewife and had no history of smoking or alcohol consumption. There was no specific problem in her past medical and family history. The body temperature was 36.5\u00b0C and the heart beats were irregularr and rated over 140/min. On physical examination, mild moist crackling sounds were heard below a third on the back bilaterally. Neck vein engorgement was also seen. Considering the chest pain as ischemic in nature, nitroglycerin was given sublingually and the pain subsided. ECG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular blurring and redistribution was seen on chest X-rays (). Other laboratory data, including cardiac enzymes and thyroid function tests, were within normal limits. Initially, cardiac tumor was not considered as the differential diagnosis. Transthoracic echocardiography, which was performed after her symptom had disappeared, showed normal global left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction: 63%) with left ventricular enlargement and hypertrophy, and also showed trivial mitral regurgitation.

There were no signs of strangulation. Immediate laparoscopic hernia reduction was performed. We observed a small amount of purulent fluid in the region of the cranial part of the hernia orifice, as well as fibrin overlying the sigmoid colon.

After performing the standard multi-organ procurement, it was noted that the donor left renal vein was essentially dismembered from the inferior vena cava (IVC). This prohibited performing the standard en-bloc technique to transplant the kidneys. Normally, the suprarenal IVC is sutured closed, and the infrarenal IVC is spatulated at the iliac bifurcation for anastomosis to the recipient iliac vein. The pediatric kidneys were divided on the back table similar to an adult kidney procedure. The left renal vein was separated completely. The aorta was split down the middle and Carrel patches were made around the renal arteries. The right renal vein was elongated using the donor IVC in the standard fashion, and a venotomy was made on the side of the IVC for the anastomosis. The transplant then proceeded normally by exposing the right iliac vessels. Adequate exposure was achieved. The internal iliac veins were ligated and divided to elevate the external iliac vein and allow for a tension-free anastomosis. The external iliac artery was dissected to its full length, from the takeoff of the internal iliac artery to the inguinal ligament. The two kidneys were transplanted by stacking them on the same side. The left kidney was placed higher to allow the longer vein to cross over the iliac artery.

    "original_text": "A 14-month-old white female toddler was referred to a service of pediatric dermatology for a wide IH on the interscapular back area. The lesion appeared after birth and grew rapidly in the first few months. She was first followed in another center where laser therapy was attempted unsuccessfully. On examination the hemangioma was described as remarkable in size, tense and not showing clear signs of involution yet. For its position the lesion was uncomfortable and exposed to possible trauma as well as pressure and rubbing when the child was laying on the back (Fig. ). Even if she was not an infant anymore, she was deemed to meet the criteria for medical treatment in order to avoid possible complications and a spontaneous involution with potentially aesthetical damages. A decision was taken to try oral beta-blocker.\nHistory and physical examination were unremarkable for cardiac problems; anyway she underwent an ECG and an echocardiogram, which were normal. Treatment was initiated at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/die (in 2 daily doses) and increased to a target dose of 2 mg/kg/die during a two-day hospital admission in order to monitor for possible side effects (in particular bradychardia, hypotension) as recommended by a group of experts [].

The pain had increased progressively over the previous 3 months. She described pain at rest associated with coldness, pallor, and paresthesia of the limb. She had fallen from stairs when 9 months old, fracturing her clavicle, which was managed conservatively.\nPhysical examination revealed discrete deformity at the level of the mid third of the right clavicle. The right hand was cold and blue and ulnar, radial, brachial, and axillary pulses were all absent. Continuous wave Doppler detected no blood flow distally and monophasic flow in the brachial and axillary arteries. The chest X-ray showed a deformity of the mid third of the right clavicle, compatible with pseudarthrosis ( ).\nDoppler ultrasonography demonstrated segmental occlusion of the subclavian artery with distal refilling via collateral vessels and very fine, threadlike flow in the axillary artery with occlusion of the brachial and radial arteries and refilling of the distal ulnar artery. Magnetic resonance angiography confirmed the Doppler ultrasonography findings ( ).\nThe pseudarthrosis was treated surgically, via a right supraclavicular incision, with resection of the mid segment of the clavicle ( ). The right subclavian artery was compressed and had thrombi with a chronic appearance inside. Thromboembolectomy of the subclavian artery was conducted with a 3F Fogarty catheter, followed by closure of the arteriotomy with a patch harvested from the saphenous vein in the thigh.

    "original_text": "A 42-year-old woman presented at our observation with a 4-year history of a slow-growing, painful swelling on the posteromedial region of her left leg (). X-rays evidenced the presence of a nodular mass at the proximal third of the left leg arising from the soft tissues next to the medial aspect of tibia (); multiple calcific components were also observed. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the presence of a 13 cm \u00d7 6 cm, 3 cm \u00d7 6 cm, 1 cm capsulated mass occupying soleus muscle, compressing, and displacing anteriorly gastrocnemius muscle (). Moreover, the patient underwent vascular MRI of leg arteries which showed a posterolateral dislocation of the distal part of popliteal artery and tibioperoneal trunk (), without alterations in canalization. Incisional biopsy was performed to assess the nature of the lesion. After the excision, specimens were immediately fixed in a 10% buffered formalin at room temperature for 48 h, cut into several tissue slices, and embedded in paraffin tissue blocks, as elsewhere reported [, ]. Histologically, the bioptic samples consisted mainly of hyaline cartilage containing chondrocytes with chondrocytic lacunae; a diagnosis of a chondroma was suggested. However, to exclude the possibility of chondrosarcoma, which is a common differential diagnosis, especially when dealing with small biopsies, a surgical excision of the entire tumor, including the capsule, was performed ().
