On examination, cardiovascular parameters were stable overt distress in the animal not apparent. The dog was ambulatory with normal gait and posture devoid of proprioceptive deficits.\nThorough head inspection revealed subcutaneous emphysema between the eyes and a superficial cut to the right dorso-orbital region. Mild right unilateral epistaxis was noted. The dog resented palpation of the right frontal bone and a communication with the sinonasal cavity was inferred by the presence of a flail segment movement of the bone synchronous with respiration. Cranial nerve examination demonstrated bilateral delayed pupillary light reflex (PLR) and normal pupil size, the remainder of the neurological examination was within normal limits.\nA right-sided frontal bone depression fracture was suspected founded on clinical findings. Radiographs and Computer Tomography (CT) imaging with a three-dimensional reconstruction of the skull were performed under general anaesthesia (see Fig. -). Radiographs of the cervical spine were unremarkable.\nCT imaging revealed a comminuted, depressed fracture of the frontal bone that extended from the level of the maxillary recesses up to the caudal aspect of the frontal sinuses at the level of the dorsal aspect of the right maxillary, nasal and frontal bones. Surgical repair of the defect was warranted to reestablish sinus architecture and mechanical stability []. Further, fracture comminution is associated with soft tissue contracture leading to cavitation with connective tissue scarring and sequestrum formation [], fracture repair addresses soft tissue injury and may minimize long-term risks of complication [].

Initially, it was a small swelling that had increased progressively and reached a size of 7 cm \u00d7 5 cm. The patient was febrile on and off for last 2 months. He had no significant past or medical history. There was no regional lymphadenopathy; general physical and systemic examination was within normal limits. Local examination of left axilla revealed a large, firm, nontender pedunculated swelling of size 7 cm \u00d7 5 cm. Skin overlying the swelling was inflamed and ulcerated. With a clinico-radiological diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma, the patient was referred for FNAC.\nHighly cellular smears showed cohesive cell clusters of malignant cells composed of two cell population; polyhedral cells with dense basophilic cytoplasm along with glycogen containing pale/clear cells with a clear cytoplasm. The nuclei were cytologically pleomorphic, hyperchromatic, round to oval with coarse chromatin and prominent nucleoli. The nuclei were eccentrically located within a moderate amount of basophilic cytoplasm, with a relatively well-defined cell borders imparting a plasmacytoid appearance. There were many bi-and multinucleated cells [Figures and ]. Few cells were showing squamous differentiation.

At this time, the patient also received two cycles of chemotherapy with Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, Adriamycin, and Dexamethasone. Following this, a repeat bone marrow aspirate showed complete hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular remission and the patient was continued on Dasatinib therapy.

Initial laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 3700, with 46% neutrophils and 45% lymphocytes. Blood cultures were negative for infection, and the patient did not produce adequate sputum for culture. A chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions with cardiomegaly, suggestive of right ventricular failure (). A CT scan was performed, which noted an enlarged central pulmonary artery and bilateral pleural effusions; no other abnormalities concerning the lung parenchyma, pulmonary veins, or interstitium were reported.

His history dates to June 2009, when he developed his first melanoma on the right occiput, Clark's level IV, tumor thickness 1.53 mm, nonulcerated, mitotic index 1/mm2. He was treated with wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy in June 2009, the latter being negative for nodal metastasis. In November 2009 he presented with a 1-cm blue to black nodule on the right posterior neck, which on complete lymph node biopsy demonstrated nodal metastasis, prompting a complete lymph node dissection in December 2009, during which time 46 lymph nodes were removed, all of which were negative for any additional metastasis. He developed a second primary melanoma on the right upper chest in September 2012, Clark's level IV, tumor thickness 0.9 mm, nonulcerated, mitotic index 3/mm2 that was similarly treated with wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy in November 2012; this too was negative for nodal metastasis.\nThe patient has a longstanding history of concurrent psoriasis since childhood. He has a strong family history of psoriasis in his sister, father, and maternal grandmother. Despite being of moderate severity, the psoriasis has been largely managed topically with various topical steroids and calcipotriol with betamethasone dipropionate.

Treatment was primary chemoradiotherapy. A local recurrence developed in 2009, which was treated with a left type III, modified radical neck dissection, left tracheoesophageal groove dissection, hemithyroidectomy, laryngectomy, and tracheoesophageal puncture. The postoperative course was complicated by a pharyngocutaneous fistula, which resolved with conservative management. In 2011, a regional recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma developed in the right paratracheal groove with overlying skin involvement. A right radical neck dissection, parastomal skin resection, and partial pharyngectomy was performed. Immediate reconstruction consisted of a right pectoralis major myocutaneous flap to close the hypopharynx defect with split-thickness skin grafting externally. The postoperative course was complicated by a pharyngocutaneous fistula at the superior margin of the permanent tracheostoma (). Reirradiation was performed perioperatively. Following 8 months of conservative treatment, the patient requested closure of the persistent fistula.\nBased on previous reports demonstrating recovery of radiated tissue with autologous fat grafting, fat transfer was performed in the current patient to improve tissue quality in preparation for flap transfer or as a primary means of achieving closure. Using hand-assisted liposuction techniques, autologous fat was harvested from the patient's abdomen and purified using Telfa rolling. Approximately 8 mL of purified fat were injected into the area immediately surrounding the pharyngocutaneous fistula using both blunt cannulas and 18 gauge needles ().

Plain radiographs of the abdomen showed a small round opacity, about 3-cm in diameter, in the left upper region of the abdomen, with evidence of calcifications. Chest X-ray was normal. The patient underwent ultrasound examination (US) that showed a calcified heterogeneous cystic mass between the superior left kidney pole and spleen in the retroperitoneal area. CT scanning demonstrated the presence of a solitary cystic mass with a calcified wall within the left adrenal gland with no enhancement after iv contrast media injection. No other intra-abdominal or intra-thoracic masses were found, either in the liver, peritoneum or lung. MRI T2-weighted imaging showed a hypointensive lesion with a calcified wall, and a peripheral hyperintensive nodule (Figure , ). CT and MRI findings suggested adrenal echinococcosis. The specific serology for immunoglobulin anti-E. granulosus resulted positive 1:61 (n.v. < 50). Urinary catecholamines and metanephrine levels were within normal limits. The patient confirmed that she had had animal contact. The albendazole preoperative therapy resulted in the disappareance of pain. The diagnosis was confirmed by surgery. The cyst was removed by a transabdominal laparoscopic approach. The exploration of the rest of the peritoneal cavity did not reveal any other lesions. The area around the cyst was carefully packed with gauze soaked in 20% hypertonic saline solution. The cyst was not drained nor aspirated during the procedure. An appropriate dissection plane between the cyst and the adrenal gland could not be found as it was hard and adhesive, so both the cyst and the left adrenal gland were endoscopically removed.

    "original_text": "A 52-year-old female experienced right knee joint pain when going up and down stairs one month prior to her presentation to a clinic. Examination by a local doctor and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) resulted in a diagnosis of lateral meniscus injury. She was treated conservatively for 2 months, but the pain was not alleviated, and her left knee joint also became painful so she was referred to our hospital immediately. Examination at our department showed a restriction in knee joint range of motion (ROM), with right knee extension \u221215\u00b0 and flexion 125\u00b0 and left knee extension \u221210\u00b0 and flexion 135\u00b0. Tenderness was present in the lateral femorotibial joint spaces of both knees, and clicking was palpated during flexion. The McMurray test also revealed lateral pain and clicking in both knees. There were no indirect signs of discoid lateral meniscus such as lateral joint space widening, squaring of the lateral femoral condyle, high fibular head, or hypoplasia of the lateral tibial plateau in plain radiographs (). Full-length frontal plain radiographs of the legs showed hypoplasia of the femoral lateral condyle and varus deformity of the articular surface of the proximal tibia. The femorotibial angle was 176\u00b0 on the right side and 177\u00b0 on the left side. The mechanical lateral distal femoral angle was 83\u00b0 on the right side and 80\u00b0 on the left side.

Her medical history was unremarkable. On examination, she was in discomfort, with a heart rate of 90/min, blood pressure 110/60 mmHg and respiratory rate 18/min. On palpation, epigastric tenderness was present and a pulsatile mass was detected in this region. The laboratory analysis yielded hemoglobin (Hb): 11.2 g/dl (12-16), white blood cells: 14600/mm(3) (4500-11000) with neutrophils 78%. Findings on her electrocardiography and chest radiography were interpreted as normal. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). An urgent computed tomography scan was performed which showed an infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm with a transverse diameter of 7 cm () starting 3 cm distal to renal arteries and ending 1 cm above common iliac arteries. CT findings include early detection of contrast material in the inferior vena cava, suggestive of an aortocaval fistula (). The ACF was concealed by a huge mural thrombus.\nOver the next 12 hours, the jugular venous pressure (JVP) elevated gradually, the blood pressure decreased and the patient became oliguric. Cardiac assessment did not show any pathologic change, so the patient was prepared for an emergent laparotomy. At laparotomy, a large retroperitoneal hematoma was detected and the aorta was exposed and clamped proximally from the lesser sac under the diaphragm and distally at the common iliac arteries. Having opened the aneurysm sac, the aortocaval fistula was identified. The venous bleeding into the aneurysm sac was controlled by direct pressure. The fistula was over sewn from within the aneurysm sac with 3-0 prolene. Then the aneurysm was replaced with a 20 mm diameter tubular graft.

    "original_text": "This case represents an 84-year-old man with a known history of left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery lesion with a mass noted on the tricuspid valve. He had previously undergone percutaneous coronary intervention with 2 stents placed in the LAD coronary artery, 6 years earlier. Subsequently, he was being closely followed by his cardiologist for the coronary artery lesion, when the right atrial mass was found on transthoracic echocardiography. This mass was observed for a 6-month period. A repeat echocardiogram revealed a rapid expansion of the mass. Specifically, the mass grew by 1 cm in that 6-month period. The mass was found to be fixated on the tricuspid valve. Also at this time, the patient had some complaints of dyspnea on exertion, which prompted a cardiac workup. The results of the workup eventually showed a lesion within the previously placed stent. The combination of in-stent thrombosis of the coronary stent with the rapid progression of the intracardiac mass incited the decision for surgical intervention. The patient was taken to the operating room for a single vessel coronary artery bypass grafting and excision of the intracardiac mass.\nThe operation was performed under normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass using ascending aortic and bicaval cannulation (Video). The right atrium was opened and a solid, well-encapsulated 1-by-2-cm mass was found to be attached to the atrial side of the tricuspid valve (Fig ). It was subsequently shaved off and sent to the laboratory for histological evaluation (Fig ). The right atrium was then closed, followed by the single coronary artery bypass grafting utilizing the left internal mammary artery to the LAD. After completion of the procedure, no regurgitant flow was demonstrated at the tricuspid valve. The patient was discharged 5 days after the operation, following a postoperative pneumothorax, which resolved spontaneously. The final pathology on the right atrial mass confirmed the diagnosis of PFE.[]",

Two months prior to presentation, he sustained injury to the right wrist while protecting himself with extended right upper extremity upwards from heavy object falling from a high place. Initially, he did not seek any treatment despite immediate severe pain. However, symptoms of the injured wrist, including swelling and pain increased over time. Examination of the right wrist revealed generalized swelling, diffuse tenderness, limited range of motion, at wrist and an abnormal bony prominence in the palmar aspect of the scaphoid. The function of the fingers was unimpaired. There was no sign of neurovascular injury. Radiographs of wrist showed an isolated palmar dislocation of the scaphoid and there were no abnormal findings in other carpal bones []. These findings were confirmed with computed tomography [].\nInitially, closed reduction was attempted by longitudinal traction and ulnar deviation undermanual application of direct pressure over the dislocated scaphoid under general anesthesia, but it was unsuccessful. We determined further attempts would be futile considering that 2 months had already passed from the date of trauma. Thus, open reduction was performed through a dorsal approach. After capsulotomy, the isolated palmar scaphoid dislocation was observed, and a complete tear of the scapholunate ligament was noted []. Although we could not identify the integrity of the volar side ligaments, we assumed that they were disrupted. Reduction was interrupted due to fibrotic soft tissue interposed in the scapholunate interval. After debridement and retraction, the dislocated scaphoid was reduced []. The torn scapholunate ligament was sutured using a Mitek anchor (DepuyMitek, Inc.

The patient described the pain as sharp, stabbing and localized to the lower pelvis with radiating to the anorectal area, and also complained of tenesmus. She had a traumatic injury on coccyx 50 years ago and retocele repaired with graft by surgery 15 years ago. At the beginning, she visited other clinics and had been diagnosed with levator ani syndrome. She took a daily dose of 225 mg pregabalin, 650 mg acetaminophen and 75 mg tramadol, and 25 mg sodium tianeptine. She also received superior hypogastric plexus block and caudal epidural blocks. But she was referred to our pain center because the previous therapies had been ineffective. Her pain score on the 10-grade visual analogue score system (VAS, ranging from 0 = no pain to 10 = absolutely intolerable pain) averaged 8/10. Pelvic MRI imaging showed 1.3 cm sized intramural leiomyoma. She was initially treated with caudal epidural block and ganglion impar block, but had the persistent presence of the pelvic pain and coccygodynia. We decided to perform a new technique for inferior hypogastric plexus block with a coccygeal transverse approach to reduce the pelvic pain and coccygodynia. A sufficient explanation was provided to the patient about the procedure and its complications and written consent was received from her. She was positioned prone on the table, with a pillow under the anterior superior iliac spine to flatten the normal lumbar lordosis. The midline of the sacrococcygeal area was cleaned with antiseptic, and sterile drapes were placed. The midline between S2 and S3 junction was the target anatomic landmark for the block ().

This pain was associated with nausea, vomiting and bloody diarrhea. He had no recent weight loss and no family history of bowel disease.\nUpon examination, the patient was afebrile, he had a tender abdomen with no peritoneal signs nor adenopathy. The patient\u2019s skin, including the perioral area, appeared normal, as did the oral mucosa. Laboratory tests indicated low hemoglobin levels, high white blood count, with normal liver and renal function. A contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging of the abdomen revealed a long segment of jejunal intussusception and a filling defect in the second part of the duodenum, with right side hydroureter and hydronephrosis.\nPatient was consented for an exploratory laparotomy and taken to the operating room. During his surgery, a long segment of the proximal jejunum (67 cm) was found to be invaginated into a distal jejunal segment, which confirmed the diagnosis of intussusception (Fig. ). A mass of 6 cm could be felt at the lead point of the intussusception and the invaginated loop of bowel appeared to be compromised requiring resection of the diseased segment that contains the leading intramural polyp. Careful exploration of the rest of the abdominal cavity and intestine was done, and two additional masses were felt to be tethered inside the sigmoid colon. The sigmoid was redundant and easily resected with good oncological margins (Fig. ). Giving the patient\u2019s young age, appendectomy was performed as well.\nPatient had an uneventful postoperative hospital stay and discharged on fourth day postoperative.\nHistopathology showed multiple polyps in the jejunal segment that exhibited features of PJS.

This showed a curvilinear hyperdensity in the left central sulcus region, left subinsular region, and inferior frontal operculum worrisome for an acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). CT angiography of the head and neck did not reveal overt vascular abnormalities. Further investigation with angiograms of the carotid and vertebral arteries successfully confirmed the absence of vascular lesions or aneurysms that may have accounted for hemorrhage. Noted in particular, there was no active extravasation of contrast evident during the study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed curvilinear hyperintensity filling along the left central sulcus without evidence of acute blood within the sulcus (Figure ). The MRI also revealed a second area of focal parenchymal abnormality located anterior to the left frontal horn, with subtle mass effect and associated vasogenic edema. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis from lumbar puncture did not reveal overt xanthochromia. Given these findings, intracerebral hemorrhage was felt less likely to be the cause of the patient's presentation, thus raising concern for an underlying inflammatory or neoplastic process.\nDue to concerns of an underlying malignancy, the decision was made to pursue a left frontal craniectomy with stereotactic biopsy of the abnormal leptomeningeal region within the left frontal lobe. Preliminary results from pathology revealed lymphocytic infiltration of the meninges, suggestive of either a lymphoma or inflammatory process. Final pathological results with molecular analysis supported a diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma. The lymphocyte population was comprised of mainly of CD20",

Cycloplegic refraction was +1.25 in the right eye and +2.50 in the left eye. The remaining examinations including pupils and anterior and posterior segments were unremarkable. Patching of the right eye was prescribed for 2 h daily to treat the strabismic/anisometropic amblyopia of the left eye, along with full cycloplegic spectacle correction to correct any accommodative component of the esotropia. On further follow-up, she was noted to have decreased vision in the left eye seeing 20/130 compared to 20/63 in the right eye using PLT. She continued to have a left esotropia of 30 PD with correction and 40 PD without correction. The family was counseled about the likely need for strabismus surgery to treat this partially accommodative esotropia.

She underwent an uneventful laparoscopic-assisted extended right hemicolectomy and was discharged in stable condition on post-operative day 5. She presented to our emergency department (ED) on post-operative day 10 complaining of diffuse abdominal pain, hematemesis and subjective fevers. Computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen demonstrated a significant amount of free intraperitoneal fluid and associated pneumoperitoneum; she was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy. Upon entry into the abdomen, she was found to have a significant volume of succus and a small anastomotic leak. The anastomosis was resected and an end ileostomy was created. The patient's vital signs were stable and remarkable only for a low grade tachycardia throughout the procedure. She was extubated immediately after the operation. However, due to the patient's persistent obtundation following extubation, she was brought to the intensive care unit (ICU). While her oxygen saturation remained above 95% on supplemental oxygen with both oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airways in place, she failed to regain consciousness. When she was noted to be apneic, her respiration was supported with bag valve mask ventilation. The patient was given naloxone, glycopyrrolate and neostigmine to counteract the opioid and paralytic agents received during her procedure without any clinical improvement in her neurologic status. While bedside blood glucose testing was within normal limits, an arterial blood gas demonstrated a profound respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.03, a PCO2 of 107 and a PaO2 of 375. She was re-intubated for hypercapnic respiratory failure and all sedating medications were held.\nShe continued to have no evidence of neurologic improvement, prompting cerebral imaging.

The pain was initially described as being most severe in the suprapubic area, followed by diffuse involvement of the entire abdomen, and ultimately localizing to the right lower quadrant. The clinical differential diagnosis at this point included acute appendicitis, ovarian cyst with possible rupture, urinary tract infection, internal hemorrhoids, inflammatory bowel disease, and pancreatitis. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated an irregular, right adnexal mass measuring 8.8 \u00d7 7.8 cm (). A pelvic ultrasound also demonstrated a large right adnexal mass measuring 9.1 \u00d7 8.4 \u00d7 7.7 cm with internal vascularity. The mass was radiographically concerning for an adnexal tumor with possible ovarian torsion. The decision was made to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy and remove the adnexal mass. During the operation, the mass was noted to be an extrinsic sigmoid colon mass with active bleeding and hemoperitoneum (approximately 400 milliliters of blood) without involvement of the adnexa. The uterus, bilateral fallopian tubes, ovaries, and liver were grossly normal intraoperatively. The procedure was changed to an open laparotomy and the mass was resected along with the sigmoid colon and a low pelvic anastomosis was performed. The patient recuperated well after surgery. A CT scan was performed after six months to assess for residual or metastatic disease. The scan demonstrated multiple new ill-defined, low attenuating lesions in the liver, the largest measuring 6 cm in greatest dimension. A follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed several subtle, ill-defined areas of restricted diffusion that were not consistent with metastatic disease. Four years after surgery, the patient remains free of disease.\nGrossly, the mass was fragmented and 16 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 9 cm in size (aggregate measurement). The mass was well-circumscribed but unencapsulated and appeared to arise from the serosal surface of the sigmoid colon ().",

The preoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20 / 20, and the retinal examination was normal except for peripheral lattice degeneration in both eyes. The preoperative cycloplegic refractive error (spherical equivalent) was -4.5 and -5.0 diopters in the right eye and the left eye, respectively. Post-PRK uncorrected visual acuity was 20 / 20 in both eyes. Two months later, the visual acuity of the left eye had decreased to 20 / 70. Fundoscopy and macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a stage II macular hole of the left eye (). Simultaneous OCT of the right eye showed vitreous traction on the fovea and mild elevation of the outer retinal layers ().\nOne month later, the patient underwent 23-gauge sutureless pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), localized posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) induction in the posterior pole, internal limiting membrane peeling and administration of sulphur hexafluoride gas as a tamponade in the left eye. During the operation, the patient was found to have inferotemporal peripheral lattice degeneration with multiple holes, around which a double line of barrier laser spots was introduced.

With a past history of asthma, he was on inhalers on an occasional basis. Having been experiencing disfigurement-related emotional and psychosocial abuse after burn injuries, he expressed a strong desire to have his original appearance restored. Accordingly, a two-stage reconstructive procedure was performed.\nGiven severe hypertrophic scars in his pectoral and supraclavicular areas resulting from the original burn injury, the occipito-dorsal area was the only available and appropriate donor site of local autologous skin for neck reconstruction. Accordingly, bilateral pre-expansion of occipito-dorsal flaps was conducted. Under general anaesthesia in the prone position, the shape of the flap was designed in a way to match the recipient site and the occipital arteries were identified and marked on the skin using a portable Doppler ultrasound machine [Figure ]. Tissue expanders were positioned in a suprafascial plane inferior to the pedicle and deep to the center of the earlier defined occipito-dorsal flap, and the skin was closed directly. The expanders were inflated over a period of 3 months to a volume of 700 ml each. Prior to raising the flap, the occipital arteries were again dopplered and the flap was raised on a narrow isthmus, with precautions taken to ensure the flap remained above the fascial layer over the posterior trunk musculature. Once elevated, the flap was thinned to the layer in which the subdermal vascular network became visible through a layer of fat.

On initial presentation, his vitals were normal except for a pulse oximetry of 89% and a weight of 102 kg with body mass index (BMI) of 29.8 kg/m2. Even though he complained of low grade fever, his initial temperature was normal at 36.8\u00b0C. His cardiovascular system examination revealed a regular rhythm with normal venous pressure and heart sounds. The only positive finding in his physical examination was crackles in the back of the chest. His chest X-ray and CT scan showed multifocal bilateral infiltrates (). Initial ECG was within normal limits, with a normal PR interval of 160 ms. He was admitted to the hospital and started treatment with supplemental oxygen via a nasal canula and the antibiotics azithromycin and ceftriaxone. COVID-19 test by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was returned positive later that day. Two days later, he developed crushing substernal chest pain with serial ECG changes suggestive of posterior myocardial infarction.

Post-procedure, he was initiated on clopidrogel 75 mg/day in addition to aspirin 81 mg/day that was started previously. During the procedure, his respiratory distress worsened, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Her medical history was noncontributory. There was no history suggestive of abdominal cramps, diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, or any other gastrointestinal disorders. Systemic examination did not reveal any abnormalities. Examination revealed a nontender, diffuse, firm swelling of the upper lip. The surrounding facial skin showed diffuse erythematous swelling. The surface of the lip was smooth with no signs of scabs, bleeding, or exudation. No fissuring of the tongue, oral ulcers, or hypertrophy of the oral mucosa was noticed. There was no palsy of facial muscles. The patient had received intralesional triamcinolone injections in the past with temporary remissions and recurrences of the swelling. A chest radiograph, complete haemogram, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum folate, iron, and vitamin B12 levels, serum levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme, were ordered, which were in normal range. The tuberculin skin test for tuberculosis was negative. Ultrasonography of the upper lip revealed a mildly increased vascularity in the region. The diagnosis of cheilitis granulomatosa was confirmed on a histopathological examination, which revealed Langhans type giant cells, epithelioid cells, lymphocytes, and few neutrophils (). We decided to treat her with a combination of intralesional weekly injections of triamcinolone acetonide 10 mg/mL in the upper lip for 4 weeks, along with oral metronidazole 400 mg three times a day and oral minocycline 100 mg daily. There was a significant improvement in the labial swelling and erythema after 15 days of treatment. The gingival swelling also subsided after 20 days. After one month, metronidazole was withdrawn and minocycline was continued on alternate days for an additional one month. A recurrence of swelling of the upper lip was noticed after 4 months, which subsided with an injection",
