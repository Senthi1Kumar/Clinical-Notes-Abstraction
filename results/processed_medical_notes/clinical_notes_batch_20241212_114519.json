A bag containing a broken pen with a missing tip accompanied him. The patient was catatonic and noncooperative, so no history could be obtained. After administering Zyprexa 10 mg and Clonex 1 mg, we were able to examine the patient. On examination the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in his right eye was 20/150 and intraocular pressure (IOP) was 20 mmHg. The patient had right periorbital edema and ecchymosis, severe conjunctival chemosis, corneal erosions, and a clean anterior chamber. The pupil was dilated with no direct or consensual response to light. The vitreous was clear and fundoscopy showed a completely normal disc and retina. In addition, the patient had positive right relative afferent papillary defect (RAPD) and a complete ophthalmoplegia of the right eye. Examination of the left eye was normal, with visual acuity of 20/20 and IOP of 14 mmHg.\nOn orbital CT there was no sign of perforation. It did show, however, a metallic foreign body in the right orbital apex close to the optic nerve and adjacent to the superior orbital fissure ().\nBecause the patient displayed signs of traumatic orbital apex syndrome, we planned an urgent surgery to remove the foreign body.

Workup revealed severe anemia and a hemoglobin level of 3.8 g/dL (reference range: 12\u201316). Colonoscopy revealed innumerable colonic polyps beginning at the cecum and extending to the sigmoid colon, with sparing of the rectum, and the patient was diagnosed with FAP. A total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis was performed without complication (Fig. ). Pathology subsequently revealed a T3 adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon with 1 positive lymph node out of 75 examined. The patient subsequently received 12 cycles of adjuvant FOLFOX.\nSurveillance CT scanning in late 2019 revealed a suspicious mass in the superior perirectal soft tissue (Fig. ). The patient exhibited no related symptoms at that time. Follow-up PET scanning revealed a PET-avid mass within the left superior mesorectal soft tissue, corresponding to the mass noted on the CT scan (Fig. ). No other suspicious lesions were identified.

There was no excessive bleeding, vomiting or loss of consciousness and respiratory distress. The relatives of the patient did not make any attempt to remove the protruding wooden piece. Within 3 h of the primary incidence, the patient was transported to the emergency department of the B P Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, Nepal. The patient did not have any history of dyspnea, dysphagia, oronasopharyngeal bleeding and neurological deficit. Mild trickling of blood from the entry site was noticed in the hospital. The arterial pressure was 130/86mmHg and the pulse rate was 80/min. The bamboo stick was seen protruding through his mouth []. The entry point was 3cm longer in transverse diameter in between the mandible and the lower lip toward the right side. A hard 13cm long and 4cm wide longitudinal swelling extending from the under lip to the clavicle was palpated []. It was found that the distal end of the wooden stick moved with movement of the proximal end. No other swelling was revealed in other part on the neck. A further examination of the neck revealed the absence of subcutaneous emphysema, bruit, thrill, stridor and respiratory distress. The pulsation of the carotid and superficial temporal artery was intact bilaterally and was also absolutely symmetrical in radial and brachial pulse.

Laboratory tests revealed mild inflammation, with a white blood cell count of 10,100 /\u03bcL and C-reactive protein level of 0.9 mg/dL. The peritoneal fluid cell count was increased at 980 /mL. Based on these findings, PD-associated peritonitis was diagnosed. CT showed localized dilation of the intestine, which suggested adhesive small bowel obstruction (Fig. ). As we suspected that the peritonitis might be associated with bacterial translocation from the dilated intestine, he was advised to stop eating and was switched from CAPD to hemodialysis.

The patient did not have a history of fever, weight loss, malaise, or carotid tenderness but had a 1-year-old history of dyspnea on exertion. The patient never had any previous indications of autoimmune diseases or infections. Approximately 17 years earlier, at the age of 24, the patient experienced a frequent loss of consciousness during exercise. He had no history of hypertension, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia, or obesity. The patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy a year ago, and echocardiography showed that all chambers were dilated with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 39%. The patient had received an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a beta-blocker, and spironolactone and had good compliance and functional outcomes as the patient has presently been classified as New York Heart Association functional class I. Physical examinations revealed blood pressure of < 120/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 60 beats per minute (bpm) because of the optimal medical treatment he had received since last year. The patient had left carotid bruit and an enlarged heart with a grade IV/VI holosystolic murmur on the apex radiating to the axilla. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly, and electrocardiography revealed sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 64 bpm, poor R wave progression, and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (Fig. ). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed eccentric LVH with reduced ejection fraction and some hypoechoic lesions resembling cysts at the anterior, anteroseptal, and anterolateral walls, suggestive of myocardial detachment. Both ventricles were dilated with reduced LVEF (31%).

Catheterization was attempted; however, it was unsuccessful. Ultrasound revealed an overdistended urinary bladder with a normal-sized prostate and scarring and focal caliectasis in the left kidney (). The right kidney was normal and no calculi were seen on either side on ultrasound. Serum electrolyte, renal and liver functions were normal. The haemogram revealed neutrophilia. The prostate-specific antigen was within normal limits. A rigid urethroscopy was performed owing to suspicion of a left urethral calculus and a 11-mm size calculus was removed from the posterior urethra. The patient was discharged and had no difficulty with micturition for 2 weeks thereafter. The patient subsequently developed burning micturition with hesitancy and induration in the perineal region. The urine was turbid and microscopy revealed the presence of Escherichia coli. A perineal ultrasound revealed an abscess in the perineum, which extended to the proximal parts of the corpus spongiosum (). This abscess was drained under saddle block. The patient subsequently developed a discharging sinus at the operative site () leaking purulent fluid. A retrograde urography revealed periurethral extravasation of the injected contrast material with a lytic lesion in the left pubic ramus (). A repeat perineal ultrasound revealed a linear hypoechoic tract leading from the skin surface to the corpus spongiosum ().

On observation, the patient had thin built and appeared pale with body mass index (BMI) of 13.3 kg/m2. On clinical examination, she was found to have a 7 \u00d7 3 inches large lump in the epigastric region which was freely mobile. Recent blood investigations revealed Hemoglobin to be 11.6 gm/dL with no electrolyte abnormalities. USG epigastrium revealed a well-defined mixed echogenic mass lesion predominantly hyperechoic in echotexture of size ~ 65 \u00d7 75 mm.

Enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a hypervascular mass of 35 mm in diameter in the descending portion of the duodenum (Fig. ), and the left three sections of the liver were occupied by multiple cystic tumors with contrast enhancement of the cystic wall, 13 cm in diameter (Fig. ). A duodenal tumor was identified on gastrointestinal endoscopy (Fig. ), and a biopsy revealed a NET. The serum levels of insulin, gastrin, and glucagon were within normal ranges. CT did not initially reveal evidence of pancreatic invasion between the tumor and the pancreas; however, irregularities of the duodenal wall and swelling of the lymph nodes around the pancreatic parenchyma were observed. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with non-functional duodenal NET with multiple liver metastases, T2N1M1 stage IV (UICC 8th). In addition, CT revealed the anatomical variation of the CHA, which branched from the SMA and ran fully through the head of the pancreatic parenchyma (Fig. , Additional file Figure S1). The CHA branches into the left hepatic artery (LHA), the middle hepatic artery (MHA), and the right hepatic artery (RHA) (Fig. a, b). Furthermore, a developed gastric arterial arcade, 4 mm in diameter, was found between the left gastric artery (LGA) and the right gastric artery (RGA).

Two weeks prior to disease onset, she had been exposed to bank voles while cleaning out a cabin. For 6 days following disease onset, she had been ill with fever, chills, weakness, low urine production, and difficulties eating and drinking. The patient had positive serology for Puumala virus thereby confirming the HFRS diagnosis. Laboratory tests taken the day before admission revealed thrombocytopenia (platelet count: 48 \u00d7 10\n9\n/L), impaired renal function (creatinine: 278 \u03bcmol/L), and leucocytosis (white blood cell count: 14 \u00d7 10\n9\n/L).

In the physical examination, we noted an ulcerative nodule with a 3 cm diameter, moveable with the skin and non-stick with the layer underneath (the muscles) [].\nSystemic investigations, including complete blood count (CBC), liver and renal function test, and blood sugar level were normal. With these clinical findings, Leishmania and squamous cell carcinoma were considered and a biopsy was required. An excisional biopsy was performed and sent to the pathology department, where one section measuring 3 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 9 was studied, Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections showed ulcerated epidermis. Interlacing fascicles of elongated spindle-shaped cells with blunt-ended (cigar-shaped) nuclei invading the dermis and parts of subcutaneous adipose tissue. The nuclei revealed variable pleomorphism & hyperchromasia with scattered atypical mitosis. All the deep and lateral surgical borders were free of malignancy [].

An MRI of the brain showed a large mass in the left frontal area () and a stereotactic biopsy showed that the tumor consisted of a diffuse proliferation of large lymphoid cells with frequent mitotic figures and necrotic cells (). A CD20 immunostain was strongly positive in the tumor cells (). A ki-67 immunostain showed a proliferation index of approximately 90% (). A bcl-2 immunostain was positive whereas immunostains for bcl-1, CD5, and CD10 were negative (not shown). A FISH study was negative for MYC translocation. The overall pathologic findings were diagnostic of a diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Workup for systemic disease including bone marrow biopsy, CT scans, and a lumbar puncture for CSF examination was all negative; therefore, he was diagnosed with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL). The workup for HIV disease was negative. The patient was treated with 8 cycles of high dose methotrexate, with significant improvement in his symptoms. He was given adjuvant radiation after completion of his chemotherapy and, in February 2010, acquired complete remission. A posttreatment MRI brain showed no recurrent neoplasm.\nHe stayed in remission until August 2012, when he presented with a palpable 1.5 cm nodule, in the lumbosacral region, the site of a previous lumbar puncture. A biopsy of the lesion showed a diffuse large B cell lymphoma, consistent with recurrence of the original CNS lymphoma. He underwent local excision followed by chemotherapy, in the form of 4 cycles of the R-CHOP (Rituxan, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone) regimen, to treat the recurrent nature of his disease.

He had been surgically treated for early colon cancer and abdominal aortic aneurysm and nonsurgically for sigmoid colon volvulus. After being aware of insidiously presenting abdominal distention, the patient had failed to defecate for 12 h due to lack of intestinal peristalsis. He had no fever and complained of neither chills nor abdominal pain. Blood tests showed a mild inflammatory response and normal CPK level: white blood cells 10,200/\u03bcL, C-reactive protein 0.183 mg/dL, and CPK 89 U/L. Plain abdominal radiograph and enhanced CT showed a markedly dilated colon in the fashion of the so-called coffee bean sign (Fig. ). Blood test and enhanced CT findings (Fig. ) led to the diagnosis of sigmoid volvulus without colon necrosis. The patient underwent initial and careful endoscopic reduction (Fig. ), leading to the successful reduction of the sigmoid volvulus followed by the improvement of abdominal distention. Although pretreatment assessment was sigmoid volvulus without colon necrosis, postreduction endoscopy showed widespread presumed mucosal ischemia (Fig. ). Considerable spread of the affected mucosa made it difficult for us to rule out the presence of transmural ischemia, which could lead to the necrosis of the sigmoid colon followed by peritonitis. However, we judged that the patient lacked the definitive evidence of necrosis of the detorsed sigmoid colon and decided to follow the patient with infusion, nil per os, and antibiotics administration under careful observation.

He was hospitalized and underwent extensive neurologic workup due to a rapidly progressive sensorimotor neuropathy. Diaphragmatic involvement and subsequent ventilator dependence required tracheostomy placement and prolonged hospitalization. The patient was determined to have an inflammatory neuropathy due to anti-neurofascin 155 antibodies. Treatment options for this pathology are limited and poorly defined, but theoretic benefit could be achieved via anti-CD20 biologic therapy with rituximab. A six-dose course was planned and initiated.\nThe hospitalization was complicated by voluminous respiratory secretions and three separate clinical syndromes consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia. Despite aggressive nursing care, the patient developed a sacral wound which progressed to stage 3. Given need for multiple antibiotic and vasoactive infusions over the course of his stay, a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was placed on hospital day fourteen. These infections created delays in biologic therapy for his inflammatory neuropathy. However, he was able to receive his second of six planned rituximab infusions on hospital day fifty-eight.\nOn hospital day sixty, the patient developed hypotension, hypoxia, and leukocytosis consistent with sepsis physiology. Two blood cultures were collected peripherally forty minutes apart as part of broad workup for decompensation. Neither was drawn from the PICC line. After twenty-one hours, the first culture resulted as Gram-positive cocci in clusters, and rapid multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing by the FilmArray blood culture identification panel (BioFire Diagnostics LLC, Salt Lake City, UT) suggested coagulase-negative staphylococcus with resistance due to mecA.

Gross examinations revealed no metastatic lesions or lymph node swelling.

At this stage, the left large monocytic cyst appeared to merge with the smaller right multilocular cyst, forming a large cyst occupying the entire pelvic cavity, which was later confirmed by laparoscopic findings.\nThis large cyst showed no solid-part or papillary growth. The serum levels of tumor markers remained normal. Malignant ovarian tumor could not be ruled out but was considered less likely.

His arm pain corresponded to the right C6 and C7 dermatomes.\nWe carried out an X-ray image examination of our patient\u2019s cervical spine and diagnosed a slight cervical spondylolisthesis (Figure ). CT and MRI were not performed. Because our patient did not show motor weakness or paralysis, his neck and arm pain were treated conservatively. However, the pain did not change over the six weeks following the injury. We conducted further X-ray imaging, MRI and CT eight weeks after the injury (Figures a,b,c, and ). Plain X-ray film images obtained at this time showed increased instability at the C5 to C6 joint when compared with those taken immediately after the accident (Figure a,b,c). MRI revealed central spinal canal stenosis at the C5 to C6 joint and high signal intensity in the spinal cord on T2-weighted imaging (Figure ).

    "original_text": "A 32-year-old Caucasian male presented with sudden onset of a chest and epigastric pain. His past medical history was significant only for a personal and family history of polycystic kidney disease. Upon arrival at the emergency department, the patient was hypoxic and tachycardic. Physical examination was significant for bilateral subcutaneous emphysema present over the lateral aspects of the neck. His abdomen was soft and not distended.\nA computed tomographic scan revealed air and fluid surrounding the esophagus (Fig. ). Esophagogram performed with water-soluble contrast media showed a distal esophageal perforation with a free leak into a large mediastinal cavity to the left of the esophagus (Fig. ). The patient was triaged directly to the operation room. A left chest tube was placed with improvement in his oxygenation, and grossly murky fluid was drained. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed next and revealed a very small caliber esophagus with concentric ringed appearance. A tight stricture was noted in the mid-esophagus, which only allowed passage of a pediatric gastroscope. In the lower esophagus, a 2-cm tear with necrotic edges was visualized 3 cm above the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. With this diffusely strictured and very diseased appearance of the esophagus, the decision was made to proceed with stent placement and thoracoscopic drainage of the mediastinum rather than primary surgical repair via thoracotomy. A fully covered, 15 cm \u00d7 19 mm, EndoMAXX\u00ae esophageal stent was successfully placed covering the perforation site. Mediastinal washout and drainage was performed subsequently via left thoracoscopy. A postoperative esophagram showed no leak and the patient was started on a liquid diet that was tolerated well.

There was nothing significant in the ante-partum history. The child looked well and active. Developmental milestones were normal. Head circumference was 42.3 cm (within normal limits). Fontanellae were normally palpable. There were no craniofacial abnormality, organomegaly or neurocutaneous markers.\nComputed tomography (CT) scan (head) was normal. EEG graph included normal drowsy and sleep-state patterns, which were consistent with the age of the patient. Background EEG frequency ranged between 2 and 5 Hz with amplitude of 150-200 \u03bcV. At places, sleep markers in the form of V-waves, K-complexes, and sleep spindles were also seen. There was no epileptiform activity.\nSeizure description included initial tonic motor activity, which was followed by asymmetrical facial movements and clonic activity. These were accompanied by uprolling of eye balls and unconsciousness, and the child used to get cyanosed during these episodes. The parents reported that the total duration of the seizure was between 5 and 15 min. Frequency of seizures varied from 3 to 4 per week to 1 per month. Parents were reassured regarding the benign nature and excellent prognosis in this disorder.\nThere was very strong family history of seizures involving nine cases in two successive generations []. Males and females were almost equally involved. The age of onset was remarkably constant. The seizure phenomenology and its occurrence on the 4th day of life were similar among all these cases and it resembled the description as noted above.

The draining tract was associated with extensive scar tissue, reduced mandibular range of motion, progressive oral pain, and frequent head-shaking. The dog was adopted 4 months before presentation after being rescued. Since the adoption, the dog was treated for the draining tract with multiple antibiotics with no apparent resolution of the condition.\nOral and maxillofacial examination revealed a moderately atrophied temporal and masseter musculature, substantial scar tissue, and contraction of the skin on the left side of the face. In addition, a draining tract with hemorrhagic purulent discharge at the left TMJ area was noted (). Multiple tooth fractures were also noted as well as mild generalized dental plaque and calculus accumulation. It was estimated that mouth opening was ~75% of normal opening on both an awake examination and an examination under general anesthesia. Complete blood count, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis were within the normal limits. Ultrasound of the left TMJ area revealed potential osteomyelitis of the zygomatic arch with suspected sequestrum and regional cellulitis with possible TMJ involvement.\nPre- and post-contrast CT images of the skull were obtained as described earlier. Severe chronic septic arthritis of the left TMJ, characterized by full destruction of the articular surfaces as well as osteomyelitis of the zygoma and sequestrum formation, was noted.

His parents complained that he had bleeding gums in his lower and upper jaws, pain in sucking and consequent difficulties in feeding. He was full-term born and his weight at birth was 2900g. His past medical history was not significant.No noticeable findings were recorded during an extraoral examination. The intraoral examination revealed multiple whitish small masses localized on the alveolar ridge of his maxilla and mandible. His mandibular alveolar ridge showed small nodular lesions in the region of the right deciduous canine and left deciduous canine and first molar (Figure \n). The size of these masses varied from 3 to 4mm in diameter.\nA surgical removal of the lesions was planned in order to solve feeding problems and bleeding.\nThe excisions were performed in different sessions in order to limit the postoperative discomfort to the baby. All oral surgeries were performed under local anesthesia (mepivacaine 3% without adrenalin) with a 15C scalpel blade. After excision of the cysts a sponge of fibrin was used and the wounds were sutured with resorbable polyglactin suture (Vicryl 4-0; Ethicon, Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA) that was removed after 10 days.The first surgery involved the excision of two lesions on his left mandibular gum (Figure \n).The second surgical session was made after 15 days. The excision of his right mandibular lesions revealed a neonatal tooth. In this step the surgeon decided not to remove it because the tooth incisal margin was below the gingival level and it would not create feeding problems (Figure \n).

After the carpal tunnel releases, the tingling in both hands gradually disappeared, but a new tingling sensation on the right fifth finger commenced 11 weeks after the carpal tunnel release. There was no history of localized, direct trauma around the right wrist after the carpal tunnel release. The physical examination demonstrated mild hypesthesia on the right fifth digit. According to the Medical Research Council scale, the strengths of the right abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles were grade 4, whereas other muscle strengths of the right upper extremity, including flexor digitorum profundus III & IV and flexor carpi ulnaris muscles, were grade 5. There was no significant atrophy on the right hypothenar area. Froment's test was negative on both sides, while the nerve percussion sign was positive over the ulnar side of the right wrist. Deep tendon reflexes were normal bilaterally.\nPrior to the carpal tunnel release, nerve conduction studies (NCS) had been performed on both upper extremities (). Bilateral median motor NCS with abductor pollicis brevis (APB) recordings had demonstrated prolonged latency and low amplitude on the left side, with normal responses on the right. Median nerve sensory responses showed prolonged latencies and low amplitudes at the wrist bilaterally. Needle electromyographic findings of the left abductor pollicis brevis muscle revealed abnormal spontaneous activities and polyphasic motor unit potentials with reduced recruitment patterns.

She was also admitted due to a headache that was triggered primarily by coughing. Vital signs on admission were as follows: a blood pressure of 202/90 mmHg, a heart rate of 137 bpm, a respiratory rate of 20, and a temperature of 36.6 Celsius. Physical exam revealed Janeway lesions. She was found to have a neutrophilic leukocytosis, with white blood cell count at 20.4 cells/mm3 and neutrophils at 17.4 bil/L. Troponin was elevated at 1.85; this was deemed to be noncardiac in nature as the patient's pain was relieved with ibuprofen and her EKG showed no acute findings. ESR and CRP were elevated at 95 mm/hr and 24.8 mg/dL, respectively. A computed tomography of the brain showed a high-density mass in the right occipital lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema. The patient continued to deny any visual changes or symptoms other than what was discussed above. An ophthalmologist was consulted to perform a dilated fundus exam, which was positive for small intraretinal hemorrhages that were deemed to be secondary to the patient's hypertension and less likely positive for Roth's spots. There was no evidence of disc edema. A brain MRI with and without gadolinium showed multiple small punctate bilateral areas of acute or subacute infarctions indicative of embolic phenomenon. The hemorrhagic area in the right occipital lobe was again identified, with subtle surrounding enhancement; the differential diagnosis consisted of neoplasm, vascular malformation, or embolic infarction with hemorrhagic conversion. A transthoracic 2D echo was without vegetation, so a transesophageal echo was ordered, and vegetation was shown on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Two blood cultures from admission then",

He was status-post esophagogastrectomy with colonic interposition and J-tube insertion performed at an outside facility, approximately six months ago. Pain was intermittently present since the time of surgery, moderate intensity, gradually worsening, associated with intractable nausea and vomiting, and located in the left lower quadrant. Patient was well oriented and awake, physical examination was significant for tachycardia and mildly tender left upper quadrant of abdomen. On admission, the computer tomographic (CT) imaging of abdomen/pelvis with contrast showed post-surgical changes and generalized mesenteric edema with no evidence of mesenteric ischemia or internal hernia. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was significant for some ulcerative changes at the site of surgical anastomosis, without stenosis and the pathology results were negative for intestinal metaplasia. Through the early course of hospitalization, he was still unable to tolerate diet orally. By hospital day four, he started complaining of blurred right eye vision and horizontal gaze palsy (cranial nerve-VI palsy) was appreciable on physical examination. Computer tomography brain without contrast ruled out intracranial hemorrhage with no evidence of acute pathology. On hospital day six, he was complaining of dizziness that progressively worsened. By the seventh day, his symptoms progressed complicated by confabulation and hallucinations. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits, were normal.\nBy this time, differential diagnosis included intermittent porphyria and Wernicke's encephalopathy. Urine porphobilinogen was negative; and patient was started on thiamine. On hospital day 9, he was intubated secondary to worsening encephalopathy and inability to maintain his airway. He was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Of note, the patient had a large volume aspiration event of brownish fluid during the endotracheal intubation.
