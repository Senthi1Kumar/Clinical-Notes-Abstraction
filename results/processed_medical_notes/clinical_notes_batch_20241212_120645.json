    "original_text": "A 65-year-old Japanese male was admitted for evaluation of an abdominal tumor. The tumor was detected by chance during a chest CT performed for a lung examination. The patient had no past history of any abdominal surgery, and his vital signs were stable. There is nothing particularly significant in the findings of the laboratory examination. Tumor markers are negative.\nEnhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a slightly enhanced heterogeneous tumor, 18 mm in diameter, between the Spiegel lobe of the liver and the IVC in early-phase images (), with no enhancement or washout in late-phase images (). Magnetic resonance imaging of this tumor revealed a contrasting low intensity on the T1-weighted image () and high intensity on the T2-weighted image (). Upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy revealed no evidence of a malignant tumor in the gastrointestinal tract. We diagnosed this tumor as either a hepatic tumor in the Spiegel lobe or a retroperitoneal tumor such as leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma.\nA laparotomy was performed, and the surface of the tumor was found to be smooth and slightly adhesive. To expose the affected IVC lesion, we need to mobilize some parts of the right lobe of the liver. This tumor was not located in the liver but originated in the IVC. We extirpated the tumor by performing a wedged resection of the wall of the IVC and sutured primary IVC wall. We controlled the bleeding from the IVC using the hemostatic forceps. The resected specimen was solid with a smooth surface (). Microscopic examination revealed that the tumor consisted of uniform and spindle cells and had a fascicular growth pattern. This pathological feature was compatible with a mesenchymal tumor (). Immunohistochemical staining revealed that \u03b1-SMA and HHF35 were expressed in this tumor (Figures and ), and c-kit and CD34 were negative. The MIB-1 index was about 60% ().

    "original_text": "A 65-year-old male positive for hepatitis C virus antibody had been treated for HCCs in the liver segments 5, 6, 7, 8 in our hospital since October 2014. The patient was initially treated for the ruptured HCC in the segment 5 with TACE, while subsequent examinations detected other HCCs in segments 6, 7 and 8 which were similarly treated by 2nd line TACE, following the Japanese HCC therapeutic guidelines. After the treatment, the tumors in segments 6 and 7 were well controlled, while the pre-ruptured tumor in segment 5 and the lesion in segment 8 still remained viable. Hence, a 3rd line TACE was performed after 6 months: while the segment 8 tumor were well embolized after the treatment, the segment 5 tumor could not be embolized completely.

After being unsupervised for approximately 4 h, the patient was discovered unconscious with a partially empty medication bottle at her side with an estimated phenelzine ingestion of 40 tablets. There was no indication of any other ingestion. Initial vitals in the emergency department revealed a temperature of 101.1 F, blood pressure of 131/80 mmHg, heart rate of 116 bpm, respiratory rate of 28, and an oxygen saturation of 94% on 2 L nasal cannula. The ECG showed sinus tachycardia with a rate 125, QRS 84 ms, and QTc 409 ms.

He had also undergone percutaneous coronary intervention on his right coronary artery 2 years previously. He was diagnosed with a reduced ejection fraction (22%) heart failure after transthoracic echocardiography. His medications included enalapril (10 mg twice daily), carvedilol (25 mg), spironolactone (50 mg), acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg), and ivabradine (7.5 mg). Despite optimal therapy for 8 months, his resting dyspnea and pretibial edema worsened gradually and his exercise capacity was very limited (New York Heart Association functional class III). The 6-minute walking test was performed, and the result was reported to be 180 m. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm and left bundle branch block with a QRS of 152 ms (). The previous cardiology center attempted to implant a CRT-D in order to palliate the symptoms. Following the failure of the implantation, the patient was referred to our department for reassessment. Another implantation procedure was planned because the patient\u2019s cardiac status sufficiently fulfilled the criteria for CRT-D implantation.\nAfter the cannulation of the coronary sinus with an electrophysiology catheter, a coronary sinus access catheter was placed in the coronary sinus. The angiography of the coronary sinus was performed with a balloon catheter. Efforts were made to place the left ventricular lead in the coronary sinus; however, high tortuosity thwarted the attempts. During maneuvers to detect the middle cardiac vein, the posterior vein was observed to be draining directly into the right atrium (, , and ).

His CHA2DS2-VASc score was 3, for diastolic heart failure, age, and history of hypertension, and HAS-BLED score was calculated to be 4, putting him at elevated risk for another serious bleed while on therapeutic anticoagulation. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia, and transseptal access was performed with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and fluoroscopy guidance. His maximum LAA width measured by echocardiography was 21 mm with maximum depth, 27 mm, measured to the anterior lobe. A 27-mm Watchman device was selected and prepped in the usual fashion and delivered via a dual curve sheath. The activated clotting time during deployment was 213 seconds. As the device was being delivered through the sheath at the area of greatest curvature, the sheath whipped anteriorly before the device exited. Contrast injection during fluoroscopy revealed pericardial staining. Given a presumptive diagnosis of LAA perforation, the device was deployed with sheath remaining in the same distal position given the concern for losing LAA access. After deployment, angiography through the sheath confirmed LAA laceration, with TEE visualization of the device in the transverse sinus (). Given increasing hypotension, 2 pericardial drains were placed with acute evacuation of approximately 1 L of blood. The patient was immediately transfused with packed red blood cells, and anticoagulation was reversed with protamine with the sheath remaining in the atrium. The patient was hemodynamically stabilized but required continuous pericardial drainage despite reversal of anticoagulation. Given the presence of an intact proximal portion of the LAA, the decision was made to deploy the device in the LAA to provide an impediment to blood loss. Following device deployment guided primarily by TEE visualization of the delivery sheath, there was an almost immediate cessation of fluid accumulation in the pericardial space.

In October 1963 he underwent tumor resection and substitution by autogenous bone graft. In 1964 his tumor recurred, and he had a resection of the distal femur and knee arthrodesis using a Kuntscher nail, which was a popular technique for the management of bone tumors at that time.\nFrom 1964 until 2003, the patient was lost to follow-up, according to his history. He was not complaining of pain or any other knee symptoms until July 2003 when he experienced gradually increasing pain of his left knee, and a sense of instability. The pain and instability slowly increased despite the use of a knee brace. Clinical evaluation of the knee revealed minimal movement, that is, a state of pseudarthrosis, with obvious varus deformity. X-rays were taken and revealed marked arthritic changes in an almost pseudoarthrotic knee joint (). Leg length discrepancy (LLD) was 5 cm. We discussed the treatment options with the patient, including refusion either with a bone graft or by distraction osteogenesis, or the challenging option of desarthrodesis and conversion to TKA. The patient chose the most difficult: to convert his failed knee arthrodesis by a TKA. We explained to him the possible complications which could include amputation.\nIn 2005, the surgery was performed under general anesthesia and excision of the arthrodesis via an anteromedial approach was carried out (). Reconstruction was done using a Howmedica Modular Reconstruction System (HMRS) with correction of the LLD and the varus deformity. A lateral release incision was performed to release the lateral patellar retinaculum. Skin closure was feasible without tension (Figures and ). There was blood loss of 330 mL, and the surgery took 3 hours and 35 minutes.\nImmediately postoperatively, the knee joint did not show much improvement with an ROM about 0\u201340\u00b0",

Intermittent HD was then performed on central venous hemodialysis catheters, complicated by bilateral jugular thrombosis.

A cementless total hip arthroplasty prosthesis was implanted through a transgluteal approach. A combination of a ceramic acetabular liner with a 36 mm ceramic femoral head was chosen. During the procedure, a low femoral neck cut resulted in a fracture of the greater trochanter, which was subsequently fixed with two partially threaded screws. Immediate postoperative radiographs revealed satisfactory orientation of the components and a fixed greater trochanter.

At six weeks the previously fixed greater trochanter was found to be avulsed (Figure ).\nThe patient had no symptoms and was therefore allowed to mobilize fully weight-bearing. At the six-month follow-up the prosthesis was considered to be functioning well on the basis of satisfactory pain relief as reported by the patient. He was able to walk unaided, with a normal gait. The hip had an excellent range of movement with no tenderness over the greater trochanter and there was no limb length discrepancy. At 15 months postoperatively the patient reported the sudden onset of pain-free squeaking with no history of trauma. Radiographs revealed a fracture of the ceramic acetabular liner (Figure ) and seven days later revision surgery was undertaken.

The patient underwent a coronary artery bypass graft operation two years prior to treatment. Hypercholesterolemia was a risk factor, and his other laboratory tests were within normal limits. He did not have DM, hypertension (HT), or chronic renal disease. Color Doppler ultrasonography revealed occlusion of the right external iliac artery and patency of the right common iliac and common femoral arteries. The left iliac artery was patent throughout its course. The distal abdominal aorta was aneurismal, with an outer diameter of 36 mm. Endovascular treatment of the occlusion was planned as the aneurysmal dilatation of the distal infrarenal aorta was mild (). The patient did not mention ED, and it was not part of our procedure to question each patient with claudication about ED. Thus, further evaluation for ED, such as urology consultation or penile Doppler ultrasonography examination, was not performed. The procedure was explained to the patient, and written informed consent was obtained.\nThe procedure was performed under conscious sedation and analgesia with fentanyl citrate and midazolam, as required.

Plain x-rays showed patella baja and an avulsed fragment of the superior pole of the patella (Fig. ). Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a shell of bone lying proximally to the patella on multiplanar reconstruction (Fig. A) and shaded surface display images (Fig. B). Clinically, disruption of the extensor mechanism was suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been performed to determine the diagnosis of rupture of the quadriceps tendon and the cartilaginous injury (Fig. ). Under general anesthesia, she underwent open surgical procedures for reconstituting anatomically the fracture and repairing the rupture of the quadriceps tendon. All the above-mentioned imaging findings were confirmed during surgical procedures. Intraoperatively, a bony fragment with a piece of articular cartilage was found above the patella, proximal quadriceps tendon was seen attached the bone pieces, and a same size bone cortical defects were seen on patella. Based on the postulation that the bony fragment pulled off the upper pole of the patella, the diagnosis of sleeve fracture of the upper pole of the patella was finally reached. Then, complete removal of the blood clot and tissue debris in the joint cavity and around the broken ends of the quadriceps tendon was performed. Joint capsule and quadriceps tendon were sutured, patella fracture piece was reset and pulled down to the front, and wire fixation was applied. After surgery a gypsum fixed knee joint in the extension position was chosen for therapy. Postoperative x-ray report showed patellar position and shape of normal, fixed well.

The CT scan also showed bilateral hydroureter and a compressed, displaced urinary bladder. Furthermore, fine needle aspiration (FNA) was done at the referring facility, which showed histologically that the mass was of spindle cell origin.\nThe patient's history and physical examination was done. The patient denied any other complaints other than urinary retention and slight tenderness in his left, lower quadrant. He denied smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug usage. He denies any recent radiation or toxin exposure. No histories of unintentional weight loss, fevers, chills, or hematuria were noted. His medical history included essential hypertension and a clavicle fracture. His surgical history included recent FNA of pelvic mass, CT guided biopsy of hepatic lesion, and soft tissue resection of lesion of finger and hand. His family history was insignificant for urological disease, but there was a family history of diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and his mother had breast cancer. Review of systems was negative except for urinary retention, and a recent decrease in appetite. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the left, lower quadrant of the abdomen and a benign feeling, enlarged prostate on digital rectal exam.\nThe patient was scheduled for cystoscopy with bilateral retrograde pyelograms.

Tachycardia was noted as a characteristic physical abnormality, and her hemoglobin level was extremely low (6.3 g/dL). The patient was transferred to our hospital and was subjected to further testing along with transfusion of 10 units of red cell concentrate. An emergency upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed active bleeding from an ulcer on the surface of an elevated lesion located in the lower portion of the stomach, along the greater curvature. The bleeding was successfully controlled using local sclerosis therapy.\nTwo days later, the patient underwent another upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which revealed a 30 mm, well-circumscribed, soft SMT (). The gastric mucosa covering the SMT showed a small ulcer, without signs of bleeding. We did not biopsy this mass because of the probability of rebleeding. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) showed a well-demarcated mass in the third and fourth layers of the gastric wall, with a hypoechoic pattern (). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a mass with dense homogeneous enhancement in the stomach wall. This scan suggested the presence of a lesion with abundant blood supply and an intact overlying mucosa using early- and delayed-phase contrast-enhanced CT, respectively (). Because the analysis to identify the possible medical causes of the lesion remained inconclusive and because of the risk of rebleeding, the patient was referred for an elective laparoscopy-assisted surgical procedure, according to the Japanese treatment guidelines for gastric SMTs [].\nDuring the operation, a tumor, approximately 30 mm in diameter, was found in the antral wall of the stomach. The tumor had not invaded the adjacent organs and was successfully removed via gastric wedge resection.

Our initial diagnosis was recurrent corneal erosion due to severe superficial punctate keratopathies, and epithelial microcysts were found at the central region of his left cornea. After several regular checkups, a grayish, slightly thickened epithelial lesion had become apparent at the upper temporal side of the corneal limbus in his left eye. The patient underwent an initial operation to excise the total epithelium of the abnormal region. During the course of several, regular postoperative checkups, a dysplastic lesion recurred, and then gradually enlarged until the lesion covered almost the entire cornea and 360\u00b0 of the corneal limbus (fig. ). The lesion appeared to be supported by adjacent engorged vessels. At that point, visual acuity of his left eye was 0.5 (decimal visual acuity), and the intraocular pressure of his left eye was normal. A total resection of the abnormal lesion was then performed. Since this 2nd operation removed virtually all of the limbal epithelial cells which potentially harbor corneal epithelial stem cells, allogeneic keratoepithelioplasty was also performed to prevent conjunctivalization of the cornea. Moieties of the resected tissues at the 2nd operation were subjected to routine pathological examination, and the resultant diagnosis was grade III CIN with significantly thickened epithelium, an increased amount of mitosis, and abnormal cellular polarity (stage Tis).\nUsing the tissue resected at the 2nd operation, histological examinations aimed at investigating cytokeratins were performed. Cytokeratin 1 was expressed in a patchy fashion in the suprabasal to upper layers of the CIN epithelium, but not expressed in the normal corneal samples.

There was a difference in diameter of pupils with 3.0 mm on the right side, and 4.0 mm on the left side; and the light reflex of eyes was disappeared. Emergency brain computed tomography (CT) revealed that patient had acute subdural hematoma in the left frontotemporal, a hemorrhagic contusion in the left frontal temporal lobe, skull fracture in the posterior occipital with epidural hematoma in the posterior fossa. Then, the patient had underwent emergent hematoma exclusion in the left frontal temporal, followed by DC. Six months later, the young man got a Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of 5, Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADL) of 18, but the CT had disclosed a progressive hydrocephalus compared with three months ago. Considering the disturbance of CSF hydrodynamics, we had expected to perform cranioplasty. Before the skull repair, we conducted a lumbar puncture to release cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and to detect and rule out the possibility of intracranial infection. Two hours later after 30 ml CSF release, the man had complained of progressively worsening dizziness and headache, and then he fell into a coma, based on the symptoms, we felt suspected paradoxical herniation might occur.

The normal anatomic orientation of the cardiac vessels is depicted in Figure for reference.\nIn this patient, an anomalous small cardiac vein draining directly into the SVC was incidentally discovered during evaluation and exchange of the malfunctioning tunneled hemodialysis catheter.

Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a giant, well defined mass measuring 16 \u00d7 10 cm in the left thoracic cavity. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed a mass with heterogenous enhancement that was in direct contact with a large area of the chest wall and diaphragm and pressed against the heart and left upper pulmonary lobe (Fig. ).

A thymoma was suspected, and surgical resection was recommended.

The first recipient was a 45-year-old man with a 20-year history of hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to hypertensive nephropathy, who had received regular hemodialysis for 2 years. In June 2005, at another hospital, single renal transplantation was performed in the right iliac fossa, with a cold ischemia time of 5 h 10 min and a warm ischemia time of 1 h 48 min. After reperfusion, the recipient immediately passed urine. He was administered an immunosuppressive regimen comprising methylprednisolone, cyclosporine, everolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil, and he was discharged 10 days after the transplantation with a serum creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. At regular follow-up over the next 6 months, his serum creatinine levels remained within the normal range.\nOver the following 9 years, the recipient showed no episodes of rejection, and his serum creatinine levels and creatinine clearance rates were within the normal ranges (Fig. ). In 2010, he underwent coronary percutaneous angioplasty and stent placement for coronary artery disease, and thereafter he regularly took aspirin. However, in June 2014, he suffered a right cerebral aneurysm rupture that resulted in brain death. At that time, his serum creatinine level was 0.94 mg/dL and the creatinine clearance rate was 90 mL/min.

As the symptoms progressed, she developed frequent urinary tract infections and was referred to an infectious disease physician. The multiple urinary infections prompted the infectious disease doctor to recommend a neurological consultation.\nHer neurological examination revealed a normal mental status and cranial nerve examination. Tests of her sensation and cerebellar system disclosed no abnormalities. Her stretch reflexes were symmetrical and 4+ at the ankles with sustained clonus, 3+ at the patellae with crossed adductor responses. Her extensor responses were plantar. In her arms, testing the brachioradialis, biceps, and triceps reflexes showed normoactive responses (2+). The muscle tone was increased in her legs and she had a spastic gait with scissoring. Her muscle bulk was normal and she had normal power except for mild weakness of hip flexion bilaterally (Medical Research Council Grade 4/5). Prior investigations that had been performed and the following were negative or normal: MRI of the brain, cervical, and thoracic spine with and with contrast, routine serum chemistries and cell blood counts, and an electromyogram which showed no evidence of neuropathy, myopathy, or motor neuron disease.\nA family history revealed many individuals affected with a neurological disorder including a brother with \u2018neuropathy\u2019 and father with \u2018amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\u2019. She also has a paternal uncle and a male cousin diagnosed with difficulty walking due to a neurological disorder. The presence of these multiple members of her family diagnosed with a neurological disorder suggests a genetic disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.

Laboratory examination showed no elevation of either carcinoembryonic antigen or cancer antigen 19-9. Colonoscopy showed a 20-mm SMT in the anal canal (Fig. ). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a 20-mm cystic tumor on the right site of the lower rectum with no evidence of lymph node or distant metastases (Fig. ).

These findings strongly suggested a benign cyst in the anal canal; therefore, the patient underwent trans-sacral resection for precise diagnosis of the tumor. The pathological diagnosis of the resected tumor was a mucinous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia (Fig. ) with negative surgical margins. The patient was observed in ambulatory practice. Follow-up CT and MRI 14 months after surgery showed a new cystic lesion near the site of the removed tumor (Fig. ). To evaluate whether the new cystic tumor was a recurrence, the patient underwent trans-sacral resection of the cystic tumor again. Pathological examination of the second resected tumor revealed that the tumor was a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the lower rectum (Fig. ) with a possible remnant tumor at the local site. After providing sufficient informed consent, the patient underwent anal sphincter-preserving intersphincteric resection (ISR) with partial resection of the external sphincter along with prophylactic lymph node dissection. Pathological examination showed that the tumor cells were located at the anal gland under the mucosa of the anal canal and that these cells produced mucin and fibrosis (Fig. ).

    "original_text": "This case report aimed to reconstruct a highly acetabular defect in an 86-year-old female patient. The first cemented THA was performed in the patient in 1973 at the age of 41 years due to secondary osteoarthritis in regard to hip dysplasia. A nonmodular stem combined with a fixed 33-mm head (Fa. Link) was used as the primary femoral component.\nIn 1998, more than 20 years after the primary arthroplasty, loosening of the cup was detected. A hip revision arthroplasty was performed with exchange of the acetabular component. An oblong revision cup was implanted to stabilize the defect. Inside the cup, a custom-made implant with an inner diameter of 33 mm was cemented into the acetabular cementless revision component.\nTwenty years after the first revision arthroplasty, the patient presented with loosening of the acetabular component. A high acetabular defect classified as a type IIIb defect based on the Paprosky classification system was defined as an \u201cup and in\u201d defect with superior and medial migration of the femoral head > 3 cm (Fig. a). A lateral view radiograph (Fig. b) and computed tomography scan (Fig. c) demonstrated a high acetabular defect near an area of pelvic discontinuity. The cemented stem was still in place and did not demonstrate any signs of loosening 45 years after primary implantation.\nTwo main problems had to be considered in this revision procedure: first, the high acetabular defect with major bone loss, and second, the reconstruction of the center of rotation in this distinct case.\nRevising the fixed stem in this elderly patient with a nonmodular stem would create a major femoral defect in this weak bone. With regard to this problem, a decision was made to create a custom-made polyethylene liner with an outer diameter of 54 mm and an inner diameter of 33 mm for the fixed head of the monobloc stem (Fa.

    "cleaned_text": "this case report aimed to reconstruct a highly acetabular defect in an 86-year-old female patient. the first cemented tha was performed in the patient in 1973 at the age of 41 years due to secondary osteoarthritis in regard to hip dysplasia. a nonmodular stem combined with a fixed 33-mm head (fa. link) was used as the primary femoral component.\nin 1998, more than 20 years after the primary arthroplasty, loosening of the cup was detected. a hip revision arthroplasty was performed with exchange of the acetabular component. an oblong revision cup was implanted to stabilize the defect. inside the cup, a custom-made implant with an inner diameter of 33 mm was cemented into the acetabular cementless revision component.\ntwenty years after the first revision arthroplasty, the patient presented with loosening of the acetabular component. a high acetabular defect classified as a type iiib defect based on the paprosky classification system was defined as an \"up and in\" defect with superior and medial migration of the femoral head > 3 cm (fig. a). a lateral view radiograph (fig. b) and computed tomography scan (fig. c) demonstrated a high acetabular defect near an area of pelvic discontinuity. the cemented stem was still in place and did not demonstrate any signs of loosening 45 years after primary implantation.\ntwo main problems had to be considered in this revision procedure: first, the high acetabular defect with major bone loss, and second, the reconstruction of the center of rotation in this distinct case.\nrevising the fixed stem in this elderly patient with a nonmodular stem would create a major femoral defect in this weak bone. with regard to this problem, a decision was made to create a custom-made polyethylene liner with an outer diameter of 54 mm and an inner diameter of 33 mm for the fixed head of the monobloc stem (fa. link). with this technique, revision of the fixed stem could be avoided.",

The onset of pain was sudden, described as alternating between sharp and aching. On the first day of the pain, a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit was noted at home, and acetaminophen was given causing resolution of fever and brief improvement in pain. Her pain was noted to be the worst when moving the leg after a prolonged period of sitting or lying down. She walked more slowly and had a limp. Headache and decreased energy were also noted on the first day of symptoms, but these did not continue. There were no other systemic symptoms and no pain in any other location. There were no recent illnesses. She did not have a sore throat, cough, congestion, or skin infections.\nShe was seen in the general pediatric clinic on the third day of symptoms, at which point she was afebrile. The physical exam showed an alert, pleasant, interactive young girl with mild tenderness over the right anteromedial thigh. She had an antalgic gait, but a full range of motion of the lower extremities with 2+ reflexes throughout. She had no tenderness over the right hip or knee. Tonsils were 2+ enlarged without exudate. However, on repeat examination 20 minutes later, her pain progressed to severe tenderness over the anteromedial right thigh. She had no other changes in the physical exam.\nShe was referred to the nearest pediatric hospital for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which showed subtly abnormal signal intensity and enhancement at the insertion of the right obturator externus muscle as shown in Figure , as well as small bilateral knee effusions with minimal synovitis. The white blood cell count was 14 K/uL with 10% band forms and 59% neutrophils. C-reactive protein was 4.6 mg/dL with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 45 mm",

The patient had a history of hypertension diagnosed approximately 10 years previously. His hypertension was poorly controlled despite a combination of three different antihypertensive agents (candesartan 16 mg DP, amlodipine 5 mg DP and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg DP).\nPhysical examination showed a blood pressure of 140/80 mm Hg in both arms, a heart rate of 69 beats/minute and no audible murmur. There was no significant pathologic finding in the chest radiography. His echocardiogram showed enlarged sinus portion of ascending aorta with moderate aortic regurgitation (grade 3), suspicious of aortic aneurysm, but left ventricular systolic function was well preserved. Due to the significantly enlarged sinus portion of ascending aorta, the patient underwent multislice spiral computed tomography (CT) angiography for evaluation of aorta anatomy. CT angiography showed focal significant stenosis of the descending aorta, just below the left main pulmonary artery level with vigorous collateral blood flow (). Invasive aortography was then performed, which showed severe aortic coarctation distal to the origin of subclavian artery (). According to the quantitative aortography measurements, the coarctation segment was a minimum of 8 mm in diameter and 40 mm in length. The diameters of the thoracic aorta above and below the coarctation segment were 19 and 22 mm, respectively.
