The patient underwent a total thoracoscopic epicardial ablation without any intraoperative or postoperative complications, followed by a percutaneous postprocedural electrophysiologic evaluation that included confirmation of pulmonary vein isolation and a cavotricuspid isthmus block on the tenth postoperative day. He was discharged in sinus rhythm six days after the hybrid procedure.\nTwo weeks after discharge, the patient was admitted to the emergency room with right-sided motor weakness and paresthesia of both upper and lower extremities. His fever reached 40\u00b0C, and he had a white blood cell count of 17,690/\u03bcL. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Computed tomography imaging of the chest and brain was performed. Chest computed tomography imaging revealed a collection of loculated air measuring up to 2 cm in diameter between the right side of the left atrium and the esophagus, with no definitive evidence of a fistulous connection (). Brain computed tomography revealed an acute-onset left middle cerebral artery infarction. Emergency echocardiography revealed many floating microbubbles.\nAn urgent surgical intervention was performed due to our high level of suspicion for a left atrial or pulmonary venous-esophageal fistula. The right femoral area was prepared for the possibility of an emergent cardiopulmonary bypass. The chest was opened through the fifth intercostal space via a right posterolateral thoracotomy under one-lung ventilation with a double lumen endotracheal tube. After anteriorly retracting the lung, a meticulous dissection of the posterior mediastinum between the esophagus, right upper and lower pulmonary veins, and left atrium was performed. A fistula 2 to 3 mm in diameter was discovered between the right lower pulmonary vein and anterior surface of the esophagus. The fistula was divided with Metzenbaum scissors (). Surprisingly, there was no bleeding from the fistula on the side of the right lower pulmonary vein. The internal orifice was very small, with a diameter of approximately 1 mm.",

Conducted to the emergency department of the local hospital, she presented hemodynamic instability and fetal monitorization compatible with severe fetal distress. She underwent an emergency cesarean section preceded by a focal convulsion upon the induction of anesthesia (attributed to induction of anesthesia in the context of severe hypovolemic anemic shock leading to cerebral hypoperfusion). The epistaxis continued and she received 5 units of red blood cells and 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma over 2 days. Because of failure to control the nasal bleeding with a local hemostatic balloon, she was transferred to a tertiary hospital for angiography with eventual embolization. During this period, she did not present any changes in her mental state or hemodynamic stability, and the local hemostatic balloon in the left nostril was kept in place.\nThe first angiography was performed using 50mL of low osmolality and nonionic organic contrast media administered in the internal and external carotid arteries. There was an abnormal vascular blush in the left nasal hemifossa dependent on branches of the sphenopalatine artery, and embolization was performed. However, the epistaxis returned shortly after, and a second angiography was performed 2 hours later, excluding the presence of any remaining vascular blush and confirming the overall success of the prior embolization. A total of 90mL of nonionic isosmolar contrast was used in both angiographies. Local tamponing was kept in the left nostril.\nImmediately after the second angiography, during the postanaesthetic recovery, the patient started to be disoriented, with sleepy speech but no formal visual complaints or motor deficits. Within 2 hours of the second procedure, she remained alert but cried continuously, developed hyperventilation, was not able to follow orders, directed her gaze but could not fix it and presented repetitive speech without intelligibility or the ability to make sentences",

Five months after the ablation she was admitted to our hospital for a cough and slight fever refractory to medical therapy. An ECG exhibited recurrent paroxysmal AF with a mean of 112 b.p.m. and no evidence of myocardial ischaemia. Chest computed tomography revealed mild pleural and pericardial effusions without any pulmonary emboli. For the first time, laboratory testing revealed an elevated C-reactive protein level (57 mg/L). Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed mild dilatation with an LA diameter of 38 mm despite there having been no dilatation of the LA just after the ablation (29 mm). Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed wall thickening limited to the LA. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed there was wall thickening with marked oedema. Cardiac PET after a 24-h carbohydrate-free diet revealed an LA FDG uptake consistent with myocarditis (Figure ). An extensive infectious work up was negative. An LA biopsy under intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) guidance revealed granulomatous and lymphocytic inflammation of the myocardium, which was consistent with atrial GCM (Figure ). After treatment, starting with only prednisolone 40 mg per day to tapering to 15 mg, she returned to a normal life after 2 months of follow-up. Atrial fibrillation was the only detected arrhythmia during the course of the atrial GCM. Atrial fibrillation recovered to sinus rhythm during treatment under the administration of dabigatran and cibenzoline. Following that, no further AF recurred during 16 months of follow-up.\nThis case exhibited a new variant of GCM with lone involvement of the LA and a preserved left ventricular function. The isolated atrial involvement was implicated as a cause of the AF in spite of an AF ablation., However, this ablation procedure might not have been associated with the development of atrial GCM, because the sudden onset of the disease was found more than at least 5",

    "original_text": "A 77-year-old man with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and ESRD underwent deceased donor renal transplantation. Two months following his renal transplant, the patient was admitted for an acute kidney injury discovered on routine follow-up laboratory testing. From a baseline creatinine of 1.3 mg/dl after the transplant, he was noted to have a creatinine of 2.7 mg/dl and a renal biopsy was obtained. Histopathology was suggestive of mildly active cellular rejection and acute tubular injury but with no concerns for antibody-mediated rejection. The patient received three days of methyl-prednisolone 250 mg daily intravenously and was subsequently transitioned to high-dose oral prednisone with a taper.\nThe patient was readmitted within three weeks of his renal biopsy with worsening renal functions, now with a creatinine level of 3.8 mg/dl. At this time, he was on prednisone five mg daily, tacrolimus four mg twice daily, and mycophenolate 500 mg twice daily. His family reported poor oral intake and that he had been taking furosemide at home. He received intravenous (IV) normal saline and diuretics were held. However, as his renal functions did not improve beyond a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dl, the decision was made to perform a repeat renal biopsy. During ultrasonography for the renal biopsy, concerns were raised for a possible renal artery aneurysm. An ultrasound of the right lower quadrant and transplant kidney subsequently showed a 3 cm x 3.4 cm x 4 cm aneurysm proximal to the renal artery anastomosis to the right external iliac artery (Figure ).

The pre-Fontan hemodynamics assessment showed a normal Glenn circuit pressure at 10 mmHg. Eight months after his Fontan procedure he was found to have mild intermittent facial edema with no evidence of biochemical signs of protein-losing enteropathy. Cardiac catheterization showed mild angiographic left pulmonary artery stenosis and low pressure in the Fontan circuit (10 mmHg). One year and 2 months after his Fontan procedure, he developed clinical and biochemical signs of protein-losing enteropathy. Repeat catheterization revealed mean Fontan pressure of 12 mmHg that increased to 18 mmHg after 10 mL/kg fluid bolus. There was 1 mm mean gradient across the left pulmonary artery stenosis that was successfully treated with stent implantation. Over the next 18 months, he had clinical and biochemical evidence of protein-losing enteropathy that initially responded to therapy with budesonide. Unfortunately, he was finally refractory to high dose budesonide with side effects from therapy and growth failure.

    "original_text": "An 80-year-old Caucasian man who initially presented with back pain was found to have a 9.8 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm on computed tomography (CT). This was suitable for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) but the left common iliac artery (CIA) was short, necessitating the extension of the left iliac limb into the external iliac artery (EIA). The decision was made to proceed with an on table coiling of the left internal iliac artery (IIA) and EVAR. However, a tortuous right CIA made coiling of the left IIA extremely difficult and following a prolonged attempt, the decision was made to proceed with EVAR without coiling the IIA (Fig. ).\nOn a 1-month follow up CT the left limb extension had disengaged from the main body, resulting in a large Type 3 endoleak. The disengagement was presumed to be due to the tortuosity of a heavily calcified external iliac artery returning to its anatomical position on removal of the Meir wire (Boston Scientific). The left IIA remained patent and acted as an outflow for the type 3 endoleak.

She had lost 10 kg over last 6 months, despite having a good appetite. She did not have significant medical or surgical illness or intervention in the past. General and systemic clinical examination was normal. Her hematological and biochemical investigations were normal too. Barium esophagogram revealed smooth narrowing of the mid thoracic esophagus with proximal dilatation (Fig. ). Esophagoscopy was suggestive of a submucosal growth with intact mucosa from 18 to 25 cm from central incisors, involving half of the circumference of esophagus, located at 12 to 6 o\u2019 clock position (Fig. ). Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan of neck, chest and abdomen revealed a longitudinally oriented, well defined, non-enhancing, homogenous lesion involving the lower cervical and upper thoracic esophagus, causing significant luminal narrowing (Fig. ). The patient underwent a right lateral thoracotomy. Esophageal dissection was done and longitudinal incision was made in the esophagus, over the lesion which was deepened through the muscle layer and enucleation of the lesion was performed. It was a solid, submucosal mass measuring 8.5 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 2.5 cm (Fig. ).

He was referred to urology and later underwent a TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. A few hours after the procedure on his way home, he had a syncopal episode and was transferred to the ER.\nHe was found to have copious amount of fresh blood clots per rectum with significant hemodynamic instability. He was diaphoretic with a blood pressure of 80/30 mmHg and a pulse rate 100 - 120/min. Patient was aggressively resuscitated with fluid and received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells. He was transferred immediately to the intensive care unit.\nA flexible sigmoidoscopy performed revealed multiple diverticulosis in the left colon and a raised non-bleeding erythematous mucosal lesion in the rectum (most likely the site of prostate biopsy). The lesion was injected with 10cc of 1:10000 epinephrines (). We planned a full colonoscopy at later date when patient was more stable.\nWhile in the unit the patient had no further rectal bleed and his hematocrit remained stable (between 30-35%) and as such was transferred to the medical floor.\nFive days later, on the day prior to planned discharge he developed multiple episodes of massive rectal bleeding with a drop in hematocrit to 25% and drop in systolic blood pressure of 60 mmHg. A central line was placed and the patient received transfusion with 4 units of packed red blood cells and was transferred back to the intensive care unit. As he continued to bleed massively with hemodynamic instability we opted for an immediate angiography rather than a colonoscopy.

He was treated 3 weeks earlier with oral acyclovir and topical steroids because of suspected LE herpetic anterior uveitis as serological tests revealed positive immunoglobulin M to herpes simplex virus-1. Initially he responded to treatment but 2 weeks later, his vision declined from 6/9 to counting fingers (CF), resulting in his referral to our center.\nThe patient denied any relevant past medical history. However, he mentioned that a month earlier he was examined for LE discomfort and diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis following minor blunt trauma from a tree branch.\nOn examination, visual acuity (VA) was 6/6 in the right eye (RE) and CF at 1 meter in the LE. Intraocular pressure was 14 mmHg in both eyes. RE anterior and posterior segments were normal. There was a remarkable LE anterior chamber reaction with dust-like keratic precipitates, cells (4+), flare (2+), and some iris nodules. Fundus assessment was not possible because of dense vitritis. B-scan and high-frequency ultrasound did not reveal any intraocular foreign body. Aqueous tap was performed and the sample was sent for culture and polymerase chain reaction analysis. It was negative for all herpes viruses and for 16S rDNA. Meanwhile, with oral steroids and valacyclovir, the patient showed signs of improvement and LE VA improved to 6/15. Despite the remarkable improvement, it was insufficient as the patient continued to have marked anterior uveitis and vitritis. A white shadow was noted in the peripheral temporal retina of the LE which again could not be assessed properly due to vitreous opacities ().

The patient was taking medications for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism and had a history of traumatic abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery 40 years previously. Chest CT revealed a 3.5-cm oval mass in the posterior mediastinum at the level of the eighth to ninth thoracic vertebrae in addition to multiple pulmonary nodules (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen showed multiple poorly enhanced masses in the liver. The liver masses were smaller than 2 cm and emitted a low T1 signal and a high T2 signal (). We considered the possibility that the lung and liver lesions were metastatic, but blood tumor marker tests were normal. Percutaneous needle biopsy (PCNB) of the pulmonary lesion failed to yield a meaningful sample. With the possibility of neurogenic tumor or pulmonary and hepatic metastases in mind, we decided to perform surgery. We planned to resect the mediastinal tumor and biopsy the pulmonary lesion for diagnosis. We decided to determine the treatment plan for the hepatic lesions based on the surgical pathology results. We performed surgery with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. We made 3 ports (5 mm, 10 mm, and 12 mm) using a 10-mm telescope. We identified the mediastinal tumor as observed on chest CT. The mediastinal tumor was located in the posterior mediastinum, close to the sympathetic chain and supplied by feeding vessels from the intercostal vessel. The tumor was well-demarcated without invasion into adjacent structures. After ligation and division of the feeding vessel with a hemoclip, the tumor was removed without difficulty.

His past medical history includes coronary artery disease with coronary bypass surgery 12 years before the present events, a ventral hernia repair with mesh 22 years before the current episode, and a smoking history of approximately 3-4 pack-years.\nThe patient has been complaining of a superficial non-healing abdominal wound lasting for almost a year, which led him to consult at another hospital due to increased pain, local erythema, and fever. Imaging revealed the presence of a subcutaneous abscess (), for which large spectrum antibiotic therapy was initiated. After 2 weeks of intravenous antibiotherapy, the abscess did not resolve and enteric content started leaking from a skin opening, suggesting the progression to an ECF (). Due to subacute mild non-productive cough, the patient underwent as well a thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan that displayed bilateral cavitary nodules () which seemed to progress in size on a second thoracic CT scan performed a month later. The patient\u2019s daily activities and occupation could not be linked to an increased risk of pulmonary infectious agents or inhalation injury, and he had no previous history of tuberculosis. Moreover, the patient complained of nasal crusting with epistaxis. Due to the complexity of the presentation, the patient was transferred to our university hospital for multidisciplinary management.\nAn infectious or a neoplastic process was suspected. Extensive microbiological investigations failed to identify a potential etiological agent at the ECF site or in the pulmonary lesions. Culture of the abdominal subcutaneous abscess revealed the expected presence of enteric pathogens, including Enterococcus sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and multiple species of Candida.

Physical examination was unremarkable, except for mild hypoxemia (SpO2 95%) and lower limb pitting edema. Laboratory findings showed elevated D-dimer levels (43.5 \u03bcg/mL). Enhanced CT images showed massive PE (Fig. ) as well as several nodules in the lungs. Moreover, an irregularly shaped tumor was also present from the retroperitoneum near the right ureter to the right pelvis, as well as DVT in the right iliac vein (Fig. ). He was transported to a nearby cardiovascular hospital and received anticoagulation therapy as well as inferior vena cava filter indwelling. From image inspection, retroperitoneal tumors, such as ureteral cancer, were suspected, although urine cytology did not show obvious atypical cells. A laparotomy biopsy of the tumor was scheduled. However, 2 months after onset, a re-examination of chest CT due to exacerbation of breathing difficulties showed a rapid deterioration of nodular lesions in the lungs. Although he was admitted to our hospital, respiratory failure combined with tumor metastasis, pneumonia, and alveolar hemorrhage made it difficult to perform a surgical biopsy. He died 8 days after admission due to progression of respiratory failure before the biopsy procedure.\nA general autopsy revealed a mass lesion in the retroperitoneal right caudal side, in contact with the right anterior part of the lumbar spine. The tumor macroscopically involved the right common iliac artery and vein, as well as the right ureter (Fig. ). However, there was no hydronephrosis in the right kidney, and no irregular lesions were observed in the ureteral luminal surface, indicating the absence of ureteral cancer.

    "original_text": "A 27-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to us by a general practitioner for prosthodontic evaluation and treatment in 2010. The patient's chief complaint stemmed from a car accident in 2002, in which she lost a few teeth. At that time, an iliac crest graft was performed, following which a dental bridge was placed. The bridge lasted for 8 years but had become unstable when the patient presented to us. In addition, the patient experienced some discomfort and bleeding. Based on a review of her medical history, the patient was classified as an American Society of Anesthesiologists Class I patient (i.e., a normal healthy patient), and she had no systemic disease and was not on any medications.\nClinical examination showed implants in the locations of missing teeth 9, 11, 12 and 13 with a fixed prosthesis. Hyperplastic tissues on the labial side and bleeding were noted, and suppuration was presented on palpation. The fixed prosthesis was infrapositioned, which resulted in an open bite situation []. The patient did not recall any parafunctional habit and did not have signs of occlusal wear. Remnants of cement were seen around the platform of the failed prosthesis. Head and neck examination revealed no cervical or submandibular lymphadenopathy as well as no facial deformities or asymmetries. The patient showed adequate interarch space at the approximate vertical dimension of occlusion. According to House's classification, the patient was classified as a Class I patient (i.e., accepts dentist's judgment and instructions and likely to best prognosis).

The child was in good health and had no relevant medical history or previous dental trauma. Intra-oral examination showed that he had a mixed dentition, reverse anterior overjet with complete deep bite and clinically missing upper left central incisor (Figures and ).\nRadiography showed all the permanent teeth were present and the possibility of root resorption of the upper lateral incisors (12, 22), caused by mesially erupting position canines could not be ruled out (Figure ).\nA cone-beam CT scan was taken to assess the extent of resorption, if any, and to aid in the creation of a suitable treatment plan. The three-dimensional view from the CT scan (Figures and ) revealed that the crown of the upper right canine was in close proximity to the upper right lateral incisors. The crown tip of the upper left canine was touching the root of the upper left lateral incisors, causing some root resorption, which was confirmed in the sequential transaxial views of the CT scan (Figure ).\nThe treatment objective was to prevent and eliminate any root resorption of the lateral incisors that might be caused by the erupting canines. The treatment plan was extraction of the upper primary first molars and palatal root torque of the lateral incisors by using a specially designed upper fixed lingual appliance (Figure ).\nBecause our patient had a reverse overjet and 100% complete overbite, the conventional labial bracket system could not be used.

    "cleaned_text": "a 10-year-old chinese boy was referred to our orthodontic department at hong kong university with the chief complaint of delayed eruption of the upper left central incisor. the child was in good health and had no relevant medical history or previous dental trauma. intra-oral examination showed that he had a mixed dentition, reverse anterior overjet with complete deep bite and clinically missing upper left central incisor (figures and ).\nradiography showed all the permanent teeth were present and the possibility of root resorption of the upper lateral incisors (12, 22), caused by mesially erupting position canines could not be ruled out (figure ).\na cone-beam ct scan was taken to assess the extent of resorption, if any, and to aid in the creation of a suitable treatment plan. the three-dimensional view from the ct scan (figures and ) revealed that the crown of the upper right canine was in close proximity to the upper right lateral incisors. the crown tip of the upper left canine was touching the root of the upper left lateral incisors, causing some root resorption, which was confirmed in the sequential transaxial views of the ct scan (figure ).\nthe treatment objective was to prevent and eliminate any root resorption of the lateral incisors that might be caused by the erupting canines. the treatment plan was extraction of the upper primary first molars and palatal root torque of the lateral incisors by using a specially designed upper fixed lingual appliance (figure ).\nbecause our patient had a reverse overjet and 100% complete overbite, the conventional labial bracket system could not be used. therefore, a specially designed upper fixed appliance with a torquing spring was constructed to apply torque to the upper lateral incisors from the palatal side. tip-edge brackets were bonded to the palatal surface of the upper lateral incisors for tying the palatal arch-wire into the teeth.\na 19 \u00d7 25 stainless steel (ss) wire was soldered to the",

In August 2011, she presented to the Department of Dermatology with a main complaint of an umbilical mass; however, she was sent to the Surgical Department because of the diagnosis of an umbilical lesion located deep in the abdomen. The hard mass, which was the size of a thumb, was palpable at her navel. She did not feel any pain.\nAn abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed the enhanced tumor; it was 2 cm in diameter and located in the pancreatic tail (Figure ).

The para-aortic lymph node was not swollen; however, low, enhanced foci were scattered in the spleen, which was a finding suggestive of metastasis.\nThe fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan showed swelling in the pancreatic tail with abnormal accumulation (Figure ).
