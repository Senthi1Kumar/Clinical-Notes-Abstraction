A subsequent computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a large mass showing homogeneous density in the bladder region without obvious enlarged lymph nodes (Fig. ). Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) indicated a huge filling defect in the areas of the bladder (Fig. ) though it was normal in the upper urinary tract.

His father told us that our patient had thought there was a gingival problem since childhood, had complained of gingival pain for the previous six months, and had been unable to brush his teeth for the last two weeks. Our patient's height was 153 cm and his weight was 62 kg. His medical history included a three-month hospital stay caused by low birth weight and cyanosis just after birth. A clinical diagnosis of PWS had been made on the basis of symptoms such as hypotonia, genital hypoplasia, acromicria (short hands and feet) and genetic testing.\nAn intra-oral examination revealed poor oral hygiene with heavy generalized plaque throughout the permanent dentition. His gingival tissues showed marginal redness, swelling, and food impaction (Figure ). An apparent anterior open bite, increasing overjet, an anterior crowded arch and malpositioning of the teeth were noted. In addition, circular caries and attrition of the mandibular first molars were present. Pocket depths ranged from 4 mm to 8 mm. Mobility grade 2 was present in the mandibular left second premolar.

The tumor was 5.0 \u00d7 6.0 cm, and it was pathologically diagnosed as malignant meningioma (Fig. A). As metastasis from a primary site was suspected, imaging examinations, including head and neck magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) examination, were carried out, but since all were negative, it was diagnosed as ectopic malignant meningioma of the primary axillary soft tissue. After surgery, 50 Gy radiation was locally administered, and she received follow-up outpatient observation. In June 2016, chest radiography showed a nodular shadow in the right lung, so she was referred to our department. There were no notable findings in the laboratory blood test results. Chest radiography indicated a similar circular nodule shadow, 1.1 \u00d7 1.0 cm in size, in the right lower lung field. Chest CT showed the 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 cm nodule shadow in the right S4; mediastinal and hilar lymph node enlargement was not observed (Fig. B). PET-CT demonstrated slight uptake in the nodule, with a maximal standardized uptake value of 2.94 (Fig. C). There was no evidence of distant metastasis. After the initial examination, it was considered to be a metastatic lung tumor, and we decided to perform surgery as there were no abnormal findings in other organs. Surgery was performed in the left lateral decubitus under differential lung ventilation and 3-port thoracoscopy.

The patient had initially taken antipyretics and antibiotics but found no effect. On clinical examination, the patient was febrile, and his abdomen was soft without any guarding or rigidity. Routine investigation showed that the patient had diabetes, which was uncontrolled. The test results indicated that the patient also had a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate along with a high total leukocyte count and a high level of positive C-reactive protein. Therefore, insulin and empirical antibiotics were started immediately. An ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen revealed hepatomegaly, chronic pancreatitis, and splenomegaly with multiple splenic abscesses. An endoscopic examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract showed the presence of esophageal candidiasis with a dilated vein at the fundus. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen indicated chronic calcific pancreatitis with splenic vein thrombosis, multiple splenic abscesses with evidence of rupture and ascites, and bilateral pleural effusion with basal lung collapse. Blood culture report showed the presence of B. pseudomallei, which was sensitive to imipenem and aminoglycosides, and so the patient was put on antibiotics. A few days through the course of treatment, the patient complained of low back pain. Clinical examination revealed tenderness at the bilateral sacroiliac joints with no neurological deficit. Plain radiographic examination confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral sacroiliitis and, therefore, twice-daily sulfasalazine 500 mg was added to the treatment regimen. One week later, the patient presented again with unimproved back pain and paraesthesia and weakness in both the lower limbs.

The symptoms started slowly over a period of 1 month and progressed gradually. The arm and the forearm were affected in equal magnitude. The sensations appeared during night and were associated with an urge to move the affected extremity. Movement of the right arm and forearm brought relief but the symptoms recurred with the cessation of movements. Typically, symptoms lasted for 4-6 hours/day for at least 4 nights a week. She also complained of daytime symptoms like lethargy and somnolence on almost all days. These symptoms were not following any dermatomal pattern; not associated with any motor weakness; never experienced during the day; and never interfered with the use of any of the upper limbs in daily chores. She did not notice any aggravating factor for the symptoms except the diurnal variation. The patient did not report any history to suggest medical, surgical or psychiatric illness before the onset of these symptoms. Similarly, onset of symptoms was not associated with any drug intake or any stressful life event.

Two years after her surgery, a 6-month follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan revealed enlargement of the thyroid tumor, but she remained asymptomatic. Blood tests revealed a small increase in CA 19-9 (from 3.5 ng/ml 6 months earlier to 8.9 ng/ml) and in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (from 1.7 ng/ml to 4.6 ng/ml). Her thyroid function tests were normal. Physical examination and laryngoscopy revealed a firm elastic nodule in the thyroid gland and left vocal fold paralyzed in the midline position. The maximum phonation time (MPT) was 10 seconds. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Ultrasonographic examination of the neck revealed a solid tumor in the left thyroid lobe with a diameter of 35 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 20 mm. CT showed spread of this mass to the tracheoesophageal groove, suggesting invasion of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN; ). Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid tumor showed a few clusters of elongated tumor cells with hyperchromatic dark nuclei on a background of benign hepatocytes, and the mass was reported as metastatic adenocarcinoma.

In 2014, the patient had a recurrence of her disease with a metastasis to mediastinal subcarinal lymph node. Over the next four years due to disease progression or inability to tolerate agents (e.g., development of acute pancreatitis from erlotinib), the patient was treated with multiple antineoplastic agents including bevacizumab, pemetrexed, durvalumab, tremelimumab, erlotinib, and afatinib.

On arrival, the patient was hemodynamically stable and was found to have an isolated left lower limb injury. Upon examination by the on-call orthopedic specialist at 22:00, the patient had a deformed left leg and complained of mild pain with tenderness. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score in the ED was 3/10. Assessment of the soft tissue revealed relatively soft compartments. Realignment of the left leg and application of an above-knee backslab were performed. Vascular examination revealed palpable and audible dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed significantly enlarged right lobe of the thyroid with a clear boundary and uneven density of mass, partly involving the isthmus of the thyroid, which was suspected as being thyroid adenoma (Fig. ). The thyroid function testing and emission computed tomography (ECT) scan were normal. Physical examination showed the following: right lobe of the thyroid showed no-fixed II degree swelling with no tender and obvious nodules. The liver and spleen were normal.

History revealed that the patient developed seizures at the age of two and was under medication for the same which was later discontinued.\nHer family history was not contributory, and none of her immediate family members and relatives were found to suffer from similar abnormality or feature of other syndromes.\nGeneral examination revealed that the patient was hyperactive and fails to respond to verbal commands. No palpable lymph node was present. Extraoral examination revealed a bilateral swelling of the face extending from lower border of the mandible to the inferior orbital margin which was not noticed by the parents.

History of the patient revealed that he had trauma 2 years back with the right side mandibular body fracture and loss of lower anterior teeth. There was no relevant medical history. The fracture was treated with open reduction, with titanium plating on right side of body of the mandible. The post-surgical examination revealed adequate mouth opening, normal occlusion and no deviation. The region had healed completely and the surgical treatment seemed satisfactory. The lower anterior alveolar ridge had resorbed to a great extent. All other teeth present were with no caries, good periodontal health and good oral hygiene.\nThe patient was educated and informed about the limitations of his treatment. An orthopantomgram (OPG) revealed well-accepted titanium plates on lower right side of the mandibular body with missing 31, 32, 41, 42, 43. The remaining teeth showed good periodontal condition with no bone loss []. Intra oral periapical radiograph (IOPA) radiographs in relation to 31, 32, 41, 42, 43 revealed bone loss up to 3 mm compared to the adjacent remaining teeth. A diagnostic impression of both the maxillary and mandibular arches was made. A radiographic and surgical stent was fabricated for evaluation of the implants []. Although one implant each for every missing tooth was the treatment of choice, the surgical site precluded the same and hence, three double-staged implants of 3.3 mm diameter and 15 mm length for 31, and 3.3 mm diameter and 13 mm length for 41 and 42 were placed under local anesthesia [Figures and ].\nThe patient was put in antibiotics and analgesics for 5 days.

She had a history of at least 10 tick bites and spent much of her life in heavily Lyme disease and Babesia endemic areas such as Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Approximately 10 years ago, she began to develop multiple symptoms including significant fatigue, night sweats, joint pain, swollen glands, neck pain and stiffness, headaches, palpitations, shortness of breath, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. She went to see a local endocrinologist and was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. She was placed on methimazole, which controlled her abnormal thyroid functions, but her health never returned to normal. One year later, her local physician diagnosed her with Lyme disease based on her symptoms and a CDC positive IgM and IgG Lyme Western blot. She was placed on doxycycline 100 mg PO BID and felt much better. She then went to see a local infectious disease specialist, who placed her on tetracycline HCL and hydroxychloroquine, but she did not feel well on this regimen and returned to her local physician to go back on doxycycline. She completed 4 months of antibiotic therapy and achieved between 70% and 80% of normal functioning.

She presented with a history of valve-sparing aortic root reimplantation for annuloaortic ectasia and aortic valve regurgitation, descending aortic replacement with intercostal arteries patch reconstruction for Stanford type B aortic dissection, and permanent pacemaker implantation in another hospital. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a hematoma in the apex of the left lung and a 32-mm intercostal patch aneurysm (). Two pairs of Th8 and 9 intercostal arteries were reconstructed in a patch, and all four arteries were patent. Because the patch aneurysm and hematoma were separated, we initially ruled out a rupture of the patch aneurysm. However, the hematoma gradually expanded, and the hemoptysis did not stop (). As a result, we reconsidered and diagnosed the case as a ruptured pseudoaneurysm of the intercostal patch aneurysm. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was the first-line treatment. However, due to retrograde flow from the intercostal arteries, the use of TEVAR alone was considered to carry a risk of a type II endoleak. Therefore, embolization of the patent intercostal arteries and subsequent TEVAR were planned. The patient was operated under general anesthesia. A motor evoked potential (MEP) monitor was also used to identify spinal cord injury. An 8 Fr sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery through the right inguinal incision, and angiography was performed at the level of the patch aneurysm. A very faint extravasation was observed at the head of the patch aneurysm. After selectively identifying the bilateral Th8 and 9 intercostal arteries using the micro catheter and micro guide wire, transarterial embolization (TAE) was performed using platinum coils. The MEP did not change during embolization, and to protect the spinal cord, the mean blood pressure was maintained above 80 mmHg. After TAE, the sheath was replaced with a 20 Fr DrySeal sheath\u00ae (W. L. Gore & Associates",

A large perimembranous ventricular septal defect with a size of about 10 mm was detected in the child after birth, so we performed a ventricular defect repair when the child was 2 months old. Two months after surgery, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed the shunt between the aortic sinus and the right atrium without significant aortic regurgitation, showing that the diameter of the break was about 1.5 mm. Therefore, we decided to have the child undergo regular follow-up transthoracic echocardiography and observe the change in the size of the break, instead of immediate surgical intervention.

Upon examination, a persistent murmur was heard in the left parasternal area. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed that the diameter of the break was about 3 mm, the length of the diastolic regurgitation beam at the root of the non-coronary valve was 35 mm, and the width of the neck was 4.4 mm.

The patient developed saddle nose deformity at age 22, but was only diagnosed with RP when he developed recurrent auricular chondritis at the age of 34. His disease was further characterized by intermittent hoarseness, costochondritis and small joint arthritis. Laboratory evaluations included normal blood counts and chemistry panels, elevated ESR during flares, negative rheumatoid factor, the absence of antinuclear antibodies or ANCA and the presence of CII antibodies. In addition, we previously identified CII-specific T cells in this patient [].

She had a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease that had required transcatheter intervention. Her family history also included coronary artery disease. Her social history was unremarkable with respect to environmental and workplace exposures, and she did not smoke or consume alcohol. A physical examination upon admission revealed no signs of cardiac congestion or neurological deficits. Her vital signs were a systemic blood pressure of 143/86 mmHg, pulse rate of 89 beats per minute, and a body temperature of 35.9 \u00b0C. Chest x-rays at the time of admission showed cardiomegaly with protrusion of the right first aortic arch, and electrocardiography showed an incomplete right bundle branch block of normal sinus rhythm. Coronary angiography performed because of her history of coronary artery disease revealed no significant coronary arterial stenosis. However, a concurrent pressure study revealed oxygen step-up in gas sampling between the SVC and right atrium (RA) with a pulmonary blood flow/systemic blood flow ratio (Qp/Qs) of 2.07, even though pulmonary artery pressure was normal in the pressure study and the atrial septum was intact on echocardiography. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed that the RUPV flowed into the SVC (Fig. ) without any other congenital heart conditions, including an ASD and a dilated RA and right ventricle (RV). Isolated PAPVR was diagnosed on the basis of CT imaging findings, and surgery was indicated on the basis of the patient\u2019s symptoms and the hemodynamic pressure findings.\nThe surgical approach was via a median sternotomy. The SVC was cannulated near the confluence of the innominate vein, sufficiently above the RUPV. A cardiopulmonary bypass was established, and cardiac arrest was applied.

She complained of non-bilious, non-projectile vomiting containing food particles. Visible peristalsis was appreciated, which appeared aggravated after taking food. She did not complain of any history of trauma or breathlessness. On clinical examination, her vitals were stable as she had been resuscitated in emergency and she was evaluated with radiographs, endoscopy and computed tomographic (CT) examinations. Plain radiograph performed on the day of admission, 1 week from the onset of acute symptoms, showed opacification of the entire lower part of the right hemithorax with significant air lucency within [].

    "original_text": "A 33-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 0, was referred to our fetal medicine department for a suspected hydatidiform mole coexistent with a live fetus at 24 weeks\u2019 gestation. Her first pregnancy was a miscarriage around 5 weeks\u2019 gestation conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) a year ago. She had no family history of twin pregnancy or hydatidiform mole. She had conceived through transfer of 2 day-5 embryos following IVF although the indication for double rather than single embryo transfer was obscure.\nSeveral ultrasound examinations performed during the first trimester displayed a single sac containing a fetus with no signs of placental abnormalities. Her thyroid hormone levels were normal, but her first trimester hCG and prenatal genetic screening results were not available. At the time of her visit, the gestational age was 24 weeks. She had no vaginal spotting and her blood pressure was normal. Her serum \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) level was 105,851 IU/L. Ultrasound evaluation revealed a structurally normal fetus with an intraplacental multicystic mass measuring 154 mm \u00d7 53 mm; no theca lutein cysts were observed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a placenta with a normally-appearing portion abutted by multicystic mass with high signal on T2-weighted images at the right anterior wall (Fig. ). The 151 mm \u00d7 139 mm \u00d7 67 mm multicystic mass was partly admixed with the normal placenta and partly bulged between the normal placenta and the amniotic sac. There were no signs of aneurismal or varicose dilation of fetal chorionic vessels. Her chest X-ray was normal.\nAmniocentesis revealed a 46, XX karyotype without pathological copy number variants.

In addition, metastases were observed in lungs and hilar lymph nodes (). Initially, indication of the nephrectomy was questionable; however, we confirmed that metastases were controllable by presurgical axitinib treatment. Therefore, we considered surgical intervention. After the patient was placed in the lateral position, we began the procedure by laparoscopy to mobilize the spleen, pancreas tail, and descending colon and ligate the left renal artery. Next, we adjusted the patient to the supine position, and open surgical intervention was performed through inverted T incision to the upper abdomen. IVC and bilateral renal veins were exposed, and the liver was mobilized to expose retrohepatic IVC. As the tumor extension in this case advanced to level III, IVC was secured under the diaphragm, and Pringle maneuver was performed. Under clamping of the right renal vein, hepatoduodenal ligament and IVC (under diaphragm and caudal part to the termination of the right renal vein), a small incision was performed to the anterior surface of IVC; however, we encountered uncontrollable bleeding. Accordingly, we closed the IVC scar, and de-clamped (clamping time was 5 minutes). The segmental resection of infrahepatic IVC is necessary, which, however, would significantly increase the difficulty of reconstruction following removal. For this reason, we performed CPB with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). We performed midline sternotomy in preparation for cannulation to superior vena cava (SVC) and left ventricles to establish CPB and to commence active cooling toward 20\u00b0C.

It was painful and gradually progressive. Two years back the patient had a hysterectomy for SCC cervix. She had received six cycles of chemotherapy followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Her ocular examination showed a visual acuity of no light perception in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination showed multiple yellowish-white deposits over the iris and in the anterior chamber giving rise to acute narrow-angle glaucoma. The right eye had a visual acuity of 6/9 with normal color vision. Anterior chamber and vitreous paracentesis of the left eye was performed. Aqueous fluid was less than 1 mL in quantity, and it was a white gel-like substance on physical examination. Microscopic examination showed cellular smears consisting of scattered, isolated, and few small aggregates of pleomorphic tumor cells having hyperchromatic angulated nuclei, coarse chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and basophilic cytoplasm. The background showed numerous degenerate and intact neutrophils along with debris [].\nVitreous tap was 0.2 mL hemorrhagic fluid. Microscopically, it showed paucicellular smears with tumor cells having similar morphology as that found in the aqueous fluid. Keeping in view the clinical details of the patient, possibility of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma was suggested.\nDue to acute narrow-angle glaucoma and the patient developing endophthalmitis, the painful blind eye was enucleated.\nGross examination of the specimen of the eye showed yellowish-white opacity behind the cornea. On bisecting the eye, there was a gray-white nodular growth of size 3 mm in the anterior chamber of the eye, extending laterally to the ciliary body [].

Surgical pathology showed the tumor to be CD56, synaptophysin, and pancytokeratin positive by immunohistochemistry, with involvement of a single right inguinal lymph node. Due to close surgical margins and inguinal nodal involvement, the patient received adjuvant intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to the right thigh and right pelvic and inguinal nodal region to a dose of 50 Gy delivered in 25 fractions (), as well as consolidative carboplatin and etoposide post-operatively.

She also reported being prone to tripping after prolonged walking as well as a mild foot drop. The patient has no prior history of knee surgery or trauma, and the only past medical history of note is long term hypertension, for which she has been managed with antihypertensive medication.\nOn clinical examination, the patient had full range of motion in her knee. There were no signs of joint effusion and the knee was stable on both collateral and cruciate ligament testing. There was some mild medial joint line tenderness but no lateral joint line tenderness. She had a large palpable mass over the proximal lateral aspect of her lower leg as well as pain around the proximal tibiofibular joint.

Dental examination revealed a right maxillary canine with a deep carious lesion. The patient also gave history of episodic swelling in the involved tooth. Clinical diagnosis was pulpal necrosis with periapical abscess and sinus discharge. The patient gave a history of BSS which was diagnosed at the age of 5 years. Her parents, siblings and her children were free of BSS symptoms.\nPatient with BSS usually requires platelet concentrate supplement prior to dental invasive procedures and tranexamic acid to control bleeding post-operatively. The referring physician from Department of Hematology instructed us to give 1 unit of platelet rich plasma and Iron dextran for thrombocytopenia and anemia. The patient showed allergy to Iron dextran after a test dose so further infusion was given with Iron sucrose (4 ampules). There was a significant increase in hemoglobin level and platelet count [].\nAfter the consent obtained from the referral doctor and written consent from the patient root canal treatment was planned for the syndromic patient. A pre-operative radiograph was obtained, which showed periapical radiolucency in relation to maxillary right canine []. After detailed clinical and radiographic examination, the right maxillary canine was prepared for non-surgical endodontic therapy. The tooth was isolated with a rubber dam and a conventional endodontic access opening was made []. The working length of canal was estimated by means of an electronic apex locator (Root ZX; Morita, Tokyo, Japan) and then confirmed by a radiograph.
