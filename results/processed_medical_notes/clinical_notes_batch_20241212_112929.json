A preoperative histopathological examination revealed an intraosseous squamous cell carcinoma. The medical history data of the patient revealed no systemic diseases or smoking habits. The patient was treated with surgical removal of the lesion through subtotal mandibular resection, associated with a temporary tracheostomy, bilateral lymph node neck dissection and fibula free flap reconstruction (). After flap failure, a second fibula free flap was performed, but this again failed. Seven months later, a spontaneous internal jugular vein and external carotid artery laceration was treated by vessel ligation. The pectoralis flap was then used to supply soft tissue defects. Oncological follow-up observed a recurrence nineteen months after the first surgery. Multiple cycles of chemotherapy and monoclonal therapy were then administered. Radiotherapy was refused by the patient.\nThe first clinical evaluation in our department revealed an important deformity in the inferior third of the face associated with swallowing and language deficiency caused by tongue hypomobility and lower lip paralysis, incontinence, and incompetence.

His past medical history consisted of a 20 pack/year history of smoking and squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, status-post excision with subsequent radiation and chemotherapy a year and a half prior to his presentation. He also had recurrent disease with biopsy-proven metastatic disease in the cervical lymph nodes nine months after the initial diagnosis and multiple lung nodules on CT and PET scans six months thereafter. He was continued on immunotherapy with nivolumab with subsequent cycles planned.\nHe was admitted for workup of the near syncope.

However, because the Vater papilla was located inside a diverticulum in the third portion of the duodenum, the use of a stone crusher was difficult. Therefore, a double-pigtail plastic stent (Zimmon Biliary Stent, 4 cm, 7 Fr; Cook Japan, Tokyo, Japan) was placed to prevent post-ES cholecystitis, and the stent was replaced usually every 3 to 12 months.

The constant refusal to suck the pacifier and to be breastfed, meant that it took a long time to feed the baby. The medical report informed that there was a delay in weight gain. At the first medical examination, a voluminous and mobile tumoral alteration was noticed on the dorsum of the tongue, resting anteriorly, but it wasn\u2019t possible to stipulate whether it extended to the oropharyngeal area.\nA new exam was set and when the computer images were obtained \u2013 for which the patient was sedated under spontaneous breathing \u2013 a pediculated mass with a cylindrical body could be seen (phallic). It was located longitudinally on the dorsum of the tongue, with its base placed in the median furrow, at an almost equal distance between the apex of the tongue and the foramen cecum. The lesion was mobile to any direction, composed of a soft consistency, yielding to traction and with color and texture similar to those of the oral mucous membranes (Figure ).\nComputed topography images were obtained. Through the use of a non ionic oral radiocontrastant a polipoid lesion was clearly distinguishable on the dorsum of the tongue, measuring 2,1cm x 0,8cm. The use of an oral radiocontrast allowed not only for the delimitation of the lesion's contours, but also, its dynamics, demonstrating its movement from the dorsum of the tongue to the oropharyngeal area, suspending the soft palate (Figure ).\nSurgery was performed under general anesthetic, using nasotracheal intubation.

The tissue loss and zone of injury extended from his distal thigh down to the ankle (Figure ). After assessment by a number of orthopedic and plastics consultants, it was decided to salvage the limb. He underwent an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of his right lateral femoral condyle, a right retrograde femoral nail, and ORIF of the tibia. He had two separate free flaps (a chimera scapular/parascapular and anterolateral thigh) to his right lower leg, and split skin grafting to the remainder of the right lower limb. As the initial defect was too large to be primarily reconstructed with free flaps, coverage of the exposed bone and metalwork was prioritized. He was affected by post-traumatic stress disorder subsequently, along with some chronic pain issues, for which he self-medicated with cannabis oil. He was a smoker of seven a day, but did not take any regular prescribed medications and did not drink. Upon regular post-operative review, it was found that while healed, the limb exhibited a poor return of function, and a major contributor was the lack of motion of the right knee joint (Figures , ).\nClinical findings, diagnosis assessment, and therapeutic intervention\nThe patient was readmitted electively for revisional surgery due to decreased range of motion and functionality in the right knee.

She gave a past history of pain 6 months ago with recurrent swelling at the lower left back tooth region. On the day of examination, there was moderate, intermittent pain in the same region, which was sudden in onset. No aggravating or relieving factors were present.\nClinical examination showed fair plaque and oral hygiene scores, mild gingivitis, and 0.10% bleeding score. Deep periodontal pockets in relation to first molars of all quadrants and furcation involvement with the same tooth of second, third, and fourth quadrants were noted.\nRadiographic examination revealed the presence of arc-shaped bone defect in the first molar region of all quadrants extending from the distal of second premolar to mesial of second molar.\nBased on the above clinical and radiographic findings, the case was provisionally diagnosed as localized aggressive periodontitis.\nThe treatment carried out was as follows: initially, nonsurgical Phase I therapy comprising of scaling and root planing along with oral antimicrobial therapy (doxycycline 100 mg, two tablets stat on 1st day; once daily for the next 13 days) was carried out.\nFor teeth exhibiting very deep intrabony defects, vitality test was performed using an electric pulp tester. In this case, premolars and molars of third and fourth quadrants were found to be vital and, hence, no endodontic treatment was performed, and periodontal flap surgery was carried on.\nFor the first quadrant, conventional flap was raised from mesial of first premolar to distal of first molar, debridement was done, and a bony ledge was noted on the buccal aspect.

The patient was transferred from an outside hospital where he had been intubated and placed in a pelvic binder and fluid resuscitated. At the time of presentation at our facility, the patient was deemed hemodynamically stable with a GCS of 11. A pelvic hematoma could be seen on the outside hospital CT. The pelvic ring injury consisted of a pubic symphysis disruption and a markedly displaced complete zone 3 sacral fracture from S1 through the coccyx (Figures and ). On exam, he was noted to have left lower extremity weakness but intact sensation.\nOn hospital day 3, the patient was brought to the operating room for fixation of the anterior and posterior pelvic ring injuries. First, he underwent open reduction and internal fixation of his anterior pelvic ring injury. While the patient was positioned supine, the pubic symphysis was reduced with a Farabeuf clamp and stabilized with a 6-hole symphyseal plate with 3.5 mm screw fixation. The posterior ring was then compressed with S1 and S2 transsacral screws compressing the zone 3 sacral fracture.\nOn hospital day 4, postoperative radiographs demonstrated unacceptable residual displacement of his sacrum through the zone 3 fracture site (Figures and ).

At the time, she was being investigated for recurrent sore throat and had had CT and MRI scans. She had a melanoma from her neck excised at the age of 11 and an ankle fracture fixation in 2014. She was taking omeprazole for a hiatus hernia. She was a nonsmoker, had used oral contraception for 10 years, and had no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. On examination, there were no palpable lumps in either breasts (P1) and no palpable lymph nodes bilaterally in the axillae, neck, or groin.\nMammography and ultrasonography were performed. There were no previous scan images to compare with as the patient's lesion was screen-detected. The left breast mammogram showed an 8 mm rounded density posteriorly in the inner half of the breast. In line with the mammography findings, the ultrasound scan showed a 7 mm, well-defined ovoid echogenic lesion in the same area of the breast. Given that ultrasound scanning is operator-dependent, the size discrepancy between the scans is in keeping with the difference in measurement within the imaging modalities. Both scans suggested appearances strongly in favour of a benign lesion (R3, U3). Three core biopsies were then performed (Figures and ).\nThe lesion was fibro-fatty tissue containing a diffuse infiltrate of lymphoid cells macroscopically (B3/4). It was initially thought to be either a reactive lymph node or a low-grade lymphoma.

The first day after surgery, at approximately 9 a.m., he complained of severe pain in the wound region and developed a fever in which the highest temperature reached was 39 \u00b0C. Upon examination, the patient was conscious without chills and other discomfort, and the incision was severely swollen and filled with hemorrhagic content. Analgesic therapy was given, but the patient did not feel pain relief. Early on the second morning, the patient started to become irritable and apathetic and the incision was inflamed. The following afternoon, at approximately 3 p.m., the patient felt increasing pain out of proportion to the physical findings accompanied by progressive swelling, numbness, and weakness of the limb. The skin around the wound was darkened, and tension blisters were visible (Fig. ). The patient was delirious on the third morning after surgery, the systemic skin turned yellow, and there was a large amount of dark red, bloody discharge drainage from the incision with bubbles of gas, and a foul, sweetish, unpleasant odor was smelled in the incision. A physical examination revealed subcutaneous crepitus extending along the length of the limb, roentgenograms revealed the accumulation of gas in soft tissue (Fig. ), the lower limb skin temperature decreased, the dorsal artery of the foot could not be touched, and the patient had no response to pain in the lower extremities.

The pain was characterized by paroxysmal headache and was mainly located in the parietal with no pulsation and other accompanying symptoms. The headache occurred several times a day, lasting 3 to 5 minutes each time. In addition, the patient had no history of brain lesions.\nConsequently, the patient underwent neurological diagnostic examination; the size of both pupils were equal (3.0 mm in diameter); pupillary light reflex was sensitive; movement and sensation of limbs were normal; physiological reflex was present, and pathological reflex was not elicited. The remaining nerve system did not show abnormal activity. Next, the patient underwent head MR (on April 7, 2018). A nodular long T1 and T2 signal was found on the right side of parietal falx cerebri (Fig. A and B). FLAIR showed high signal intensity (Fig. C); DWI was slightly limited (Fig. D) and a low signal intensity was observed on diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (Fig. E). In addition, a significant homogeneous enhancement was also observed (Fig. F). The result of complete blood cell (CBC), routine urine test, renal function, liver function and blood biochemical parameters were all normal. The patient had no significant medical or family history. According to clinical and imaging features, the lesion was diagnosed as meningioma.\nSince the patient had no contraindications for surgery, craniotomy was performed on April 12, 2018. During the operation, the tumor was observed within the dura surface. On the surface of dura, the parafalx tumor presented gray and hard with wide base, with abundant blood supply and complete capsule. There was no obvious adhesion between the lesion and the surrounding brain tissue. According to intraoperative condition, tumor",

Just after the embolisation, he developed an acutely ischemic right leg, for which he underwent a successful thromoboembolectomy through a femoral arteriotomy. Embolectomy was performed using a size 2\u20133 Fogarty Embolectomy catheter. Fresh thrombus was retrieved and blood flow resumed with restoration of pre-event distal pulses.\nThe patient presented with right leg pain 2 weeks following embolectomy. On admission he had a pulse rate of 80 beats per minute and was normotensive. There was no apparent leg swelling, no visible sign of ischemia or injury to the leg. Dorsalis pedis pulse was not palpable though good posterior tibial and popliteal pulses were present. An expansile swelling was palpable on the anteromedial surface of the leg, 5 cm above the ankle.\nA colour Doppler ultrasound of the leg suggested the presence of a peroneal pseudoaneurysm. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed a 5.1 \u00d7 2.4 cm pseudoaneurysm at the distal third of the mid peroneal artery. There was also a small aneurysmal dilatation of the mid peroneal artery (Figure ). Embolization using five 4 mm \u00d7 2 mm coils was performed, proximal and distal to the pseudoaneurysm (Figure ).

She often performed repetitive tasks in the overhead position as an orchard farmer. She complained of difficulty in performing work because of the loss of muscle strength in her right upper limb while working for a prolonged time in the overhead position 6 months prior to visiting our clinic.

Chest-enhanced CT after admission revealed a space-occupying lesion in the right chest. The pathological diagnosis according to percutaneous lung biopsy was a solitary fibrous tumor. Preoperative three-dimensional reconstruction showed that the blood supply to the tumor originated from the arteries and veins of the right lower lobe (Fig. ). After complete preoperative preparation, the patient underwent resection of the tumor with single-operation-incision thoracoscopy. Incision selection is one cm for the endoscope port (at the midaxillary line of the seventh intercostal space) and two cm for the operation port (at the preaxillary line of the fifth intercostal space). Intraoperative exploration revealed that the tumor had two tumor pedicles (Fig. ), and both were located in the right lower lobe. The tumor pedicles were intraoperatively separated using a linear stapling device. Because the specimen was large and the surface was smooth, bagging the specimen by the traditional method was difficult; therefore, the specimen was bagged by adjusting the operating table. The detailed procedure was as follows: First, the operating table was arranged with the head at a lower position, and the specimen bag was inserted into the thoracic cavity. Then, the operating table was adjusted such that the head was at a higher position to enable loading of the specimen into the specimen bag by gravity. Due to the large size of the specimen, extracting the specimen by the traditional method was difficult.

There was no history of previous orchitis or scrotal contusion. He noted the mass a month ago. A physical examination found a 2 cm palpable mass in the upper pole of his left testis. There were no signs of scrotal inflammation. The mass had a firm consistency and regular margins. Palpation of his right testis and the lower pole of his left testis were normal. Routine blood tests were normal. As a testicular tumor was strongly suspected, a bioassay of testicular tumor markers was ordered. Alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were in the normal ranges. There was no bacterial growth in urine analysis, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis screening. A scrotal ultrasound showed a homogeneous testicular parenchyma, with a conserved vascularization on Doppler. An extratesticular mass was observed, attached to the upper pole of his testis. The mass was isoechoic to the testis parenchyma, and poorly vascularized Doppler (Fig. ).\nHe underwent a radical inguinal orchiectomy. We first performed a high ligation of the spermatic cord. The operative specimen included the testis and the tunica vaginalis in one piece (Fig. ). The macroscopic aspect of the supratesticular mass looks similar to splenic tissue (Fig. ). There were no macroscopic lesions of the testis and the spermatic cord. His postoperative course was uneventful. He was discharged on the second postoperative day.\nHistological examination of the operative specimen confirmed the presence of regular splenic tissue in the suspect mass, without any signs of malignancy.

    "original_text": "A 42-year-old female patient presented with progressive visual disturbance. She did not have any other medical history before but hypertension and pulmonary tuberculosis. Humphrey test revealed defect of more than three quarters of her bilateral visual field. No other neurologic deficits were found. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a heterogeneously enhanced solid and cystic mass involving the sella and suprasellar region with compression of an optic apparatus (). The solid part of the tumor showed isointense signal with heterogeneous enhancement on T1-weighted images and slightly hyperintensity on T2-weighted images.\nThe tumors were approached with a transsphenoidal route. A yellowish-grey mass was seen over a pituitary gland and no definite diaphragm was identified. The tumor was not dissected from a pituitary gland so that a part of a pituitary gland was resected together with the tumor mass. The frozen section of the tumor showed the presence of high grade malignant tumor cells and not a benign tumor such as a pituitary adenoma. Most of solid part of the tumor was removed, however, and a part of the thin tumor capsule was left as it was very adhesive to the optic nerves and chiasm. Intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage was noted and sellar floor reconstruction was done with our conventional method [].\nOn low magnification, hematoxylin-eosin stain revealed relatively homogenous population of tumor cells with very high cellularity. At the inferior margin of the tumor mass, it showed a continuation between the tumor mass and pituitary gland.

He had one episode of hematuria at two years of age but no other complaints such as abdominal pain, fever, loss of appetite or weight loss. On systemic examination, there were no palpable masses or any other abnormalities. As part of the initial work up, an ultrasonography of abdomen was performed, this showed a partly exophytic hypo-echoic mass arising from the interpolar region, measuring 4.7 \u00d7 4.8 \u00d7 5.3 cm. Vascularity was noted within the mass, suggestive of Wilm's tumour. Ultrasound guided biopsy of the renal mass was performed, which on microscopic examination showed a tumour composed of sheets of spindle shaped cells with oval to elongated nuclei and moderate amounts of cytoplasm. There was no obvious atypia or any other feature of malignancy. Occasional tubules were noted, lined by cuboidal cells. The biopsy was reported as a spindle cell lesion with occasional tubular structures. The cells were negative for WT-1 and S-100 on immunohistochemistry. Based on the biopsy report and the radiological findings, the patient underwent nephroureterectomy. The operation was uneventful and the patient recovered appropriately.\nA kidney measuring nine cm in maximum dimension was received in the laboratory. The external surface was smooth. Sectioning revealed a firm white tumour, 7.5 \u00d7 5.5 \u00d7 4.5 cm replacing most of the kidney. There were a few small cystic areas containing serous fluid. The neoplasm appeared to abut the pelvis but there was no infiltration into pelvic or perirenal fat [].

Although she experienced slight difficulty in swallowing, she did not experience pain or tongue paralysis. Her medical and family histories were unremarkable.\nIntraoral examination revealed a well-defined 3.5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 cm-sized solid, spherical submucosal nodule adjacent to the sublingual gland; the nodule was covered with light bluish smooth mucus (Fig. ). The patient experienced slight pain when pressure was applied to the tumor. Mobility and sensory functions of the tongue were normal, and no lymphadenopathy in the submandibular region was detected on palpation. All relevant laboratory test results were normal. Enhanced computed tomography revealed a 2.8 \u00d7 1.8 \u00d7 2.1 cm-sized well-defined, solid, heterogeneous nodule that did not appear to involve the mandible (Fig. ). In addition, a three-dimensionally reconstructed image showed a nodular lesion occupying the left floor of the mouth with abundant blood flow (Fig. ). No enlarged lymph nodes were found in the submental or submandibular regions.\nThe initial clinical impression was a benign salivary gland tumor, dermoid cyst, or benign connective tissue neoplasm. The patient was scheduled for surgery via an intraoral approach. First, an elliptical incision was made around the periphery of the sublingual gland through only the oral mucosa, and a full-thickness tissue flap was prepared along the lingual aspect of the sublingual gland. After the sublingual gland was freed from its surrounding tissue with blunt dissection, a well-circumscribed tumor without capsular extension was found beneath the body of the sublingual gland and located above the submandibular gland duct and lingual nerve.

Contrast-enhanced CT revealed irregular lumen in the right renal artery (Fig. ); however, she had normal blood pressure and a blood test indicated normal renin activity and aldosterone level. Renal arteriography visualized a 15-mm long string-of-beads pattern at the proximal right renal artery (Fig. ), while the rest of the distal right renal artery and the whole left renal artery appeared intact. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed with moderate renal artery FMD. A renogram with technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine revealed that the ERPFs of the right and left kidneys were 48.4 and 64.1 mL/min, respectively. Considering the laterality of FMD as well as the difference of ERPF, her right kidney was judged to be suitable as a graft kidney.\nLaparoscopic right donor nephrectomy by the retroperitoneal approach and kidney transplantation to the recipient were performed. Following the removal of the donor kidney, we resected 20 mm of the right renal artery, including 15 mm of the diseased portion documented by preoperative imaging examinations, considering the finding of intraoperative palpation. The renal artery was then reconstructed using a graft of the internal iliac artery and its brunch harvested from the recipient on extracorporeal surgery. As shown in Figure , end-to-end anastomosis between the donor renal artery and arterial graft was performed at two proximal sites using the interrupted suture. Then, the graft kidney was transplanted in the right iliac fossa by vascular anastomoses with arterial graft to the internal iliac artery in an end-to-end fashion and the renal vein to the external iliac vein in an end-to-side fashion.

The lesions on the right arm appeared first and spread serially to the right breast and back during the next month. Three years previously she had been diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast and underwent a right breast-conserving mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. Tumor stage was determined pathologically to be T1N2(4/10)M0. Three weeks later, she started adjuvant chemotherapy with four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, followed by four cycles of docetaxel for 5 months. After 1 month, she underwent radiation therapy to the whole right breast with a dose of 50.4 Gy and a boost to the tumor bed with a dose of 9 Gy in 33 total fractions. After radiation therapy was completed, she started rehabilitation therapy with complete decongestive therapy on the right arm for the secondary lymphedema. About 2 year later, she presented with a skin eruption. A physical examination showed multiple, oval to rounderythematous patches with silvery scale on the right arm, breast, and back. No associated symptoms were observed. She still suffered from the lymphedema and wore an elastic compression garment on the entire length of the right arm. A histological examination of the biopsy specimen from the right breast skin lesion revealed an irregular acanthosis with rete ridge elongation, parakeratotic mounds with focal hypogranulosis, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration into the upper dermis (). Based on the histological features, the skin lesion was diagnosed as psoriasis. The patient was treated with twice-weekly applications of narrow-band ultraviolet B with a starting dose of 300 mJ/cm2 and a combined ointment containing calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate once per day. The lesions were nearly resolved after 1 month but post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation remained ().",

Propranolol and hydrochlorothiazide were prescribed previously to treat medication-induced peripheral edema and tremor. Our patient accidentally received the medication of another patient: clozapine 300 mg, theophylline 200 mg, olanzapine 30 mg, warfarin 5 mg, and 1 g of potassium chloride. Four hours after the initial dose he arrived at our emergency room for a clinical examination.\nThe first clinical examination took place 6 h after our patient took the incorrect medication. This examination was unremarkable and demonstrated that he had a soft non-tender abdomen. Results from an electrocardiogram were normal and there was no tachycardia or fever. Blood tests revealed a normal leucocyte level, an international normalized ratio of 1.0, minor thrombocytopenia (127 \u00d7 109/l), and a normal C-reactive protein level. Two hours later, our patient started to complain about upper abdominal pain and vomited brown liquid several times. An abdominal X-ray revealed gastric stasis. The next morning (14 h after taking the wrong medication) a gastroscopy was performed, which revealed necrotic esophageal mucosa starting 25 cm from the upper incisor teeth that abruptly ended at his gastroesophageal junction (Figs. and ). The ventricle was extremely dilated because of the presence of air but only a minimal amount of liquid was present. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which showed an edematous esophagus (Fig. ) but no perforation.

Her two younger siblings were healthy. Her mother reported scarce fetal movements during pregnancy. She was born at term and suffered from an amniotic infection syndrome requiring antibiotic treatment and oxygen supply. She had congenital severe bilateral ptosis that required head extension for upward gaze. She was bottle fed owing to poor suction. She had normal spontaneous limb movements and started rolling over at 3\u20134 months of age. She could not lift her head at ventral position and failed to crawl. She achieved independent sitting at 5\u20136 months of age and standing position at 10 months. She walked independently at 14 months of age and was able to climb stairs from two years of age onwards. She fell frequently that was likely provoked by an impaired downside field of view as she compensated her ptosis by head extension. In addition, she developed increasing difficulties for stair climbing and required pulling at the ramp and pushing on her upper legs with her arms. However, she could climb walls independently as leisure activity. Walking became more difficult with walking perimeter below one kilometer because of rapid fatigability. She developed an increasing hyperlordosis. At the age of 5 years she developed a respiratory insufficiency requiring short-term invasive assisted ventilation during a respiratory infection. Nocturnal non-invasive-assisted ventilation was started to compensate sleep disordered breathing and nocturnal hypoventilation.
