A detailed medical, dental, and social history was obtained. He was both self-conscious and unhappy as regard the appearance of his teeth. Clinical examination revealed that tissue loss affected all teeth. The enamel layer was very thin and Brown (pigmented), the cuspal structure was completely absent in the occlusal portion of the molars which were most severely affected, and enamel pit defects (pigmented stains deep) were present in the anterior teeth (Figures , , and ). However, the clinical appearance of cervical and approximal enamel seemed to be normal. It was thought that the patient likely suffered from a hypomature type of AI. The patient's occlusal vertical dimension and rest vertical dimension were assessed. The interocclusal rest space had increased because of attrition of the molars. The exposed dentin was hypersensitive. Clinical and radiographic examination of the patient revealed deep carious lesions in the maxillary four teeth, and the mandibular left first molar had been extracted because of severe attrition and caries approximately 10 months earlier.\nA treatment plan was developed with the following aims: to reduce the reported sensitivity of the teeth, to modify the occlusion, to restore mild crowding and masticatory function, and to improve the aesthetics. The patient was informed of the diagnosis and all treatment plans were discussed with him and his parents. He could not afford prosthetic treatment, including porcelain or ceramic restorations. Therefore, the treatment plan included placement of direct composite resin restorations in maxillary and mandibular anterior and posterior teeth.

The patient had been visiting friends and relatives in the DRC and had returned to the US two days prior to presentation. History was obtained primarily from the patient\u2019s son as his father was delirious, which limited his ability to provide a comprehensive history. The son stated that the patient\u2019s symptoms began one week prior to presentation while still in the DRC. The patient returned to the US in a feeble state per the son. He had very little oral intake over the prior week and would wake up confused and disoriented during the three days prior, including not recognizing his own house or shower on the day of presentation. The patient\u2019s confusion would wax and wane but seemed worse upon wakening in the morning and after napping, and would improve throughout the day. He reported night sweats and chills but no known fevers. He had multiple episodes of dark diarrhea, but no bright red blood or black stools. He had a mild cough but no dyspnea or chest pain.

This plaque had begun as a small nodule on the shin 1 month prior to this visit. It had gradually extended outward in a centrifugal pattern despite oral antimicrobial treatment by her family physician. She was initially diagnosed and treated as a case with cellulitis and with poor clinical response. This patient denied having had a sore throat or arthralgia in the previous months. Other than diabetes mellitus type II, she had no significant medical history. She had been taking oral hypoglycemic agents for many years. On physical examination, it became evident that she had a large erythematous plaque measuring 30 \u00d7 30 cm2 on the anterolateral aspect of her lower left leg []. There was mild edema and local tenderness on the leg plaque. The color of this morpheaform plaque varied from red to brown, and its surface was mildly scaling. A skin biopsy specimen was then taken from the newly extending area on the left calf. Histopathological examination revealed that the pathologic changes were mainly in the subcutaneous tissue, in which the septa were thickened and there existed lymphohistiocytic infiltrate and a few neutrophil and occasional multinucleated giant cells. Some inflammatory cells had infiltrated into the periphery of the fat lobules (Septal panniculitis) []. The vessels have not any obvious pathology. A mild perivascular inflammatory infiltrate was also present in the dermis. The overlying epidermis was mildly acanthotic and hyperkeratotic. These findings suggested a diagnosis of erythema nodosum migrans. The results of laboratory investigations were within normal limits.

He was conscious, hemodynamically stable, and without signs of active bleeding or cervical spine injuries. Physical examination showed significant edema in the region of the mandibular angle, trismus, restriction of mandibular movements, absence of rhinorrhea or epistaxis, and soft tissue injury compatible with the bullet entrance orifice in the right posterior cervical region without clinical signs of exit bullet orifice.\nComputed tomography showed a comminuted fracture of the coronary and mandibular right ascending branches associated with ipsilateral zygomatic-orbital fracture (Fig. ) and the presence of artifacts compatible with the firearm projectile, suggesting an upward trajectory toward the face (Figs. ,).\nAfter physical and imaging evaluation, vascular surgery and neurosurgery teams opted for conservative treatment. However, the maxillofacial surgery team indicated surgical removal of the bone fragments due to the restrictions of the mandibular movements and removal of the fragments of the projectile due to discomfort and superficialisation in the genic region.\nOn the third day after trauma, under general anesthesia, removal of the bone fragments was initiated by intraoral access in the ascending ramus of the mandible, which evolved intraoperatively with an intense arterial bleeding, incompatible with the surgical procedure. Local compression maneuvers were performed using compresses, attempts to pinch with instruments after local exploration and the use of hemostatics, but they were not enough to contain the bleeding.

Earlier, she had a single large similar eruption on left breast 10 days ago. She gave a history of upper respiratory infection 2 weeks before the onset of first lesion, when she had a mild fever, coryza, and malaise lasting for 5 days. She received a combination of ibuprofen+paracetamol and cetrizine orally, prescribed by a family practitioner for 3 days. She had been treated with the same drugs several times earlier by the same physician.\nThere was no history of similar lesions in the past. Her past and family health was unremarkable.\nThere was no history suggestive of allergic or irritant contact dermatitis in the present case. She did not receive any other systemic medications in the recent past. Travel history was insignificant. She distinctly denied a history of tick bites.\nThe first lesion was a large oval plaque measuring approximately 7 cm \u00d7 6 cm, almost occupying the whole left breast, with peripheral collarette scaling and central clearing with minimal itching. She was treated by a family physician with topical miconazole cream for 10 days without significant resolution. The patient refused the front of chest to be photographed and hence, a picture of herald plaque could not be taken. Prescriptions brought by the patient were verified specifically and did not contain topical or systemic steroids.\nShe suddenly developed the subsequent lesions as multiple, sharply demarcated, large scaly lesions of irregular shape on front and back of trunk as well as lateral thighs extending upto the hips on both sides somewhat in symmetrical distribution.

He was hypotensive but alert and required a left needle thoracostomy for decreased breath sounds. On arrival, he remained hypotensive with blood pressures 60 mmHg systolic. He was intubated and a massive transfusion protocol was activated. He was found to have left chest deformity, and a left chest tube was placed with an initial return of >2000 cc blood.\nHe was taken to the operating room emergently for a left thoracotomy where he was found to have multiple comminuted rib fractures, multiple large pulmonary lacerations, a left diaphragm injury, and bilateral hemothoraces. A fragment of bone was found abutting the pericardium, and the thoracotomy was converted to a clamshell thoracotomy to better evaluate the heart. The pericardium was incised and the heart was found to be intact. A tractotomy was required to control pulmonary hemorrhage and the left chest packed. An exploratory laparotomy was performed which was negative except for superficial splenic lacerations. His other injuries include a left humerus fracture and left scapula fracture.\nPostoperatively, he remained hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the low 80s mmHg and hypoxic despite massive transfusion including 38 packed red blood cells, 36 plasma, and 4 units of platelets. A this point, we had exhausted our hospital's blood supply and prognosis remained poor. He was started on vasopressors and resuscitation continued.\nWhile in the intensive care unit, he failed to respond to additional fluid resuscitation and hemorrhage was felt to be controlled.

Below is a day to day account of the development of the sickness based on the mother's experiences of the care received at the PHC facilities where she first sought help for her sick baby.\nDay 1: The child started having diarrhoea and vomiting. The mother took her child to a nearby public dispensary. At the dispensary, mother was given metronidazole tablets to give the child at home.\nDay 2: Observing no improvement in the child, the next morning mother went back to the same dispensary. This time she was given one packet of oral rehydration solution and was told to continue giving metronidazole tablets as well.\nDay 3: The diarrhoea and vomiting was getting worse. The child was getting weaker and started breathing fast. The mother decided to go straight to the health centre (next higher level facility). On arrival, she was ordered by the clinician to go and buy an injection (antibiotic) from the local drug store which she was told was going to help the fast breathing. After the child had received the injection she was then asked to take her to be investigated for malaria at a nearby private laboratory. There she paid, had the child tested and brought back the results which revealed malaria parasites. She was then told to go and buy quinine syrup.

She had a history of vague headaches and a family history of hypertension and ischemic heart disease but did not have a formal diagnosis of hypertension herself. Initial examination and investigations revealed a normal hemoglobin level (12.1 mg/dL), minimally raised neutrophil count, and a normal renal profile. Chest X-ray revealed severe congestive cardiac failure with markedly raised blood pressure (230/130). ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophic changes which were incorrectly interpreted as left bundle branch block (LBBB). A quick bedside echo revealed moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and no significant valvular lesions (such as mitral or aortic regurgitation or aortic stenosis) which could have accounted for her clinical deterioration. She was commenced on an intravenous nitrate infusion and transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in our tertiary care facility for a presumed acute coronary event leading to decompensated cardiac failure.\nOn arrival to our facility, the patient was extremely moribund and complained of severe dyspnea and chest discomfort. Her blood pressure was still unchanged at 230/130 mm Hg. Additional antihypertensive pharmacotherapy was considered; however, in view of her unstable clinical status, we decided to shift her to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.\nCoronary angiogram revealed nonobstructive coronary artery disease with severely raised end diastolic pressure. In view of the nature of her presentation, renal angiography was performed which showed a normal right renal artery while an ostial occlusion of the left renal artery was noted (Figures and ).

She walked lame due to pain. During her physical examination, the patella was found to have dislocated laterally towards the knee flexion and reduced the normal position to 30 degrees flexion during extension (Fig. ). The results of an apprehension test and posterior drawer test were positive and the knee was significantly laxed under both valgus and varus stress testing. An artificial mass was palpated at the medial side of the distal femur. X-rays of the knee revealed a tibial posterior sag, the femoral component had been installed at an extremely valgus position, and the patella surface was still native, but irregular and sclerotic. No implant loosening was evident (Fig. ). The FTA was measured at 159\u00b0, HKA at 9\u00b0 and mLDFA at 80\u00b0, all of which were out of the normal range. CT analysis of the axial section confirmed that the femoral and tibial prosthesis had been adequately installed (Fig. ). TT-TG distance was 8 mm.

    "original_text": "A 72-year-old female presented to the emergency room with the complaint of left thigh pain and the inability to walk after tumbling. She had been suffering from osteoarthritis of the left hip but was able to walk with a cane and sit on a couch. She had also received the diagnosis of osteoporosis and had been taking alendronate 35 mg weekly for six years. The initial radiograph in the emergency room showed a non-comminuted subtrochanteric fracture of the left femur with cortical thickness and the beaking of the lateral cortex at the fracture site. The fracture line was transverse on the lateral side and oblique on the medial side. The radiographic findings and the weakness of the force that caused the fracture satisfied the criteria for an atypical fracture of the femur. The radiograph showed Kellgren-Lawrence grade 4 osteoarthritis of the left hip as well, with superomedial migration, the external rotation of the femoral head, and the shortening of the femoral neck (Figure ).\nOsteosynthesis with intramedullary nailing was planned. However, the deformity of the hip joint appeared to preclude correct nail insertion. Furthermore, whenever we used a fracture table in the past, we often observed that the perineal post of the fracture table impeded the adduction of the proximal fragment of the subtrochanteric fracture while the whole leg was being adducted, resulting in varus malalignment. On the other hand, we were aware of easy access to the entry point via the standard lateral decubitus position without using the perineal post. For these reasons, we decided to fix the fracture with a nail in the lateral decubitus position.

    "cleaned_text": "a 72-year-old female presented to the emergency room with the complaint of left thigh pain and the inability to walk after tumbling. she had been suffering from osteoarthritis of the left hip but was able to walk with a cane and sit on a couch. she had also received the diagnosis of osteoporosis and had been taking alendronate 35 mg weekly for six years. the initial radiograph in the emergency room showed a non-comminuted subtrochanteric fracture of the left femur with cortical thickness and the beaking of the lateral cortex at the fracture site. the fracture line was transverse on the lateral side and oblique on the medial side. the radiographic findings and the weakness of the force that caused the fracture satisfied the criteria for an atypical fracture of the femur. the radiograph showed kellgren-lawrence grade 4 osteoarthritis of the left hip as well, with superomedial migration, the external rotation of the femoral head, and the shortening of the femoral neck (figure ).\nosteosynthesis with intramedullary nailing was planned. however, the deformity of the hip joint appeared to preclude correct nail insertion. furthermore, whenever we used a fracture table in the past, we often observed that the perineal post of the fracture table impeded the adduction of the proximal fragment of the subtrochanteric fracture while the whole leg was being adducted, resulting in varus malalignment. on the other hand, we were aware of easy access to the entry point via the standard lateral decubitus position without using the perineal post. for these reasons, we decided to fix the fracture with a nail in the lateral decubitus position. total hip arthroplasty with fracture fixation was not chosen because of its invasiveness, which was inappropriate for the rather mild, pre-injury symptoms due to osteoarthritis, and because of the patient's wish to preserve the femoral head.\nin surgery, a flat, radiolucent operating table was used. the whole injured leg was sterilized and draped,",

    "original_text": "The patient is a 65-year-old female who initially presented with severe abdominal pain and was eventually found to have bowel obstruction. At that time, she had undergone sigmoidectomy and primary anastomosis to manage the bowel obstruction. However, it was complicated by an anastomotic leak which required exploratory lap and end colostomy. During the same hospital course after surgery, the patient developed acute onset dyspnea and hypoxic respiratory failure. Based on clinical features of developing pitting edema and orthopnea, a diagnosis of CHF was made. Two doses of IV Lasix 20mg were given with significant clinical improvement then patient got discharged. However, patient presented to ED with similar complaints of dyspnea, orthopnea and pitting edema after 4 days of discharge. On lab investigation, CBC showed leukocytosis and hemoglobin of 11 with normal peripheral smear. Electrolytes and renal function were within normal limits. Urinalysis was unremarkable. A CT angiogram was performed which excluded pulmonary embolism, but instead discovered an incidental filling defect that was present along the right side of descending thoracic aorta at 9 o\u2019clock position opposite the carina and near the esophagus measuring 15.5 mm x 12.8 mm in size ()()(). Differential diagnosis for the filling defect at the time included a mural thrombus, primary arterial/aortic tumor, primary myxoma, or xanthogranulomatous sarcomas. Infection of the aorta was less likely as there was no irregular wall thickening elsewhere or any suggestion of plaque with ulceration. The difficulty in determining the etiology prompted an MRI of the chest which better visualized and aided in diagnosing a thrombus in the descending aorta. She had also undergone a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed ejection fraction of 3540%, no valvular vegetations, and no septal defects.

Two hours after the accident, the patient presented to the emergency department with painful swelling of the neck, inspiratory stridor and increasing hoarseness. The clinical examination revealed a palpable mass on the right anterior part of the neck. Emergency tracheal intubation was performed due to progressive breathlessness and dyspnea. Subsequently, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a laceration of the right thyroid lobe with surrounding hematoma and tracheal deviation to the contralateral side (Fig. ). Therefore, the patient underwent emergency neck exploration with a 4-cm Kocher incision followed by a right hemithyroidectomy. Intraoperatively, the dorsal aspect of the right lobe of the thyroid gland was found to be ruptured with active arterial bleeding from branches of the inferior thyroid artery.

He underwent a colonoscopy which revealed an irregular thickening with a slightly raised area at the proximal transverse colon. Biopsies taken were reported as neuroendocrine carcinoma. An abdominal CT scan was done at the same hospital and revealed a mass in the proximal part of the transverse colon. No other lesions were seen. No significant lymph nodes or omental deposits were noted.\nPatient underwent resection of the transverse colon. The colonic segment showed a disc shaped slightly raised ulcerated mass measuring 23 \u00d7 20 mm. An infiltrating high grade malignancy was detected. It was reported to be positive for CD56 and focally positive for NSE and negative for other immunohistochemical stains including cytokeratins (AE1/AE3, CK20, and CK7), synaptophysin, chromogranin A, TTF-1, HMB45, Melan A, S100, and CDX2. The lesion was reported as grade 3 neuroendocrine carcinoma by the primary pathologist.\nThe patient was referred to the oncology centre in our hospital for further management. He had a whole body scan which showed no lesions anywhere else and was advised with follow-up. After a period of 9 months, he developed right shoulder pain and bleeding per rectum again. A whole body CT scan showed multiple osteolytic lesions involving rib, clavicle, and bilateral femoral shafts. A 11 \u00d7 10 cm mass was also noted in the retroperitoneum posterior to head of pancreas, attached to posterior wall of stomach and involving the duodenum. It was diagnosed as a recurrence of the initial colonic mass. Colonoscopy was done and showed a raised lesion at the anastomotic site from which biopsies were taken.

The mass gradually increased in size, and she had difficulty in walking.\nAt 1 year and 11 months of age, she was referred to our hospital.

Knee movement was restricted because of the tumor, but there were no neurological symptoms. Laboratory parameters including tumor marker levels were within normal ranges. Radiography showed a localized mass on the popliteal side of her lower right leg, with compression of the mass causing proximal tibia deformity (Fig. ).

During the first consultation, physical examination revealed limited range of motion of her left hip due to pain. Her Merle d'Aubign\u00e9-Postel score was 9 points, with the following distribution: pain, 2 points; walking ability, 3 points; and mobility, 4 points.\nAn anteroposterior plain radiograph of the hip indicated enlargement of the acetabular fossa of the affected hip (). Upon magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, coronal and axial images of the left hip joint revealed a large lesion with heterogeneous signal intensity that extended to both the intra-articular and extra-articular joint spaces. A large extra-articular tumour-like lesion appeared to be connected to the inferomedial joint capsule (). Arthrography and computed tomography (CT) images of the left hip joint also revealed a honeycomb appearance of the lesion (). These examination findings suggested that the tumour was a synovial osteochondromatosis forming a herniation sac. Therefore, our treatment goals were to confirm the diagnosis, extract intra-articular loose bodies, and perform a synovectomy using arthroscopy. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a synovial osteochondromatosis (). After examining the CT and MR images, we determined that a complete arthroscopic resection would be difficult and that an open anterior approach would be more suitable for manually reaching the herniation sac. Therefore, we performed open surgery using an anterior approach 2 weeks after the initial diagnostic arthroscopy.\nThe surgical procedure of this case was succinctly reported previously [], and the salient components of the procedure were as follows. The patient was placed in a supine position, and a 13 cm straight skin incision was made just lateral to the anterior superior iliac spine, extending distally. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve was identified beneath the fascia and was gently retracted medially. The joint capsule was exposed between the tensor fascia latae and the rectus femoris",

During the previous pregnancy, she received a combination of warfarin and heparin for anticoagulation, and the pregnancy and delivery were uneventful for both mother and infant. As with the previous pregnancy, oral administration of warfarin was switched to continuous intravenous infusion of heparin in the fifth week of gestation. In the 12 weeks of gestation, oral administration of warfarin was resumed at a dose of 3 mg/day, and then, the dose was increased to 4.5 mg/day. The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was maintained between 50 and 60 sec during heparin use, and prothrombin time by international normalized ratio (PT/INR) was maintained between 1.5 and 2.0 during oral administration of warfarin. On the fifth day of the 31 week of gestation, ultrasonography revealed mild enlargement of the left lateral ventricle of the fetus, measuring 1.0 cm, and it was found to have further enlarged to 1.5 cm on the fifth day of the 33 weeks of gestation (Fig.). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed on the first day of the 35 week of gestation revealed bilateral intracranial subdural hematoma in the fetus, and the left ventricle was found to have enlarged due to compression by the hematoma (Fig.). We determined that the fetal intracranial subdural hematoma had been caused by fetal intracranial hemorrhage associated with warfarin administration to the mother. On the same day, warfarin was discontinued and replaced with continuous intravenous infusion of heparin. Cardiotocography (CTG) showed that the fetal conditions were favorable and no anemia was observed based on the measurement of middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV).

She went to the nearest hospital where an abdominal X-ray was done nearly 2 h after the accident and showed that the battery is beyond the esophagus and stomach (shown in Fig. ). So, the decision was made for outpatient management and to repeat the abdominal X-ray after a week as long as the boy is asymptomatic.

On examination, the child was vitally stable, abdomen was lax with mild distension, and normal stool could be detected in PR examination. Laparoscopic exploration failed to detect the site of the battery and an evident discrepancy in the jejunum with hugely dilated proximal segment up to the duodenojejunal junction was identified and brought out through a longitudinal umbilical incision (shown in Fig. ). On palpation of the site of this discrepancy, a membrane-like thickening was felt with retained food particle proximal to it containing the battery (shown in Fig. ).

He has no family history of any psychiatric or medical illness. He had attained all his milestones on time, and he was an active student in his school. According to his parents, the patient's symptoms had started nine years ago when he had started to show inattentiveness, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. He was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperkinetic disorder (ADHD). His parents were counseled on behavioral therapy and the need for medications. His parents refused medications and agreed to behavioral therapy. They changed his environment.

Due to the huge amount of bleeding and the bone, which had not been resected at the beginning of the operation, concealing the bleeding point, the location of the bleeding point could not be determined. The bleeding seemed to be from a venous sinus at the far lower lateral corner of right posterior fossa. To stop the bleeding, TachoSil (Baxter, Deerfield, IL, USA) was used, but to no avail.

He had progressive dyspnoea and a history of syncope on exertion. The transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed severe stenosis of a BAV with a peak velocity of 3.9 m/s (peak gradient 61 mmHg, mean gradient of 39 mmHg and area of 0.89 cm2). There was also the presence of moderate aortic regurgitation. Coronary angiography revealed non-flow limiting coronary artery disease. MSCT confirmed a Sievers Type 1 bicuspid valve with a partial raphe between the right and left cusps. The aortic annulus was large with a perimeter measuring 98 mm, mean Sinus of Valsalva diameter of 40 mm and an inter-commisural distance of 29 mm (Figure ). Both common femoral arteries were of large caliber and measured 8 mm on the left and 9 mm on the right. Following discussion by the Heart team and careful analysis of the MSCT it was felt that TAVI was technically possible if deployed at the inter-commisural space.\nTAVI was performed under local anesthetic and the right femoral artery was cannulated and a 20 Fr sheath was inserted. The left femoral artery was cannulated and a 7 Fr sheath was inserted. The left femoral vein was used for insertion of a temporary pacemaker lead. The bicuspid aortic valve was crossed retrogradely using a Amplatz Left 1 diagnostic catheter and a hydrophilic coated straight tipped Glidewire. This was exchanged for a pre-shaped Safari wire and placed in the left ventricular apex. A balloon valvuloplasty was performed using a 25 mm balloon and a simultaneous aortogram was performed. The aortogram revealed a leak of contrast into the left ventricular cavity during balloon aortic valvuloplasty and felt to be an inadequate seal. A 34 mm Evolut CoreValve was deployed at the level of the leaflet tips, with hemodynamics and echocardiography confirming a",

She was initially diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus in the Internal Medicine Department, but after being treated, there was no improvement of her condition. She was then transferred to our department. We found a bacterial index of 4+ and a morphological index of 59.7% from the slit skin smear examination. The patient was then diagnosed with lepromatous leprosy with second-grade deformity and erythema nodosum leprosum reaction. She received multidrug therapy based on the World Health Organization multibacillary regimen for 12 months along with prednisone for 6 months. One year after release from treatment, multiple erythematous nodules reappeared, and she was diagnosed with erythema nodosum leprosum and received prednisone for 3 more months.\nIn the current examination, we found bilateral madarosis and hyperextension of the PIP joints and flexion of the DIP joints of the second to fifth fingers of both hands (Fig. , ). Neurological examinations showed ulnar nerve thickening by palpation and hypoesthesia without motor impairment of the fourth and fifth fingers of both hands.
