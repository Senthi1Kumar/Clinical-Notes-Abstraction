The surgical service requested epidural analgesia for assistance with post-operative pain management. Following uneventful thoracic epidural placement and negative catheter aspiration, a test dose of 1.5% lidocaine with 5 mcg/ml epinephrine was administered. This resulted in a transient increase in heart rate from approximately 80 beats per minute (BPM) to 115 BPM. There was no change in non-invasive blood pressure measurement and the patient remained asymptomatic. Attempts to aspirate blood through the epidural catheter failed to demonstrate any return of any fluid. Given the transient rise in heart rate, lack of change in blood pressure, negative aspiration, and lack of symptoms reported by the patient, a repeat test dose created by the provider was administered. Following administration of a second test dose, the patient experienced supraventricular tachycardia with heart rates of 200-210 BPM for approximately 2 minutes. This rhythm then converted to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with heart rate of 150-170 BPM. Initial conservative treatment with esmolol boluses was ineffective and the patient's blood pressure decreased from approximately 140/70 mm Hg to approximately 90/50 mm Hg.

The patient had more than six caf\u00e9 au lait spots on the trunk and extremities, axial and inguinal freckling and several cutaneous tumors that were slightly raised above the level of the skin. The patient had no physical discomfort, no motor or sensitive deficits. The patient stated that he had been operated 2 years earlier on a tumor of the back in another hospital. More detailed information was not available. Despite this previous treatment of the tumor, the remaining tumor mass disturbed him both physically and in his self-perception.

He remained on observation for 4 additional years and then received an additional 4 cycles of FCR followed by 5 cycles of maintenance rituximab. Five years later, he was found to have 17p deleted recurrent disease and he was started on ibrutinib with good response. He presented to an outside facility with acute onset altered mental status after stopping ibrutinib 2 months earlier due to financial constraints. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was initially concerning for CLL infiltration of the CNS with neoplastic-appearing lymphocytes identified by cytomorphology; however, serological tests for West Nile virus indicated acute infection based on positive IgM and negative IgG; however, PCR could not be performed. The patient received therapy for presumed CNS involvement by CLL with intrathecal methotrexate along with intravenous rituximab and methylprednisolone before being transferred to our institution. On admission, his complete blood count revealed leukocytosis with a normal differential and thrombocytopenia, after reviewing the patients' historical trends, we could discern that the platelet count had been within normal limits in the past and had likely decreased due to the acute illness; additionally, we can appreciate the increasing trend in WBCs until the start of treatment around 10 years prior to this admission (). Peripheral blood smear showed normal platelet morphology and moderate leukocytosis with lymphocytosis with coarse, block-like chromatin pattern concerning for prolymphocytoid transformation which had not been present previously.

In March 2012, one month after implanting a permcath catheter he came for the emergency department with signs of infection to elucidate. The results of the microscopic examination of urinary sediment showed 15 to 20 white blood cells (WBC), and so cephalexin was begun to treat a possible urinary infection. However, three days after the antibiotic therapy was begun the urinary sample did not show any bacterial growth. The patient returned with signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. A clinical examination of the patient showed an inflammation at the insertion site of the hemodialysis catheter. The patient was admitted in our critical care unit on 7 March 2012 with suspicion of CRBSI. The catheter was removed and another was implanted in his right femoral vein. Two samples of peripheral blood were sent for culture and empiric therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated within one hour of admittance to the ICU. The microbiology analysis of blood samples revealed MRSA. The therapy was changed to daptomycin on 12 March 2012. After 30 doses of daptomycin intravenously based on his glomerular filtrate rate (GFR), the patient was discharged from the hospital on 18 April.\nOn 9 May 2012, 20 days after the last dose of daptomycin, he returned to the hemodialysis department with a respiratory syndrome. The chest computed tomography demonstrated signs of pneumonia. Therefore, three samples of peripheral blood were sent to the hospital laboratory.

Her symptom continued with weight loss. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed and found a pancreatic cancer. She was admitted to our hospital in October 2012. Computed tomography (CT) showed a pancreatic head cancer with multiple hepatic metastases. It also revealed irregular duodenal stenosis, suggesting direct cancer infiltration into the second portion of the duodenum (fig. ). Percutaneous needle aspiration was performed to the pancreatic tumor. The pathological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma (fig. ). Laboratory findings on admission showed mild anemia and coagulation abnormalities. Tumor markers were markedly elevated (table ); CA19-9 was extremely high (>100,000 U/ml).\nThe patient's prognosis was considered extremely poor. Comparison of the CT findings on admission with those at the primary clinic 2 weeks previously demonstrated rapid tumor progression; the hepatic metastases had increased in size by approximately 15%. We concluded that we might have no chance to treat her with second-line chemotherapy if first-line chemotherapy failed. Therefore, we selected combination therapy with gemcitabine and S-1 (GS therapy), currently the therapy with the highest antitumor effect in Japan.\nMelena occurred just before the initiation of chemotherapy. Subsequent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed and revealed a giant ulcer 3 cm in diameter with oozing. We found neither arterial hemorrhage nor exposed blood vessels (fig. ). Her anemia did not deteriorate without any endoscopic hemostatic procedure and she was eligible for the scheduled chemotherapy. Melena occurred again on day 5 of chemotherapy with progressive anemia from 9.5 to 7.2 g/dl. Gastrointestinal endoscopy could not be performed because she rejected it. Total parenteral nutrition was started with a blood transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells.

    "original_text": "A 34-year-old female of Australasian ancestry, born in the UK, presented with subacute visual loss in the right eye preceded by retroocular pain. Vision deteriorated to no perception of light; vision in the unaffected (left) eye was 6/5 with normal perimetry. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed 2 weeks after the onset of her symptoms showed hyperintensity on STIR images and Gadolinium enhancement of the intraorbital portion of the right optic nerve (Figures and ). The brain appeared normal. A lumbar puncture was performed: the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was normal apart from minimal elevation in the number of lymphocytes (5/mm3). On CSF protein electrophoresis, one oligoclonal band was found in both CSF and serum and one or two further bands were found in the CSF only. Serological tests for NMO were negative. The diagnosis was made of non-MS optic neuritis.\nThe patient was treated with 1 g of Methyl Prednisolone intravenously for 3 days and with 60 mg of oral prednisolone for 3 weeks thereafter, at which point there had been good improvement in the right peripheral field. Her right visual acuity remained at 6/60 with a dense central scotoma, and the dose of prednisolone was steadily reduced as it was considered unlikely to improve further. Eventually, the daily dose was 7.5 mg and the signs were stable with no new symptoms. Repeat MR imaging was performed after one month at this dose and showed no persistent or recurrent enhancement. It was therefore considered reasonable to gradually reduce the corticosteroid dose further, that is, by 1 mg every two weeks.

X-ray of the right ankle done at the local urgent care center was normal and he was discharged home with a diagnosis of a right ankle sprain. The pain and swelling persisted and progressively got worse over the next week, prompting the visit to our ED.\nIn our ED, the patient appeared to be in moderate discomfort, unable to bear weight and has an ankle brace wrapped around his right ankle. Vital signs on presentation: temperature = 99.3 F, heart rate = 113 beats per minutes (tachycardia), blood pressure = 117/73 mmHg , respiratory rate = 18 breaths per minute, pulse oximetry was 98% on room air. On physical examination, there was moderate swelling of the right foot and ankle area with significant edema extending to the lower third of the leg, along with severe tenderness that is exaggerated upon moving the toes. Evaluation of pulses in both lower extremities revealed a noticeable reduction in the right popliteal, posterior tibialis, and dorsalis pedis arteries (Figure ). The right foot felt colder and paler compared to the left foot without any erythema or bluish discoloration of the toes.\nThe surgery team was consulted due to the suspicion for possible compartment syndrome and vascular compromise and the patient was admitted to the in-patient unit for further workup and management.

He had undiagnosed learning difficulties (LD) due to which he was never able to lead an independent life. He lived with his parents. No other agencies were involved in his care and he was not seen by the General Practitioner (GP) for years. He was brought in to be seen by the GP for a routine appointment by his father. He was frail and looked unwell but did not seem to be in any discomfort. Examination revealed a rectal mass and palpable inguinal lymph nodes. An urgent referral to the colorectal surgeons was made and blood tests were performed. He was found to be profoundly anaemic. Due to the parents\u2019 belief, no blood products were accepted for CJ.

Chronic haemodialysis was initiated in 1970 when the patient was 28 years of age and this modality was still rare in Japan. For the first 26 years, he received nocturnal haemodialysis for 12 h twice a week. After that he had received haemodiafiltration (HDF) for 4.5 h three times a week until transplantation. He had surgery for aseptic necrosis of the right femoral head at the age of 58 and suffered from cerebral infarction but recovered without any neurological defect. He was noted to have atrial fibrillation at the age of 63, and has since then been treated with an anticoagulant.\nAfter maintenance haemodialysis for 38 years and 2 months, he received a kidney transplant from a 54-year-old female who had been diagnosed as brain dead due to traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage. At the time of emergent admission, screening was performed to evaluate the risk of transplantation. There was no critical problem regarding the cardiovascular system except for the anticoagulant treatment. Computed tomography (Figure a) showed minimal calcification of his iliac vessels in spite of the long-term haemodialysis.\nThe kidney was harvested after cardiac arrest and preserved in University of Wisconsin solution, with a total ischaemic time of 6 h and 48 min. The graft ureter was anastomosed to his bladder intravesically. A percutaneous transvesical ureteral catheter was inserted because of the small volume of his bladder (<50 ml).\nThe graft functioned slowly, and four sessions of haemodialysis were needed after transplantation (Figure ). Thereafter, the serum creatinine level gradually decreased to as low as 1.0 mg/dl. However, another operation was necessary on postoperative Day (POD) 13 due to bursting of the surgical wound caused by incisional hernia.

She had a past history of alcohol and tobacco abuse, although she had been abstinent from both for five years at the time of presentation. No HIV risk factors were identified. She did not have a fever, and she had moderate abdominal tenderness on examination. Her chest X-ray was interpreted as showing a right lower-lobe infiltrate (), and she received intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin for suspected community-acquired pneumonia. Because of persistent pain, an abdominal ultrasound was performed, which was negative for gallbladder wall thickening, stones, or pericholecystic fluid. A hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan was also normal. The antibiotics were continued. The third day in the hospital, her abdomen became more diffusely tender and she developed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Her heart rate was controlled with intravenous diltiazem. An abdominal CT scan was performed, and it revealed multiple dilated loops of bowel anterior and superior to the liver, with associated free fluid (). Laboratory studies demonstrated a leukocytosis of 13,000 white blood cells/mm3 with a left shift and two-dimensional echocardiography revealed a moderate pericardial effusion, without evidence of hemodynamic compromise. She was taken to the operating room, where she was found to have an internal hernia, with an ischemic loop of ileum incarcerated between the liver and the diaphragm. The hernia was reduced, and the ischemic segment of bowel was resected. She also underwent a cholecystectomy during the same procedure. Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were administered postoperatively.\nOn the first postoperative day, control of her atrial fibrillation worsened. An echocardiogram was repeated, revealing an increase in size of the pericardial effusion.

Two months following his renal transplant, the patient was admitted for an acute kidney injury discovered on routine follow-up laboratory testing. From a baseline creatinine of 1.3 mg/dl after the transplant, he was noted to have a creatinine of 2.7 mg/dl and a renal biopsy was obtained. Histopathology was suggestive of mildly active cellular rejection and acute tubular injury but with no concerns for antibody-mediated rejection. The patient received three days of methyl-prednisolone 250 mg daily intravenously and was subsequently transitioned to high-dose oral prednisone with a taper.\nThe patient was readmitted within three weeks of his renal biopsy with worsening renal functions, now with a creatinine level of 3.8 mg/dl. At this time, he was on prednisone five mg daily, tacrolimus four mg twice daily, and mycophenolate 500 mg twice daily. His family reported poor oral intake and that he had been taking furosemide at home. He received intravenous (IV) normal saline and diuretics were held. However, as his renal functions did not improve beyond a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dl, the decision was made to perform a repeat renal biopsy. During ultrasonography for the renal biopsy, concerns were raised for a possible renal artery aneurysm. An ultrasound of the right lower quadrant and transplant kidney subsequently showed a 3 cm x 3.4 cm x 4 cm aneurysm proximal to the renal artery anastomosis to the right external iliac artery (Figure ). The right external iliac artery to renal artery anastomosis was patent and the renal vein was noted to be patent as well.

She presented to our clinic in February 2013 with debilitating back pain secondary to degenerative lumbar scoliosis with a multilevel lumbar spinal stenosis. She had posterior spinal fusion from T12 to pelvis with a decompression of the stenotic levels. Two months following her surgery, she presented to our clinic complaining of disabling back pain after a history of falling on her back. This pain was exacerbated by activity and relieved by rest. However, she had no change in her neurological status. Clinical and radiographic findings confirmed T11 and T12 compression fractures. As the patient was symptomatic, the decision has been made to proceed with vertebroplasty and in this way avoid a more extensive surgery with rods and screws. Following general anesthesia, she was positioned in a prone position. Then, under direct fluoroscopy, the correct levels were confirmed followed by a standard percutaneous insertion of trocars into T11-T12 pedicles. High viscosity bone cement was injected into T11 and T12 vertebral bodies under fluoroscopic guidance. At T12, the bilateral trocars were placed using an in-out in technique aiming the tip of the trocar just under the pedicle screws at T12. A bipedicular approach was also used at T11 to inject bone cement. High viscosity bone cement was injected into T11 and T12 vertebral bodies under fluoroscopic guidance. The total volume of injected cement was 4 cc in each level. The patient tolerated the procedure and was discharged uneventfully. Six months following her vertebroplasty, she presented to our clinic with a history of trauma causing back pain, diminishing her ability to ambulate, and worsening neurological symptoms. On clinical examination, she had tenderness over the thoracolumbar spine and generalized weakness of the lower extremity. Radiographs demonstrated a significant 45-degree junctional kyphosis at T11-T12 with a loss of sagittal balance. Subsequent CT-scan showed an incidental finding of a cement pulmonary embolism",

In addition, he reported occasional swelling of the ankle but denied numbness or tingling. The patient indicated great difficulties to perform daily life activities (as walking, climbing stairs and getting up from chairs) due to the pain and felt worried about the stability of his ankle. On physical examination, his feet and ankle have no abnormalities, edema or skin changes. Sensibility was found to be conserved for the entire lower limb and there was no strength deficit. The patient presented strong pain during heel palpation, specially corresponding to the medial insertion of plantar fascia on the calcaneus bone. When he was asked to walk on his heel, the pain was too strong to be tolerated. Moreover, he reported a feeling of stiffness and articular limitation of the hip and knee during lower limb active mobilization. Both legs had no pulse or reflex impairment. Finally, the patient received a diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. The patient was addressed to a conservative treatment by using ESWT and a 3-session program was assessed. The clinical condition was investigated by using Foot and Ankle Outcome Scale (FAOS) and Foot Functional Index (FFI).

On physical examination, there was moderate swelling over the lateral aspect of the hindfoot, with point tenderness directly over the cuboid bone. The remainder of the foot exam was normal.

The margins of the lesion were circumscribed, but not sclerotic, and there were no internal foci of mineralization. There was also no evidence of ankle effusion.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a gadolinium-enhancing lesion, with increased signal intensity on the T2 weighted image (figure ).

These symptoms appeared eight months after bilateral breast reconstruction, which was performed following subcutaneous mastectomy that was necessary owing to ductal carcinoma in situ. The breast reconstruction was conducted using a non-muscle-sparing pedicled TRAM-flap transposition. The defect created at the donor site within the abdominal wall after harvesting the rectus muscle was closed using a continuous suture with resorbable suture material. An additional augmentation was performed by the implantation of a resorbable polyglactin mesh placed on the fascial suture.\nThe patient presented at the authors' outpatient clinic eight months after reconstruction. At that time her body mass index was 18.9 and she was suffering from a lower abdominal bulge formation (Figure ). An ultrasound examination revealed an abdominal wall defect measuring 18 \u00d7 20 cm, with no detectable rectus abdominis muscle remaining, resembling a large rectus diastasis. A preoperative endoscopy of the colon showed signs of adhesions in the colon sigmoideum and transversum, but no other pathologies; the laboratory values were normal. Apart from an appendectomy performed 20 years ago, the patient had undergone no other previous abdominal surgery. In addition to the annoying large bulge in this otherwise slim patient, the pain experienced during everyday movement and impairment of bowel function led to an explorative laparotomy and an attempt to reconstruct the abdominal wall.\nFollowing adequate preparations with intestinal irrigation, a re-incision through the midline scar was performed. On entering the peritoneal cavity, several dense adhesions of small intestine to the abdominal wall and interenteric to the colon were found. These were carefully dissolved without causing injury to the intestine. Further exploration revealed a near-total absence of both abdominal rectus muscles; residual muscle fibres could be detected only at the lateral side of the rectus sheath.

The patient referred no pain relief after taking anti-inflammatory drugs and denied respiratory symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, or cough. No weight loss, anorexia, or other symptoms were reported. There was no referral of previous surgeries or medications. A different, stronger anti-inflammatory drug was prescribed, but three days later she returned to the hospital, where a lumbar radiograph revealed the presence of a lytic lesion in the L4 vertebra. Due to the nonspecific appearance of the lesion, the patient underwent an MR of the lumbar spine. The exam revealed the presence of a heterogeneous, T1-hypointense mass in the body of L4, causing its partial destruction, and nerve root compression (). A CT-guided biopsy was performed in order to assess the etiology of this mass.

He had a score of 7 on the GCS at the time of ambulance transport. CT of the head revealed hemorrhagic cerebellar contusion in the left hemisphere, fractures of the left occipital condyle, and C1 dislocation. Brain herniation occurred due to cerebral edema associated with the hemorrhagic contusion of the left cerebellar hemisphere, which was a medical emergency (). Physicians at the medical emergency center performed lifesaving left suboccipital craniotomy and removed the hematoma and a part of the cerebellar hemisphere damaged by the contusion. Two weeks after surgery, the physicians intended to perform extubation due to the patient's improved of consciousness, since airway narrowing caused by left-sided vocal cord paralysis was observed, tracheostomy was additionally performed. At that time, neurological findings revealed lower cranial nerve (CN-IX to -XII) palsy. The patient was referred to our hospital for OCF and C1 dislocation treatment. On admission, he had clear consciousness but required bed rest in the supine position because of prominent neck pain that occurred when he was in the seated position. Although he complained of muscle weakness, which resulted from the prolonged bed rest, no obvious motor paralysis of the four extremities or sensory impairment was observed; however, he experienced left trapezius weakness, as well as paralysis of the larynx and the left side of the throat, which were associated with lower cranial nerve (CN-IX to -XII) palsy.\nCT revealed OCFs associated with C1 dislocation.

There was no notable medical history. Orthopantomograph and computed tomography (CT) scan findings revealed a periapical cystic lesion associated with the maxillary right central incisor (Figure ), after which we made a diagnosis of a periapical cyst in the maxillary central incisor. The cyst and right central incisor were extracted under general anesthesia in May, and histological findings led to a diagnosis of radicular cyst.\nFollowing surgery, aesthetic complications developed (Figure ), which CT scan images obtained 4 months after the cystectomy showed the cause to be severe horizontal alveolar bone atrophy (Figure ). We planned to perform autogenous onlay bone grafting to restore bone volume in the alveolar ridge. It was determined that a horizontal bone volume of at least 7 mm was needed for aesthetic recovery and the width of a cortical bone block alone would be unsatisfactory to obtain an adequate alveolar ridge horizontal thickness.

From the history, it was learned that the patient had osteopetrosis tarda and had not previously had any fractures. Physical examination revealed that there were abduction and external rotation deformity in the left lower extremity and pain on palpation in the hip. On direct radiography, a subtrochanteric femur fracture was determined (). Apart from mild anemia, other laboratory test results were normal. The patient was admitted to our clinic for planned surgical treatment of intramedullary PFN. Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed into the right decubitus position and the left lower extremity was prepared.\nThe fracture line was opened with a longitudinal incision from the lateral. The fracture ends were reached. The whole of the femur medulla was seen to be closed and sclerotic. The medulla was then drilled and opened with a series of reamers. During this process, the drill bit was broken twice and one of the broken drill bits remained in the medullary canal. The fracture was then reduced and fixation was made with one antirotation wedge PFN screw (TST\u00ae, Turkey). One lag screw and one antirotation wedge were advanced in the femoral neck, and the distal screw was locked with two nails. Throughout the operation, particularly during the drilling, extreme difficulties were experienced.\nFluoroscopy checking was applied and the operation was concluded. On the radiograph taken on postoperative Day 1, the lag screw was seen not to be fixed in the femoral head (), so revision surgery was planned for the patient.

She had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, allergic rhinitis, and chronic lower back pain. Patient has a family history of arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus; she denies ever using alcohol or tobacco.\nWith the onset of elevated alkaline phosphatase level and vague abdominal pain in 2013, an abdominal ultrasound performed in December showed hepatic steatosis. Viral serologies for hepatitis during 2013 were negative, as a gastrointestinal consult was required to determine the need for a liver biopsy. A liver biopsy was subsequently performed, which showed focal mixed micro and macrovesicular steatosis. Portal tracts showed minimal focal chronic inflammation, no significant fibrosis, and no iron deposition.\nThe vague abdominal pain that she was experiencing waxed and waned for two years. Additionally, the patient experienced some vague chest pain and dyspnea that prompted an echocardiogram in February of 2015, which demonstrated a left ventricle ejection fraction of 44%. Consequently, a left heart catheterization in the following month showed no significant coronary disease with a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 50%. A 2-year follow-up in July of 2015 showed suspicious cirrhosis by Computed Tomography (CT) scan (), possibly due to granulomatous changes and chronic inflammation. A CT scan was determined to be necessary for our patient because of rising alkaline phosphatase without other explainable etiologies, in addition to the patient's appetite suppression and vague abdominal pains. Patient's weight during this time was 207 lbs (93.89 kg) and was advised to diet and exercise. After 4 months of continuous symptoms, especially with abdominal pain, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed with a liver biopsy that showed subsequent granulomatous changes in September of 2015.

    "original_text": "The patient was an 11 year old boy who had been involved in a MVA versus pedestrian accident in which a large vehicle rolled over his pelvis, resulting in an open book pelvic fracture, splitting the osseous structure of his pelvis. He sustained life-threatening injuries for which he underwent 19 surgeries over the course of one year in order to repair damage that resulted from the accident (). Because of healing from both the number of surgeries and trauma from the accident, the patient developed extensive scarring and abdominal adhesions as well as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He had traditional physical therapy for three months to facilitate his ability to walk and perform daily functions. However, the patient experienced recurrent partial small bowel obstructions (SBO) that were treated non-surgically, and he required a laxative, polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 \u2013 oral, for maintenance of bowel function. The use of laxatives caused the patient distress and reportedly impacted his life significantly, causing rectal fecal leakage and thus furthered emotional distress in a pediatric patient medicated for PTSD.\nUpon initial physical therapy evaluation at a specialized manual therapy clinic, 19 months following the accident, the patient reported frequent constipation, pain of up to 7/10 during bowel movements, weakness and tingling in his left lower extremity and general pain that increased throughout the day.

    "cleaned_text": "the patient was an 11 year old boy who had been involved in a mva versus pedestrian accident in which a large vehicle rolled over his pelvis, resulting in an open book pelvic fracture, splitting the osseous structure of his pelvis. he sustained life-threatening injuries for which he underwent 19 surgeries over the course of one year in order to repair damage that resulted from the accident (). because of healing from both the number of surgeries and trauma from the accident, the patient developed extensive scarring and abdominal adhesions as well as post traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). he had traditional physical therapy for three months to facilitate his ability to walk and perform daily functions. however, the patient experienced recurrent partial small bowel obstructions (sbo) that were treated non-surgically, and he required a laxative, polyethylene glycol (peg) 3350 \u2013 oral, for maintenance of bowel function. the use of laxatives caused the patient distress and reportedly impacted his life significantly, causing rectal fecal leakage and thus furthered emotional distress in a pediatric patient medicated for ptsd.\nupon initial physical therapy evaluation at a specialized manual therapy clinic, 19 months following the accident, the patient reported frequent constipation, pain of up to 7/10 during bowel movements, weakness and tingling in his left lower extremity and general pain that increased throughout the day. he expressed numerous goals, including the ability to participate in more athletic activities, to run a marathon, and to eliminate the requirement for pharmaceutical maintenance of bowel function. findings from the initial evaluation, which included visual, palpatory, postural and movement exams were correlated with patient medical history, previous surgical reports, and physician diagnosis to determine adhered and dysfunctional areas requiring treatment. restrictions, scars or adhesions were palpated by the therapists, major organs were identified, and decreased mobility of specific organs was determined. the patient was ambulatory, but exhibited a shuffling gait and a wide base of support with both hips held in external",

    "original_text": "Our patient, a 67-year-old Caucasian man, presented in the morning to the emergency department complaining of a sudden onset of excruciating right-sided arm and neck pain radiating to his head, followed by two episodes of vomiting. Both arms had reduced power from the shoulder distally. He complained of weakness in his legs, but denied any recent trauma, falls or loss of consciousness. On initial examination, shoulder abduction and adduction were absent, and flexion and extension of the elbow joint 2/5 on the Medical Research Council (MRC) power scale. Power in the lower limbs was normal. All modalities of sensation were intact bilaterally in the upper and lower limbs. No cranial nerve abnormalities were detected.\nThe patient had recently been diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. His blood results on admission showed no abnormalities apart from a high glucose level consistent with untreated diabetes. A computed tomography angiogram showed no signs of thrombosis or dissection of the aorta. A spinal MRI scan showed a high-intensity lesion in the anterior two-thirds of the gray matter extending from C3 to C5 (Figures and ). He was diagnosed with anterior spinal artery ischemia secondary to dissection of a distal vertebral artery. He was started on 300 mg aspirin, and his case was reviewed by both a physiotherapist and a diabetic specialist nurse while he was an in-patient. Within three days of presentation, power in both of his arms had improved (MRC score 4/5), except for abduction of his right shoulder, which he could not lift above the horizontal position.\nSpinal cord infarction and ischemia are rare and often difficult to diagnose, but they represent important differential diagnoses of acute spinal symptoms.

As a routine practice in our centre, the patient was assessed pre-procedurally by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) on the day of procedure to delineate anatomy of pulmonary veins and left atrium (LA) and to exclude LA appendage thrombus. During RFA procedure all four PV were individually isolated under guidance of intracardiac echocardiography. RF energy was delivered using a conventional 4 mm and 8 mm tip ablation catheters and a power setting of 30 W, 50 \u00b0C around a circular decapolar catheter located at the pulmonary veins ostia. Application of the RF was immediately interrupted when microbubbles were detected by the intracardiac echocardiography (ICE). After a curative ablation therapy patient was kept on aspirin to prevent pulmonary venous or arterial thrombosis and recurrence of AF. Ambulatory follow-up cardiac computed tomography (CT) angiogram was done 3 months following RFA and showed approximately 60% left superior PVS but no intervention was performed because the patient was asymptomatic and he was kept on oral anticoagulation ().\nTwo months later, the patient developed cough associated with hemoptysis, mild intermittent fever, mild left-sided pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath on exertion. He visited the primary health centre close to his residency where chest radiography was done and showed left upper lobe poorly marginated opacities and minimal left pleural effusion. Further laboratory studies were done to rule out pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) which were within normal limits.
