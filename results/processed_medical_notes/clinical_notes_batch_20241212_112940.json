He initially declined surgical resection and opted for observation. On reimaging six years later, the tumor had grown to 5.5 x 3 x 3 cm and had extended to the superior sagittal sinus and the left premotor and motor areas (Figure ). Eight years after initial diagnosis, the patient noted a decline in cursive handwriting and subsequently was treated with external beam radiation therapy to a dose of 54 Gy in 30 fractions. Afterwards the patient noted return of his baseline handwriting.\nTwo years after completion of the external beam radiation therapy, the patient presented with a sudden transient episode of aphasia. An MRI of the brain showed a slight interval increase in the size of the mass, and he underwent a left frontoparietal craniotomy. Pathologic examination revealed a WHO grade I meningioma.\nThe patient experienced recurrence with increase in size of the meningioma with new bilateral temporal lobe lesions, and was subsequently treated with fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Shortly after completing SRS, he presented with persistent lower back pain. An MRI of the spine with and without contrast revealed lytic lesions in the C4, T11, and L3 vertebrae, suspicious for malignancy (Figure ). A biopsy of the L3 lesion revealed clusters of proliferating meningothelial cells admixed with hematopoietic cells and visible mitotic figures with immunomorphological features consistent with a WHO grade II meningioma (Figure ).\nThe patient was subsequently treated with SRS to the right temporal tip lesion adjacent to the dura and the T11 lesion.

The respiratory and cardiovascular examinations were normal. The electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST\u2013T wave changes in leads V1\u2013V6, and the laboratory work was within the normal range except for a low-density lipoprotein level of 170 mg/dL. The exercise stress test was nondiagnostic, and the myocardial perfusion scan revealed inducible ischemia in the anterior septum, mid, and basal portions of the anterior wall. Cardiac catheterization was performed and showed a giant left main coronary artery aneurysm ( and ). All of the left coronary system arose from the aneurysm. The patient had no history of Kawasaki disease in childhood, and nor was the type of the lesion compatible with Kawasaki disease.

The patient reported insidious onset of swelling with a gradual progress to the present size. He also reported mild, intermittent, and dull pain in the region of swelling.\nClinical examination confirmed a solitary, oval, well-defined swelling measuring approximately 7 \u00d7 5 cm in the preauricular region []. The surface over the swelling was smooth without any secondary changes. It extended superioinferiorly from the level of outer canthus of the eye to inferior border of mandible and anterioposteriorly extended from 2 cm in front of anterior border of ramus to the mastoid notch []. On palpation, the swelling was firm, non-tender, free from skin, and mobile over the underlying structures. Mild pulsations could be appreciated from the swelling. There was no weakness of facial muscles or enlargement of swelling during mastication.\nUltrasonography revealed a large lobulated solid mass of 6 \u00d7 4 cm in the right parotid region with multiple vessels with low velocity flow and without any areas of calcification or cystic changes. Findings were suggestive of a low-grade vascular tumor.[] Computed tomography scan with contrast medium revealed a large well-circumscribed, solitary isodense lesion measuring 6.36 \u00d7 4.39 cm [].

Brain computed tomography (CT) scan showed diffuse SAH with a Hunt and Hess score of 5 and the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) score of 5. On further workup, the patient\u2019s ECG showed ST elevation in V1-4 and ST depression in inferior leads. Cardiac troponin also raised significantly along with the evidence of wall motion abnormality on echocardiography. According to the patient\u2019s neurologic condition, the treatment of possible MI was started with the dual oral antiplatelet drug.\nBrain CT angiogram that performed after admission of the patient to the neurosurgical intensive unit, revealed a 6 mm AComA aneurysm. Single antiplatelet therapy was started on the 1st day after the ictus with no new episode of rebleeding from the AComA aneurysm. Given the evidence of SAH and aneurysm on CT, the administration of dual antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants imposed a high risk of rebleeding and deteriorating neurologic condition on our patient. Therefore, considering the stability of our patient\u2019s hemodynamic, we decided to close the aneurysm first. Cerebral angiography was performed to obtain anatomical data required for endovascular treatment [ and ]. The endovascular intervention was done, and complete occlusion was achieved [].\nAfter successful endovascular closure of brain aneurysm, dual antiplatelet therapy was started with no evidence of rebleeding on follow-up brain CT.

She reported overall good health with no significant medical or surgical history and had undergone regular cervical cancer screening and breast cancer screening which has always been normal. She had a family history positive for breast cancer in her mother. Six months prior to presentation, the vulvar lesion rapidly increased in size with the beginnings of ulceration. She incurred minimal bleeding and discomfort from this and did not seek immediate medical attention. The lesion continued to enlarge which prompted her to consult a physician.\nOn inspection of her vulva, a 3 cm pedunculated, round, and ulcerated mass was identified on the left labium majus. The surrounding skin appeared normal, and no other vulva pathology was identified. An inguinal lymph node survey was negative for masses. Speculum exam of the cervix revealed no abnormalities.\nA biopsy of the lesion was inconclusive. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast showed no metastasis, no adenopathy, and no soft tissue thickening at the vulva. A colonoscopy and CA-125 levels were performed which revealed no abnormalities. At this point we decided to proceed with local excision given the negative metastatic workup and the shallow base of the lesion. We performed a wide local excision of the left vulva with 1 cm margins. Frozen pathology revealed negative margins and no angiolymphatic invasion. We elected to omit inguinal lymphadenectomy given the pedunculated nature of the lesion with a narrow stalk.\nFinal pathology reported a grade 4 invasive adenocarcinoma forming a 1.9 \u00d7 1.8 \u00d7 1.3 cm mass with a depth of 0.5 cm. Margins were negative for cancer.

His past ocular history was significant for blunt trauma to the left eye with a stick while riding an all-terrain vehicle 8 months ago; over the following 3 months, the eye became painful with deterioration of vision for which he sought ophthalmic care. At that initial examination, outside records indicated that his vision was light perception, and there was significant conjunctival injection, corneal edema, and anterior chamber reaction precluding a view of the fundus. There was no recorded sign of previous ocular trauma, keratic precipitates, hypopyon, or afferent pupillary defect, and his poor vision was attributed to the inflammation from initial injury. He was treated for non-granulomatous anterior uveitis with topical and subtenon's corticosteroid injection for several months. The lens developed progressive cataract changes with corticosteroid treatment, and he underwent cataract surgery that was complicated and unsuccessful due to significant sequela from uveitic changes. An intraocular lens was not placed due to questionable lens capsule integrity.\nOur examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/30 right eye (OD) and no light perception of the left eye (OS). The right pupil was reactive to light, but the left pupil was fixed and non-reactive, with a left relative afferent pupillary defect. He had marked restriction of ocular motility of the left eye due to pain. The left upper eyelid was ptotic and edematous.

At the age of 16, she was referred from the school physician to a pediatrician for the first time because of a subtle gait ataxia. Neurological examination revealed areflexia, muscular hypotonia, reduced position and vibration sense in the lower limbs. A few years later, she presented with an aggravated spastic gait ataxia, postural ataxia and dysarthria as well as urinary and fecal incontinence. At the age of 30, the patient was no longer able to walk and has been confined to a wheelchair ever since. A few years later, she underwent colectomy and received a suprapubic catheter. She started taking idebenone, a drug that has shown a positive effect on neurological functions in patients with FA []. Her parents were first cousins. The diagnosis of FA was confirmed genetically by a DNA analysis showing that the patient was homozygous for an expansion of GAA in the frataxin gene corresponding to 900 repeats. The serum \u03b1-tocopherol level was normal.\nIn August 2010, the patient presented to the Department of Neurology, Uppsala University, for her annual visit. She reported frequent and very painful flexor spasms in the lower limbs and trunk. Her sleep was interrupted because of such spasms awakening her throughout the night. Changing the position of her body in the bed or wheelchair, exposing herself to the cold, laughing, coughing, sneezing or taking a shower elicited the spasms, which at times lasted for more than 1 h.

There was no pain at rest, swelling, or tenderness in the lower right limb. The range of motion was not limited in the right hip, the right knee, or the right ankle. There was no history of endocrine dysfunction including precocious puberty, and no cutaneous abnormality was found.\nRadiographs of the right lower limb revealed multiple radiolucent lesions with sclerotic contours in the diaphyses of the femur the tibia, the patella, the pelvis, and the tarsal bones. Characteristic lesions were also found in the distal epiphysis of the femur, and the proximal and distal epiphyses of the tibia. The growth plates in both the femora and the tibia had not been closed. The lesions in the diaphyses of the right femur and the right tibia were distended causing the surrounding cortex to thin (). Technetium bone scintigram showed increased uptake in the diaphyses of the right femur and the right tibia and the right pelvis and around the bilateral knees and ankles (). On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the epiphyseal lesions of the distal femur and the proximal tibia showed a low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and a high signal intensity on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images, and the lesions were markedly enhanced by gadolinium ().\nOn the basis of radiological findings, benign bone tumors, such as polyostotic FD or nonossifying fibroma, were suspected.

At 1 month after diagnosis, this patient received adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of four cycles of Taxol and carboplatin. However, this regimen seemed ineffective in preventing disease progression because multiple hepatic metastases were found at only 6 months after surgery (Figure A). Accordingly, a revised chemotherapeutic strategy with four cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin, as well as one cycle of interventional therapy, was administered sequentially. However, a symptom involving lower abdominal compression was gradually felt over a 1-year period. Because of this, the patient was again admitted to our hospital. Physical examination showed a large abdominal mass lying between the xiphoid process of the sternum and the umbilicus, without obvious tenderness. Abdominal computed tomography with peripheral enhancement using contrast material in the delayed phase revealed extrinsic multi-organ compression because of a giant mass, 27.0 \u00d7 17.0 cm, in the abdominal cavity (Figure B). At laparotomy, a giant tumor was discovered adhering to the right ovary, as well as multiple metastases in the greater omentum and liver (Figure ).

Routine medical history and physical examination revealed no systemic disease.\nExtraoral examination [] showed a massive, generalized multinodular growth covering both maxillary and mandibular arch completely causing incompetent everted lips and a convex profile. The surface of maxillary growth was granular, mildly pigmented, and had multiple fissuration extending between corners of mouth and covering all maxillary anterior teeth completely; while mandibular growth was larger and extended beyond submental region of mandible giving an appearance of hanging mass attached to mandible. The growth was multilobular, pebbled, and had smooth surface extending between corners of mouth. The mandibular anterior teeth were not visible. The growth was pink to pinkish white in color. On palpation, it was found to be firm and nontender in consistency. There were no fluctuancy, no compressibility, no translucency, and no associated bleeding noted.

He had a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was well controlled on insulin. He was an ex-smoker of tobacco with a tobacco smoking history of one pack a day for 10 years but he quit smoking tobacco 20 years ago.

Gastroesophageal contrast radiography showed slight dilatation of the esophagus, an absence of primary peristalsis but presence of aperistaltic waves, and a narrow distal esophagus with a \u2018bird\u2019s beak\u2019 aspect (Fig. ). A CT scan was performed, but was unremarkable and did not reveal any esophageal lesion.

The patient was counseled regarding the diagnosis of achalasia and scheduled for POEM. Informed patient consent was obtained before the procedure. The patient was intubated and brought under general anesthesia. Subsequently, upper digestive endoscopy was performed by using a conventional endoscope. Carbon dioxide insufflation was used throughout the procedure. At the esophageal mucosa, 10 cm proximal to the gastroesophageal junction, a 2 cm longitudinal mucosal incision was made using a Hook knife to serve as the entry point for the tunnel in the planned POEM procedure.

    "original_text": "A 79-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease was admitted to a district hospital with a completed inferior myocardial infarction. A loud systolic murmur was noted. A presumed VSD was identified on TTE. The patient was pain-free but hypotensive and was transferred to our center for further management 2 days after her initial presentation. On arrival, blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 100 beats/min and an oxygen saturations of 99%. Coronary angiography confirmed an occluded dominant right coronary artery. Repeat TTE demonstrated an inferior LV wall defect with left-to-right flow. The margins were difficult to define but appeared to be contiguous with the septum. An attempt was made to temporize and allow healing of the tissue rim, but heart failure developed and an IABP was inserted 1 week later. Despite this the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated.

She had been treated with acupuncture on her back and buttock because of chronic back pain before the onset of symptoms. Blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg, heart rate was 94 beats per minute, and body temperature was 38.2\u2103. Other vital signs were unremarkable. White blood cell count was 27,420/\u00b5L with 90% neutrophils and C-reactive protein was 14.78 mg/dL on laboratory examination. Blood and urine culture was done to investigate the focus of fever. Because she complaint of chest pain and mediastinal widening on an initial chest x-ray was documented, chest computed tomogram (CT) was performed to rule out acute aortic syndromes. And it revealed a dissection of the ascending aorta with hemopericardium and an incidentally noted abscess in the right buttock (). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed severely dilated ascending aorta with intimal flap suggestive of aortic dissection, a moderate amount of pericardial effusion without tamponade sign, and no visible vegetations. The left and right ventricular functions were preserved and the cardiac valves had no abnormal findings except mild aortic valve regurgitation. Under the impression of acute aortic dissection with an impending rupture, an emergent operation was performed.\nThe surgery was performed through a median sternotomy and a subclavicular incision. After pericardiotomy, blood with fresh clots was observed and removed securely. On the superior wall of the proximal aortic arch just distal to the innominate artery and beneath the innominate vein, inflamed friable tissue with a hematoma was observed and cultured microbiologically.

General and systemic examinations of the patient were normal except for bilateral renal angle tenderness. Her blood urea was 80 mg/dl and serum creatinine was 1.9 mg/dl. The blood counts were within normal limits and her daily urine output was 2500 ml. Urine analysis revealed plenty of pus cells and culture of the urine revealed Escherichia coli and hence she was started on appropriate antibiotics. Ultrasonogram of the kidney ureter and bladder revealed bilateral gross hydroureteronephrosis with renal cortical thickness of only 5 mm. Ultrasonography also revealed bilateral double J stents in situ with associated encrustations in both the renal and vesical ends. On further probing, the patient recollected total hysterectomy performed for fibroid uterus 32 years ago for which prophylactic bilateral ureteric stent placement was performed. As she was asymptomatic, the patient never made it to remove the stents. Noncontrast computed tomography was done, which revealed bilateral gross hydroureteronephrosis with thinning of cortex in both the kidneys (Figure ). There were bilateral ureteric double J stents with heavy encrustation in both the renal and vesical ends (Figure ). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography was avoided on account of the persistently high renal parameters. The patient was not affordable for diuretic renogram study and hence it was decided to proceed with the removal of the stents after a course of antibiotic.

Physical examination revealed palpable abdominal mass in the epigastric area and laboratory findings were not remarkable except high alkaline phosphatase (118 IU/mL) and bilirubin (1.6 mg/dL) levels. Two years ago, he was diagnosed as having hepatitis B virus-related HCC based on computed tomography (CT) and hepatic angiography results demonstrating two hepatic masses compatible with HCC (8.0\u00d78.0 cm in segment III and 3.0\u00d72.5 cm sized in segment VIII) with elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration of 50,202 IU/mL. Follow-up CT scan after three sessions of TACE revealed that HCC in the right lobe was completely filled with lipiodol, but HCC in the left lobe still showed viability in spite of size reduction. Thereafter, he was found with ruptured HCC in the left lobe and underwent additional three sessions of TACE. However, HCC in the left lobe did not respond to repeated TACE, but grew in size. Moreover, it also revealed additional suspicious features indicating direct invasion to the adjacent stomach wall on CT scan. Therefore, local salvage radiotherapy for HCC in the left lobe was administered using tumor dose of 4,500 cGy with a daily fraction of 180 cGy. In this visit with dysphagia and postprandial epigastric pain, two months after the end of radiotherapy, we noted that bulging HCC in the left lobe was still directly invading the adjacent stomach (). Upper GI endoscopy showed the opening of fistula to HCC which was covered with exudates (). Endoscopic biopsy through hepatogastric fistula revealed poorly differentiated HCC (). His symptoms were thought to be caused by extrinsic compression of the stomach by bulging HCC in the left lobe and we consulted with a surgeon for palliative resection. However, the resection could not be performed as the patient had poor liver reservoir (indocyanine green retention at 15 minutes [ICG 15], 39.1%). Two weeks later",
