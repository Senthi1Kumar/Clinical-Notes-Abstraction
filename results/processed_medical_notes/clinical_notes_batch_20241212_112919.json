Her other past medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney allograft dysfunction due to recurrent IgA nephropathy. Immunosuppressive regimen included cyclosporine 100 mg every 12 hours, azathioprine 50 mg daily, and prednisone 5 mg daily. On arrival to the hospital, the patient was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 75/48 mmHg and febrile with a temperature of 100.6 F. Norepinephrine drip and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated, although a source of infection was not obvious at that time. Laboratory testing was notable for anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP). CMV viral load was positive with a titer of 3.6 log10 IU/ml and valganciclovir therapy was initiated as a result. Morning cortisol level was substantially suppressed at 0.6mcg/dL, and, due to concern for adrenal insufficiency, stress dose hydrocortisone was administered, followed by conversion to prednisone taper. Patient's hypotension and fever resolved within 24 hours from the initial presentation, and she was subsequently discharged in stable condition with a diagnosis of CMV infection, on appropriate dose of valganciclovir with plan for follow-up as an outpatient. Unfortunately, the patient was rehospitalized 4 times in the subsequent 2 months with fever, shock, and fatigue. During each admission she received stress dose hydrocortisone and vasopressor with or without empiric antibiotics. Every time, her symptoms resolved rapidly (within 24 hours of initiation of therapy) without a clear diagnosis. Initially CMV was considered to be the cause of recurrent fever and hematologic abnormalities, but she had recurrent severe symptoms despite resolution of CMV viremia in the setting of valganciclovir treatment (summary in ).\nOn the 5th admission, she presented again with hypotension and",

A computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained, revealing an obstructing 2-3 mm left ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) stone and associated hydronephrosis. Physical exam also showed a fever of 102F. Urologic evaluation was not available so he was subsequently transferred to a different outside hospital for management, where he was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and taken to the operating room (OR) for ureteral stent placement. A retrograde pyelogram was normal without filling defects, however urine from his left ureteral orifice was noted to be bloody and there was a hydronephrotic drip reported. A postoperative abdominal and pelvic CT with and without contrast showed clot in the left collecting system and hydronephrosis with a 3 mm lower pole stone. His hematuria persisted, though his vital signs and hemoglobin were stable. He was ultimately discharged home on hospital day 5 with an indwelling Foley catheter and plans to follow-up with his primary urologist. He returned to his primary urologist several days later with persistent gross hematuria and passing clots through his Foley catheter, for which continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) therapy was initiated. His hemoglobin was noted to have fallen to 8.6mg/dL from 10.8mg/dL in the past week. At this time, he was transferred to our hospital for further work up and management.\nNotable past medical history for this patient includes acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) diagnosed 4 years prior to this current admission, for which he received an allo-stem cell transplant.

During work-up, contrast enhanced chest- and abdominal computed tomography (CT) verified a large mass (10 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5.5 cm) located in the left diaphragm, suggesting infiltration of the fundus of the stomach and the left lobe of the liver. An exophytic mass measuring 1.5 cm in diameter was seen at the posterior wall of the stomach, with low amount of calcification. A 13 mm large lymphnode, on the left side, posterior to the crus of the diaphragm was visible, otherwise there were no pathologically enlarged lymphnodes in the abdomen, or the pelvis (Figs. , ). The patient had no history of malignancies, and at initial presentation no distant metastases were confirmed on imaging. Left sided atelectasis and pleural fluid were also described on chest CT. Gastroscopy was negative. Ultrasound guided fine needle biopsy of the mass suggested a malignancy consisting of epithelial cells. On the basis of these findings, primary surgical approach was indicated in concordance with our tumor board.\nAfter video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) exploration excluded pleural dissemination, a left sided posterolateral thoracotomy was performed in the 9th intercostal space. The tumor was located in the left diaphragm with infiltration of the left lower lobe of the lung and left lobe of the liver. Regarding pulmonary involvment, the lesion was situated at the base of the left lung, in close proximity to the pericardium, with medial border reaching the diaphragmatic crura and lateral border on the thoracic wall. There were no potential cysts, or pseudocysts identified during the surgical procedure.\nMultivisceral resection was carried out, involving resection- and reconstruction of the left diaphragm (Gore-tex\u00ae Dualmesh\u00ae), wedge resection of the left lower lung lobe and resection of the left liver lobe. The tumor did not involve the stomach. Postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged after 7 days",

The gingival hyperplasia became evident at 18 months of age and progressed to the extent that it interfered with tooth eruption and feeding. Partial gum surgical resection was initially performed at 3 years of age and has been performed several additional times over the past eight years due to excessive gum overgrowth.

    "original_text": "In 2002, a 52-year-old asian woman underwent a lumpectomy for a stage II infiltrating duct carcinoma over her right breast, followed by four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy combining doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel. Chemotherapy was followed by locoregional radiation. Eight years after the completion of chemotherapy, she found a slowly growing mass on her right neck. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed large infraclavicular mass and a supraclavicular adenopathy of the right neck and right nasal cavity. Analysis of biopsy samples from both masses was consistent with metastatic carcinoma and suggestive of the metastasis having arisen from primary breast cancer. She underwent removal of the right supraclavicular and infraclavicular masses at that time, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. However, one year after the surgery, she found a mass in the upper outer quadrant of her right anterior chest wall. Ulceration and bleeding of the mass caused her to have a painful disability of her right upper limb. A computed tomography (CT) scan (Figure a) revealed a mass in the upper outer quadrant of her right anterior chest wall. The mass had invaded the ribs and pleura.

    "original_text": "A 34-year-old woman with a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome self-presented to the emergency department, complaining of malaise, nausea and feeling cold. Her only previous hospital admission was for the birth of her first child one month earlier.\nAn obstetric history revealed that during the antenatal period, she developed severe headache and was investigated with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain in the 30th week of her pregnancy. This showed an enlarged pituitary gland with a cranio-caudal length of 12 mm. She was reviewed along with her imaging by the Neurologist, who felt the pituitary enlargement was physiological for her stage of pregnancy and the headache a manifestation of migraine.\nShe had a difficult vaginal delivery requiring the use of ventouse and forceps for shoulder dystocia with documented blood loss of 500 mL during delivery. Subsequent history from the patient revealed that during the in-hospital post-partum period, she experienced significant fatigue and generalised weakness. Further, the baby was commenced on formula feed due to lactation failure.

After flexing his neck while tying his shoelaces, the patient experienced a sudden, severe pain (with a maximum score on a visual analog scale) that started in the posterior neck and spread rapidly across the entire head. Bilateral hand weakness that followed the pain onset prevented the patient from tying his shoelaces. The patient's vital signs were stable upon hospital admission, except for markedly elevated blood pressure (202/108 mm Hg). The initial neurological examination revealed weakness in both flexion and extension of the wrists and fingers bilaterally, and during left leg extension [Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 4]. However, the deep tendon reflexes were normal and the patient denied hypoesthesia in any sensory modality including pain, temperature, proprioception, and vibration. A detailed examination did not reveal any cortical sensory sign such as graphesthesia. The Romberg test produced a negative result. Laboratory findings were normal, and chest radiography did not reveal any pathology; an electrocardiogram also produced no evidence of ischemia or arrhythmia. Furthermore, 2-D echo and transesophageal echocardiograms provided no evidence for an embolic stroke. Subsequent 24-hour Holter monitoring failed to identify any arrhythmia or atrial fibrillation. His motor symptoms improved rapidly within 1 day except for mild weakness of his left wrist (MRC grade of flexion/extension IV/IV) and fingers (MRC grade of flexion/extension IV/IV; slightly more severe in the 5th finger). Brain computed tomography (CT) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not reveal any signal abnormalities or mass lesions.

The patient did not complain of any symptom concerning the gastrointestinal tract. During an abdominal ultrasonography, a hypoechoic round-shaped mass 4.7 cm in size, with regular margins, located between the left lobe of the liver and the anterior surface of the pancreatic body, was found. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of a cystic mass with complex content, located anteriorly to the gastroesophageal junction.\nThe patient was then submitted to EUS, in order to better define the structure of the lesion and its relationship with the adjacent organs. EUS showed a hypoechoic mass with slightly heterogeneous internal echoes and regular margins, located just below the gastroesophageal junction (Figure ). The lesion measured about 4.5 cm and seemed to be contiguous to the fourth layer of the gastric wall (muscolaris propria). On the basis of the morphologic evaluation, a diagnosis of GIST was suggested. As is usual in a case of suspected GIST involving the upper part of the gastric wall, we tried to obtain diagnostic confirmation through EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). The puncture was practiced using a 22 G needle, which, unexpectedly, penetrated very easily into the mass as it was cystic. We were able to aspirate only a few milliliters of a clear mucus-like fluid, and then a cytological sampling was made from the cystic wall. The collected material was judged adequate by an onsite cytopathologist. The cytological smear showed cylindrical cells isolated or aggregated in small groups with a palisade organization (Figure ).

He brings an ultrasound, which shows a 4 cm heterogenous mass in segment 8. His alfafetoprotein level is elevated to 76 ng/mL. He has no symptoms and looks in good performance status. We scheduled him for a triphasic CT scan, which shows a lesion of 4.3 cm with brisk arterial contrast and venous washout. According to the LIRADS classification, this lesion could be considered a class 5 with diagnostic features of hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient was discussed in our multidisciplinary tumor board including hepatobiliary and transplant surgeons, hepatologists, radiologists, pathologists, oncologists, and interventional radiologists. The plan was to submit the patient to curative intent treatments given his early presentation according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging System (BCLC), namely surgical resection or liver transplantation; radiofrequency ablation was excluded given the tumor\u2019s dimensions. Given the good performance status, the position of the lesion (which was right below the Glissonian capsule) and the liver function of the patients, the MDT decided to schedule the patient for surgery.

Her Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score was 2, and her Hugh-Jones classification was IV. Rhonchi were evident in the anterior chest.

Cartilage destruction was apparent, and the boundaries between the tumor and the esophagus and descending aorta were unclear (Fig. ). Therefore, tumor infiltration into the esophagus and descending aorta was suspected. We diagnosed her with obstructive pneumonia due to a tracheobronchial tumor. For the purposes of securing the airway, performing a tissue diagnosis and evaluating the extent of tumor progression, rigid bronchoscopy was initially performed. The tumor almost completely occluded the left main bronchus, and tumor hemorrhage was evident.

The girl and her parents denied any history of choking or FB aspiration. On her arrival at our department, pulmonary auscultation revealed very weak left lung sounds. Chest computed tomography revealed a soft tissue density at the left lower lobe bronchus (LLLB) with stenosis of the left main bronchus and emphysema of the left lower lobe ().\nAirway exploration by fiberoptic bronchoscopy under sedation and local anesthesia through the nasal route was performed to locate the suspected bronchial lesion. Bronchoscopy revealed that the stenosis of the left main bronchus was caused by a bridging scar tissue (). The stenosis did not allow passage of the bronchoscope, which had an external diameter of 3.6 mm. A smaller bronchoscope with an external diameter of 2.8 mm was able to pass through either lumen divided by the bridging scar tissue. Advancement of the bronchoscope revealed that the bridging scar tissue ended 5 mm above the left second carina, and a pink tubular-shaped FB was lodged in the LLLB. However, the nature of the FB in the left main bronchus was unclear. Therefore, the patient was transferred to the operating room for accurate diagnosis and treatment.\nIn the operating room, the patient admitted that she had aspirated a plastic whistle 6 months previously. A laryngeal mask was used during general anesthesia, allowing the patient to breathe spontaneously. A swivel adapter was used to connect the proximal end of the laryngeal mask to the T-piece anesthesia system. A flexible fiber bronchoscope (4.9 mm outer diameter) was inserted via the swivel adapter.

The chest X-ray was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck and chest revealed a 1.5 cm polypoid tumor arising from the posterior wall of the upper thoracic trachea (). A flexible bronchoscopy showed a double cone shaped, polypoid tumor arising from the posterior wall of the trachea, 5 cm distal to the vocal cords, and 7 cm proximal to the carina (). Based on the biopsy specimens, the mass was diagnosed as a glomus tumor. To check for an extension of the tumor into the surrounding tissue, an endoscopic ultrasonic exam was performed, and it showed that the tumor was confined to the trachea. Since the tumor was located in the upper trachea, we decided to approach the tumor through a cervical collar incision. After exposure of the trachea, the location of the tumor was identified between the 5th and 6th tracheal rings using flexible bronchoscopy. We divided the trachea one cartilage ring below the tumor and a sterile laryngectomy tube was inserted into the distal trachea.

On physical examination, abdominal distension, mild tenderness, and a firm palpable lump in central abdomen were found. There was also hyperactive bowel sound on auscultation. He admitted a history of constipation, anorexia but no weight loss in the recent 3 months. He had no medical history related to his current condition, no history of chronic diseases, chronic use of medication, infectious diseases like tuberculosis, or abdominal surgery. He had experienced several similar episodes over the previous 3 months, which required hospitalization and were relieved by conservative therapy. During examination, he was in distress, but laboratory findings were normal. Multiple air-fluid levels were seen in plain abdominal X-rays and small intestinal CT revealed congregated small intestine loops were confined to a single area and encased in a thick membrane suggestive of AC or internal hernia (Fig. ). The most likely primary diagnosis was AC, and a decision was then taken to carry out an exploratory laparotomy this time. During laparotomy, a thick white membrane (Fig. ) was found encasing the entire small intestine in the abdomen. The greater omentum was not observed. The large intestine, stomach, liver, and spleen were not affected. The whole of cocoon membrane was excised with care to avoid injury to small intestine. Appendectomy was also done before the closure of the abdomen. The pathology of the resected membrane showed fibrocollagenous tissue associated with mucoid and vitreous degeneration and an infiltration of few lymphocytes. Unfortunately, the patient experienced crampy abdominal pain, distention, and vomiting on day 6 after the surgery. A provisional clinical diagnosis of EPSBO was made for this patient. On the 10th day, an NIT of 300-cm long was installed through the nose with the tip pushed to the upper jejunum assisted by gastroscopy.",

Three weeks prior to presentation, the patient had undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and developed a postoperative gastric volvulus. This was decompressed three days after cholecystectomy with a gastrostomy tube. The gastrostomy tube was connected to suction, relieving some of the patient's abdominal symptoms.\nOn presentation the patient was tachycardic, with a heart rate of 123 beats/minute and a blood pressure of 107/73. She was afebrile. Her abdominal exam was significant for both right upper and lower quadrants pain, but she did not exhibit any abdominal guarding or rebound tenderness.\nThe patient's physical exam indicated the presence of an incarcerated hernia, but it could not be determined at the bedside whether this was a spigelian or ventral hernia. A computed tomography (CT) scan was ordered for a definitive diagnosis, as well as to determine the location and contents of the lesion while the patient was stable.\nThe patient was initially treated with intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to CT scanning. The CT scan demonstrated a high-grade small bowel obstruction caused by an entrapped loop of small bowel within a left-sided spigelian hernia (see ). Informed consent was obtained, and the patient was taken to the operating room for emergency laparoscopic repair of her spigelian hernia. The laparoscopic approach involved placement of the patient in the supine position with both arms tucked. Pneumoperitoneum was established using a veress needle in the midline at the umbilicus. Three ports were inserted under direct vision (a 5 mm port in the midline, a 10 mm port in the right midclavicular line, and a 5 mm port in the right suprapubic region). A spigelian hernia was noted on the left lower abdominal wall and measured about 3.5 cm in its greatest diameter. Fortunately, the uncompromised loop of small bowel was reduced back",

Treatment for HCV, genotype 1, was initiated with pegylated interferon alfa-2a 180 mcg subcutaneously once per week and oral ribavirin 1000 mg per day. On the fourth day of treatment he experienced an intermittently pruritic and enlarging rash localized to his arms and legs.

The patient initiated nicotine use at 18 years of age escalating to 15 cigarettes/day within 2-3 months of onset and became dependent on nicotine. At the age of 19 years, he reported initiating alprazolam use due to sleep disturbances during exams but later continued its use on regular basis. During his postgraduate residency period in anesthesia, he started using injectable midazolam 5 mg intramuscular (IM) as it was more easily available than alprazolam. After use of midazolam on few occasions he did not experience a good sleep and so he injected pentazocine with promethazine IM which was also readily available with him in his personal kitbag. His use of pentazocine gradually increased to 15 injection/day regularly within 3-4 months of initiation. During the last year of residency, on 1 day, he was feeling difficulty in sleep; however, he was not having any other medication or injection other than ketamine in his room. He injected 1 ampoule (2 ml) of ketamine (1 ml = 50 mg ketamine) IM himself. He felt a unique experience with ketamine which was different from all substances he had used in the past. He felt light, euphoric, had pleasant visual hallucinations of animals and also felt as if his limbs had separated and he was floating in the sky, other sensations of depersonalization. Though these effects persisted for about 30 min, he felt as if time around him had stood still and he had been in the state for hours together. He started using 1-2 ampoule of ketamine daily in night time",

A chest computed tomography (CT) scan was carried out at the clinic which showed a significantly enhanced irregular huge soft tissue mass in the anterior mediastinal area, considered likely to be a malignant lesion (Fig ). A CT-guided transthoracic fine-needle aspiration was performed at the left second intercostal space and the biopsy specimen showed pathological findings consistent with a spindle cell tumor with mitotic figures (MF) up to 14/10 high power fields (HPF). Immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that CD34 and vimentin were strong positive, Bcl-2 was partially positive and CD99 was diffuse positive, while STAT6, melanocyte, cytokeratin, epithelial cell membrane antigen, S-100, and calretinin were all negative (Fig ). A diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) was suspected as a result of the negative immunohistochemistry staining of STAT6. Following surgery via a sternal midline incision, the tumor was found to be located at the left side of the anterior mediastinum, pulmonary artery and pericardium. It invaded the left mediastinal pleura and pericardium and was closely related to the left phrenic nerve. There was no invasion of the lungs, large blood vessels and no metastasis to the chest.

Her chest pain was retrosternal with no radiation and persisted continuously throughout the admission time. She described the pain as heaviness in her chest. The pain had no relation to exertion and was not relieved with rest. Additionally, it was neither positional nor pleuritic. There were no other accompanying symptoms. In her past medical history, she had an episode of cardiac arrest 3 months earlier, following an episode of a chest pain similar to her current pain. On that occasion, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was successful, coronary angiography was normal, and an ICD was implanted. She had no history of any previous medical disease, allergy, atherosclerosis risk factors, or smoking, and nor did she consume any drugs. She had a low socioeconomic status.

Physical examination on admission showed: a height of 145 centimeters; a weight of 82 kilograms; a blood pressure of 180/85 mmHg; capillary blood glucose at 0.91 g/l, with a typical clinical picture of hypercorticism with the presence of pain on palpation of the thoracolumbar spine.

It was not associated with dysphagia, dyspnea, or dysphonia. There was no history of trauma. It was not associated with similar swellings in other body parts. Her head and neck examination revealed a 4 \u00d7 3 cm swelling in left anterolateral region of upper neck. It was soft, not tender, nonpulsatile, and nonexpansible on Valsalva maneuver. There was no palpable thrill. Oral cavity examination did not reveal any abnormality. The overlying skin was normal in color without local rise of temperature and it was free from the underlying swelling. Her medical and family history was unremarkable. Based on the history and clinical examination, provisional diagnosis of branchial cyst was made.\nUltrasonography revealed a well defined hyperechoic mass, suggested as a highly vascular mass. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) examination was suggestive of vascular lesion. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed an inhomogeneous hypodense lesion lying in close approximation to left ala of thyroid cartilage ().

Her Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score was 2, and her Hugh-Jones classification was IV. Rhonchi were evident in the anterior chest. Laboratory studies showed an increased inflammatory response. All tumor markers were within normal limits. The chest X-ray revealed an infiltrative shadow in the lower left lung field. CT imaging showed a solid left main bronchial tumor with carinal involvement. Cartilage destruction was apparent, and the boundaries between the tumor and the esophagus and descending aorta were unclear (Fig. ). Therefore, tumor infiltration into the esophagus and descending aorta was suspected. We diagnosed her with obstructive pneumonia due to a tracheobronchial tumor. For the purposes of securing the airway, performing a tissue diagnosis and evaluating the extent of tumor progression, rigid bronchoscopy was initially performed. The tumor almost completely occluded the left main bronchus, and tumor hemorrhage was evident. By coring out the tumor, the left main bronchus was reopened, and detail of the involved area was revealed. The tumor originated from the left main stem bronchus and occupied almost the entire left main stem bronchus.

Clinical examination revealed a huge swelling on the left side of the jaw []. The patient was aware of the swelling since 15 years. The swelling was gradual on onset, slowly increased over years to present size and was not preceeded by any trauma or tooth ache in that region of jaw. History of associated pain since 3-4 years was noted. No history of any loss of sensation or pus discharge was noted. The patient was a known hypertensive since 15 years and was on regular medication. The swelling was solitary, well-defined, firm in consistency, tender, and 12 \u00d7 12 cm in size extending from the right canine region to the left angle region. No evidence of lingual cortical plate expansion or perforation was noted. Based on the history and clinical findings, a differential diagnosis of osteoblastoma, cementoblastoma, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, and OF was given.\nRadiographic evaluation with OPG and lateral view of mandible showed a mixed radiolucent and radioopaque lesion with diffuse foci of calcifications throughout [Figures and ]. Patient underwent extraction of the complaint tooth and an incisional biopsy of the lesion was done and sent for histological evaluation.\nHistopathological analysis revealed connective tissue stroma that was highly cellular and was made up of numerous fibroblasts and collagen fibers. Trabeculae of bone with osteocytes and globules of calcification amidst plump fibroblasts were noted [Figures and ]. Few endothelial lined blood vessels were also seen giving an impression of OF.\nCorrelating the clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings, a final diagnosis of OF was given.

An explorative laparotomy in August 2010 showed metastatic disease spread extensively to regional lymph nodes and thus the primary tumor in the pancreatic head was not resected. By CT imaging criteria no other distant metastatic disease was evident. Lymph nodes were sampled surgically from the right gastric artery, the hepatic artery, the coeliac trunc and from the interaortocaval region; in all samples, tumor infiltration by a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma was confirmed by histology. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CK7, CK20 and CA 19\u20139 (with CDX-2 being negative). At that time point an additional analysis for KRAS mutational status and EGFR protein expression (which were conducted within a translational research project) detected a wildtype sequence of KRAS exon 2 by pyrosequencing and a moderately positive immunohistochemical staining for membranous EGFR expression in about 80% of the tumor cells.\nThe patient initially received systemic chemotherapy with three cycles of standard dose (1000 mg/m2) gemcitabine between September and December 2010. Imaging studies in January 2011 confirmed stable disease and the CA 19\u20139 levels decreased from 3700 U/ml at first diagnosis to 180 U/ml.

There were left eye ptosis and decrement of left nasolabial fold in patient\u2019s face. The patient had tremor and truncal ataxia. The force of the extremities and deep tendon reflexes were normal in physical examination. Her heart rate was 110 min, blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg and temperature 38.2 \u00b0C. The patient\u2019s weight was 21 kg and had 133 cm height and head circumference was 52 cm. The patient had no history of head trauma.\nAn informed consent was obtained from her parents in order to publish data as a case report without publishing her name. Ethics Committee of the university approved the study.\nDiagnostic focus and assessment:\nThe patient underwent a brain CT scan without contrast in first day of admission preceded by CBC, diff, BUN, Cr, Na, K, Arterial blood gas sampling (ABG) and Urine analysis. On the second day, brain magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with flair, T1, T2 and DWI sequences and also EEG were ordered, then lumbar puncture with 3 samples was carried out. About 48 h after the MRI the patient became aggressive and had severe headache, nausea and vomiting plus ataxia and delirium, then the patient transferred to PICU and we decided to order the second CT scan and after the results, we asked for urgent neurosurgery consultation and the patient was prepared for brain surgery. The day after surgery the patient underwent brain CT scan without contrast again and laboratory tests were repeated. The patient underwent the last brain CT scan without contrast on thirteenth day and also had an EEG on the same day. We also did a portable echocardiography",

    "original_text": "Our patient is a 5-year-old female who was referred for evaluation and management of recurrent episodes of cellulitis in the left scapular region. A small cystic lesion had first been noted at the age of 2 years. While this had initially been an asymptomatic, small lump that grew in size over time, it first became symptomatic when the patient was 4 years old. The lesion developed surrounding induration and erythema, as well as purulent drainage and tenderness. Over the next 1-year period, she went on to develop 3 such episodes of cellulitis. This was treated with a 10-day course of cephalexin by the patient's family physician, and it was due to these recurrent episodes of infection that we saw the patient in consultation.\nPhysical examination revealed a playful and well-appearing 5-year-old female, weighing 24.8 kg and measuring 114.5 cm in height. Review of systems and cardiorespiratory examinations were unremarkable. On inspection of the left scapular region, approximately 7 \u00d7 5 cm area of cellulitis was noted, with a small opening and associated purulent drainage. The surrounding skin was tender to palpation, but there was no appreciable fluctuance. Thus, the initial working diagnosis was infected epidermoid cyst. An ultrasound of the affected area showed a complex cystic mass measuring 3.9 \u00d7 2.9 \u00d7 3.7 cm within the subcutaneous fat (). Deeper margins of the mass were poorly demarcated due to the degree of inflammation, and the lesion appeared to abut the underlying musculature. Since these findings were nonspecific, an MRI was obtained to further characterize the lesion. The MRI revealed the presence of a subcutaneous cystic lesion just superior to the scapula measuring 1.6 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 2.8 cm. While the mass abutted underlying muscular fascia, there was no extension into the underlying trapezius muscle itself (Figures and ). Thus, the decision was made to pursue surgical excision of the lesion. This was performed",
