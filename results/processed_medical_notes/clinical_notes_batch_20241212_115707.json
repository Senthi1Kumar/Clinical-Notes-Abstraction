This was associated with blurred vision for the 3 months prior to presentation. The patient denied pain or double vision, and there was no history of trauma at any time. The patient had had type 2 diabetes mellitus for more than 20 years. On examination, his best corrected visual acuity in the right eye was count fingers at 3 feet and 20/25 in the left eye, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Color vision and confrontation visual fields were normal bilaterally. Mild restriction of ocular motility in superior gaze, as well as 4 mm of proptosis and 4 mm of hypoglobus were present. A palpable mass was present above the globe []. The fundus exam showed severe bilateral nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, with greater macular edema in the right eye compared to the left eye. Fundus fluorescein angiography revealed evidence of an ischemic macula in the right eye. Macular edema was responsible for his decreased vision and this was managed with laser photocoagulation by the retina service. An orbital computed tomography (CT) scan indicated a large intra-orbital cyst in the superotemporal aspect of the right orbit, which was associated with an irregular bony erosion of the orbital roof and inferior displacement of the globe [].

A lumbar NMR scan showed a paramedian LDH at L4/5 with compression of nerve root L5 and a paramedian LDH at L5/S1 touching nerve root S1. A decompression operation was not performed despite the neurosurgeons' recommendations as our patient refused because of the fear of prolonged ventilation and respirator dependency after operation in the light of her severely impaired lung function. In spite of intensive physiotherapy, full mobilization took several weeks and inspiration was impaired by the pain, so that it was not possible to perform respiratory physiotherapy to its full extent. The paresis disappeared under physiotherapy but the pain did not fully disappear, needing NSAIDs and opioids. A course of intravenous antibiotic therapy was necessary at one, four and five months later. Her lung function parameters declined further and home oxygen therapy was started three months after LDH diagnosis, with 3 to 6L of O2 per minute. From six months after LDH diagnosis onwards she was hospitalized in an intensive care unit. A sternal fracture occurred seven months after LDH due to coughing and osteoporosis. Finally, our patient died eight months after LDH diagnosis while on the high urgency waiting list for lung transplantation because of an unmanageable pulmonary infection with massive pulmonary bleeding. She had spent three weeks on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) before she died. The fact that she temporarily fell from the high urgency list a month before her death because of improving partial CO2 values on blood gas analysis may have also played a role in the disease process, as it tremendously destabilized her mood and raised fears she may not get a transplant organ.",

Abdominal US showed that a few of the lesions were consistent with HCs in both lobes of the liver and the spleen. The patient was examined with a panendoscope to differentially diagnose the dyspeptic complaints. The endoscopic examination revealed external compression of the gastric wall. The echinococcal indirect hemagglutination test was positive at a titer of 1:256. A contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan showed 2 calcifying lesions consistent with HCs, the largest of which had a diameter of 5 cm, in the anterior and posterior segments of the right lobe of the liver. The other HC lesion was 11 \u00d7 10 cm and almost completely filled the left lobe of the liver. This HC was compressing the stomach, and was close to the anterior abdominal wall. Additionally, 2 more lesions resembling HCs, of which the larger had a 10-cm diameter, were detected in the spleen (Figs. and ). Surgery was scheduled, so the patient was administered two 400-mg doses of albendazole p.o. and a pneumococcal vaccine.

The first episode was precipitated by the diagnosis of renal cancer which required simple nephrectomy. After a failing trial with escitalopram, this first episode was treated with venlafaxine up to 300 mg/day during 16 weeks to obtain a sustained remission. All psychotropics were discontinued one year later and the patient maintained complete stability the next nine years. On January 2014 she was admitted to the psychiatric ward due to a relapse in severe depressive symptoms with continuous suicidal thoughts. The current episode might be triggered by a back pain that reminded the onset of the cancer. Imaging methods ruled out a cancer relapse and additional blood tests, including thyroid status, showed no significant abnormalities. The patient had a negative record for any substance use, but additional medical history included properly corrected hypothyroidism, intrinsic asthma, and hypercholesterolemia. Nevertheless, the initial anxiety symptoms generated by the fear of a cancer relapse gradually became a major depressive episode with extreme fear for everything, including any new physical or mental disease that kept her from going out of the house, restlessness, fragmented sleep, and lack of energy that caused total impairment of daily activities. Venlafaxine titrated to 300 mg/day had been initiated two weeks before admission with no relief. Quetiapine 400 mg/day was added and the patient showed an improvement in anxiety and insomnia but core depressive symptoms remained unmodified. After two more weeks without any improvement venlafaxine was switched to imipramine up to 300 mg/day and lithium at doses to obtain therapeutic levels. Three weeks later no improvement was observed and bilateral ECT was initiated three times per week until obtaining a slight improvement in mood that allowed discharge. The patient was complaining of moderate retrograde amnesia and subjective perception of mild cognitive deficit.

The patient was diagnosed with gingivitis, and treated with a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug and oral rinsing with chlorhexidine. The condition of the patient did not improve significantly. When she returned a week later, she had no alleviation, but labial paresthesia on the right side of her lip. As the cause of the new symptom remained unidentified, she was referred to the oral surgery group. Initially, the paraesthesia affected only the right side of the lower lip, but by this time it had spread to the skin of the right side of her chin. The oral surgeons decided to extract the lower right wisdom tooth, but the labial paraesthesia still persisted. Since there was an extended composite restoration in the lower right first molar, and translucency around its apical region was visible, the lesion was diagnosed as periapical granuloma. The lesion on tooth 46 was not close to the mandibular canal; this can be seen on Fig. . Therefore, root canal treatment was carried out, despite the uncertain result of the percussion, palpation and sensibility test. The transparent lesion around the apex and the negative sensibility test lead to the decision of endodontic treatment. Diagnosis was made by a dentist who is not a staff member of our Department. The treatment revealed that the pulp was vital. Our oral diagnostic team examined the patient, and we diagnosed the case as cemento-osseous dysplasia based on the panoramic radiograph showing apical translucency lesions around the anterior teeth with vital pulp (Fig. ). The paraesthesia has been continually present ever since. Because the lesion around the lower right canine had already involved the cortical bone by CBCT scan (Fig. ), a root canal filling and removal of the apical lesion were performed.

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain confirmed the previously noted enhanced intraventricular lesions within the right lateral ventricle, the fourth ventricle and bilateral foramen of Luschka (). An oncologic workup ensued and a CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed thickening of the rectum with surrounding fat stranding and a heterogeneous mass in the right cardiophrenic region (). The patient underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy with rectal biopsies showing a moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. He also underwent a CT-guided biopsy of the anterior mediastinal mass, which was diagnosed as a World Health Organization (WHO) grade AB thymoma and was thought to be an incidental diagnosis unrelated to his metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma. The patient's neurological functions were assessed intact with no deficits, but he continued to have progressive dysphagia possibly due to the thymoma impinging on his vocal cords. As opposed to performing an invasive craniotomy for resection of the patient's intraventricular lesions, we decided to proceed with a less invasive intraventricular Ommaya reservoir placement. This decision was predicated by the fact that the patient had multiple ventricular involvement, a potential need for intrathecal chemotherapy and the possibility of developing hydrocephalus.

Differential diagnosis at this time included chondroblastoma, giant cell tumor, clear cell chondrosarcoma, and osteomyelitis. Given the patient's delayed presentation and our increased concern for metastatic disease we elected to proceed with a CT chest, in place of a routine screening chest radiograph. This CT showed no evidence of metastatic disease. Core needle biopsy () showed mononuclear neoplastic cells with intermixed multinucleated giant cells, tumor cells surrounded by dark blue \u201cchicken wire\u201d calcifications, and fibrochondroid islands all consistent with a chondroblastoma. At this point an MRI of the left knee was obtained to evaluate the extent of articular cartilage involvement and to determine reconstruction options after recommended intralesional curettage. MRI demonstrated a lytic lesion with sclerotic borders involving the posterior aspect of the medial femoral condyle and abutting the posterior articular surface with a 3 mm collapse of the subchondral bone and breach of the chondral surface (). Also the significant enhancing of marrow edema in the medial femoral condyle and adjacent soft tissue edema with associated joint effusion is well demonstrated on the T2 STIR images (). The imaging and pathology were reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board and the surgical approach and reconstructive options were discussed at the weekly orthopaedic departmental preoperative planning meeting.

    "original_text": "A 40-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented to his primary care physician with worsening intermittent right lower quadrant abdominal pain radiating to his right flank. This pain was described as a constant dull ache with intermittent sharp pains. For the last three days, he had feelings of being bloated with progressive abdominal discomfort. His medical history was unremarkable aside from asthma, hypertension, and obesity with BMI of 35.7, while family history was significant for ovarian cancer in his mother. Of note, within the past week, he was treated with a course of high dose steroids for asthma exacerbation. His social history consisted of being a father to four biological children. Upon presentation, the patient denied dysuria, diarrhea, and blood or pain with bowel movements. On physical exam, he had a distended abdomen with right lower quadrant tenderness but no costovertebral angle tenderness, rebound tenderness, or guarding. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a large midline pelvic complex cystic lesion that appeared to arise from the right vas deferens (Figures and ). Radiology recommended an MRI for clearer visualization and location of the mass based on results of the CT scan (Figures and ). The MRI displayed intensity of the mass on T2-weighted imaging (). The distal portion of the right vas deferens was also dilated near the ejaculatory duct junction. The patient had followup appointments with general surgery and urology for surgical evaluation.

The results on chest radiography, electrocardiography, and blood examinations were normal. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a mobile mass, 16 mm in diameter, originating from the anterolateral wall of the left ventricle. Its stalk was short, and the tumor was directly attached to the ventricular wall. The diameter of the left ventricle was 52 mm in the diastolic phase and 30 mm in the systolic phase.

Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane in air\u2013oxygen mixture with intermittent doses of intravenous opioids and vecuronium bromide for skeletal muscle relaxation.

The patient was a tattoo fanatic who underwent solar branding on her right forearm approximately 2 weeks before presentation. The patient first noticed the blistering of the branded area 3 days after her body modification. Over the next few days, the entire branded area became very warm, swollen, painful to touch, and developed cellulitis with weeping blisters. Given her dire situation, the patient finally sought medical care in the local urgent care center. The patient was diagnosed with a superficial infection of her right forearm full thickness burn and prescribed oral clindamycin. The patient continued to develop painful blisters for the next week and did not notice any improvements in her cellulitis despite the antibiotic treatment, prompting her to come to our ED for a second medical opinion.\nDuring her physical examination, the patient was noted to have painful blisters, redness, and swelling of the right forearm and hand (Figure ). She did have a full range of motion of the hand; however, there was mild pain noted on the flexion of the hand. There were no signs of sepsis, and her vital signs and her laboratory panel which included white blood cell count were all within normal limits. The rest of the physical examination was also unremarkable. The patient was admitted to the Burn Surgery Service for intravenous (IV) antibiotics and possible operative interventions.\nThe patient was started on IV clindamycin 600 mg every 8 hours, and once adequate pain control was achieved, a bedside debridement was performed in the Burn Unit.

She presents with worsening headache for three months with associated vertigo, nausea, and vomiting not responding to analgesics or vestibular sedatives. Her symptoms initially started twelve years ago as a diffused mild headache, which persisted through the day. Gradually, the headache worsened to a severe headache episodically associated with vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. These episodes lasted for two to three days and got resolved. She was treated with flunarizine for suspected basilar migraine but did not show any response. From the last year, she had monthly exacerbations of headache associated with distressing vertigo, unsteadiness of gait, and right-sided body numbness. In between these episodes, she had a significant dull diffuse headache not responding to simple analgesia. She did not complain of fever or night sweats but had constitutional symptoms lasting for several months. All of these symptoms severely affected her daily activities and functionality.\nDuring the last 17 years, she had repeated episodes of neurological deficits. Even before the headache appeared, she has presented with visual impairment of the right eye and right lateral rectus palsy and was treated as retrobulbar neuritis with good response to methylprednisolone. One year later, she developed left-sided visual impairment, which fully responded to methylprednisolone. MRI imaging at that time revealed normal results. Few months after this event, she got admitted with right hemisensory loss with hemiplegia, and a demyelination disease or hemiplegic migraine was suspected. Second MRI was performed at this admission, and no abnormalities were detected again. Eight years ago, she had developed a left lower motor type facial nerve palsy, which was attributed to Bell's palsy.

He received alemtuzumab at induction (30 mg subcutanously on day 0 and day 1) followed by maintenance immunosuppression with tacrolimus, mycophenylate mofetil (MMF) and prednisolone. As he was enrolled in a clinical trial, the use of alemtuzumab for induction was determined by the arm he was randomised to. He continued on tacrolimus before being randomised at 6 months to switch to sirolimus as part of the clinical trial []. A year later he had to leave the study as he was undergoing incisional hernia repair so returned to tacrolimus-based immunosuppression.\nThree years after transplantation renal function started to decline. Chronic antibody mediated rejection (CAMR) was found on transplant renal biopsy and new donor specific antibodies against HLA class II were detected. Tacrolimus and MMF doses were increased and he restarted on 5 mg prednisolone. The daily total tacrolimus dose was increased from 3 mg to 5 mg with levels rising from 5.4 \u03bcg/L to 7.0 \u03bcg/L and MMF daily dose was doubled from 1000 mg to 2000 mg. A month after this change he presented to primary care having passed frank blood in his stool and with a one week history of abdominal pain and faecal urgency.

Her pregnancy was uncomplicated until she received a diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) at 29 weeks through an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test. She was commenced on insulin at 33-week gestation after failing to control her blood sugars through diet and exercise alone. Her pregnancy was further complicated with diagnosis of obstetric cholestasis at 36-week gestation and she was admitted to hospital due to persistent pruritus and reduced fetal movements. A decision was made to induce labor at 37 weeks due to worsening liver enzyme profile and further progression of her pruritus. Induction of labor was achieved with 2 mg of dinoprost per vaginum. Her initial examination revealed a cephalic presentation, with a soft posterior cervix 1 cm dilated. Spontaneous rupture of membranes occurred 5 h after vaginal prostaglandin administration. Palpable contractions commenced within 20 min of rupture of membranes and reached a peak frequency of 7 in 15 min, lasting 45\u201360 sec each. Vaginal examination was performed 45 min after rupture of membranes due to maternal distress. The patient was found to be 4 cm dilated, vertex -2 and was transferred to a dedicated delivery room with one to one midwifery care. Within 2 h, the patient began involuntary bearing down and was found to be fully dilated, vertex +1 and rapidly advancing. Pushing was commenced.\nIn the second stage of labor, after pushing for 16 min, a 4 cm defect of the perineum between the vaginal orifice and the rectum was noted. The vaginal orifice itself remained intact. The fetal head was visible through this perineal defect as the head crowned. A right mediolateral episiotomy was performed to prevent an anal sphincter injury; however, the patient sustained a third-degree tear. Total time in labor from contractions starting to delivery of the baby was 2 h 45 min.\nAfter examination under anesthesia, a 3b tear was diagnosed \u2013",

She had a medical history significant for prolonged glucocorticoid exposure for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. She had undergone colectomy in 1994, following which daily corticosteroid administration had been replaced with intermittent, pulse-dosed glucocorticoids, as required. The onset of left knee pain had occurred in March of 2019 with a rapid increase in pain severity. She had developed difficulty in walking, necessitating the use of a cane for ambulation, and had started taking ibuprofen on a regular basis. Three months later, she had been evaluated by a rheumatologist and found to have bone infarcts of both the femur and tibia. This had led to the diagnosis of ON of the knee, presumably corticosteroid-induced due to exposure history. At that time, she had started alendronate and calcitonin. However, the pain had persisted and she had been prescribed oral morphine 15-30 mg every eight hours as needed by her primary care physician (PCP), following which she had been transitioned to a 25 mcg/hr fentanyl patch six months after the initial presentation due to worsening pain.\nDespite additional analgesics, the pain had progressed with new-onset radiation into the distal tibia, ankle, and foot. This had prompted an evaluation with an orthopedic surgeon, who did not recommend surgical intervention. A second surgical opinion had been obtained with the recommendation to undergo intraarticular corticosteroid injections (CSI) for symptom management until the degree of progressive collapse necessitated TKA. A third surgical opinion had recommended against TKA since the location of the lesion in the tibia was too distal to the joint line and had instead considered transfemoral amputation as the best surgical option.

    "original_text": "A 71-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with chief complaints of abdominal pain and vomiting.\nA 71-year-old man was on treatment for chronic hepatitis B for 22 years when he was diagnosed with HCC. He was noted to have tumor nodules of size 20 mm in diameter, located in segment 8, on a follow-up abdominal computed tomography (CT) (Figure ) and had undergone partial liver resection 7 years previously. Based on the 8th Union for International Cancer Control classification of HCC, the tumor was classified as pT1N0M0 stage 1. Seven months after the first surgery, abdominal CT revealed recurrent HCC with nodules 10 mm in diameter, in segment 6 of the liver (Figure ). When laparotomy was performed, a peritoneal mass was found that was not apparent preoperatively; therefore, partial liver resection and peritoneal tumor resection were performed (Figure and ). The peritoneal tumor with peritoneal metastasis of HCC was diagnosed based on histopathological findings. Fourteen months after the first surgery, abdominal CT revealed a tumor nodule 32 mm in diameter in the pelvis, which was diagnosed as a peritoneal recurrence of HCC (Figure ). We determined that the recurrent tumor was solitary and decided to perform tumor resection. However, many small peritoneal nodules were found at the time of laparotomy, and radical resection was impossible (Figure ). Subsequently, the patient was followed up by the department of gastroenterology of our hospital, and 16 mo after the initial resection of HCC, administration of sorafenib of 400 mg/d was started. Since he developed a grade 2 hand-foot syndrome, the dosage was reduced to 200 mg/d.

    "original_text": "A 29-year-old multi-gravida was referred to our hospital with an antenatal diagnosis of a large cystic hygroma diagnosed at 38 weeks of gestation. Fetal MRI revealed a large multiseptated cystic mass (measuring 12 \u00d7 8 cm) involving both sides of the neck with compression over the trachea []. Hence a difficulty in securing the airway was anticipated and EXIT procedure was planned. The parents were counseled and informed written consent was obtained. A multispecialty team comprising of obstetricians, anesthesiologists, pediatric surgeons, neonatologists, and radiologists were involved in planning and executing the procedure. Under general anesthesia elective Cesarean section was performed. Two teams of anesthesiologists were present, one for the mother and the other for the fetus. Apart from the routine monitoring, radial artery cannulation was done for invasive blood pressure monitoring. Patient was positioned in the supine position with left lateral tilt to prevent compression on the aorta. The legs were slightly abducted in order to allow easy access to the fetus for intubation. General anesthesia was commenced and maintained with higher concentration of isoflurane (for complete uterine relaxation), oxygen, nitrous oxide, and muscle relaxants. Before skin incision, ultrasound was done to locate the placental edge which revealed two loops of umbilical cord around the fetal neck. After skin and uterine incision, the fetal head and neck with the mass was delivered []. Warm Ringer lactate was infused into the uterine cavity to maintain the uterine volume. Fetal heart rate was monitored with an ultrasound probe and manually by umbilical cord pulsation. Initial attempts at intubation failed. Ultrasound-guided aspiration of the cyst was done but since most of the cysts were microcystic, adequate decompression could not be obtained. The neck was delivered up to the sternal notch [] and then intubated.

The patient reported that he first noticed a dull ache when playing golf. Radiographs obtained in the emergency department showed moderate degenerative changes but no acute abnormalities. A diagnosis of rotator cuff tendinitis was established. The patient was subsequently provided with an arm sling and discharged for outpatient follow-up.\nThe patient was evaluated in clinic approximately three weeks after his initial presentation in the emergency department. He reported minimal pain relief despite daily use of the arm sling and oral naproxen sodium. Physical examination revealed significant tenderness to palpation over the left glenohumeral joint. Range of motion of the left shoulder was restricted with abduction and extension. The Hawkins-Kennedy test and external rotation lag sign were positive. A presumptive diagnosis of rotator cuff tendinopathy vs tear was established. The patient was referred for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and outpatient physical therapy. However, a trial of physical therapy was required for health insurance authorization of imaging; the first session was scheduled for one week after the clinic visit.\nThe patient began physical therapy as planned. However, three days after his first session, he presented to the emergency department complaining of testicular swelling. An ultrasound was performed and revealed hydrocele. The patient was diagnosed with epididymitis and prescribed oral ciprofloxacin. The swelling failed to resolve after a two-week course of antibiotics. He was subsequently evaluated by urology, who recommended continuing ciprofloxacin for eight weeks. Symptoms had partially resolved following two months of treatment.\nThe left shoulder pain failed to improve after three months and twelve physical therapy sessions.

Her cranial computerized tomography (CT) scan showed multiple lesions that are a 6 mm mass on the right parietal lobe, a 16 mm mass on the left occipital, and another 7 mm mass on the left temporal lobe (Figures and ). All the lesions were hyperintense and surrounded by edema which suggests a metastatic cancer. Her cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also confirmed similar findings suggestive of a metastatic cancer to the brain.\nFor identification of the primary malignancy, she initially underwent thoracic and abdominopelvic CT. Upper abdominal CT scan revealed indistinctly bordered and heterogeneously contrast accumulating multiple lesions less than 15 mm in the liver. There was a pelvic tumor of 62 \u00d7 53 mm sized and solid cystic in nature located in the right adnexa. The pelvic mass was round shaped and thin capsulated that contains irregular septations and a solid component of 38 \u00d7 24 mm on MRI scan (). The right pelvic lymph nodes were slightly enlarged.
