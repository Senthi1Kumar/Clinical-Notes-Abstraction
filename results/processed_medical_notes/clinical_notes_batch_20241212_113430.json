Intraorally, a bony hard painless swelling was extending from the lower right third molar region to the left canine region with intact overlying mucosa. All the teeth in the lesional area were vital with mobility of the right incisors and molars.\nThe panoramic radiograph revealed a predominantly well defined multilocular radiolucency with sclerotic border and scalloped margins in the right mandibular body region.

Anterior to the multilocular radiolucency, an area of mixed radiopaque/radiolucency was noted extending from the mandibular right second premolar to the mandibular left lateral incisor crossing the midline. The entire lesion measured about 8\u00d74 cm. Root resorption of lower anterior teeth and molars were noticeable (). Axial computed tomograph (CT) revealed a mixed radiolucent-radiopaque mass with well defined borders on the right mandibular body crossing the midline along with buccal cortical plate expansion ().\nBased on the clinical and radiographic findings a presumptive diagnosis of ameloblastoma or odontogenic keratocyst was made. Incisional biopsy was performed from the posterior and anterior regions which were submitted to the department of oral pathology.

The results of blood tests, including a complete blood count, chemistry, and clotting profile, were all within normal limits.\nThe initial orthopantomogram () revealed an alveolar bone height resorbed edentulous area in the upper-left posterior maxillary region with pneumatization of the maxillary sinus. The residual bone height was 2.5 mm (class D) between the upper first and second molars, 4.5 mm (class C) in the second molar area, and 7 mm (class B) in the second premolar area. The classification of sinus morphology (classes A through E) was initially proposed by Jensen to aid in the selection of the appropriate grafting material or technique at a specific site []. The alveolar ridge was approximately 8 to 10.5 mm in width, and the occlusal clearance was 6 to 7 mm.\nIn the first stage, the 1st implant was placed at the least alveolar bone height, which was located in the 1st molar area, to obtain maximum lifting of the sinus area and avoid any interference with the Schneiderian membrane in the 2nd stage and prepare the adjacent resorbed sites for further implant placement in the sinus areas. The punch incision was initially preferred (the alveolar ridge was approximately 8 to 10.5 mm in width) but because of the risk of miscalculating the exact alveolar bone height in that critical area, under local anesthesia, a full-thickness flap was elevated using a mid-crestal incision and 2 releasing buccal and palatal incisions of the upper-left first molar.

On examination, he had an ejection systolic murmur heard throughout the precordium with a valvular click noted. Examination showed no peripheral stigmata of endocarditis.\nThe ECG showed sinus rhythm and chest X-ray was normal. Full blood count and renal function were normal. Liver enzymes were slightly elevated without jaundice or hypoalbuminaemia. The CRP was elevated (47 mg/L) (<5 mg/L). All blood cultures were negative and a sample for mycobacterial culture was sent. HIV and hepatitis screen were negative. Transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography showed no vegetations. Abdominal ultrasound showed a thickened gallbladder wall and one small gallstone. CT thorax, abdomen, and pelvis excluded the presence of malignancy or abscess as the cause of the pyrexia.\nAn FDG PET CT scan was performed which showed a retrosternal soft tissue density/collection involving the pericardium and linear increased uptake was noted in the ascending aorta and root (). This mass was felt to represent an abscess. There were also metabolically active areas in the right upper lobe and focal splenic uptake. The mycobacterium blood culture isolated a Mycobacterium avium intracellular type organism which was identified later as M. chimaera infection, and diagnosis of infective endocarditis secondary to M. chimaera was established.\nPatient 2 was initially treated as endocarditis and started on intravenous flucloxacillin, rifampicin, and gentamicin. Based on the equivocal abdominal ultrasound result, microbiologists briefly advised treating with intravenous piperacillin\u2013tazobactam for suspected cholangitis.

    "original_text": "In August 1993, a then 45-year-old Indonesian female underwent a modified radical left mastectomy for T1N0M0 breast cancer. Her earlier history revealed keloid formation on shoulders and upper back, although she then denied significant previous traumas. Postoperatively, timed mammographies of the right breast were proposed according to the Guideline on Breast Cancer []. Approximately 1 month following the first mammography in November 1993, keloid tissue started to emerge around the nonoperated right breast, reflecting the position of the rigid breast compression paddle that was used for the mammography. Although she was worried that the lesions would progress, mammography screening was continued annually, indeed leading to worsening of the keloid formation.\nWhen she presented to our outpatient clinic in 2005, a physical examination revealed firm, hyperpigmented, smooth-surfaced lesions on both sides of the thorax (Fig. ). Remarkably, the scars following the mastectomy remained within the confines of the original surgical incision and had not expanded over time. Conversely, keloid formation on the right side was progressive reflecting the repetitive trauma associated with approximately 12 consecutive mammographies over a period of 12 years. As she was convinced of an association between the keloid formation and the mammographies, it was decided to abandon these radiographies. She declined serial MRIs. As a consequence, it was decided to limit oncological control to palpation.\nBecause of the patient's progressive emotional burden associated with the growing keloids she was referred to a dermatologist who advised calendula, Dermatix\u00ae silicone gel, and corticosteroid injections, but to no avail.

    "cleaned_text": "in august 1993, a then 45-year-old indonesian female underwent a modified radical left mastectomy for t1n0m0 breast cancer. her earlier history revealed keloid formation on shoulders and upper back, although she then denied significant previous traumas. postoperatively, timed mammographies of the right breast were proposed according to the guideline on breast cancer []. approximately 1 month following the first mammography in november 1993, keloid tissue started to emerge around the nonoperated right breast, reflecting the position of the rigid breast compression paddle that was used for the mammography. although she was worried that the lesions would progress, mammography screening was continued annually, indeed leading to worsening of the keloid formation.\nwhen she presented to our outpatient clinic in 2005, a physical examination revealed firm, hyperpigmented, smooth-surfaced lesions on both sides of the thorax (fig. ). remarkably, the scars following the mastectomy remained within the confines of the original surgical incision and had not expanded over time. conversely, keloid formation on the right side was progressive reflecting the repetitive trauma associated with approximately 12 consecutive mammographies over a period of 12 years. as she was convinced of an association between the keloid formation and the mammographies, it was decided to abandon these radiographies. she declined serial mris. as a consequence, it was decided to limit oncological control to palpation.\nbecause of the patient's progressive emotional burden associated with the growing keloids she was referred to a dermatologist who advised calendula, dermatix\u00ae silicone gel, and corticosteroid injections, but to no avail. she was advised to seek consultation of a plastic surgeon, but she dismissed this option because of fear for invasive therapy as well as doubts on the success rates of therapies.\nin 2018, she again visited our surgical department outpatient clinic as keloids had progressed even more over time. on inspection, strands of keloid tissue expanded from the right breast to the",

He was discharged on augmentin for possible pneumonia as there was a questionable retrocardiac infiltrate on chest X-ray. Three days later, he presented in the ED with complaints of acute dyspnea in addition to fever, cough, and fatigue for one month. His initial vitals were blood pressure 127/54 mmHg, pulse rate 77 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, temperature 100.3\u00b0C, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. He was alert and oriented and physical examination was significant for an unexplained murmur. He was admitted on medical floors; lab workup was sent including blood cultures and urine cultures. The infectious disease department was consulted for fever of unknown origin and augmentin was discontinued. The initial differential diagnosis included endocarditis, occult malignancy, and recurrent pulmonary emboli (patient's son recently sustained a pulmonary embolism). On day two of admission, 1/2 sets of blood cultures were positive for Enterococcus faecalis, then two more subsequent sets were positive.

This shortness of breath was worse on exertion, was associated with tiredness, dry intermittent cough several times a day lasting for a few minutes, and an increase in her baseline abdominal distension. The dyspnea had no relation to changes in her position, did not wake her up from sleep, and further denied any day time somnolence or snoring at night.

Because of her persisting pain non-responding to conservative treatment, she was scheduled for a resurfacing shoulder prosthesis on the right side. Standard antibiotic prophylaxis of three gifts of 1 g cefazoline in 24 h was used. A deltopectoral approach was used during surgery and the rotator cuff was intact.

A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained without chest pain in the patient showed normal sinus rhythm at 63 beats/minute without Q waves and with a normal QRS width (Figure ). The echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction without regional motion abnormalities. The patient was referred for exercise testing using a standard Bruce protocol. The test was stopped at minute 10 of the protocol because the patient was experiencing fatigue, had an increasing heart rate of 148 beats/minute (87% of maximal predicted heart rate), had maximal blood pressure of 183/98 mmHg, and had a workload of 12.8 metabolic equivalents without clinical symptoms or ECG abnormalities.

For one year prior to being admitted, the patient had observed a defecation frequency that had increased from once per day to six-seven times per day without precipitating causes and accompanied by stool reduction. The stool was yellow, but retained its shaped. The patient had no history of a frequent/urgent requirement to urinate, gross hematuria or abdominal pain. The prostate could not be palpated clearly when performing the physical examination, though a huge mass was identified behind the prostate during the rectal examination. The mass was medium-hard without unusual palpable nodules and tenderness. The other physical examinations were normal. Ultrasonography revealed that the boundary of the prostate was unclear and that it was 39\u00d725\u00d723 mm in size. A thick-walled inhomogenous hypoechoic cystic mass (76\u00d777\u00d774 mm), in which the thickness of the cyst wall was uneven, was detected posterior to the prostate. The level of blood prostate specific antigen (PSA) was normal, while the pelvic CT () revealed that the diameters of the mass were 77 mm from top to bottom and 76 mm from right to left.

With respect to sleep, there were reports of difficulties going to sleep, waking up two to three times per night to drink water, getting up to go to the bathroom, open mouth breathing while asleep (), snoring during sleep, and sweating more than usual during sleep. She experienced wheezing that was associated with asthma, which was treated with an Albuterol sulfate inhaler. There were reports of difficulty with effective chewing. In addition, the patient would eat around 50% of her meals, before refusing the rest. She experienced chronic cough and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections.\nPhysical examination () of the patient showed her to be well developed, well nourished, and to appear the stated age. The patient was alert, oriented, able to communicate, and respond appropriately to questions. During the nasal examination, the nose had no external deformity. The nasal septum was straight, and the inferior turbinates were grade 2 bilaterally. There were class 3 dental occlusion and a class 3 facial-skeletal relationship characteristic of anterior-posterior maxillary deficiency. Oropharyngeal examination showed grade 3 modified Mallampati tongue position and grade 2 tonsils.

    "original_text": "A 65-year-old male presented with a three-week history of progressively worsening abdominal distension. He denied any abdominal pain but stated that he noticed an increased frequency of bowel movements. His past medical history was unremarkable. On examination, he was afebrile and had a hugely distended abdomen with an immobile, nontender mass occupying all four quadrants of the abdomen. Computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a large, heterogeneous lobulated mass occupying most of the abdomen (Figure ). The peripheral component appeared lipomatous and the margins of this component were difficult to estimate accurately. There was also a heterogeneous nonlipomatous component that contained areas of lesser density, as well as a central stellate region of calcifications. The preoperative differential diagnosis included a retroperitoneal sarcoma (especially dedifferentiated liposarcoma), desmoid tumor, undifferentiated carcinoma, carcinoid or sclerosing mesenteritis; lymphoma was also considered.\nWhile neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation comprise a frequent approach for retroperitoneal sarcomas at our institution, the extent of the tumor made this approach unfeasible. Resection was therefore planned unless an intraoperative biopsy revealed lymphoma. Resection was accomplished through a T-type incision (Figure ), and entailed removal of the right kidney, terminal ileum, ascending colon, sigmoid colon and the left spermatic cord structures, all of which were intimately attached to the mass. Encasement of the external iliac artery and vein was also encountered near the end of the procedure.

Surgical intervention revealed stage T4N2M1 tumor, which involved all layers of the colorectum, showed peritoneal dissemination, and metastasized to the ovaries. Complete cytoreduction was achieved by sigmoid resection, extended lymph node dissection, hysterectomy with adnexectomy, and parietal subtotal peritoneumectomy. The molecular analysis revealed that the tumor contained KRAS G12D mutation. The anatomic involvement of the ovaries suggested that the patient may have a concurrent ovarian cancer. However, the pathological report and the KRAS mutation analysis confirmed the gastrointestinal origin and the identical KRAS status for all tumor lumps. Therefore, the diagnosis of multiple primary carcinoma (i.e., the combination of CRC and ovarian cancer) was considered highly unlikely and the woman was managed as a CRC patient. The FOLFOX adjuvant therapy was given for 6 cycles. Starting from June 2018, the patient went on to observation. The disease relapse was revealed in November 2018: there was a metastatic spread in the lungs and peritoneum accompanied by ascites.

The patient had no known risk factors for head and neck malignancies. There was no family history of thyroid or other malignancies and no history of childhood radiation. Examination revealed a 2 cm right parotid mass with associated cervical lymphadenopathy. Workup for autoimmune disease revealed CBC, ESR, ANA, and immunoglobulin tests to be within normal limits with no immunophenotypic evidence of ALPS. CT demonstrated enlarged right intraparotid and cervical lymph nodes. Ultrasound-guided biopsy of the parotid mass revealed a reactive lymphoid process. Excisional biopsy of the multiple cervical lymph nodes revealed florid follicular lymphoid hyperplasia with few follicles demonstrating infiltration of the germinal center by small mature mantle zone lymphocytes consistent with a pathologic diagnosis of PTGC. Due to the potential association with NLPHL, PET/CT was performed, and increased uptake was noted in the right parotid, bilateral jugulodigastric chains, right supraclavicular region, right axilla, peripancreatic region, and bilateral inguinal regions (). Additional excisional biopsy of a particularly high FDG uptake supraclavicular lymph node revealed PTGC without any evidence of malignancy (). The patient was followed up clinically and the lymphadenopathy remained stable for two years. Incidentally, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician for thyroid abnormalities after developing unexpected weight gain and fatigue. Laboratory workup was negative for hypothyroidism. Thyroid ultrasound demonstrated an isolated left thyroid nodule and subsequent FNA was suggestive of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection was performed. Despite the presence of persistent bilateral jugulodigastric lymphadenopathy, the lateral necks were not addressed surgically.

Gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an elevated mucosal lesion with linear ulceration in the anterior wall of the gastric antrum, located very close to the pylorus (Fig. a). A definitive diagnosis could not be obtained, even with an incisional biopsy. She was referred to our hospital for further investigation and treatment.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history and family history were noncontributory. Laboratory evaluation, including tumor marker levels, showed results within the normal range except for the presence of anemia. Endoscopic ultrasonography showed a heterogeneous echoic tumor in the submucosal layer not involving the muscularis propria (Fig. ). Computed tomography (CT) showed a nodular soft tissue mass in the gastric antrum, with no apparent metastatic lesions. There was no significant uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose into the tumor on a positron emission tomography/CT scan (Fig. , ).\nThe results were inconclusive for excluding malignant potential of the tumor. Additionally, resection with ESD technique was difficult to perform, given the high risk of perforation during the procedure. Under the presumption that the tumor was a GIST, schwannoma, or other types of submucosal tumors, we sought to achieve a definitive diagnosis by radical resection for total biopsy with minimal margins. Among the various surgical procedures, we chose LECS, with more than usual caution on the prevention of gastric juice leakage into the intraperitoneal cavity (Fig. , ). LECS was performed as described by Hiki et al. []. Briefly, it is executed in three main parts. First, the endoscopist marks the smallest negative margin around the tumor using the ESD technique.

[]. briefly, it is executed in three main parts. first, the endoscopist marks the smallest negative margin around the tumor using the esd technique. second, the submucosal incision is extended toward the serosa passing through the muscularis propria, resulting in a small artificial perforation. finally, a surgeon resects the tumor laparoscopically with the guidance of the endoscope and surgical marks. the defect in the gastric wall is then closed either with the continuous hand-sew",

Progressive pain developed in our case one month after orthopedic surgery on her forearm. She suffered a consistent severe stabbing and shooting pain, hyperalgesia, and allodynia with cramping and numbness in her right upper limb which interfered with her sleep. On physical examination, severe intractable pain, allodynia, hyperalgesia, skin temperature and color asymmetry, edema, and trophic changes in the nails of the right upper limb were identified. Full flexion, extension, and abduction at the right shoulder, elbow, and wrist were restricted. Neurological examination was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging, X-ray, laboratory blood tests, and work-up identified no pathology, thus supporting the diagnosis of CRPS. Thrombosis was ruled out through a color Doppler ultrasound. A nerve conduction study showed no significant difference between the right and left upper limbs. The patient's pain score was 10 out of 10 on the numerical rating scale (NRS), where 0 is the total absence of pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable. Her quality of life had clearly deteriorated. CRPS type 1 was diagnosed according to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) criteria. The patient took tramadol HCL 100 mg, celecoxib 200 mg, pregabalin 75 mg, and amitriptyline 25 mg, but they had no effect. She received a stellate ganglion block (SGB) with 2 ml bupivacaine HCL 0.5% and 2 ml of lidocaine 2% and reported a significant decrease in pain (NRS improved from 10 to 3) for 6 days after block.

She was seen on May 2011 for the first time by a neurologist with a 3-month history of dull holocephalic headache who ordered a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diagnosed a tension-type headache and a depressive disorder. Treatment with an antidepressant (duloxetine) was started. The patient experienced no improvement and a second examination by another neurologist was undertaken 2 months later. Again no focal neurological signs could be detected. Due to the weight loss, an occult neoplasm was suspected but not detected during an extensive inpatient investigation at a medical department during February 2012; however, the MRI showed bilateral white matter lesions (WML) and an old lacunar lesion located at the left striatum, the latter was not seen in the previous MRI from May 2011. Since the patient also suffered from mild hypertension, vascular encephalopathy was thought to be the cause of the progressive cognitive decline. Extensive neurocognitive testing was carried out in a rehabilitation centre in May 2012 and disclosed a severe decline of attention, memory and executive functions corresponding to subcortical dementia (Fig. ). When the patient was seen for a further diagnostic work-up at the SMZ-Ost-Donauspital in July 2012, the weight was 47\u202fkg and a weight loss of 20\u202fkg was reported over the past year. The gait was insecure with postural instability and with a tendency to fall when turning around. Frontal signs were positive, the voice was quiet, the tonus was mildly elevated and showed a slight hesitancy (\u201cGegenhalten\u201d), tendon reflexes were brisk, paresis and pyramidal signs missing.

His lower back pain had been treated with caudal blocks for the last 3 years. A lumbar spine radiograph revealed degenerative scoliosis and narrowing of multiple intervertebral disc spaces. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan demonstrated marked lumbar 3-4 (L3-4) intervertebral disc extrusion, lumbar spinal stenosis, and an L3 compression fracture. He was treated with one L3-4 epidural block, medial branch blocks, and received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. His radicular pain and claudication improved, but he complained of low back pain consistently. Therefore, a transforaminal epidural block and percutaneous epidural neuroplasty were performed. After the treatments, all symptoms improved, and only mild lower back pain which increased with walking remained. However, 2 weeks later, he was hospitalized for left leg paralysis and excruciating lower back pain that did not diminish when laying down. MRI was repeated, which identified aggravated L3-4 disc extrusion and a dilatated abdominal aortic aneurysm of nearly 6.0 cm (). Careful review of the previous MR images identified a curvilinear atherosclerotic (calcified) lateral wall of an abdominal aortic aneurysm and fusiform aneurysmal dilation of the abdominal aorta anterior to the vertebral body (). The patient was referred to the neurosurgery department of our hospital for further examination and treatment for the disc extrusion and abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nHe presented to our hospital with intractable lower back pain and pitting edema of both lower extremities.

The intra-oral examination showed a complete set of permanent teeth in the left maxillary area up to the second molars but on the right side, the primary canine was firmly retained. However, its permanent counterpart was not visible intra-orally. There was neither a canine bulge nor a cortical expansion of the maxilla. The mandibular arch had a full complement of permanent teeth up to the first molars except the mandibular second primary molars which were near exfoliation.\nAn orthopantomograph revealed a supernumerary tooth-like structure between the roots of permanent maxillary right lateral incisor and primary maxillary right canine. It was enclosed in a unilocular cystic space, which had caused divergence of the roots of these teeth (). In addition, there was an overlying impacted, mesially rotated permanent right canine. Radiologically, the lesion resembled a compound odontoma or a dentigerous cyst.\nThe over-retained primary canine was extracted. The embedded tooth-like structure was surgically enucleated along with its cyst-like lining (). It had a conical crown and a short root with a closed apex. It was then sent for histopathological examination.

Histopathology () showed the morphologic features of SCLC including small to medium size cells, high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, salt and pepper chromatin with inconspicuous nucleoli, nuclear molding, and high mitotic activity. Immunostaining showed that the tumor cells expressed synaptophysin and chromogranin and discontinuous cytokeratin markers. TTF-1 was also positive. Imaging was performed with PET/CT showing a 5 cm right hilar mass and right paratracheal lymphadenopathy and no disease elsewhere including a negative brain MRI.\nThus, he was deemed to have limited stage disease and was treated accordingly with cisplatin and etoposide and concurrent radiation therapy (). He achieved a complete response after 6 cycles of chemotherapy and subsequently underwent prophylactic cranial irradiation. He was monitored clinically and by imaging every 3 months. In May 2009, the disease relapsed with left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy and was confirmed by excisional biopsy. He underwent radiation therapy with concurrent cisplatin and etoposide for 2 cycles followed by 4 cycles of oral topotecan. He had complete response again that lasted for one year. In September 2010, he had a relapse presenting with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. After another 5 cycles of cisplatin and etoposide, he had near complete response, and he was monitored clinically. After progression in September 2011 with increased hypermetabolic activity in the right hilum and paratracheal lymph nodes, he was started on carboplatin and etoposide. He had good response after 4 cycles and was switched to oral etoposide. He again progressed with increased metabolic activity in the right hilar and paratracheal region.\nAt this time, genomic profiling of his prior tumor biopsy was undertaken. This showed that his tumor harbored a novel JAZF1-MYCL1 gene fusion but lacked alterations in TP53 and RB1. This was performed in a CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited commercial laboratory.
