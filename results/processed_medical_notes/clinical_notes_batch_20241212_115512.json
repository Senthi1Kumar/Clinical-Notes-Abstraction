The vomiting often occurred at night, 2 to 3 times a week. When she was 8 months old the vomiting increased to 2 to 3 times a day, with larger portion of the vomitus containing bile. No evidence of blood in the vomitus or abdominal distension was noted. GI radiography was performed at a local hospital, and obstructions were seen at the third and forth portion of the duodenum. Three surgeries were performed at the local hospital including a Ladd operation and duodeno-duodenostomy; however, her symptoms were not alleviated after these procedures. Hence, she underwent a further exploratory operation at the local hospital, and an obstruction which has the appearance of a diaphragm at the third portion of the duodenum was noted, along with severe adhesions. A proximal duodenostomy, resection of the septum, and enterolysis was performed, and a jejunal nutrition tube was placed. Unfortunately, her symptoms worsened after surgery. She was then admitted to our institution, and reexamination of the GI radiographic studies indicated that there was still an obstruction at the duodenum.Surgical exploration at our hospital revealed significant dilation of the second portion of the duodenum, while the distal intestines were saggy and flat. The third portion of the duodenum was adhered in a U-shape. After releasing the adhesions, a diverticulum was visible at the lateral margin of the mesentery. We removed the duodenum drainage catheter to inject air and extrude the air towards the distal end, and air was noted to pass through.

She had had a cholecystectomy 30 years ago; later on, without significant illness in medical history, she was a teetotaler and she smoked 2 cigarettes per day during 10 years but stopped completely during the 6 last months. Routine blood tests were in the normal range. Abdominal ultrasound did not visualize the pancreas well due to bloating. A CAT scan was performed, finding multiple calcifications and irregularly dilated main pancreatic duct, predominantly in the pancreatic head (Figures and ), where the dilatation had some cystic aspect and was disproportionally more pronounced than in the pancreatic body and tail. The same alterations were confirmed by MRI (Figures and ), without intramural nodules in the dilated main duct. Based on the two imaging methods, we could not distinguish between chronic calcifying pancreatitis and mucin-producing neoplasia, that is, main duct IPMN. ERCP was performed, and contrast injection revealed a cystic dilation of main pancreatic duct in the head (). The duct of Wirsung was less dilated in the body. Through pancreatic papillotomy, typical whitish pancreatic stone passed into the duodenal lumen (). However, after having continued the contrast injection, mucin passage was seen producing the typical fish eye appearance in the major and also the minor papilla (Figures and ). Simultaneous existence of CP with pancreatic stones and main duct IPMN was our final diagnosis. Given the high probability of malignancy in the dominant cystic lesion, surgery was decided and performed. Surgery revealed a cystic tumor that was found in a fibrotic pancreas. Pancreatoduodenectomy was performed with preservation of pylorus and pancreaticogastrostomy. Some whitish pancreatic stones were extracted. No lymph node metastasis was seen. Histological () findings confirmed the existence of a mucinous tumor emerging from the main pancreatic duct, with multiple foci of high grade dysplasia and even with evident transformation into an infiltrative malignant lesion ().

Pathology of the tumor was reviewed and confirmed to be poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor histology was most consistent with thymic origin; however, metastasis of other sources, such as lung, could not be ruled out.

During the operation, the tumor was found to invade the sternum and bilaterally encase both the phrenic nerves. In attempts to see if the phrenic nerves could be freed without injury, the pericardial sac was opened and the right phrenic nerve was followed.

The man was placed in a soft cervical collar and transferred to the local emergency center. No neurologic complication was noted upon admission. The cervical spine radiograph and computed tomographic scan demonstrated a type II odontoid fracture that was displaced 2 mm anteriorly. The skull traction with 3 kg was applied immediately for cervical reduction. Once the displacement was reduced, a percutaneous anterior odontoid screw fixation was made in local hospital after he signed the informed consent form. The postoperative radiograph and CT were taken immediately, and both of them demonstrated an iatrogenic distraction of the odontoid fracture with a gap of 6 mm (Fig. ). The patient was fitted with a soft collar for 6 weeks, and the follow-up radiograph did not show any sign of bone union. After the distraction and no sign of bone union, the patient was referred to our spinal unit where the decision was made to attempt the anterior endoscopically assisted bone grafting for the distraction of the odontoid.\nThe anterior endoscopic approach to C1 to C2 was similar to the approach we previously reported in the microendoscopic anterior approach for irreducible atlantoaxial dislocation.[ The patient was placed in supine position on a radiolucent table, and a nasal intubation was performed under local anesthesia when the patient was still awake.

After injury, he did not received any evaluation or treatment, but he felt a snapping of the ulnar side of the wrist in forearm rotation and dorsal side of the long finger MP joint in MP flexion. At that time, the symptoms improved spontaneously after several weeks without specific treatment, three months earlier, after heavy lifting, he had persistent symptoms despite the conservative treatment including short arm splint for 4 weeks. A physical examination revealed painful ECU dislocation in forearm rotation and painful extensor tendon subluxation at the long finger MP joint in MP flexion. He showed generalized ligament laxity according to the Beighton and Horan criteria but did not have any symptoms in the contralateral hand.\nPlane radiography did not reveal any fracture or abnormality. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed to confirm the subluxation and identification of the associated pathology. In dynamic ultrasonography, the sagittal band (SB) was subluxated ulnarly as the long finger MP joint was flexed more than 70\u00b0. In addition, the ECU was subluxated volarly in forearm supination with tendon attrition at the level of the ulnar styloid process where the ECU groove exists. MRI revealed longitudinal splitting approximately 5 cm at the level of the ulnocarpal joint and dislocation of volar half slip of the ECU tendon on T2 axial plane image ().\nThe patient had been in military service. He required surgical treatment for rapid return to his previous work. Therefore, surgical treatment was performed.\nWith the patient under general anesthesia, the long finger MP dorsum was approached longitudinally.

There was a progressive increase in its size. Initially, he had been able to reduce the mass, but now it had become irreducible. His history revealed no symptoms of bowel obstruction.\nOn examination, he looked comfortable with normal vital signs and no signs of distress. On palpation, a large mass was found in the left inguinal region extending to the left scrotum, about 10 cm in diameter. Cough impulse was present; the transillumination test was negative; and the mass could not be reduced.\nAs the presentation was not typical for an incarcerated hernia, further investigations were done. An ultrasound examination of the area revealed normal testes with no hydrocele; it also showed that the mass had increased vascularity most likely representing omentum.\nThe patient was prepared for surgery and taken to the operating room where the left inguinal canal was explored. The content of the hernia could not be reduced, so the hernia sac was opened and a piece of omentum was seen extending from the internal ring to the scrotum. The incision was then extended into the scrotum and a large encapsulated mass was encountered attached to the omentum []. The mass was easily delivered out of the scrotum as it was not attached to the scrotum or the testes and it was completely excised along with a small piece of omentum to get a clear margin. The hernia was then repaired using a prolene mesh.

    "original_text": "We present a case report and a surgical video of a 42-year-old woman with perineal hernia. The manuscript has been written according to CARE guidelines. This patient presented with stage IIA squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, initially treated by radiotherapy, chemotherapy and brachytherapy in December 2013. Surgery consisted of laparoscopic total hysterectomy and ovariectomy, together with pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Early left paravaginal recurrence occurred in 2015 and was treated by resection of the left Bartholin gland. Another course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy was administered due to positive surgical margins (R1) of this resection. The patient presented another recurrence of her cervical carcinoma in February 2017 confirmed by pelvic CT scan and MRI. Due to the presence of a suspicious rectovaginal node, abdominoperineal resection with terminal colostomy was performed via a laparoscopic and perineal approach. We performed laparoscopic dissection of the left and right pararectal space to prepare an extralevator abdominoperineal excision and partial posterior colpectomy. We then performed radical posterior vulvectomy and a perianal incision at the lateral margin of the external anal sphincter and continued the dissection into the ischioanal fossa as far as the insertion of the pelvic floor muscles. We repaired the perineal defect and performed reconstruction of the posterior part of the vagina with an omental flap to preserve sexual function. After another course of chemotherapy and cycles of bevacizumab, the patient presented with her third recurrence two years later.

    "original_text": "A 53-year-old man presented with transient acute onset of left-sided numbness and speech disturbance one week prior to admission. These symptoms lasted for only several minutes and spontaneously resolved. Transient ischemic attack or acute cerebral infarction were possible diagnoses, so MRI and MR angiography were performed, showing an occlusion of his right MCA at the proximal M1 segment without any acute ischemic lesion or infracted area on MRI, including diffusion-weighted images. The next day, a conventional angiogram was taken and revealed a tapered occlusion at proximal M1 segment of right MCA, collateral pathways through perforating arteries, rich pial collateralization from distal anterior cerebral artery, and a shift of the watershed zone (). These findings were compatible with the long-standing stage of the occlusion of MCA rather than the acute occlusion. He also has an incidental saccular aneurysm at left posterior communicating artery (P-com) origin.

    "original_text": "This patient is a 68-year-old female, known case of hypertension for the last eight years, presented to us with complaints of anterior neck swelling for about 40 years which had gradually started increasing in size for the last four years. She developed progressive difficulty in swallowing and breathing for the last three months. On examination, there was a presence of large neck swelling, multinodular, which moved on deglutition, with lower limit of swelling not palpable. Prominent dilated veins were appreciated on the neck. A computed tomography scan was done which showed enlarged thyroid with multiple internal calcifications and retrosternal extension up to the level of ascending aorta with multiple collateral vascular channels around mass lesion in anterior mediastinum (). She also underwent total thyroidectomy, sternotomy, and excision of mass lesion. The intraoperative findings were enlarged multinodular goiter with thyroid gland reaching the manubrium. The mediastinal component was also large and separately capsulated from cervical component, extending up to the arch of aorta and superior vena cava with compression of brachiocephalic vein (). The mass was carefully dissected from the above vessels. Specimen was sent for histopathology. Postoperatively, the patient remained well. She was given intravenous analgesia and deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. She developed respiratory distress on 2nd post-op day, and a chest X-ray showed elevation of the right hemidiaphragm (most likely due to iatrogenic right phrenic nerve injury) and right lower lobe atelectasis and hence was shifted to the intensive care unit for observation. She was managed conservatively with chest physiotherapy, nebulizers, and application of BIPAP. She responded to supportive therapy and recovered well.

Range of motion in the left knee joint was \u22125\u00b0 extension to 135\u00b0 flexion. An anteroposterior radiograph of the left knee showed degenerative joint changes.

For these reasons, we decided that extension corrective osteotomy was necessary. We performed a preoperative simulation using a three-dimensional (3D) model with 3D image-processing software.

During her hospitalization, she progressed to respiratory failure and found to have disseminated histoplasmosis. After failed attempts at extubation, the patient underwent an open tracheostomy. She was discharged to a long-term acute care facility (LTAC).\nThe patient developed bright red blood per rectum during her stay at the LTAC without evidence of bleeding at the tracheostomy. Her hemoglobin level was 4.5 mg/dL; a blood transfusion was initiated at the facility and she was transferred to the local community hospital's intensive care unit (ICU). During routine morning patient care, the nursing staff noticed minor non-pulsatile bleeding around the tracheostomy and immediately alerted the ICU physician team. On initial inspection, there was no noted bleeding of the exterior surfaces while the patient was positioned with the head of the bed at 30 degrees. Bleeding recurred when the patient was placed back into the supine position, prompting urgent surgical consultation.\nThe surgical team and the ICU team proceed to evaluate for bleeding sources. A flexible fiberoptic scope was used to investigate the upper airway and no bleeding was seen from her nasopharynx or oropharynx. The tracheostomy was also evaluated and no bleeding was seen distal or proximal to the tracheostomy site, while the tracheostomy cuff was deflated. Due to the recurrence and unidentifiable source of bleeding, surgical evaluation and management were needed. While prepping the patient, pulsatile bleeding was observed from the tracheostomy. The patient started to develop hemodynamic instability and surgical management deemed necessary. Interventional radiology was not considered at this time because the service was not immediately available on site.

He had epigastric pain since midnight of the day of visit, and vomited blood five to six times an hour after the onset. Upper endoscopy performed after the visit revealed that an ulcer was formed on a submucosal tumor-like lesion (Fig. ). He bled from the ulcer, and the bleeding was stopped using thrombin. Upper endoscopy on the next day showed that the bleeding from the ulcer was stopped. However, he was suspected to have penetration into a hollow viscus after the removal of clots (Fig. ). We performed computed tomography (CT) scan analysis to identify the hollow viscus. The CT result revealed the accumulation of fluid around the pancreas and penetration of pancreatic cyst into the stomach (Fig. ). Blood test performed on the same day indicated that the serum amylase level was 164 U/L, which is higher than normal level. Considering the CT image finding, the patient was diagnosed as gastric penetration caused by acute pancreatitis episode in chronic pancreatitis. We considered surgery, but we decided that we can take a wait-and-see approach, since hemostasis was confirmed on the upper endoscopy.

Over time her symptoms increased in frequency and severity often requiring hospitalization. A chronic treatment with NSAIDs and exposure of lower legs to cold compresses were provided resulting in an improvement of symptoms.

She was assessed one year after injury and reported diffuse hand and wrist pain. She was unable to make a complete fist on the right, and there was loss of joint extension. In particular, the 5th digit was contracted at the interphalangeal joints; the hand was not uniformly swollen. The digits were all flexed at rest.

Four days after this visit, she was involved in an accident and sustained a left wrist fracture of the distal radius and ulna. She required open reduction internal fixation and underwent a bone scan several weeks after the second fracture. The right side, the older fracture, showed no significant periarticular uptake. In contrast, on the newly fractured left hand, there was diffuse hyperemia in the left wrist, distal forearm, and fingers, as well as uptake at the left sided ribs in the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 10th ribs, consistent with fractures. On the newly fractured left arm, she had developed swelling in the digits and capsular restrictions. The 5th digit was difficult to extend. There was an obvious deformity in the left wrist.

Her followup was interrupted due to her moving between two different parts of the country and between several hospitals.\nShe was seen at our institution in September 2007 for small bowel obstruction that required abdominal exploration, lyses of adhesions, and small bowel resection with primary anastomosis. Final pathology revealed no carcinoma. Later that year she had progression of her pulmonary metastasis and was started on additional chemotherapy. In February 2008, she developed a small right-sided extraperitoneal bladder perforation with a possible small colovesical fistula. At this time she denied any trauma, recent surgery, pneumaturia, or fecaluria. Cystoscopy and biopsy were negative. Her fistula was managed with catheter drainage alone and at 3 months a cystogram showed complete healing.\nOn this hospital admission at initial evaluation, given her active hematuria and pelvic mass she was taken to the operating room for cystoscopy, possible transurethral resection of tumor, control of bleeding, and possible removal of retained stent. Given the length of time the stent was indwelling, the stent was likely encrusted and would require more invasive maneuvers to remove. Given that her main problem was hematuria from an apparent pelvic mass, the likely encrusted and retained stent was a secondary objective at the time of surgery.\nOn cystoscopic exam, her bladder showed no lesions or tumors. There was an old patch of scar on the right bladder wall consistent with the known area of bladder perforation. There was no active bleeding present",

On further questioning, she informed us that she had presented to this hospital with a 2-week history of abdominal pain, confined to the right lower abdomen. She complained of general ill health and occasional altered bowel habits for 6 months prior to this acute episode.\nAn enquiry with the doctors who had initially seen her revealed that at the time of presentation for acute appendicitis she was quite unwell with fever, tachycardia, and dehydration. Her abdomen was tender all over with guarding, more pronounced over the right lower half. Her white cell count was 24 \u00d7 109/L. An X-ray of her abdomen showed a few fluid levels and an ultrasound scan revealed free fluid in the abdomen with an associated right iliac fossa mass.\nA diagnosis of pelvic peritonitis secondary to acute appendicitis was made by the physicians, and she was taken up for surgery after adequate resuscitation. The abdomen was approached through a right McBurney's incision. There was pus in the abdomen with an appendicular mass, and the appendix appeared oedematous, thickened, and congested. An appendicectomy was carried out followed by a thorough irrigation of the abdominal cavity. The abdomen was closed after placing a drain, which was removed on the 3rd post-operative day. In spite of antibiotic administration, she developed a wound infection and persistent pyrexia. She was managed conservatively with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medication and eventually improved, except for a persistent purulent discharge from the wound.

He stated that the swelling was initially small, but gradually enlarged to cause spacing between teeth and noticeable facial asymmetry. This swelling was not associated with pain, paresthesia or pus discharge. History taking from his parents revealed recurrent fractures since the age of 4 years, brown pigmented patches over his trunk since birth, attainment of puberty at the age of 12 years and no similar features in other family members. There was no history of visual impairment, nasal stuffiness or hearing disability. He was a product of non consanguineous marriage, born full term with normal birth weight and milestones. Physical examination showed short stature in comparison to parents (height-142 cm), multiple deformities due to recurrent fractures, shortened right leg, limping and a large caf\u00e9 au lait macule over the back crossing the midline. Facial examination revealed frontal bossing, asymmetry on the right side, with an enlargement of the right malar and maxillary bone and chin button deviation towards the left side [Figures and ].

The labial and right buccal vestibules of the mandible were shallow due to the swelling. The mucosa over the swelling showed black patchy pigmentation and dilated superficial veins. The swelling was non tender and bony hard on palpation.

    "original_text": "A 72-year-old man presenting with groin pain irradiated to the thigh with a history of an intersubtrochanteric left hip fracture treated with a long dynamic condylar screw at another institution 8 years before being referred to us. Six years after the index operation the patient started with symptoms that were not able to respond to oral analgesics. Medical history included hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiac insufficiency, and renal insufficiency without requiring dialysis. Functional preoperative score was 6 points according to the D'Aubigne and Postel score []. Radiographs showed fracture consolidation in 10\u00b0 of varus in comparison with the anatomical femoral axis and 1.5 shortening of the left leg, with bone ingrowth along the distal 2/3 of the osteosynthesis plate (). We indicated a short-stemmed prosthesis in order to avoid plate removal. Removal of previously fixed metallic devices would have necessitated an extensive soft-tissue dissection and a long operation time, which might have increased the risk of cardiac complications as well as infection. Preoperative assessment in our hospital indicated an ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) class 4 []. The patient was classified as a grade C (other severe comorbidities) according to Charnley's classification []. Radiographic preoperative templating using various femoral component designs confirmed that the cannon of the plate would jeopardize implantation of standard-length components.

A giant mass in the right thoracic cavity was detected accidentally by X-ray in a routine preoperative screening process. Physical examination demonstrated some loss of breathing sounds in the right base. Subsequent thoracic computed tomography scan demonstrated a complex lesion (size 15.1 \u00d7 12.3 \u00d7 15.7 cm) occupying more than two-thirds of the thoracic cavity on the right side. The blood supply to the area of the lesion was from a systemic artery arising from the abdominal aorta, with venous drainage through the inferior pulmonary vein, suggesting an ILPS ( - ). She had no history of weight loss, pneumonia, hemoptysis and dyspnea. After careful consultation, a right temporal craniotomy for intracranial lesion was performed. The intracranial mass was completely excised and histopathological study revealed the tumor as cholesteatoma. The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful.\nThree months later, an open thoracic surgery for the intrathoracic lesion was performed under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, lesion appeared hypervascular, because of abundant systemic vascularization (). The massive lesion was compressing the right lung and there was no communication between the tracheobronchial tree and sequestered lesion. Based on the findings of 3D CT angiography, we explored the aberrant artery at the bottom of the chest and carefully ligated it with an absorbable silk suture. After the pulmonary ligament had been completely divided, the lower pulmonary vein was found to be widened. The lesion was adherent to adjacent pulmonary vein branches and was not easily dissected. To avoid major intraoperative blood loss, a right lower lobectomy was performed following resection of the sequestered lesion. Pathologic analysis showed a predominant fatty differentiation with fibroblastic, chondroid and osseous differentiation making the rest ( - ).

She had experienced daily intractable headaches since age 18 years. She also had chronic bilateral occipital neuralgia on the basis of the diagnostic criteria outlined in the second edition of The International Classification of Headache Disorders []. Her occipital neuralgia persisted for more than 15 days monthly and was distributed throughout the greater occipital nerves, beginning in the occipital region and radiating upward to the top of the head. When the occipital neuralgia occurred, her occipital area became very tender to palpation. Complete alleviation of her pain had been achieved for a limited time with diagnostic bilateral greater occipital nerve blocks.\nHer medical history included NF-1, which was first diagnosed in childhood. Several neurofibromas had been removed from her sacrum 10 years previously, as well as many from her upper extremities. She also had had problems with depression, anxiety, alcohol consumption, and smoking. She has been a housewife throughout her adult life. With regard to her family medical history, her mother had died at 68 years of age as a result of heart disease, and her father was alive at 72 years of age with a history of cancer. An older sister has rheumatoid arthritis but not NF-1.\nBefore her referral to our service, she had undergone extensive medical management with biofeedback training, physical therapy, massage, acupuncture, and pharmacological management with narcotic and non-narcotic pain medications. Her medications included sustained-release morphine (30 mg every 12 hours), hydrocodone and acetaminophen (10 mg and 325 mg, respectively, every four to six hours), and pregabaline (75 mg every eight hours).

He complained of nausea and had dark urine as well as jaundice. His medical history revealed a cholecystectomy 33 years earlier. Fifteen year before the current presentation he was diagnosed with stones in the common bile duct for which he underwent ERC, papillotomy, and stone extraction. He was without complaints until the current presentation. Laboratory results were consistent with cholestasis (Table ). Ultrasound imaging showed dilated intra- and extrahepatic ducts with the suggestion of stones in the common bile duct. Aerobilia was present, and sludge was seen in the hilar region. The patient was treated for ascending cholangitis with fluid resuscitation and intravenous antibiotics. An ERC was performed. The previous papillotomy was not visible anymore, hence a new one was done. Many stones were extracted from the common bile duct.\nThe patient recovered well. However, 3 months later he experienced recurrent complaints. Ultrasound showed retained stones in the common bile duct. In two ERC sessions all these stones were removed. Contrast cholangiography showed complete clearance of the bile ducts.\nOver the next 4 months the patient experienced four episodes of chills with a temperature of 38\u201339\u00b0C and right upper abdominal complaints without colics. The laboratory findings during these episodes are shown Table . Repeated ultrasound investigations showed no abnormalities. The bile ducts were normal. On each occasion the patient received antibiotics, with excellent clinical response. Blood cultures remained negative.\nRenewed medical history revealed that the patients had done heavy lifting work, such as moving furniture, the day before each of the four episodes.

His past medical history also included coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease and a cerebral vascular accident. In the trauma bay, he reported left chest and left upper quadrant abdominal pain. On physical examination he was hemodynamically stable but tender to palpation over the left ninth and tenth ribs along the mid-axillary line. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast demonstrated a large expanding left lateral chest wall hematoma, which appeared to be dissecting into the abdominal wall and peritoneum. Active contrast extravasation originating from an intercostal artery (Fig. ) was associated with intraperitoneal blood in the perisplenic region and left paracolic gutter (Fig. ). A selective angiogram of multiple left intercostal arteries and the deep circumflex iliac branch of the left external iliac artery did not show any active contrast extravasation. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and administered idarucizumab (praxbind) for reversal of his anticoagulation. Eight hours later, he developed worsening abdominal pain and became hemodynamically unstable with a systolic blood pressure of 80 mmHg. An exploratory laparotomy was then performed through a left subcostal incision. Upon entry into the peritoneal cavity 500 ml of clot was evacuated. A significant hematoma in the lateral abdominal wall just under the lower ribs had caused a tear in the peritoneum leading to the intraperitoneal blood. Active arterial bleeding could not be appreciated however a small amount of continuous bleeding from the left abdominal wall was controlled with suture plication.

    "original_text": "A 76-year-old male patient sought a maxillofacial surgeon because of difficulty in swallowing and in chewing, pain complaint, and an internal nodule hardened on the tongue. On visual and palpatory clinical examination, a free and well-defined rounded nodule was found, with the tongue showing normal color, but with an enlarged aspect in the central region (). In the initial clinical interview, the patient did not remember whether he had eaten anything that had hurt his tongue. To assist in the diagnosis and try to elucidate the fact, the patient was asked for a complementary ultrasound examination of the tongue. The ultrasound device was a linear matrix probe, with a frequency of 12 Mhz. In the result, it was possible to observe a 5 mm hyperechoic linear image with a 1.2 \u00d7 0.7cm granuloma formation. The lesion was located on the left lateral border of the distal third of the patient's tongue, 0.1 cm from the surface.\nThe echographic aspect suggested a foreign body inside, showing an image compatible with a spine, with granuloma formation (). On the patient's return, when asked about the possible spine on the tongue, he recalled that he had eaten pequi a while ago but that he was not sure exactly regarding the time, leading us to a more consistent diagnostic hypothesis of a foreign body granuloma caused by a pequi spine. Complete surgical enucleation of the lesion was then performed, with bilateral anesthetic block of the lingual nerve. Surgical access was performed through a linear incision in the lingual dorsum on the left side, close to the most superficial region of the lesion (). The lesion was divulsed, using blunt-tipped instruments, from the adjacent tissue planes, having been cleaved without the rupture of its evident lining capsule (). No vascular rupture with subsequent hemorrhagic accident occurred, despite the close proximity of the lesion with lingual arteries and veins. The visualization of these large lingual vessels was perceived by the surgeon during",

He reported that he \u201cthrew out his back\u201d while getting out of his truck, which led him to being unable to move the next day and required transportation by ambulance to a hospital for treatment. Upon arrival he reported receiving an oral steroid prescription and then being discharged home to rest for a few days. Over the next few weeks, he reported taking things easy and refraining from all of his previous exercise and activity. After two to three weeks, he reported that he began playing golf and resumed his prior resistance training program with full return to all normal activities within the next month. His complaints consisted of a tight achy pain in the right lower back with prolonged sitting, sleeping (slept on his side and/or back) and with playing golf. He stated that it was typically worse the day following exercise or activity. The patient reported that he can gain relief from the pain with stretching his lower back and taking a hot shower. He reported playing a full 18-hole round of golf two times per month and is at the driving range every other day. When he is at the range, he reported that he would hit both a large and small bucket each time (approximately 150 balls) with twenty of those consisting of chips and pitches. His current workout routine consisted of rotating through chest, back, arm, and leg workouts 2-3 times each week. Overall his past medical history is unremarkable, and he is not currently taking any medications to manage his pain. His goal with physical therapy was to play golf and resistance train without LBP. The patient was informed that the data concerning his case would be submitted for publication.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 61-year-old man. He had sustained a burst fracture of the axis in a traffic accident and had thereafter suffered from continued pain. We performed posterior spinal fusion from C1 to C4. The devices used for C1 fixation were a lateral mass screw and an infralaminar hook. The MPR-CT at 7 months postoperatively showed erosion in the occipital bone corresponding to the location of the proximal tip of the rod used with the C1 lateral mass screw (Figure ).\nThe conventional fixation device used for C1-C2 fusion was a wiring procedure described by Gallie (, ) McGraw & Rusch () and Brooks & Jenkins (). Subsequently, the Halifax clamp (Tucker ) hook system and the transarticular screw technique using the Magerl procedure (Magerl & Seeman ) have been introduced into practice. These procedures were indicated for various atlantoaxial disorders such as atlantoaxial instability and unstable fracture of the axis. With the intent of further improving fixation properties and eliminating the need for a concomitant structural bone graft, newer methods utilizing fixation of C1 with the lateral mass screw and hook system have been developed and are commonly used in our current clinical practice. Although the advent of these fixation systems has reduced surgery-related morbidity and improved surgical outcome, introduction of novel surgical systems may result in complications that have not been encountered with the conventional procedures. The postoperative complication of erosion in the occipital bone as presented in this paper has not previously been reported in the literature.\nThe risk of interference with the surrounding tissue using the conventional wiring technique for C1-C2 fusion can be minimal because the fixation construct is not bulky.
