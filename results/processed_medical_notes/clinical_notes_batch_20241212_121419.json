After the trauma, she found her elbow in a valgus position and repositioned the joint herself through flexed and internal rotation. She was admitted to the emergency center of our hospital because of right elbow pain and deformity. She presented with a flexed elbow and the hand placed on her abdomen. The neurologic examination revealed mild numbness in her 4-5th digits only. The radial pulse was palpable. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the elbow showed lateral convergent displacement of the radius and ulna relative to the humerus without fracture signs ().\nUpon diagnosis of lateral elbow dislocation, we attempted closed reduction under sedation with 15 mg pentazocine hydrochloride and 25 mg hydroxyzine hydrochloride i.m. as well as local anesthesia with 10 mg lidocaine.\nThe reduction maneuver was performed in the image intensifier room with the patient in the supine position. Initially, we attempted gentle longitudinal traction on the axis in the flexed position with an assistant holding the axilla as a countertraction while simultaneously checking lateral images of the elbow. After the first try was unsuccessful, we applied longitudinal traction on the axis in the stretched position while checking anteroposterior images of the elbow. The operator distracted her wrist distally and moved the dislocated proximal forearm medially. After this maneuver, we felt a click; however, the image intensifier revealed that the elbow joint was not reduced fully, and we suspected that only the ulnohumeral joint was reduced on the trochlea of the humerus (). The operator gently pushed the radial head with the elbow flexed and we heard a click to indicate full reduction. Postreduction radiographs were obtained without signs of fracture (). Though obvious varus and valgus instability of the joint was observed, redislocation was not observed in the range of motion from 30\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 (). Elbow arthrography",

She had (++) pretibial edema and (++) proteinuria was deteacted in urine analysis. Her medical history in the first trimester was associted with hyperemezis gravidarum needing hospital care. She had an appendectomy a year ago and therapy for PCOS with oral contraceptives before pregnancy. She had no signs of thyroid disorder. She had signs of hyperandrogenism on face. On admission, her vital signs were stable, blood pressure was 150/100 mm Hg, heart rate was 88 beats/minute, uterine contractions were 12 minutes apart with baseline level reaching 30 mm Hg on nonstress test. Laboratory data showed normal liver and renal function and normal coagulation parameters with a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dl, platelet level of 227,000, white blood cell count of 9500, and (++) proteinuria on urine analysis. In the light of these findings, our team decided to perform cesarean section due to nulliparous breech presentation and possible severe preeclampsia. A male baby, weighting 2620 g, with an Apgar score of 7 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes was delivered. Placental histology showed focal villous infarction and ischemic changes without infection or trophoblastic disease, and the histologic analysis of a biopsy sample from the ovarian tumor confirmed hypertrophic luteinized cells.

    "original_text": "Our patient was a 37-year-old Caucasian male who was initially diagnosed 12 years ago with a World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV oligodendroglioma of the right temporal lobe. He initially underwent resection and pathology was originally read as anaplastic oligodendroglioma. He was enrolled in RTOG 9402, a study which examined the effects of radiation alone versus pre-radiation chemotherapy for pure and mixed anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. However, on central review, pathology was reclassified as grade IV oligodendroglima and he was deemed ineligible for the study.

The patient had relapsed immunoglobulin G (IgG) kappa multiple myeloma with 17-p deletion. For treatment, the patient had received multiple chemotherapy regimens including two autologous stem cell transplants. She suffered from generalized bone pain with worsening lower back pain. PET-MR was performed on a hybrid scanner to evaluate the extent of metastatic disease including bone involvement.\nPET-MR fusion images showed unusual severely decreased radiotracer activity throughout the liver. The corresponding T1 images revealed generalized decreased MR signal in the liver parenchyma in relation to the paraspinal musculature signal intensity which is commonly seen with iron overload. When looking at the PET imaging, the attenuation-corrected images showed severely decreased uptake which was not present on the nonattenuation corrected images indicating an attenuation correction artifact. The mean standard uptake value (SUV) of the liver was 0.6 [].\nOn review of the Dixon T1 MR sequence used for attenuation correction, the out-of-phase sequence revealed normal moderate signal intensity in the liver parenchyma, but on the corresponding in-phase image, the liver demonstrated signal loss due to susceptibility artifact from excessive iron accumulation in the hepatic parenchyma. As a consequence, the generated mu maps for this patient expanded the boundary of the right lung instead of correctly assigning soft-tissue density to the liver parenchyma []. To confirm this, the coronal attenuation mu map was manually segmented by filling in the faulty liver reconstruction with soft-tissue density instead of lung tissue. The resulting attenuated corrected PET image showed the properly corrected liver parenchyma tracer activity with mean SUV 2.4 [].\nFive months after the initial FDG PET-MR scan, the patient returned for follow-up imaging.

Initial examination revealed a swollen and deformed forearm, ecchymosis over the elbow and midforearm, and a limited range of elbow movement. There was no distal neurovascular deficit. Radiographs showed a Bado type I Monteggia fracture-dislocation ().\nManipulation under general anaesthesia and percutaneous fixation of the ulna with a 2 mm titanium elastic nail was performed due to the unstable ulna diaphyseal fracture. An intraoperative decision by the senior author was made not to manipulate and reduce the displaced ulna fragment as it did not interfere with forearm rotation and the potential for remodelling in this six-year-old child (). A lightweight splint was applied with the elbow flexed at ninety degrees and the forearm in full supination. The patient was discharged home the following day, comfortable and with no neurovascular deficit.\nAt review on day ten, the patient complained of new pain over the volar aspect of the right forearm and paraesthesia in the right thumb and index finger. Clinical examination revealed resolving ecchymosis, sensory deficit in the median nerve distribution, and painful flexion of the wrist. Electromyography confirmed median nerve neuropathy, and magnetic resonance imaging of the right forearm showed contusion of the median nerve with the distal spike of the ulna fragment abutting the nerve.\nIt was decided to surgically explore the median nerve as the delayed development of pain and median nerve symptoms indicated progressing nerve compression. The median nerve was identified as it passed deep to the fibrous arch of the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle. It is accompanied by the ulna artery here.

The patient's medical history indicated no known diseases. Her laboratory values were abnormal. Upper abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed seven hypodense lesions in the liver parenchyma with regular contours; the lesions were initially thought to be haemangiomas, the largest of which measured 21 mm in diameter and was located in the superior part of the left lobe medial segment of the liver. MRI also revealed a solitary cystic lesion with septations at the pancreatic tail level measuring 24 mm \u00d7 18 mm, which was initially thought to be a pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasia [].\nEndosonography-assisted aspiration failed because of the dense contents of the cyst. Since a diagnosis of pancreatic mucinous neoplasia could not be ruled out, a decision to perform laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy and cholecystectomy was made. Four trocars were placed: One measuring 12 mm, two 10 mm and one 5 mm []. The omental bursa was opened through the gastrocolic ligament, along the stomach's greater curvature.

Her medical and familial histories were not contributory and she is the only child to nonconsanguineous parents. This was her first visit to a dentist, and hence, she did not undergo any dental treatments. On extraoral examination, her appearance and gait were normal and no significant asymmetry or abnormalities were distinguished. Intraorally, she presented with permanent dentition with adequate oral hygiene. She was presented with Angle's Class I molar relation and teeth 13 and 45 were clinically missing and teeth 36 and 46 were noted with carious lesion []. On radiographic examination (orthopantomogram), impaction of teeth 13 and 85 was evident. There was evidence of a radiolucency of 0.5 mm diameter resembling a follicular space (inner white circle) near to the occlusal surface of tooth 85 []. A cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan was performed and all various sections of CBCT revealed the presence of an apically underlying second primary molar above which a follicular space containing a developing tooth bud (Nolla's stage A) was present []. Late-formed second premolar was occurred due to impaction of second primary molar. Based on clinical and radiographic findings it was considered as delayed formation of tooth 45 caused by severe impaction of tooth 85.

A magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan of his brain did not detect any problems, apart from for a lacunar infarct of the central pontine. He was treated with drugs in the department of internal medicine with no apparent improvement in symptoms. The patient had undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery 6 years earlier due to myocardial infarction; subsequently, his hiccups worsened, appearing very frequently, especially when he finished eating in the afternoon or tried to sleep at night. He usually suffered 3-4 hours once the hiccups started. To treat his aggravated symptoms, 5 mg of baclofen and 100 mg of gabapentin were given twice a day, making him somewhat better. However, he was not able to increase the dose, as he showed symptoms of drowsiness and ataxia at a higher dose. Eventually, the patient was referred to our pain clinic, complaining of fatigue, insomnia, and weight loss.\nOur first action for the patient was blocking the right phrenic nerve guided by ultrasound using 4 ml of 0.2% ropivacaine and 10 mg of triamcinolone (). This procedure decreased the frequency of the hiccups for about one week, but afterward, his symptoms returned to their previous state. Three weeks later, we attempted to perform the same procedure on the left phrenic nerve, only to have the same outcome: a relapse after approximately 1 week.\nConsequently, we decided to perform PRFL, targeting both phrenic nerves with the use of ultrasound.

Eight years later, she again injured her shoulder and now suffered from a rotator cuff lesion and a slight loosening of the humeral stem. The rotator cuff lesion was treated by open surgery, and the humeral part of the arthroplasty was changed.

After being treated with amiodarone, digoxin, and beta-blockers for several years, her electrocardiogram remained abnormal. Electrical cardioversions eight and six years before the admission were unsuccessful. Anticoagulant (Rivaroxaban) use was stopped after intestinal bleeding two years before the surgery.\nBrain natriuretic peptide on admission was elevated to 1621 pg/mL, while troponin I was negative. Echocardiography showed moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension (mean arterial pressure 41 mmHg at rest), moderate impairment of left ventricular systolic motion, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%, and atrial dilatation, with a left atrial diameter of 43 mm. Coronary angiography showed arteries without any sign of obstructive atherosclerosis. Preoperative chest computed tomography (CT) is a part of the protocol for patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic procedures at our institution and it revealed a mass in the superior segment (S6) of the inferior lobe of the right lung ().\nIn order to follow the institutional protocol for cancer patients and minimize the operative trauma, we performed a totally thoracoscopic resection of the lung lesion and left atrial posterior wall and pulmonary vein isolation.

    "original_text": "Patient A was a 73-year-old white male who was diagnosed with RCC in 2000 and subsequently underwent a left radical nephrectomy. He went on to have multiple locoregional recurrences in the nephrectomy bed and in the lower pole of the right kidney. By January of 2007, he had involvement of the pancreatic tail and the left adrenal gland as well. He was evaluated at our medical center in March of 2007. He was restaged at that point and it was confirmed that he had no disease outside of the abdomen, so he was offered radical resection of his disease with curative intent by surgical oncology, but the patient declined. Therefore, he was started on sunitinib 50 mg daily for 4 weeks of a 6 week cycle, and an MRI in July 2007 showed decrease in the size of the tumor in the left renal bed and the pancreatic mass and right renal pole mass remained stable. Imaging after 24 weeks of sunitinib showed stable disease in known sites. His disease remained stable until imaging performed in April of 2008, after 36 weeks of treatment, showed clear enlargement of the renal fossa mass. The patient was then started on temsirolimus 25 mg IV weekly for second-line therapy. The patient had thrombocytopenia, worsening of lipid profile, and elevated blood glucose levels on temsirolimus that required a 20% dose reduction. After 12 weeks, CT scan showed pneumonitis consistent with mTOR inhibitor induced pneumonitis, a possible new lung metastasis, and progression of disease in the liver and renal fossa. Single agent bevacizumab 10 mg/m2 given every 2 weeks was started for third-line therapy and restaging every 3 months showed continued stable disease.

There was also loss of papilla height on the distal aspect of the first deciduous molar tooth. The gingiva in this region was edematous, reddish, and had an ulcerated appearance (\u201cthe ulcer looked raw\u201d); plaque deposits were minimal.\nThe parents were interviewed regarding any unusual practices or habits involving the child's mouth.

Her chief complaint was a severe pain of the right elbow that was apparently swollen. Active and passive motion of the elbow was not possible due to pain, but no neurovascular deficits were observed in her left arm. She had a history of dwarfism and had been undergoing growth hormone replacement therapy since she was 7 years old at our hospital. She also had a history of developmental dysplasia of the left hip and a habitual patellar dislocation of the right knee. For the patellar dislocation, she underwent reconstructive surgery of the medial patellofemoral ligament when she was 12 years old, and at that time, her general joint laxity was diagnosed with the Beighton score of 6 points.\nIn plain X-ray and CT scan of the elbow, apparent displaced medial epicondyle fracture (Watson-Jones classification type 2) together with an avulsed thin fragment of the lateral epicondyle was detected; however, no proximal radial fracture or a coronoid fracture was observed (). She could not undergo MRI because of her panic disorder and claustrophobia.\nThe next day after the injury, her surgery was performed under general anesthesia. Prior to skin incision, ultrasonography and stress X-rays of the elbow were evaluated. Proximal avulsion of LCL from the epicondyle was clearly seen in the ultrasonography (). Valgus and varus stress tests were performed bilaterally with her elbows at a 20-degree flexed position.

Symptoms had started four hours prior to presentation while he was watching television. Initial admission computed tomography (CT) scan was negative for any acute infarcts or other intracranial processes. His initial physical exam was significant for mild gait impairment, with Weber and Rinne test consistent with bilateral neurosensory hearing loss. Patient was initially admitted as a possible stroke rule out. Work up for stroke including carotid ultrasound, Cardiac echo were all negative except for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) which showed some periventricular and deep white matter lesions demonstrating T2 hyper-intensity without enhancement consistent with questionable demyelinating disease as seen in Figure . Given the non-specificity of his symptoms and unknown sexual history, a decision was made to evaluate for syphilis. Rapid plasma reagent (RPR) test was ordered, and it came back positive with a 1:16 titer. A confirmatory Treponema pallidium fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption-Ab was also positive which confirmed the diagnosis of syphilis.

At the age of 25 years her weight was 105 kg with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 and her renal function started to deteriorate with progression to requiring hemodialysis by age 30. With development of renal failure, secondary hyperparathyroidism was noted. Due to her obesity, she was not eligible for a renal transplant or a SPK. At this point it was decided to offer her bariatric surgery, and, after extensive discussion, it was felt that a RYGBP was the best option for her in terms of weight loss. At the age of 32 years, she underwent uneventful robotic-assisted surgery; the stomach remnant was attached to the abdominal wall for potential future access.\nOver the next 2 years she lost 60 kg and underwent SPK during which the donor duodenal segment was diverted to a bowel loop distal to her Roux loop implant site into the common channel. Induction immunosuppression with alemtuzumab was followed by maintenance with tacrolimus (trough levels 5-7 ng/mL), mycophenolate-mofetil (2 g daily), and a steroid taper. She was CMV seronegative and received a graft from a CMV positive donor and received standard prophylaxis with oral ganciclovir (GCV) for 100 days.

The patient was transferred to our institution once the initial trauma evaluation revealed perihepatic hematoma, left internal carotid artery dissection, and bilateral pulmonary contusions. En route, the patient became hemodynamically unstable requiring crystalloids and packed red blood cell transfusion.\nVital signs on arrival were T 95.5, HR 140, BP 107/65, and O2 sat 99% on assist-controlled ventilation. Repeat imaging at our institution revealed a heterogeneously enhancing mass with active extravasation suggesting hemorrhagic adrenal mass rather than inferior hepatic lobe hematoma (Figures and ). The patient underwent emergent angiography with selective arterial embolization of right superior adrenal artery and a small adrenal branch from the right renal artery to control the hemorrhage ().\nThe patient was admitted to trauma intensive care unit for further resuscitation and stabilization. Profound hypovolemic shock led to myocardial infarction and acute kidney injury prior to control of her hemorrhage. Peritoneal signs were revealed on clinical examination on hospital day 2 leading to emergent exploratory laparotomy. Extended right hemicolectomy was performed for ischemic colitis and the abdomen was temporarily left open. Subsequently, on reexploration, an ileocolic side-to-side anastomosis was performed and abdominal wall closure was performed using component separation.

The medial margin of the tumor was deformed by a left transverse process of the second lumber spine, suggesting invasive behavior (Figure ).

His injuries included: skull base fracture; diffuse axonal brain injuries, bilateral lung contusions with left side diaphragmatic rupture and dissection of descending aorta.\nOn admission to ICU he was sedated and mechanically ventilated. His blood pressure was 134/54 mmHg and pulse was 69 beats/min. Due to a potentially high risk of rupture and bleeding from the aortic dissection, the patient underwent urgent endovascular stenting. The procedure was completed successfully uneventfully.\nFor the following two weeks the patient was treated for severe traumatic brain injury. Despite adequate sedation and analgesia the patient had become extremely hypertensive (blood pressure 215/100 mmHg). CT imaging and ICP monitoring did not reveal any signs of elevated intracranial pressure, or signs of herniation.\nA detailed clinical workup was performed, and included a repeated abdominal CT, which demonstrated a remarkable subcapsular hematoma of the left kidney (), with no active bleeding. There was no biochemical evidence of kidney dysfunction or reduction in GFR.\nThe patient was started with and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and an alpha-beta blocker Labetalol. Due to persistent hypertension, despite optimal medical treatment a surgical approach (capsulotomy or nephrectomy) was considered. Due to refusal of the patient's proxy, surgery was not performed. Thus, ultrasound guided hematoma drainage was done with a total of 80 mL of sanguinous fluid withdrawn. Gram stain analysis did not detect any microorganism. Antihypertensive therapy was continued after the procedure. Further workup for primary hypertension which included a cardiac echocardiogram and vascular ultrasound did not reveal abnormalities.\nAfter one month of ICU hospitalization the patient was discharged for rehabilitation for rehabilitation.

This was incidentally noticed on enhanced CT images obtained to follow-up findings from a routine chest X-ray as part of a medical check-up. The thrombus was also distributed in the proximal portion of the right common iliac vein. Pulmonary embolism was not seen. D-dimer was elevated to 1.8 \u03bcg/mL. The patient was in apparent good health and had experienced no specific episode that could have caused deep venous thrombosis. A review of the entire family tree revealed no inherited disorder, and results of blood studies suggested no genetic causative factors.\nA GTF (Cook, Bjaeverskov, Denmark) was prophylactically implanted to prevent development of a pulmonary embolism by movement of the released thrombus. Because the top of the thrombus distributed in the IVC just below the level of the renal veins, the GTF was positioned at the suprarenal IVC through the right jugular vein with the patient under local anesthesia. Anticoagulation therapy with intravenous heparin followed by warfarin sodium given by mouth was administered.\nEighteen days later, enhanced CT revealed that the venous thrombus had decreased and the risk of pulmonary embolism had lessened. Thus retrieval of the GTF was attempted.\nAt first, we used the standard method of retrieval using the GTF retrieval set supplied by the manufacturer (Cook). Details of techniques to retrieve the GTF are described elsewhere (). Devices for retrieval were inserted from the right jugular vein. However, retrieval was impossible in spite of perseverance.

Routine blood examination revealed a hemoglobin level of 116 g/L, neutrophils 71.1%, and eosinophils 8.0%. In addition, liver function tests showed an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level of 152 U/L, and bilirubin was normal.

A week later, she started getting a clear watery discharge from the affected site.\nOn examination, there was a pinpoint size opening just posterosuperior to the angle of the mandible with a continuous dribbling of clear serous fluid and scarring of the surrounding area (Figure ). Laboratory analysis of the fluid revealed raised salivary amylase levels (7800 IU/mL), which confirmed the diagnosis of a salivary fistula. Our patient was successfully managed by a simple surgical technique, described below.\nThe procedure was performed under general anesthesia with local infiltration of 1 in 100,000 adrenaline around the fistulous opening to minimize intra-operative bleeding. Methylene blue was then injected into the fistulous opening using a 26-gauge needle (blunt tip) under microscopic magnification. The dye was seen exiting from the natural opening of the Stenson's duct, indicating a patent ductal system. An elliptical incision of 1 cm diameter was taken around the fistulous opening, which included the scar tissue. The skin island was then held with skin hooks and the subcutaneous tissue dissected until the fistulous tract containing dye was visible (Figure ). The fistulous tract was then traced proximally until it entered the thick parotid fascia. The fascia was then incised and the tract was seen entering the superficial lobe of parotid.

A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) demonstrated a thickened bicuspid aortic valve with moderate aortic stenosis (mean gradient: 33 mm Hg) and severe insufficiency. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a chronic Stanford's Type-B aortic dissection originating just distal to the left subclavian artery, luminal thrombus within the distal aortic arch and proximal descending thoracic aorta (\n), splenic infarcts, and bilateral renal infarcts. The patient was placed on the appropriate intravenous antibiotics and started on systemic anticoagulation.\nAfter 2 weeks of persistently negative blood cultures, the patient was taken to the operating room. An 8 mm Hemashield graft was sewn to the innominate artery and used for arterial inflow. The aorta was divided just above the sinotubular junction, and the aortic root was examined. The valve was grossly infected. There was a root abscess and tissue necrosis that extended from the right-noncommissural post to the left\u2013right interleaflet triangle through the right coronary sinus. After extensive debridement, it was clear that the cavities were very large and continuous, thus warranting total aortic root replacement. The left coronary artery button originated from the left coronary sinus. Upon further examination of the right coronary artery, it was noted to originate from the left coronary sinus and travel in an intramural course toward the right coronary sinus (\n). The tunnel portion measured from 7 to 10 mm.
