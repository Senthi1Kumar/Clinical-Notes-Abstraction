The diagnosis was made by the upper gastrointestinal system endoscopic examination that revealed duodenal lymphangiectasia []. She did not respond to dietary or medical (octreotide: 15\u201320 \u03bcg/kg, twice a day, subcutaneously) treatment.

Two months after the last partial intestinal resection, the patient was hospitalized due to edema and hypoalbuminemia at first only once a month, then twice a month, and finally weekly. In addition, her immune system was depressed due to protein loss, which was leading to frequent and severe infections that jeopardized her life. Her brother, who also had PIL, had improved after partial intestinal resection and needed albumin supplement only once for 3.5 years.

Hence, we concluded that no pathology left in small intestines, and the only pathology remaining was at the duodenum.

    "original_text": "This is a case of a 55-year-old female patient with no pre-existing medical illnesses, whose first presentation to the clinic was in 2001 with anal pain and mass. On examination, a retrorectal fullness was felt posteriorly with no signs of inflammation or fistulization. The anal sphincter tone was normal with an empty rectal vault. The mass was suspected to be an abscess and was aspirated under computed tomography (CT) guidance and surgical excision was planned, using a posterior approach. Drained fluid was thick and resembled pus. A biopsy of the wall of the abscess revealed the presence of multiple fragments of tissue lined by columnar epithelia with goblet cells and focal cilia formation. Bundles of haphazard smooth muscles were also noted, and the underlying stroma was focally edematous and infiltrated by mononuclear cells. These findings indicated a tailgut cyst.\nA year later, the patient presented again with anal pain. Given her history and pathology, a CT scan was performed. A pelvic CT scan showed multiloculated cystic lesions posterior to the anus and rectum, slightly displacing the rectum anteriorly and indenting its posterior wall.\nThe patient underwent excision by a posterior approach to avoid injury of the rectum and anal sphincter. We found multinodulated cysts branching laterally and ascending 10 cm in the retrorectal space, while the anterior wall was attached to the wall of the anus and the rectum, forming an endless tree root-like structure. A small number of cysts attached to the posterior wall of the rectum were left untreated, due to the high risk of injury.\nIn 2006, the patient underwent excision of two main presacral cysts through the same approach.

    "cleaned_text": "this is a case of a 55-year-old female patient with no pre-existing medical illnesses, whose first presentation to the clinic was in 2001 with anal pain and mass. on examination, a retrorectal fullness was felt posteriorly with no signs of inflammation or fistulization. the anal sphincter tone was normal with an empty rectal vault. the mass was suspected to be an abscess and was aspirated under computed tomography (ct) guidance and surgical excision was planned, using a posterior approach. drained fluid was thick and resembled pus. a biopsy of the wall of the abscess revealed the presence of multiple fragments of tissue lined by columnar epithelia with goblet cells and focal cilia formation. bundles of haphazard smooth muscles were also noted, and the underlying stroma was focally edematous and infiltrated by mononuclear cells. these findings indicated a tailgut cyst.\na year later, the patient presented again with anal pain. given her history and pathology, a ct scan was performed. a pelvic ct scan showed multiloculated cystic lesions posterior to the anus and rectum, slightly displacing the rectum anteriorly and indenting its posterior wall.\nthe patient underwent excision by a posterior approach to avoid injury of the rectum and anal sphincter. we found multinodulated cysts branching laterally and ascending 10 cm in the retrorectal space, while the anterior wall was attached to the wall of the anus and the rectum, forming an endless tree root-like structure. a small number of cysts attached to the posterior wall of the rectum were left untreated, due to the high risk of injury.\nin 2006, the patient underwent excision of two main presacral cysts through the same approach. a thick yellowish odorless material was found. de-roofing of the remaining cysts was performed, which were also attached to the posterior rectal wall.\nin 2007, a follow-up endo-rectal ultrasound report showed a multiloculated cystic structure of approximately 4.7 \u00d7",

He had visited another hospital when the symptoms had started and had been diagnosed with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma with a single metastatic lesion in the left thalamus (Figs. & ). He had undergone gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) at the other hospital. However, due to brain edema and deterioration of his overall condition, systemic chemotherapy had not been performed.\nA physical examination revealed grade 4 motor weakness in the upper and lower right limbs. Laboratory findings revealed mild hypochromic microcytic anemia but were otherwise non-specific. Follow-up abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed aggravation of an advanced gastric malignancy with multiple metastatic regional lymph nodes, and new hepatic, left adrenal, and peritoneal metastases were also observed (Fig. ). Follow-up brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mild increase in the size of the metastasis in the left thalamus (Fig. ). He was only given palliative treatment and discharged.\nFive months later the patient was admitted to our neurosurgery department with a severe headache. A brain MRI showed a slight increase in the previous mass (Fig. ) and several newly developed metastases with surrounding edema (Fig. ). Repeated GKRS was performed for both recurrent and new lesions. However, his symptoms persisted and his general condition worsened. A pathological examination of the endoscopically biopsied tissue revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with glandular fusion in a cribriform pattern (Fig. ). By immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells were completely negative for PD1, but showed weak to moderate cytoplasmic positivity for PDL1 (Fig. and ).

In 1991, the patient underwent surgery for intra-abdominal total colectomy with terminal ileostomy for acute severe UC. In 2018, he noticed the appearance of right ischial-rectal abscess associated with a perianal fistula with evidence of rectal adenomatous villous lesion with high-grade dysplasia. So, the patient went to surgery with proctectomy in November 2018 for adenocarcinoma G2 infiltrating the muscle tunic (pT2 pN0 M0 sec. ajcc 2017). The surgical resection margins were free from neoplastic localization.\nAfter a multidisciplinary consult, an adjuvant chemotherapy and pelvic radiotherapy treatment was proposed to the patient, but he refused and avoided to undergo oncological follow-up until October 2019 when he noticed the appearance of a hard-wooden swelling in the soft tissue of right perineal region (6\u20137 cm in diameter).

A week into his symptoms, he was referred to the ED for evaluation of post-LP headache.\nVital signs on presentation to the ED were as follows: heart rate of 45 beats per minute, blood pressure of 93/73 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and a temperature 37 degrees Celsius. He was drowsy but arousable and could answer simple questions. His presenting Glasgow Coma Scale was 14. Head examination revealed a sunken scalp flap overlaying the left anterior temporal craniectomy site without erythema, drainage or fluctuance. There was no evidence of new cranial trauma. His cranial nerve examination revealed no deficits, with symmetric and reactive pupils. He had full and symmetric strength in his upper and lower extremities with no obvious sensory changes. His cardiac exam was notable for bradycardia. His LP site was well appearing without leakage, erythema, bruising, or tenderness. The remainder of his examination was normal.

In addition, she had a history of depression treated by Sertraline (total daily dose of 200 mg) up to 6 months ago. In the physical examination, there was no abnormal finding and the airway examination did not show any difficulty in ventilation or intubation. All laboratory tests were acceptable. After usual preparation and premedication with 2 mg of midazolam and 100 mcg of fentanyl, auto-co-induction was performed by 30 mg propofol. 3 minutes later, 70 mg (1 mg/Kg) propofol was injected intravenously for the induction of general anesthesia. Suddenly, the patient fell into an uncontrollable agitated state that forced us to inject another dose of propofol (70 mg) for deepening the anesthesia and use the oropharyngeal airway for maintaining mouth opening. A few seconds later, the patient was calm and became apneic, mandating bag ventilation via facemask, but difficult mouth opening and mask ventilation. At this time, we decided to terminate the procedure and awake the patient. Fortunately, after a few minutes, she began to breathe spontaneously and after a while, she regained her consciousness gradually.

He described this pain as constant with slight improvement with hot showers and taking gabapentin 1200 mg 3 times daily. He also had pain and numbness along his left thorax and left ear and face numbness. He had noted some left arm weakness. He denied any recent trauma (prior MVC 15 years ago), falls, changes in balance, problems with fine motor skills, or any bowel or bladder incontinence.\nPrior medical history includes gastroesophageal reflux disease with Barrett\u2019s esophagus, generalized anxiety disorder, recurrent major depressive episodes, hypertension, restless legs syndrome, cocaine abuse, hepatitis C, diabetes mellitus type 2, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy. He had no prior spine surgeries.\nLaboratories were unremarkable. On examination, he was full strength in his right arm and both legs and was three out of five strength in his left deltoid and four out of five strength in the rest of his left arm. Sensation was intact to light touch throughout, except decreased in the left arm, left hemithorax, and left jaw. He had diminished DTRs in his left arm. He had a negative Hoffman\u2019s sign, no clonus and a negative Romberg\u2019s sign.

Fundoscopy was normal without pallor of the optic nerves, no meningeal signs, and no overt clinical signs of hormone imbalance, but the measured pituitary hormone profile had a slight elevated prolactin level and suppression of sex hormones and thyroid profile (Table ). The blood tests revealed normal electrolytes and infection parameters. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a large 22 mm x 18 mm x 15 mm enhancing hemorrhagic pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension and compression of the optic chiasm (Figure ). Emergency surgery was indicated. A transsphenoidal approach was carried out under general anesthesia. The pituitary tumor was identified, though it was not characteristic of a hemorrhagic pituitary macroadenoma. The tumor was tough and yellow colored, and debulking with a sharp curettage was difficult. Acute hemorrhage ceased after resection of tumor. Dopamine agonist was not used due to the patient experiencing complete blindness. After decompression, the surgery was concluded.

Apgar scores were 4, 5, 5, and 8 at one, five, ten and fifteen minutes respectively. He required mask ventilation at birth for primary apnoea and was intubated at seven minutes of postnatal age for persistent apnoea. At 30 min of life he was extubated to CPAP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 was weaned from 100 to 44%. On these settings he had a tachypnoea of 90 breaths per minute with mildly increased respiratory effort and a pre-ductal oxygen saturation of \u226597%. A capillary blood gas excluded respiratory or metabolic acidosis. Empiric antibiotics benzylpenicillin and gentamicin were commenced to cover the risk of sepsis due to the prolonged rupture of membranes. Chest x-rays at 2 and 4 h of life showed crescent shaped homogeneous opacities in both upper lung fields (Fig. ). The Neonatal and Paediatric Emergency Transport Service (NETS) was consulted. Initial paediatric radiological advice via telemedicine was that this appearance could represent bilateral pleural effusions. Accordingly the PEEP was increased to 8cmH2O; lateral decubitus x-ray (not shown) was uninformative. Due to the uncertainty regarding the cause of the respiratory distress the baby was transferred to the local neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) by NETS at 10 h of postnatal life.\nA progress CXR at just under 13 h of age was still inconclusive. However a lateral decubitus film performed concurrently demonstrated air anterior to the mediastinum, consistent with a diagnosis of pneumomediastinum (Fig. ); all respiratory support was therefore ceased.

    "original_text": "A 38-year-old white male who is an avid skier presented with left calf pain described as sharp on the medial aspect that started after he fell while skiing about two weeks prior. During the fall, his left ankle was forced into extreme dorsiflexion. He had immediate onset of severe pain and had to stop skiing that day. He noticed swelling in the medial calf along with bruising of the area over the next few days. After about a week, he was able to ski again but had pain aggravated by active plantar flexion.\nOn physical examination of his left leg, his knee and ankle both appeared normal and had normal strength and range of motion with no tenderness. Sensation and pulses were normal. There was tenderness over the medial head of his gastrocnemius with a palpable, firm, four-centimeter ovoid mass. Pain was elicited during resisted plantar flexion. His right leg was completely normal.\nRadiographs of the lower leg obtained in the ED were normal. A POCUS was then performed in the ED with specific focus over the mass in the medial head of the gastrocnemius, revealing a swollen, heterogeneous, disorganized mass in the medial head of the gastrocnemius, as demonstrated in \u2013. Comparison views to the unaffected extremity, as seen in , further clarified the findings. We made a diagnosis of muscle tear in the medial head of the gastrocnemius.\nThe patient was instructed on exercises for strengthening and range of motion of the calf and ankle and specifically eccentric exercises that he should complete after an initial rest period of two weeks.

The patient denied any history of trauma, manipulation, or injection around the lump before. She was otherwise healthy despite her lumps. However, she had a history of lymph node tuberculosis on her neck about 25 years before and underwent tuberculosis chemotherapy regiment for about six months.\nOn the local physical examination, we found a painless non-mobile distention on her gluteal and upper femoral region bilaterally with some fluctuation and cystic consistency on palpation of the mass. The initial largest diameter of her thigh was 60 cm on the left and 45 cm on the right. There was no signs of inflammation, sinus or fistula around her thighs and buttock, or any remarkable signs on physical examinations (). Laboratory examinations however, showed elevated level of ESR and CRP. Mantoux test were inconclusive due to previous infection of tuberculosis. Radiological examination showed no signs of abnormality besides the expanding soft tissue shadow especially on her left femur region.\nMRI examinations were then performed over the lumbosacral and pelvis region. Sagittal T2 weighted MR images of the sacrum showed destruction on anterior lower sacral segments, with hyperintense anterior lesion and presacral abscess.

    "original_text": "A 41-year-old man, working in a furniture confection plant, experienced severe \u201ctearing\u201d chest pain upon heavy lifting. On presentation in another health facility, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan, with incomplete imaging of the iliofemoral axis, revealed a type A aortic dissection (DeBakey type I). Following transfer to our center, physical examination showed a pulseless left femoral artery, while no sign of acute limb ischemia was present. The patient underwent a mechanical Bentall procedure with hemiarch replacement under circulatory arrest for a total procedure time of 7 hours, 45 minutes. The immediate postoperative course was uneventful. The femoral pulses were symmetrical and well palpable once the patient rewarmed. Thirty-six hours after surgery, the patient was extubated and complained of severe pain to his left buttock. The lower limb pulses were present and no sensory or strength deficit was found. The left limb was normal, while the buttock was tense and painful especially upon flexion and adduction of the hip. A GCS was suspected. A CT angiography scan of the pelvis showed a dissection flap ending proximal to the iliac bifurcation without direct involvement of the iliac arteries. The false lumen was thrombosed and preferentially oriented toward the common left iliac artery. The opacification of the left internal and external iliac arteries was good. Preoperative CT angiography showed left gluteus muscle swelling (\n). This was likely related to a malperfusion following thrombotic or embolic occlusion (\n).

He had been treated with bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and occasional antibiotics without improvement. He had no history of tobacco use, significant alcohol consumption, or any illicit drug use.\nOn examination, the patient was in no significant distress and was able to speak in full sentences. His vital signs were normal except for a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air at rest. Cardiovascular examination was notable for jugular venous distension to the angle of the mandible. A parasternal heave, an accentuated P2, and an S3 were appreciated. Lung auscultation was notable for decreased breath sounds. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.\nTransthoracic echocardiography revealed right ventricular dilatation with flattening of the interventricular septum and an estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 85 mmHg. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) demonstrated severe obstructive ventilatory defect with diffusion impairment.\nChest radiograph demonstrated bilateral perihilar soft tissue densities with right apical scarring, pleural thickening and volume loss [].

He visited the second affiliate hospital of the Zhejiang University School of Medicine. A physical examination indicated the result of the straight leg raising test was positive and also muscle atrophy. The muscle power of the right lower limb had decreased to grade 3. There was no sensory impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intraspinal extradural tumor over T10 to L3 (Fig. ). It appeared to be a spinal extradural arachnoid cyst (SEAC). To confirm whether the fistula existed between the subarachnoid space and arachnoid cyst, and to localize the position of the fistula, we performed a real-time technique. First, we injected contrast medium into the cyst under fluoroscopy. After 1 h the follow-up computed tomography (CT) was administered, and it revealed there was no contrast-infiltration into the subarachnoid space (Fig. ). We then extracted about 20 mL of fluid from the cyst. The follow-up magnetic resonance imaging on the same day indicated the cyst did not become smaller (Fig. ). A \u201cone-way valve\u201d fistula was suspected such that cerebral spinal fluid could pass into the cystic space from the subarachnoid space but could not flow in the opposite manner. Therefore we designed a procedure to localize the fistula. We penetrated two needles into the cyst and subarachnoid space separately in the L3/L4 level under digital subtraction angiography (Fig. ). Pending the fluid drained through those two needles, we injected 10 mL of contrast medium slowly into the subarachnoid space and a little contrast medium infiltrated into the cystic space horizontally at the T12/L1 level.

Additionally, the patient\u2019s human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was positive, with a +3 score by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Further evaluation showed multiple bilateral pulmonary and liver metastases along with a highly suspicious active bone lesion in the proximal end of the right humerus. She had a history of hypertension that was controlled on bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide. She was also known to have thalassemia trait and negative family history for malignancy. She had no symptoms related to her disease and her Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was zero. The patient\u2019s breast exam was negative except for a 3-cm left breast mass with a retracted nipple.\nFollowing detailed discussion with the patient, she was started on chemotherapy, initially with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, then her regimen was switched to docetaxel along with anti-HER2 therapy with both trastuzumab and pertuzumab, which resulted in almost total disappearance of both liver and lung lesions after the 6th cycle. Docetaxel was held after two more cycles, but both anti-HER2 drugs were continued along with endocrine therapy with an aromatase inhibitor.

She described chest tightness while exercising on a bicycle after 10 minutes. The next day she developed a severe hacking cough at work during a conference call. The cough was associated with disorientation and severe chest tightness. This prompted her to present to the emergency department in February 2018. The patient is a pharmacist, nonsmoker, and denies illicit drug use or recent travel. She had endometrial laser ablation with myomectomy in 2006. Hormonal contraceptives have been used since 2004 and were stopped three months before presentation in hopes of conception. Her last menstrual period was four days before the onset of symptoms. On physical examination, she had chest tightness localizing to the right side and decreased right sided breath sounds. All the routine laboratory work and vital signs were normal. The CXR showed a large right spontaneous pneumothorax with what approved to be a 5.6 cm pleural mass at the right lung base ().\nFollowing the pneumothorax diagnosis, the patient underwent emergent right thoracostomy with pigtail catheter placement. A repeat CXR revealed marked re-expansion of the lung but persistence of the right cardiophrenic opacity of unclear etiology. A follow-up CTof chest showed a 33 mm diaphragmatic defect with a 5.8 x 4.6 x 3.9 cm area of herniated liver corresponding to the presumed pleural mass ().\nFollowing complete thoracic imaging the patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), mechanical pleurodesis, and open repair of the right diaphragmatic defect by Dr. Emily Cassidy (Figures and ). Intraoperatively, the lungs appeared grossly normal.

Her medical and gestational history was unremarkable. Her husband reported having eaten dried dates 2 days before admission. The patient collapsed shortly after entering the emergency room. Upon initial examination, she had a non-palpable pulse and non-recordable blood pressure. The ultrasonography revealed a large amount of intraperitoneal free fluid. The initial diagnosis was hypovolemic hemorrhagic shock secondary to a pregnancy-related intraperitoneal hemorrhage. Hence, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated, and an emergency cesarean section was indicated for saving the fetus and exploring the source of bleeding. Cefazolin 2 g was administered. During uterine incision, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest; thus, resuscitation efforts were continued intraoperatively. The newborn infant was hypotonic and unmoving (with an Apgar score of 0) and therefore received resuscitation immediately. The uterus was not the source of bleeding.\nThe surgeon immediately further explored the abdominal cavity and opened the abdomen up to the xiphoid process. This revealed a large hemorrhagic region between the spleen and stomach. Resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful, and both mother and infant died. Due to the unclear cause of death, an autopsy was performed. The newborn autopsy was not undertaken according to the family\u00b4s wishes.\nOn autopsy, approximately three liters of clotted and unclotted blood collected in the peritoneal cavity. The spleen was perforated (3 cm in diameter, extending toward the pancreatic tail, along with a tear in the splenic artery. The splenic capsule was tense under pressure with gas inside ().

    "original_text": "A 41-year old man presented with a large cervical mass involving both sides of the neck, with associated macroglossia for 5 years. No personal history of disease was reported. Physical examination revealed a large painless rubber-like mass within the entire cervical region, which also extended intraorally through the floor of the mouth, pushing it upwards. The tongue was largely involved with lingual mandibular imprints and also marked protrusion and displacement of the teeth over the vestibular region both in the upper maxilla and mandible. Progressive limitation of breathing, swallowing and speech was observed. A cervicofacial CT-scan showed a large mass in the floor of the mouth with involvement of the tongue, mylohyoid and geniohyoid muscles and anterior cervical soft tissues, formed by multiple tortuous small and large-size vessels, with preservation of the hyoid bone and both submaxillary glands. No pathologic lymph neck nodes were observed. Angiography of both external carotid arteries confirmed the vascular nature of the mass, this particular case being an arteriovenous malformation [AVM] mainly supported by the right lingual artery, but also by the facial and upper thyroid arteries. The mass presented large draining veins crossing the midline that finished at the left jugular vein (Fig. ).\nTreatment approach consisted on the embolization of the right upper thyroid, lingual and facial arteries under intravenous sedation followed by surgical resection 3 days later. Embolization was tried with rounded beads [microspheres] of polymers and collagen. Unfortunately, embolization was scarcely successful, as it was checked during open surgery. Tracheostomy was performed under local anaesthesia.

    "original_text": "A 25-year-old male patient reported with a chief complaint of mild pain on his right lower back tooth region for the past 6 months. In the past 1 week, the intensity of pain increased and became continuous and spontaneous in nature. The patients familial and medical histories were noncontributory. Extraoral examination revealed no abnormalities. Intraorally, the patient had generalized gingivitis and a deep occlusal carious lesion in relation to the mandibular second molar (tooth #31). The tooth was tender to percussion. Mobility was within physiological limits, and periodontal probing around the tooth revealed a pocket depth of 4 mm on the distal aspect. Pulp testing with cold test and electric pulp tester gave a negative response in relation to tooth #31.\nIn addition, the crown morphology was found to be abnormal []. The tooth was wider buccolingually and revealed two well-developed lobulated tubercles on the buccal surface. The tubercles appeared bulbous, conically projecting from the cervical line toward the occlusal surface. The combined mesiodistal extension of both the tubercles was almost equal to the mesiodistal width of the associated tooth. A distinct developmental occluso-gingival groove clearly delineated the tubercles from the associated tooth. The mesial tubercle was larger than the distal tubercle.

The patient did not report any cough or hemoptysis. Referring to a local emergency room, the on-call physician requested work-ups including Electrocardiogram (ECG), chest radiography and abdominal sonography. The only abnormal finding was sinus tachycardia. The patient was sent home with antacid medication after which no improvement was observed. The same afternoon, a gastroenterologist performed and upper endoscopic study turned to be normal. The results of liver function test, amylase and cardiac troponin were also normal except for a mild AST elevation and high troponin level (665 pg/ml [NL: 0-140]). The second ECG revealed ST-T segment elevation in lead I, Avl and v1-v4 (). The patient was then admitted to the coronary care unit of another hospital. The following morning, coronary angiography was carried out that only exposed mild sluggish flow in diagonal 2 (D2) branch of coronary artery. A day later the patient was released with his consent but returned a couple of days later with the recurrence of the right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain combined with the right flank pain.

The international normalized ratio of prothrombin time (PT-INR) was monitored every 2 weeks to keep it range between 2.5 and 3.5 s. She complained of persistent abdominal distension and repeated exertional dyspnea for 2 years at admission. Physical examination showed obvious body signs of right heart failure, including jugular vein distention, lower limb pitting edema. The 12-lead surface ECG showed atrial fibrillation rhythm with narrow QRS complex. The transthoracic echocardiography indicated a normal ventricular size of 35 mm with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 65% and a moderate stenosis of tricuspid valve with the pressure gradient across the tricuspid valve of 8 mmHg. Laboratory examination revealed the NT-pro-BNP of 1780 ng/ml. Due to progression of heart failure from her valvular heart disease, she underwent tricuspid valve replacement again (Medtronic bileaflet prosthesis). On the second day after surgery, the patient developed sudden cardiac arrest with bedside electrocardiographic monitor recording atrial fibrillation, complete third-degree AVB with repeated episodes of torsade de point secondary to the long QT interval (0.6 s). Thus, a permanent pacemaker was required to oppose this malignant arrhythmia.\nAfter taking full consideration of the patient\u2019s basic situations, the CRT-P implantation via two pacing leads in cardiac venous system to provide dual-site ventricular pacing was primarily planned. As the patient with triple mechanical valve replaced had a relatively higher risk for thrombosis, the oral warfarin was not interrupted before operation. The instant blood test prior to operation showed a PT-INR of 2.42 s. The intravenous unfractionated heparin was used during the procedure to keep an activated clotting time (ACT) range between 250 and 300 s. Electric surgical knives were applied to stop bleeding of the incision during the whole procedure.",

Over time, the patient\u2019s symptoms progressed to the point where he would experience bilateral thigh numbness, which worsened with ambulating and, subsequently, lower abdominal numbness and urinary retention. His physical exam at that time demonstrated hyper-reflexia in his lower extremities bilaterally along with decreased hip flexor strength and bilateral Babinski signs. Due to concern for myelopathy and the inability to perform an MRI given the patient\u2019s pacemaker, a CT myelogram was performed and demonstrated a likely intramedullary lesion at the T3 level (Figure ).\nThe quality of the CT was sub-optimal due to part of the dye being injected in a subdural location. A positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) was subsequently performed, which seemed to confirm that the lesion was neoplastic and likely intramedullary in location.
