He had resolution of his pain and was able to tolerate diet and was discharged home. He returned one month later for recurrence of abdominal pain and nausea. He was empirically started on antimicrobials and underwent repeat imaging with the computed tomography mesenteric angiogram that demonstrated only moderate features of atherosclerotic disease with patent celiac, superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) (). Additional findings included features of colitis with pericolic fat stranding in the distal ascending, transverse, and proximal descending colon (). He underwent repeat colonoscopy showing similar findings (3 regions of circumferential ulceration in the ascending/hepatic flexure, splenic flexure, and descending colon) (Figures \u2013). Biopsy histology demonstrated ragged colonic mucosa with ulcerative debris and nonpolarizing crystalline material at the sites of ulceration (Figures \u2013). Clinical workup for additional causes including cardioembolic events and vasculitis was completed and found to be nondiagnostic. Histology from the current and prior colon biopsy specimens demonstrated crystalline material morphologically consistent with the phosphate binder sevelamer carbonate.

Following the initial implantation, he required reoperation for a lead fracture. Subsequently, he developed a device infection and bacteremia with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The entire ICD system was explanted using a laser lead system. The infection healed and a new device was subsequently placed on the contralateral side.\nTwo years later, the patient developed another MRSA infection involving the now right-sided biventricular ICD system. Again, the system was explanted and the infection was treated. Angiograms documented bilateral occlusion of the subclavian and axillary venous systems. Cardiac surgical consultation was sought regarding placement of epicardial leads for a biventricular ICD.

Recent computed tomography scan revealed a mass in the left upper lobe of the lung, and she was admitted to undergo video-assisted thoracoscopic LUL lobectomy. She had a history of hypertension and osteoporosis, treated with raloxifen, alfacalcidol, fexofenadine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine and esomeprazole magnesium hydrate. She smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 45 years. Physical examination on admission was unremarkable. Preoperative electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with an incomplete right bundle branch block. After placement of an epidural catheter between the fifth and sixth vertebrae, general anesthesia was induced with remifentanil and propofol. Tracheal intubation was accomplished using rocuronium bromide. Combined epidural and general anesthesia was maintained with remifentanil, desflurane and ropivacaine. The LUL lobectomy proceeded without difficulty with an operating time of 157 min. No arrhythmias or severe hypotension were detected during the surgery. She was transferred to a general ward after extubation in the operating room.\nThe postoperative course was uncomplicated with no episodes of atrial fibrillation on the first postoperative day.

She was taken to the hospital by her relatives after they found her in the bathroom presenting with intestinal loops exiting through her anus. The presence of a rectal prolapse was not among her precedents ().\nOn the first exploration, we recognized an abdominal excavation, which was painless on palpation, and we observed many small intestine loops with a congestive aspect exiting through the anus. When the patient arrived, she was hypotensive and tachycardic. After the first resuscitation attempt, an urgent blood test was requested, and the results showed albumin, 3; C-reactive protein, 47.3 mg/dL; and 19,700 leukocytes with neutrophilia, indicating an urgent need for surgery. The patient was taken to the operating room less than two hours after the beginning of the symptoms, and during the surgery, her hemodynamic condition remained the same.\nFor the surgery, the patient was placed in a modified lithotomy position, and two areas (abdominal and perineal) were prepared. After checking the difficulty of reducing the intestine exclusively through the anus, we performed an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed the absence of small intestine loops in the cavity; these had been moved to the pelvis and this was causing an important traction of the mesentery root. As a result, a manual reduction of the loops to the cavity through intraperitoneal traction was done; this was controlled from the perineal field. After the reduction had been completed, a 3 to 4 cm lineal craniocaudal perforation in the antimesenteric portion of the upper rectum was objectified (RIS II/AAC III). An important flaccidity of the entire pelvic musculature which contained a large rectovaginal pouch was observed, which resulted in both the superior rectum and the peritoneal reflection leaning on the pelvic floor (). The peritoneal cavity was abundant",

The systolic RV pressure measured by maximal tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TR Vmax of 5.2 m/sec) was about 110 mm Hg. TTE also revealed mass lesion mimicking thrombus in the MPA with severe stenotic component (measured maximal MPA velocity of 4.6 m/sec) ().

Six months prior, he started feeling palpitations and more tired than usual after activity. These symptoms became aggravated after he developed a common cold 4 months prior to presentation. He also complained of lower extremity edema and difficulty laying down at night. He was treated with medicines including digoxin and furosemide prior to admission to our ward. The patient underwent TOF repair in our hospital 25 years ago; however, the surgery data were lost and he had no regular follow-up.\nOn admission, the patient\u2019s heart rate was 67 beats/min, blood pressure was 119/79 mmHg, and respirations were 12 per minute with oxygen saturations around 99% on room air. Under cardiac auscultation, the cardiac rhythm was regular; a diastolic murmur at the apex was heard. Blood chemistry was normal. Echocardiography showed an acceleration of forward blood flow and regurgitation in the pulmonary valve (moderate-severe) (Figure ), mitral valve stenosis (severe), and tricuspid regurgitation (mild), while a detailed assessment revealed that the pulmonary valve was short and curly. Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm and a right bundle branch block. Magnetic resonance imaging showed thickening and opening restriction of the mitral valve (Figure ) as well as mild regurgitation in the tricuspid and aortic valves. Computed tomography showed an increase in texture within the lungs and an enlarged heart.\nThe patient was scheduled for mitral valve and PVR surgery after diagnosis.

The first large lesion, located in segment V, was ablated several times the previous years. A new lesion appeared in segment II, located under the ribs (), which was decided to be treated with RFA.\nPrior to therapy the patient had underwent laboratory examinations: hematocrit, white blood cell count, blood coagulation tests, values for hepatic, function and a-fetoprotein levels. Platelet (PLT) count value was 60,000/mL and international normalized ratio (INR) was 1,2. Forty-five minutes before the procedure the patient received analgesic and antidepressant treatment consisting of one pill of 3 mg bromazepam per os and 75 mg d-propoxyphene hydrochloride intramuscularly. CT-guided RFA started by placing the patient in the supine position. The shortest, most vertical, and safest path should be chosen. The front path just over the lesion was chosen. The skin at the needle entry site was prepared with povidone iodine 10% solution. A 22 G needle for syringe use was inserted into the skin, and three contiguous CT images were obtained to ensure that the chosen point was the appropriate one. Local anaesthetic (2% lidocaine hydrochloride) was then instilled through this needle for skin and subcutaneous tissue anaesthetization. The needle was removed and an incision with a surgical blade was made to facilitate electrode cannula insertion. Ablation was carried out with a MIRAS triple spiral 15 G electrode.\nThe tip of the electrode was positioned in the correct position and it was deployed slowly ().

    "original_text": "A 40-year-old male patient reported in 2012, with a complaint of TMJ ankylosis since last nine years. The patient had sustained a road traffic accident in May 1990. He was treated conservatively for head injury and suspected condylar fracture. One year after trauma, the patient experienced gradual reduction in mouth opening. It became 0 mm in next seven years. In 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2003, the patient underwent surgical operations for the treatment of TMJ ankylosis []. After every surgical intervention he did achieve some mouth opening, but it quickly reverted to 0 mm in three to six months\u2019 time, in spite of good compliance with physiotherapy.\nIn 2012, his mouth opening was 0 mm. A computed tomography (CT) scan examination showed a huge new bone in the previous 1.5 cm arthroplasty area []. The mediolateral dimension of ankylotic mass on the left side was 3.2 cm and the anteroposterior dimension was 3.5 cm. On right side, there was relatively less amount of bone. His sequential radiographs showed adequate bone removal in the previous surgeries.\nThe patient was operated via preauricular with extended temporal and submandibular approaches. To avoid two broad cut bone surfaces facing each other, a lower osteotomy cut was planned below the mid-ramus region. To maintain the ramus height a titanium mandibular condylar plate with 2.4 mm diameter screws was used. Buccal fat pad was interposed between the metal condyle and sclerosed temporal bone.

During the following days, she experienced continuous pain and sought medical attention. Physical examination did not show any reduction of passive and active arcs of movements. Also, Jobe and Bear Hug tests were negative. There was only a mild ligamentous laxity and 10 degrees of elbow hyperextension.

Despite treatment with 5 mg/kg cyclosporine, 3 mg/kg azathioprine and corticosteroids, the patient experienced frequent and severe panuveitis attacks in both eyes. The patient was resistant to all treatments including interferon alpha and mycophenolate mofetil. The patient underwent phacoemulsification surgery in the right eye in 2004 and trabeculectomy in the same eye in 2006. Almost all systemic side effects were a result of steroid usage.\nThe patient suffered a bilateral panuveitis attack in January 2012 (). The visual acuity decreased to 20/400 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. He was started on infliximab in February 2012. Infliximab therapy at 5 mg/kg was administered at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Because he experienced side effects related to azathioprine and cyclosporine, the patient reduced the dose of the drugs and subsequently self-terminated the therapy. The visual acuity was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye in the third month of infliximab therapy. The intraocular pressure was 14 mmHg in both eyes. The anterior and posterior segments were quiet in both eyes.\nAfter 6 months of infliximab therapy, he presented to our clinic with pain and blurred vision in his right eye. The visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. The intraocular pressure was 35 mmHg in the right eye and 16 mmHg in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination revealed corneal dendritic ulcers and 2+ cells in the anterior chamber in the right eye (). There was no vitritis or vitreal flare. The posterior segment was quiet.

He had a history of cerebral infarction and was taking an antiplatelet agent. Laboratory tests, including those for tumor markers, were approximately normal, and he was negative for markers of viral hepatitis. CT revealed synchronous multiple liver metastases, mainly in the right lobe (Figure ). The patient was pathologically diagnosed with moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, classified as T3N1 in the TNM system. Because this patient had at least eight metastases in the liver, we decided to resect the primary lesion, by high anterior rectal resection in open sugery, followed by chemotherapy.\nFollowing resection of the primary tumor, the patient was started on postoperative chemotherapy with XELOX plus bevacizumab. CT showed a partial response after seven cycles of chemotherapy. However, the patient experienced side effects, including nausea, general fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, and anemia. He wanted to stop the chemotherapy and undergo liver resection. MRI revealed seven metastases in the right lobe, one in segments 4 and 5, and one in segment 3. R0 resection therefore required right hepatectomy and partial resection of segment 3 (Figure ). His liver function tests were almost normal, but his indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes (ICGR15) was 12.7%, which was thought to be slightly deteriorated because of the chemotherapy. CT volumetry revealed a very small left lobe of the liver. The projected FLR volume was 364 ml, 29% of total liver volume and 0.61% of the total body weight that was 59.6 kg. The FLR volume would therefore be insufficient following resection. PVE was considered but might not always have induced sufficient remnant liver hypertrophy. Moreover, the time required to wait after PVE, about 4 weeks, may have increased the risk of tumor progression, especially on the non-embolic side. Conventional two-stage hepatectomy with PVE or PVL was also considered,",

Other pertinent medical history included psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, which had been well controlled on a weekly dose of 12.5 mg of oral methotrexate. After careful discussion with the patient about the potential side effects of treatment including worsening of psoriasis, methotrexate was discontinued and pembrolizumab was initiated at 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks.

    "original_text": "A 47-year-old woman initially complained of a mass in the left anterior chest wall. On examination, a mobile, firm mass was discovered in the left breast. The patient underwent a thorough examination including a mammogram, breast ultrasonography (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), followed by a guided core needle biopsy (CNB).\nThe mammogram showed an isodense mass in the upper inner quadrant of the left breast (). Breast US revealed the presence of a 1.9 cm mass at the 10 o'clock position that appeared malignant and was most likely primary breast cancer. MRI confirmed the breast US findings. The CNB results showed that the tumor was an invasive ductal carcinoma, nuclear grade 2/3, and histological grade 2/3. No hormone receptor testing was performed on the CNB sample ().\nTwo years prior to her breast complaint, the patient presented with a mass on the left side of her neck that had been present for 2 months. Following radiological and pathological investigations, the mass was diagnosed as a left parotid salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) with cervical lymph node metastasis. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT) revealed no distant metastases. She underwent a radical left parotidectomy with selective neck dissection, and her final pathology revealed a 3.1 cm tumor with lymphovascular and extensive facial nerve invasion; 1 of 45 excised lymph nodes was positive, and the tumor was staged as pT4a N2a M0.

Previously, the same day he had been working using a hammer and chisel to repair his car without any eye protection, and he thought a foreign body had struck his right eye. The examination of his right eye revealed congestion and laceration of the conjunctiva, and the general practitioner started treatment with a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic (chloramphenicol). Seven days following his first presentation to the general causality clinic, he woke up with decreased vision, redness, and minimal pain in his right eye, and he presented to the nearby ophthalmology department on the same day. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) decimal had decreased from 1.0 to 0.7. The orbit computed tomography scans detected a metallic intraocular foreign body (), and he was referred urgently to the Department of Ophthalmology at Oslo University Hospital for surgical removal of the foreign body. On arrival, the BCVA decimal had decreased from 0.7 to hand motion. The biomicroscopic examination revealed intense conjunctival and ciliary injection, most likely self-sealed conjunctival laceration, corneal oedema, 3+ anterior chamber cells with fibrin, and a thin layer of hypopyon in the anterior chamber and posterior synechiae. A layer of fibrin mesh covered the anterior surface of the lens. The changes in ocular media obscured the fundus view. The B-scan ultrasonography revealed an echogenic foreign body in the posterior vitreous cavity with dense vitreous opacities and attached retina and posterior vitreous. His left eye was unremarkable, and he was otherwise in good health.

The immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis showed that the biopsy specimen was positive for chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56 and negative for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), S-100, and human melanin black-45 (HMB-45). The pathologist reported it as a metastatic neuroendocrine tumor of unknown origin. Based on the pathology report, the urologist diagnosed the tumor as a metastatic tumor derived from the right kidney. The patient was referred to the departments of dermatology and plastic surgery.

Although he had taken analgesics, the pain during exercise did not improve, and he presented to our emergency department with lower leg pain (Fig. ). There was no clear abnormality on the radiographs of the tibia, but STIR magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a high-intensity area of the distal one-third of the tibia, and the diagnosis of stress fracture and shin splint was made. The patient was instructed to suspend training, and the injury was treated conservatively with follow-up on an outpatient basis (Fig. ). Follow-up radiographs were checked at 2 and 3 months. With this treatment, the fracture healed with no complications, and he decided to return to running after 3 months. At 6 months, radiography showed thickening of the bone cortex in the back one-third of the right tibia and in the back of the distal part of the left tibia, so that he was again instructed to stop training (Fig. ). However, he discontinued coming to the outpatient clinic on his own after 6 months.\nHe was then seen in the emergency department, having sustained an injury to the right lower leg while running a middle-distance race, 1 year after the initial examination.

Her laboratory data revealed obstructive jaundice and cholangitis, and tumor marker levels were elevated with carcinoembryonic antigen at 3.6 and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 at 4573.9. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an enhancing mass in the biliary duct hilum and dilation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, and there was no evidence of lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed a luminal filling defect in the biliary hilum (Fig. ). We diagnosed the tumor as a Bismuth type 1 cholangiocarcinoma, and performed endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage. Biopsies of the tumor revealed adenocarcinoma. The estimated volume of the postoperative liver remnant was less than 35%. Therefore, percutaneous transhepatic portal vein embolization (PTPE) of the right branch of her portal vein was performed (Fig. ). Twenty-one days later, the volume of the left lobe of her liver increased, and we performed right hepatectomy, caudate lobectomy, extrahepatic bile duct resection, and lymph node dissection. Node dissection included resection of hilar and pericholedochal nodes in the hepatoduodenal ligament, common hepatic artery nodes, and those at the celiac trunk, and posterior and anterior pancreaticoduodenal nodes.\nHistological examination of the tumor showed moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma without regional lymph node metastasis, a pathological stage II tumor according to the Union for International Cancer Control classification of malignant tumors, 7th edition (Fig. ).

Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a markedly distended gallbladder, measuring 16 cm x 8 cm, with oedema and pericholecystic fluid consistent with gallbladder empyema (Figure ). Relying on the patient's clinical picture and the results of the imaging studies, a diagnosis of gallbladder empyema was made. Due to this diagnosis and the big size of the gallbladder, an open cholecystectomy was decided upon. No other abnormality was identified intra-operatively during the assessment of the peritoneal cavity, including lymphadenopathy and liver or peritoneal pathology. Based on the pre-operative as well as the intra-operative findings, open cholecystectomy was performed; no lymph nodes were excised. After an uneventful recovery, the patient was discharged on the 4th postoperative day.\nOn cut surface, a 2 cm firm mass obstructing the lumen in the neck of the gallbladder was identified. The mass was solid, yellowish-grey and granular with focal areas of necrosis. Under light microscopy, the tumour demonstrated invasion of the muscularis propria in some areas, with foci of necrosis and haemorrhage (Figure ). No extension to the gallbladder serosa was found. Examination of multiple regions under light microscopy did not reveal any vascular invasion. Additionally, no evidence of carcinoma was present in situ.\nThe neoplastic tissue consisted of diffusely arranged and focally syncytial large and pleomorphic tumour giant cells, with a significant infiltrating population of large multinucleated hyperchromatic cells.

Laboratory findings revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 19.9\u00d7109/L and hemoglobin (Hb) levels of 84 g/L. He vomited approximately 300 ml of bright red blood and produced a large amount of tarry stool on March 29, 2011. His Hb levels subsequently decreased to 73 g/L. CT angiography (CTA) demonstrated a mediastinal esophageal fistula with inflammatory exudate surrounding the descending aorta. An aortic pseudoaneurysm at the anterior wall of the descending aorta was also observed at the lower edge of thoracic vertebrate 5 (). A diagnosis of AEF was highly suspected. Angiography was performed on March 31, 2011 and showed a 0.7 cm\u00d70.4 cm pseudoaneurysm of the descending aorta approximately 4.5 cm below the origin of the left subclavian artery, which was consistent with the results of the CTA. This finding confirmed the diagnosis of AEF. After an immediate multidisciplinary discussion, a plan for definitive treatment was established. An endovascular stent-graft (catalog number: TF2424C200X, Medtronic, Inc., USA) was placed inside the descending aorta to isolate the pseudoaneurysm. Postoperative angiography showed satisfactory exclusion results, and the patient was transferred to the operating room for thoracoscopic exploration. Swelling in the esophageal bed and inflammatory exudates were observed under the thoracoscope. Immediate mediastinal debridement and irrigation was performed using the thoracoscope. Two F16 silicone tubes were placed in the pleural cavity and the mediastinum to facilitate postoperative drainage.

The patient had undergone endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (size: 82 mm) utilizing bifurcated excluder prosthesis (W. L. Gore Associates Inc., Flagstaff, AZ, USA) at another hospital in 2006. Upon the completion of the EVAR procedure, there was no evidence of an endoleak, and the renal arteries as well as the internal iliac arteries were intact. Six years later, he had developed a type 2 endoleak sustained by several lumbar arteries; further, the maximum transverse diameter of AAA had increased to 110 mm. On his physical examination, he was found to have mild hypertension (138/95 mmHg) with a regular heartbeat of 69 beats/min and body temperature of 36\u2103. Mild abdominal thrill was observed upon palpation, but no other specific abnormalities were identified. A computed tomographic angiography revealed endoleaks passing posteriorly into the enlarged aneurysm sac that was measured to be 110 mm in size (). First, we performed selective angiography with left internal iliac artery catheterization for coil embolization. An angiography verified a contrast material entering the aneurysm sac via the lumbar arteries (). We subsequently proceeded to the coli embolization of the penetrating lumbar arteries. However, an attempt for the endoluminal embolization of the lumbar arteries was unsuccessful due to anatomic variations and their complex interrelations, which impeded the access to the endovascular catheter.\nTherefore, we adopted a surgical approach. A midline laparotomy was performed to expose the aneurysm sac after further informed consent.

On arrival to the ED, the patient was managed according to the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol. The left lower limb was grossly shortened and externally rotated (Figure ). Swelling was noted in the left hip and thigh region. Tenderness was present near the hip joint and movements were painful. An abrasion of approximately 10 cm x 15 cm was present over the medial aspect of the left thigh. The neurovascular status was normal. Standard radiographs showed an anterior dislocation of the hip with an intra-articular bone fragment (Figure ). After stabilizing the vitals, the patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the pelvis, with both hips, which showed an anteriorly dislocated femoral head lying externally rotated in relation to the superolateral aspect of the acetabulum. In addition, a displaced posterior wall fracture fragment was found within the acetabulum and a separate anterior wall fracture was noted (Figure ). The patient was immediately rushed to the operation theater after consenting for both closed and open reduction. After general anesthesia, closed reduction was attempted by the Allis method under image guidance. The femoral head could not be displaced from its position despite three attempts and a decision was made to proceed with open reduction using the Smith-Peterson approach.

A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 4 \u00d7 3.6 cm mass in the right superior lung and enlargement of the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. Small cell lung cancer was confirmed by pathological examination after fibro-bronchoscope biopsy (Fig a,b). A comprehensive CT scan ruled out distant metastatic disease, thus the clinical stage was classified as limited. Between April and November 2007, the patient received three courses of standard chemotherapy composed of etoposide and cisplatin (EP), and then received sequential intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT; total dose: 60Gy/30f), which involved the primary lesion in the right lung and the hilar and mediastinal lymph node areas. The patient then received another three courses of EP chemotherapy. A CT scan in December 2007 demonstrated that the primary lesion in the right lung and the metastatic lymph nodes had disappeared, signaling a complete response according to World Health Organization standard criteria. Three months later, the patient received preventive radiotherapy of the whole brain.\nFollow-up CT scans showed no evidence of recurrence until September 2014 when new tumors were found in the right posterior segment of the liver and in the upper pole left kidney. We performed enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen, which suggest the presence of malignant neoplasms (Fig ). The patient had a history of chronic viral hepatitis B, and his alpha-fetoprotein level had elevated to 385 ng/mL, which supported a diagnosis of primary liver cancer. As is well known, enhanced CT and MRI cannot provide sufficient information to distinguish metastatic and primary tumors. Hence, our team performed image-guided percutaneous liver and renal biopsies to make a pathological diagnosis. Pathology determined the liver tumor as HCC (Fig c,d) with immunohistochemistry (IHC): hepatocyte (3+), carcinoembryonic antigen (\u2212), caudal type homeobox 2 (\u2212), cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) (1",

Trans-vaginal ultrasound revealed endometriosis and a complex cystic mass of the right ovary consistent with possible malignancy. The CA-125 was 32. She was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic right ovarian cystectomy. Based on visible tumor within the ovary at surgery, the operation was converted to a staging laparotomy with traditional cytoreductive surgery with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, bilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection, peritoneal biopsies, and peritoneal washings. No residual disease remained after surgery. Pathology disclosed clear cell carcinoma of the right ovary. Examination of the uterus revealed adenomyosis and endometriosis with focal clear cell carcinoma near the parametrial margin; 13 pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes from the right and 15 from the left side showed no evidence of metastatic disease. The omentum contained a small focus of malignant cells, however the remainder of samples from the pelvis, paracolic gutters, and the undersides of the diaphragms revealed no cancer. She was staged as having FIGO stage IIIA2 clear cell carcinoma of the ovary.\nBeginning in June 2014 she was treated with post-operative, adjuvant, dose dense paclitaxel and carboplatin x 6 cycles, which were completed in October 2014. A post-treatment PET scan in October 2014 revealed metastatic progression with hypermetabolic metastatic disease in the liver and multiple sites of hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy throughout the pelvis including the vaginal cuff. Chemotherapy utilizing pemetrexed and bevacizumab was administered the following week for three treatment cycles until December 2014. In January 2015, another PET scan disclosed new hypermetabolic disease in the left lung measuring 8 mm, additional new hypermetabolic lymph nodes in the left iliac chain, and progression in the liver with multiple metastases.\nGermline BRCA1 and two testing at Myriad Genetics was negative.
