An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan done to rule out appendicitis revealed a 4 \u00d7 3 cm cystic lesion in the region of pancreatic head, and whether the lesion involved the pancreas at its head or not was unknown based on the images (). The differential diagnoses included a choledochal cyst, a retroperitoneal lymphangioma, and a pancreatic cystic lesion. The patient therefore underwent an exploratory laparotomy to obtain a histologic diagnosis. The intraoperative frozen section diagnosis of the cyst wall biopsy was a true pancreatic cyst without malignancy. The cystic lesion was drained and unroofed. Cystic fluid analysis showed an amylase of 60 U/L. The patient's symptoms subsequently resolved after the procedure, and she was placed under close ultrasound surveillance. The surveillance interval period was 3 months for the first follow-up, 5 months for the second follow-up, 8 months for the third follow-up, and then extended to a year.\nFor the next fifteen years, the patient was asymptomatic without any complications and had a successful uncomplicated pregnancy. The abdominal ultrasound surveillance showed the tumor grew in size from 4.2 cm to 6.2 cm in diameter for 15 years. In the latest five months, the patient had noted occasional right mid abdominal pain and discomfort. A pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was then performed due to her recurrent pain and enlargement of the lesion.\nOn gross examination, a multilocular cystic lesion was identified in the head of the pancreas with cysts ranging from 0.5 to 3 cm in size ().

A computed tomography (CT) scan of thorax, abdomen and pelvis showed the presence of multiple liver metastases which were confined to its right lobe. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of his pelvis showed a 7-cm nodular tumour which circumferentially surrounded the rectum, and the local invasion of this tumour was also noted. The whole-body positron emission tomography\u2013CT (PET\u2013CT) scan confirmed the same and showed no evidence of tumour dissemination to any other sites (apart from local invasion and to the right lobe of the liver). He had a successful course of palliative radiotherapy for his rectal bleeding and was started on chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin on a weekly schedule for 6 weeks with a 2-week break. However, the repeat CT scans in April 2007 showed no response to this treatment. His chemotherapy was then changed to a combination of oral capecitabine plus intravenous infusions of oxaliplatin in May 2007; however, he developed significant myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity, and was taken off this regimen. In September 2007, he had a synchronous resection of his liver metastases and the resection of primary rectal tumour with colostomy. Subsequently, his chemotherapy was changed to irinotecan. Unfortunately, in January 2008, his PET scan showed an uptake at the primary tumour site and also in the right lobe of liver; this was also accompanied by the episodes of rectal bleeding.

She did not have family history or past history of suicide or depression. After running the bar for more than 20 years, in 2002 at the age of 70, she handed running the bar over to her employee. The next year, Mr. A, a customer of the bar and her friend for 30 years who was a widower and 4 years older than her, began to make advance towards her, stating his wish to live with her and to guarantee her an adequate income. Issues of money and marriage were of no importance to her, but she began to dream of life with a reliable partner in her golden years.\nWhen she was admitted to hospital with severe hypertension in 2004, Mr. A was unexpectedly cold towards her and she became suspicious of his sincerity towards her. After discharge, repeated episodes of hypertension led to emergency admissions. In 2005, tired of a single life, anxious about the future, and led on by Mr. A's ardent desire to be with her, she decided to live with him.

His physical examination showed regular pulse and his blood pressure was 120/86 mm Hg cardiac palpation and percussion was unremarkable; auscultation showed an accentuated first heart sound, and diastolic rumbling murmur. Chest X-ray showed evidence of pulmonary venous congestion. Transthoracic and transesophageal 2-dimensional echocardiography () revealed a double-orifice mitral valve of incomplete type at the leaflet level. Both orifice sizes were unequal in our patient, with the anterolateral orifice being much smaller than its counterpart. Surprisingly in our patient there was moderate subvalvular fusion and both commisures were fused contrary to other case reports mentioned in literature. Color doppler examination showed 2 separate mitral diastolic flows with mean gradients of 11 and 13 mm of Hg, respectively. There was no left atrial clot seen by transesophageal echocardiography.\nAfter informed written consent, BMV was performed using the Inoue-balloon technique. Initially, PA pressure recording was done and LV angiography recorded in RAO view for assessment of mitral regurgitation. Transseptal catheterization and left atrial placement of the balloon catheter were performed in the usual manner []. As balloon crossing of the anterolateral orifice proved difficult in the previous cases mentioned in literature, we crossed balloon through posteromedial orifice which was readily accomplished []. The posteromedial orifices were dilated using the stepwise dilation technique. Balloon catheter selection was based on the balloon reference size derived from the usual height-based formula and 4 mm less size was taken for first dilation. Following each dilation procedure and after confirming no significant mitral regurgitation or leaflet tears by echocardiography, the balloon size was increased by one mm.

He had been an orphan at the age of three years and was entrusted and adopted to his uncles in Italy at the age of four years. His clinical history indicates no relevant medical problems until the age of nine when he underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis. In the following two years, no disease occurred, and neuromotor and psychiatric development was normal as stated by the primary care paediatrician who visited him during annual health check-ups.\nApproximately one year before admission to our hospital at 12 years of age, the boy began to suffer from severe pains in the left lumbar region. These painful crises were characterized by monthly cadence, sudden onset, extremely high intensity and spontaneous remission within a few tens of minutes. To assess whether the pain depended on the kidney and the urinary tract, renal ultrasonography and renal scintigraphy with technetium-m99 mercaptoacetyltriglycerine (MAG 3) were performed. Echography revealed a grade 3 hydronephrosis (20 mm) in the left kidney. Almost all calyces were observed, and a large renal pelvis without parenchymal thinning was noted. MAG3 revealed good renal function balanced between the two kidneys with only slight reduction of the ureteropelvic drainage on the left side. A ureteropelvic junction obstruction caused by abnormal polar vessels was suspected. A JJ stent was positioned. A few weeks later, laparoscopic robotic pyeloplasty was performed. However, no polar vessels were found.\nDespite this procedure, two months later, he was admitted to a second hospital for left renal colic. Here, radiographic evaluation of the abdomen revealed that the stent was correctly positioned, and renal ultrasonography revealed reduction of the known left pelvic dilation to 17 mm. The abdominal pain was attributed to the prolonged stay of the JJ stent with a supposed coexistence of vesicoureteral reflux caused by the stent itself.",

However, she noticed recurrence of the swelling since 1 year and complains of paresthesia, and difficulty in mouth opening and swallowing in the same since 1 year. There was no significant medical and family history. On extra oral examination, there was difference in relationship of two sides of face due to swelling noted on right side, which was measuring approximately 4 cm \u00d7 9 cm in diameter, extending superiorly from zygomatic arch and infra orbital margin inferiorly to lower border of mandible (). The skin over swelling was stretched with no signs of inflammation. Inspectory findings were confirmed on palpation. Swelling was tender, firm in nature, with diffuse margins, and there is no rise of temperature. On intraoral examination, entire mandibular teeth were missing, soft tissue swelling was seen on the right buccal vestibule, obliterating the vestibule, and no signs of pus discharge and inflammatory component were noted. Buccal and lingual cortical plates were expanded on palpation with perforation of lingual cortical plate in lower first molar region (region 46). Based on patient\u2019s history, and on general examination, a provisional diagnosis of recurrent ameloblastoma was given with a differential diagnosis of ameloblastic carcinoma, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor an odontogenic keratocyst. The patient was advised for further investigations like panoramic radiograph, computed tomography (CT), and biopsy.

At the time of presentation, the patient was also short of breath with initial chest plain, a radiograph (X-ray) showing pulmonary edema is depicted (Figures and 3).\nThe patient was electively intubated before urgent cardiac catheterization, which was performed within 12 hours of patient\u2019s arrival, and revealed 100% occlusion in right coronary, left main coronary, and the proximal portion of the circumflex artery as well as diffuse disease of the grafted vessels to circumflex. Furthermore, during catheterization, the patient was also noted to have hemodynamic compromise with blood pressure observed to be 86/63 mmHg and a heart rate of 115 beats per minute, which prompted emergency echocardiography (ECHO) showing partial disruption of medial papillary muscle with severely flail posterior MV leaflet and severe MR. He subsequently underwent venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) pump placement by cardiothoracic surgery for hemodynamic support accessing through the right common femoral artery and right femoral vein (Figure ).\nHeart team specialists thus discussed the possibility of performing an MV clipping, and it was decided in favor of proceeding with the transcatheter procedure as the patient had a history of median sternotomy and previous bypass surgery. The patient remained intubated and was taken to cath lab on the fifth day of hospitalization.

The transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed severe stenosis of a BAV with a peak velocity of 3.9 m/s (peak gradient 61 mmHg, mean gradient of 39 mmHg and area of 0.89 cm2). There was also the presence of moderate aortic regurgitation. Coronary angiography revealed non-flow limiting coronary artery disease. MSCT confirmed a Sievers Type 1 bicuspid valve with a partial raphe between the right and left cusps. The aortic annulus was large with a perimeter measuring 98 mm, mean Sinus of Valsalva diameter of 40 mm and an inter-commisural distance of 29 mm (Figure ). Both common femoral arteries were of large caliber and measured 8 mm on the left and 9 mm on the right. Following discussion by the Heart team and careful analysis of the MSCT it was felt that TAVI was technically possible if deployed at the inter-commisural space.\nTAVI was performed under local anesthetic and the right femoral artery was cannulated and a 20 Fr sheath was inserted. The left femoral artery was cannulated and a 7 Fr sheath was inserted. The left femoral vein was used for insertion of a temporary pacemaker lead. The bicuspid aortic valve was crossed retrogradely using a Amplatz Left 1 diagnostic catheter and a hydrophilic coated straight tipped Glidewire. This was exchanged for a pre-shaped Safari wire and placed in the left ventricular apex. A balloon valvuloplasty was performed using a 25 mm balloon and a simultaneous aortogram was performed.

When first aid arrived, since anaphylactic shock was suspected, intramuscular steroids, intravenous antihistamine and nebulized salbutamol were administered, with rapid improvement on the part of the patient. The only thing of note in the child\u2019s medical history was allergy to dust mite, and no other allergies were reported. There was no evidence of any insect bite or drug ingestion; an hour before the swim, the child had eaten his usual breakfast, with hot chocolate. Apparently, there was not contact with fish during the swim. The child had never complained of similar symptoms before and had never had urticaria after contact with water, be it seawater or tap water. No familiarity for allergic disease or chronic urticaria was reported. The child was referred to the local Allergy Department and in order to identify the offender, skin tests and specific IgE assays were performed. In detail, they tested allergy to milk, due the history of milk intake before the appearance of symptoms, and to insect venom and fish, because of the possibility of contact with insects and fish during the bath; all the tests were negative. Although the patient developed no symptoms on contact with tap water, an aquagenic urticaria was suspected, but the specific test was negative. Finally, a cold urticaria was suspected but the cold stimulation test (CST) was negative too.

Initial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) identified a hypervascular lesion and arteriovenous shunting lesion on both external carotid artery (ECA) angiograms (). Both lesions suggestive of DAVF showed abnormal retrograde flow from the middle meningeal artery (MMA) and the superficial temporal artery into the superior sagittal sinus, including cortical venous reflux via the arteriovenous shunt (Borden classification II).

The mass exhibited mild heterogeneous enhancement (Fig c). We considered the possibility of primary lung cancer because the patient was young, female, with no relevant family history. No abnormality was evident on gross bronchoscopic and cytological examinations. Blood test data and tumor marker levels were normal.

Although chest CT radiologic findings suggested sclerosing hemangioma or carcinoid tumors, we planned surgical resection because we could not rule out malignancy. During surgery, a mass was evident in the interlobar fissure above the interlobar pulmonary artery.

She described the pain as \u2018stabbing\u2019 pain that radiated to her back. She reported that the pain was exacerbated by oral intake. Although the patient was having regular bowel movements without gross blood, she was noted to have microscopic blood in her stool and was sent for evaluation in the ER. Computerized tomography (CT) with contrast demonstrated evidence of fatty liver, diffuse gallbladder wall thickening, an 8 mm common bile duct, diverticulosis and a normal appendix. Lipase level was found to be within normal limits and there was no leukocytosis. The patient was subsequently transferred to our hospital for further workup.\nPrevious workup for the patient\u2019s abdominal pain included a CT which demonstrated medial insertion of the cystic duct and a positive hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan suspicious for cystic duct obstruction. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy demonstrated mild inflammation of the gastric antrum but showed no evidence of dysplasia, malignancy or Helicobacter pylori infection.\nMRCP performed during the patient\u2019s hospital stay confirmed the patient\u2019s aberrant ductal anatomy, showing a cystic duct coursing parallel and medial to the common bile duct before anastomosing just proximal to the ampulla. CT angiogram did not show evidence of bowel ischemia.\nAlthough the location in the left upper quadrant was not typical of gallbladder pain, cholecystectomy was offered to the patient given the evidence of gallbladder wall thickening. Additionally, workup for alternative etiologies of the abdominal pain, including mesenteric ischemia, had been negative. Patient elected to undergo open cholecystectomy with awareness that her aberrant anatomy put her at increased risk of common bile duct injury as well as the fact that her pain may not be improved by the surgery.\nPatient successfully underwent EGD with stent",

For these reasons, she was referred from a local dental clinic and consulted our center. The patient had no systemic health conditions.

At 4 years and 7 months of age, the patient presented to our institution with typical signs and symptoms of KD (persistent fever up to 39\u2103 for 10 days accompanied with conjunctival injection and a strawberry tongue). Consequently, the patient received intravenous gamma globulin and aspirin, which resulted in a prompt resolution of the fever and improvement of symptoms. Two-dimensional echocardiography performed during the acute phase of the illness demonstrated fusiform aneurysms of the right coronary artery (RCA) (10 mm in diameter), left anterior descending (LAD) branch (7 mm), and left circumflex (3.7 mm), as well as dilatation of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) (4 mm). However, there was normal systolic ventricular function without regional wall motion abnormalities. The patient was given low-dose aspirin and discharged from the institution. After discharge the patient was free of symptoms. An echocardiogram performed 15 months after the onset of illness demonstrated mildly improved fusiform aneurysms of the RCA (8.4 mm) and LAD (5 mm), as well as improved dilatation of LMCA (3.4 mm). However, there was no change in the left circumflex lesion. The patient was continued on a therapy of low-dose aspirin and remained asymptomatic.

The patient presented clinically with a midline diastema of 1.5\u20132 mm. She reported that she had lost two maxillary central incisors due to trauma when she was a teenager. Ten years later, she received orthodontic treatment that moved the lateral incisors into the central incisor positions and the canines into the lateral incisor positions. The right lateral incisor also received an endodontic treatment followed by a casting post and core with porcelain fused to a metal crown (PFM). The left lateral incisor was built up with a direct resin composite (Figures and ). The mesiodistal width dimension of left and right lateral incisors was increased by 1 mm each in order to transform the lateral incisors into maxillary incisors. Gingival recession of about 0.5 mm was presented at the distolabial aspect of the left lateral incisor, resulting in gingival level disharmony (). A shine-through effect in a metal ceramic crown and cast metal post was also observed (). Orthodontic treatment and all restorations were completed in a private clinic more than 13 years ago. A periapical radiograph showed that both lateral incisors had horizontal bone loss at cervical 1/3 of the roots. The distance from the estimated contact point to the alveolar bone was about 8 mm (Figures and ). This suggested that it was unlikely that a restorative technique alone would completely close the space.\nThe primary treatment objective was to restore a normal appearance of both \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cpink\u201d esthetics to the maxillary anterior teeth. Based on the objective and given the clinical and radiographic features, two treatment options were proposed to the patient.

Also, there was a dilated vessel along the posteromedial and inferior of the mass (Figure ).\nAfter the chest CT findings, the patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and cardiac consult was called. In order to differentiate if the mass was due to some tumor or some anomaly of the coronary vessel, coronary CT angiography with contrast was ordered. A subsequent coronary CT angiography (CCTA) showed a 9.7 cm aneurysm and an anomalous vessel emanating from the left coronary artery and the proximal circumflex, fistulizing into the right atrial appendage. CCTA also showed a dilated right atrium likely due to fistula formation (Figures -).\nWhen the right heart catheterization was performed, a rise in saturation was noted in the right side of the heart due to shunting of blood from the left side to the right side of the heart as a result of coronary cameral fistula formation between the right heart and the anomalous vessel originating from the left coronary artery and proximal circumflex artery. On transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), an enlarged right atrial chamber was noted due to the fistulous tract draining into the right atrium.

The convulsions were generalized, tonic-clonic, and were associated with tongue biting, fecal and urinary incontinence as well as postictal confusion. The seizures lasted for about ten minutes. They were recurrent with episodes occurring on a monthly basis. The fever was of gradual onset, high grade, intermittent in pattern, relieved temporarily by medications and cold sponging. There were no associated rigors or chills. She was reported to be having poor appetite and sleep. She had a history of multiple previous admissions in different hospitals for the management of her seizures. However, no brain imaging had previously been done. Her past medical history was significant for delayed motor, language, and cognitive functions. She was bedridden and needed nursing care since childhood. She had a skin lesion on her face since her birth. There was no significant past surgical history. She was on anti-epileptic medications, but there was no available record.\nOn inspection, a young female of average height and build was lying in a drowsy state. She had a dark, pigmented skin lesion on the midline of her face. The lesion was dark brown in color, extending from the submental region to the lower lip and then extending from her nasal bridge to her forehead in the same midline plane (Figure ).\nThe lesion was greasy on touch.

Physical examination revealed multiple subcutaneous tender \u201cstony consistency\u201d masses with erythema involving her breast, buttocks, thigh, and back. Areas of thickened skin were also noticed in multiple areas involving sternum and thighs. Laboratory workup revealed moderate leukocytosis with left shift. Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) revealed extensive infiltration of the soft tissue planes involving breast, back, and gluteal areas (Figures and ). She was treated with ibuprofen 400 mg every 8 hours and a short course of corticosteroids prednisone 40 mg daily with tapering dose for 4 weeks without significant improvement.\nFor the next few years, she had multiple admissions due to chronic pain involving breasts, buttock, and back. In 2009, she underwent bilateral mastectomy. The histopathological examination of biopsy specimen of breast showed foreign material reaction with microscopic and macroscopic fibrous loculation, giant cell reaction, and fibrosis (). However, she continued to have silicone migration to her neck and anterior chest leading to multiple debulking surgeries in 2011 and 2012, and CT chest still showed extensive infiltrative even after multiple debulking procedures (). The histopathological examination of biopsy specimen from anterior chest revealed muscle tissue with fibrosis, fat necrosis, giant cell reaction with chronic inflammation, and calcifications as shown in .\nShe continued to have multiple admissions for pain in her chest and back and swelling in her neck. She was intubated electively in 2015 for airway protection due to increased swelling.

She had previously received modified radical mastectomies in both breasts, one for ductal carcinoma in situ in the left breast 7 years prior, and another for LPS in the right breast in 2014. She experienced menarche at the age of 14 and had regular cyclical periods. Menopause age was 49 years old. She had her 1st child at 26 years old and the child had been breastfed. There was no history of oral contraceptive use, and she had no family history of breast cancer.\nThe endocrine adjuvant therapy for her left breast ductal carcinoma in situ was tamoxifen for 5 years, and no radiotherapy had been given. The LPS mass was 1.8 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm in her right upper quadrant breast. No postoperative adjuvant therapy was administered after the surgery.\nAfter physical and imaging examinations, bulk pleural effusion and multiple masses in the pleura were discovered by computed tomography (CT) scan when the patient came to our inpatient department. Core needle biopsy of the pleural mass identified a metastatic LPS (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry was positive for S100 proteins (Fig. ).\nAfter discussion in a breast cancer multidisciplinary team meeting, considering the relatively milder side effects of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) than doxorubicin, we decided to treat the patient with a regimen of PLD, ifosfamide, and pleural cavity infusion of recombinant human interleukin 2.

Additionally, chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a tumor in the LA; thus, he was diagnosed with acute left heart failure caused by the mass that obstructed cardiac blood flow (Fig. ).\nAn emergency surgery was performed under cardiac arrest with extracorporeal circulation, which was established in the usual manner with bicaval direct cannulation.

The tumor pedicle widely and irregularly originated from the right upper and posterior LA wall and extended to the lateral LA wall, which included the right upper pulmonary vein. The tumor was visibly extirpated and invaded the LA wall (Fig. ). The shape and function of the mitral valve were intact, and the large defect in the LA wall was reconstructed using a bovine pericardial patch. It was 159 min under extracorporeal circulation, and the aortic cross-clamping time was 123 min.\nExtracorporeal circulation weaning and post-operative course were uneventful, and arthralgia in both lower limbs disappeared immediately after surgery.

Subsequently, as imaging studies soon and 3 months after surgery did not reveal tumor presence, we decided to adopt a more suitable treatment strategy without involving adjuvant therapy after surgery if UPS relapse or metastasis occurred. Specifically, we planned to perform re-surgical resection or proton radiotherapy for recurred or metastatic tumors. In addition, we planned to initiate systemic chemotherapy",

Her smartwatch had alarmed several times during the preceding night that her pulse rate exceeded 120 beats per minute (bpm) whilst she was inactive and indicated a fluctuating rate of 130\u2013140 bpm. The smartwatch (Apple Watch Series 2, Apple Inc.) had been used without any medical or diagnostic intention and did not have any specific features to diagnose arrhythmias. The patient remained tachycardic the following morning but felt well and was asymptomatic. She denied palpitations, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath or infective symptoms. She gave a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, obesity, temporal lobe epilepsy and osteoarthritis. She was a non-smoker and drank alcohol only very occasionally. Two months prior she had suffered a TIA which had been managed in accordance with the locally implemented national stroke guidelines. One day before her TIA she had a brief episode of diaphoresis and palpitations, her smartwatch had then indicated a heart rate of 144 bpm. When reviewed by the stroke team, she was found to be in sinus rhythm, computed tomography of her brain was normal, bilateral carotid dopplers showed no evidence of atheroma. She was also found to be in sinus rhythm throughout during an outpatient 24 hour ECG that was recorded a fortnight after her presentation. Myocardial perfusion imaging in the past had shown no evidence of ischaemia and a normal ejection fraction. On examination, she was comfortable but had an irregular pulse and a heart rate that was fluctuating between 130 and 140 bpm. The rest of her observations were normal. ECG showed AF with a fast ventricular response. There was no evidence of heart failure, valvular disease or an infection clinically.

    "original_text": "A 59-year-old female with a history of non-anticoagulated paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, dyslipidaemia, and tobacco use was admitted with anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Her chest pain started 2 days before she sought medical advice. ECG showed sinus rhythm with ST-elevation in the anterolateral leads with established deep Q waves in leads V1\u2013V4. She was taken directly to the catheterization laboratory where diagnostic coronary angiogram revealed occluded mid left anterior descending artery (LAD) with otherwise unobstructed vessels. Revascularization of LAD was attempted with balloon angioplasty several times but with no restoration of flow. Due to resolution of symptoms and a relatively small-calibre vessel, the procedure was abandoned. Routine post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) transthoracic echocardiography showed akinesia of the apex and apical walls with moderately impaired left ventricular systolic function. Following stabilization, she was discharged with optimal medical therapy. After 2 months, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to assess for myocardial viability to guide the need for further revascularization attempts and this showed transmural myocardial infarction in the mid to apical LAD territory. There was a large left ventricular apical septum pseudoaneurysm measuring \u223c 80 \u00d7 55 mm with laminar thrombus and markedly increased left ventricular volume (Figure ). The pseudoaneurysm was contained within the pericardial space with the pericardium forming its walls. Despite the large pseudoaneurysm, 13 segments of the left ventricle were viable. A routine repeat transthoracic echocardiography with contrast demonstrated a large apical myocardial rupture and apical pseudoaneurysm (Figure ).\nTo guide the optimal intervention strategy and for better anatomic delineation, cardiac computed tomography (CT) was performed and this confirmed a large apical pseudoaneurysm measuring 95 \u00d7 64 mm with significant increase in the size of thrombus occupying more than half of the cavity (Figure ). The patient underwent urgent surgical repair at which time a huge friable clot was found within the pseudoaneurysm (Figure ). She had an uneventful postoperative recovery and continued to do well at 6-",

She was taken to the nearest hospital then, for left arm pain, where anteroposterior (AP) and lateral plain X-rays of left humerus showed a minimally displaced transverse fracture at the distal third shaft of the humerus (Figure ). The patient was managed conservatively with a Plaster of Paris (POP) back slab that was replaced by a POP full cast. However, X-ray performed after a period of six weeks showed no callus formation indicating delayed union along with the disappearance of the bone. (Figure ). Serial X-rays taken thereafter showed the persistence of fracture and bone resorption at the site along with generalized osteopenia in the shaft (Figure ). Hence, she was diagnosed with osteomyelitis and treated accordingly. Following no significant improvement of her symptoms and increased bone resorption at the fracture site as seen on X-rays, she was referred to our setup and was admitted for a detailed workup. A thorough evaluation was undertaken at our institution. A careful examination of the patient's left upper limb revealed global decreased muscle strength and limited motion of the left forearm. All active movements in the affected limb were mildly painful and limited at the shoulder and elbow joint, most notably flexion and extension. Wrist movements including gripping were normal. No neurologic deficits were found. A gap of nearly 3 cm was palpable in the distal part of the arm with palpable non-tender bony ends. Soft tissue swelling was absent and no lump was palpable along the length of the humerus. The skin overlying the fracture was normal. X-ray of the left arm was repeated, which showed marked disappearance of bone at fracture site resulting in a gap of 2-3 cm with taper",
