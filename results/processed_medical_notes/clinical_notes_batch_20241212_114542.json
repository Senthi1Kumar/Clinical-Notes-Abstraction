    "original_text": "A 73-year-old Japanese man on PD presented with progressive worsening of abdominal pain and cloudy peritoneal fluid. He had high blood pressure, and he started continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) because of hypertensive nephrosclerosis 8 years previously. A PD catheter was primarily inserted at the right abdomen, but it was removed and inserted at the left abdomen because of exit site and tunnel infection 5 years previously. He had no past medical history of diabetes mellitus and major abdominal surgery. In the peritoneal equilibration test, his result was high. Bloody ascites was not evident. One year previously, he had been hospitalized for PD-associated peritonitis caused by touch contamination that was treated with intraperitoneal cephazoline and cephtazidime. Bowel adhesion was not noted 5 years previously; however, local bowel adhesions and agglomeration of the intestine were detected by computed tomography (CT) after the identification of PD-associated peritonitis (Fig. , ). The major findings of EPS, such as peritoneal thickening and calcification, were not noted on CT.\nOn physical examination, his blood pressure was 134/74 mmHg, pulse rate was 76 beats/min, and temperature was 99.7 \u00b0 F. He complained of severe pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, and this area was tender on palpation. The exit site was clear. Laboratory tests revealed mild inflammation, with a white blood cell count of 10,100 /\u03bcL and C-reactive protein level of 0.9 mg/dL. The peritoneal fluid cell count was increased at 980 /mL.

Following the IVC insertion, he had been treated with warfarin for one year and had been on anti-platelet therapy since.\nHe had been admitted to the hospital three days prior to transfer after presenting with progressive bilateral lower extremity pain and decreased sensation in his gluteal region. Acute bilateral DVTs involving the common femoral and popliteal veins were diagnosed. Over 48 h, despite receiving unfractionated heparin, he developed anuric renal failure and shock. Placement of a right internal jugular dialysis catheter was complicated by airway compromise due to a retropharyngeal haematoma necessitating endotracheal intubation. The heparin infusion was discontinued and the patient was transferred to our hospital.\nOn arrival, his mean arterial pressure was 71 (104/53) mmHg while on norepinephrine, vasopressin, and phenylephrine. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.06, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 28 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 312 mmHg, and a lactate of 16 mmol/L. The platelet count was 31 K/\u03bcL. Examination was notable for tense bilateral lower extremity oedema. Dorsalis pedis pulses were detectable with Doppler ultrasound. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed dilation of the distal IVC suggesting thrombosis (Fig. A). Transthoracic echocardiography showed a 25% ejection fraction with no right ventricular dilation or strain. The IVC was collapsible proximal to the hepatic veins. Lower extremity ultrasound confirmed acute bilateral DVTs involving the external iliac and femoral veins.

Three days before her hospital visit, the patient drank about 2,000 mL beer because of heavy stress. Normally she drank 1,500-2,000 mL beer twice a week. Two days later, she ate fried chicken for lunch and after 1-2 hours generalized urticaria and lip swelling developed, accompanied by dyspnea and light-headedness. However, there was no loss of consciousness. The patient recovered after a few hours of rest, although pruritus and general weakness remained. The following day, the patient underwent blood tests at a local hospital and marked elevations in her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were noted. When the patient arrived at the hospital, her blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg and urticaria with pruritus observed. She was treated with an antihistamine and steroids and referred to the emergency department at our hospital for further evaluation.\nThe patient had experienced five similar episodes in the past. The first episode occurred 10 years previously. At that time, the patient was suffering from stress brought on by overwork.

At physical examination, a palpable nodule of ~2 cm in size was detected in the isthmus of the thyroid. There were no palpable cervical lymph-nodes. An US evaluation confirmed an isolated lesion located in the isthmus, showing an isoechoic solid nodule with smooth margins; its size was 18 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 6 mm with intra and perilesional vascularity (Figure ). Therefore, a FNA was performed and cytological results revealed a TIR3A lesion. The cytological specimen showed an increased cellularity with some microfollicular structures in the background of scant colloid (Figure ). Thus, we assessed the risk factors associated with the isolated TIR 3A nodule of our patient. According to the ATA guidelines we repeated the FNA which confirmed the same result (TIR3A).

Echocardiographic evaluation showed floating, pedunculated, soft thrombus in the cardiac chambers, attached to left atrial appendage, mitral apparatus, right atrial cavity, and at right ventricle apex (). CT angiography showed a common filling defect within the femoral bifurcations extending to the superficial femoral artery. The proximal and mid-superficial femoral artery showed absent filling. Reconstitution of flow seen in the distal femoral artery. Popliteal artery was not opacified suggestive of occlusion (). The patient underwent emergency right sided superficial femoral arterial thromboembolectomy (for SFA long segment thrombosis) and below knee amputation. Infective endocarditis with distal embolization was suspected, and the patient was started on empirical antibiotics. Post procedure she was started on heparin infusion along with antiplatelets.\nMultiple sets of blood cultures were sent, which were reported as negative. Prothrombotic workup was sent including anti-nuclear acid test, antiphospholipid antibody workup, and homocysteine levels. All the tests were negative.

His ECG showed sinus rhythm with RBBB and his chest radiograph was normal without evidence of free air. During the observation period at ED, suddenly his systolic blood pressure was dropped to 90 mmHg with sinus tachycardia. Ongoing severe abdominal pain was mentioned. He received abdominal computed tomography (CT) under the initial impression of hollow organ perforation with septic shock. However, CT scan showed massive hyperdense ascites surrounded around the spleen without free air (Figures and ). Grade II of spleen laceration was found on this CT scan. Therefore, spleen laceration with hemoperitoneum as the complication of colonoscopy was impressed. General Surgeon was consulted at the same time. Due to the fact that severity of spleen laceration is grade II, conservative treatment was suggested. He received blood transfusion with PRBC 2U; then, he was admitted to ward. After admission, his hemodynamic status was stable with improving symptoms. So, he was discharged from our hospital 3 days later. However, LUQ pain was noted on the same day of discharge, so he came back to our ED immediately. Abdominal and pelvic CT was arranged again with progressing ascites compared to previous study.",

He discontinued smoking 9 months before the first visit following development of this cough and had never taken an ACE-I. Although he did not complain of heartburn and other symptoms suggestive of GERD, endoscopic assessment of the esophagus revealed reflux esophagitis (Los Angeles classification Grade B). He had had no respiratory infections during the 8-week period preceding the first visit. No abnormal shadows were noted on chest or paranasal sinus X-rays and chest CT scan.

Airway reversibility to inhaled \u03b22 agonist was 6.5%, and testing for bronchial responsiveness to methacholine and cough reflex sensitivity revealed no hyperresponsiveness (29053 \u03bcg/ml) and no hypersensitivity (500 \u03bcM). Cell fractionation of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed percentages of macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils of 91%, 7%, 1.7%, and 0.3%, respectively. Cough was evaluated based on frequency and intensity as follows: 10 = cough level at the first visit, 5 = half the level at the first visit, 0 = none. Neither bronchodilator therapy nor anti-inflammatory therapy improved the cough. PPI was given after discontinuing bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy. The cough was markedly improved 2 weeks after initiation of PPI (cough level 1), but returned nearly to pretreatment level 3 weeks after discontinuation of PPI (cough level 7, cough sensitivity 62.5 \u03bcM). On 24-h esophageal pH monitoring performed prior to re-initiation of PPI to determine the reason cough improved with PPI, the probe was positioned in the lower esophagus 5 cm above the upper border of the lower esophageal sphincter. Acid reflux in the esophagus was considered present if pH was 4 or less []. Some cough and acid reflux were observed, little cough",

Her blood analyses were normal. A physical examination was unremarkable. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed an intrahepatic neoplastic lesion of 38 mm localized in the gallbladder bed associated with multiple spleen, pulmonary, and peritoneal metastases. Serum levels of CA19-9 were increased (1100 U/mL; reference range less than 37 U/mL). She was then referred to our oncology division. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) was equal to 0; a physical examination found only mild abdominal tenderness. In October 2015 an ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed on the intrahepatic lesion. Pathological analysis revealed the presence of bile duct adenocarcinoma cells; immunohistochemistry showed strong expression for CK19. A pulmonary biopsy on one of the secondary lesions confirmed the diagnosis of lung metastasis. From November 2015 to January 2016 she underwent first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin (25 mg per square meter of body surface area) followed by gemcitabine (1000 mg per square meter), each administered on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks []. After three courses of treatment, a CT scan showed a condition of stable disease assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) evaluation criteria. Her serum levels of CA19-9 were slightly decreased to 576 U/mL. No signs of bone marrow toxicity were observed; grade 1 of gastrointestinal toxicity was recorded (nausea and vomiting). She was then treated with an additional three courses of cisplatin-gemcitabine. A following CT scan revealed a dimensional increase of lung metastases with a 10% increase by RECIST criteria, whereas no changes were observed in the other lesions; her CA19-9 serum levels were increased to 753 U/mL. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia was observed soon after the fourth cycle of chemotherapy; the doses were then reduced by 10%. Grade 1 constipation",

Her personal history revealed a spontaneous abortion and no consanguinity. She underwent routine ultrasonographic examinations at 13, 22, and 30 gestational weeks at a regional hospital; however, at 35 gestational weeks, ultrasonography revealed an abnormal fetal thoracic wall.\nPrenatal ultrasonography revealed a fetal thoracoabdominal wall defect with partial displacement of the left ventricle and the liver associated with rotation and elongation of the heart and a high index of clinical suspicion for intracardiac malformations such as tricuspid atresia, a ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary artery hypoplasia (Figures \u2013).\nBased on the aforementioned findings, she was admitted to the Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic in T\u00e2rgu Mure at 39 gestational weeks, where she underwent a cesarean section. The male newborn weighed 3,100 g with an APGAR score of 7.

There was no history of rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic or inflammatory disease, preceding pelvic trauma, or coagulation disorder. Laboratory investigations including red and white blood count with differential count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, liver and renal function tests, and tumours markers (CEA, CA19-9) were normal. On examination, the range of movement of the hip was complete and a tender, nonpulsatile mass was palpable in the proximal third of the right thigh. Conventional radiographs of the hip showed minor findings of degenerative osteoarthritis of the right hip. An abdominal ultrasonography was also performed because she had lower abdominal pain finding no abdominal abnormalities in the major organs (uterus, ovary, urinary bladder, kidney, liver, gallbladder, spleen, and pancreas). An MRI scan confirmed the presence of a cystic lesion very close to the femoral nerve that appears dislocated and compressed as well as femoral vein and artery. The cyst seems to be connected and originate from the hip joint. However, a ColorDoppler examination revealed no pathologic compression or blood-flow reduction of femoral vessels and the pulses in the distal leg were normal.

MRI of the cervical spine demonstrated multilevel cervical degenerative disc disease with reversal of normal lordosis and a kyphotic deformity in addition to varying levels of moderate to severe central canal stenosis from C4-T1 and moderate to severe bilateral foraminal stenosis at almost every level, especially on the right side (Figure ).\nWe discussed the various conservative and surgical options with the patient, and it was determined that surgery would provide the best chance to stop the progression of her neurological symptoms. Due to her cervical kyphosis, we opted for an anterior approach to restore vertebral column height and lordotic curvature. The anterior fusion would supplement with posterior instrumentation given the number of levels requiring fusion.\nDescription of the surgery\nThe left-sided approach was chosen to theoretically decrease the risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. A transverse incision was created extending from medical sternocleidomastoid to midline in existing neck crease, planned using fluoroscopic localization overlying the C5-6 interspace. Standard neck dissection was performed. Omohyoid muscle was divided sharply (and reapproximated at the end of the case). Discectomy and graft placement proceeded superiorly to inferiorly with Caspar pin retractors for retraction two levels at a time, C3-5, C5-7, then C7-T1. The posterior osteophyte complexes were removed to decompress the spinal cord and exiting nerve roots. Six-degree lordotic cages were used at each level to restore natural cervical lordosis.

Medical history revealed hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, severe gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) with hiatal hernia and a family history of gastric cancer (father and uncle). No previous abdominal surgery was reported. A preoperative upper endoscopy (UE) showed antral gastritis with extensive intestinal metaplasia (the helicobacter pylori test was negative); a medium size hiatal hernia was confirmed, as well as grade B esophagitis (Los Angeles classification). Echography revealed hepatic steatosis with no biliary tract alteration. Psychiatric evaluation did not find any contraindication for a bariatric procedure, suggesting a restrictive procedure. After a multidisciplinary counseling, we finally indicated a restrictive procedure for the patient. Being aware of the potential worsening of GERD related to sleeve gastrectomy, and particularly worried for the impossibility of endoscopic surveillance of his intestinal metaplasia in case of standard RYGBP, the patient agreed to undergo RYGBP with remnant gastrectomy, aware of the increased operative risk. A standard 6 trocar access was performed (). Greater gastric curvature was firstly dissected, medially to laterally, and the fundus completely mobilized, dividing the short gastric vessels. Right gastro epiploic and right gastric vessels were divided close to the gastric wall, and the duodenum was then divided using a 60 mm endoscopic linear stapler. Gastric resection was completed stapling the stomach on a 37-French calibration tube, creating a gastric pouch of 40 cc. An antecolic antegastric RYGBP was finally performed (). The remnant was extracted by an enlargement of a midline trocar and two drains were left in place.

As part of the routine postoperative follow-up management, the recipient underwent DUS to assess the patency of the graft on postoperative day 1. The DUS finding was suspicious for an acute arterial thrombosis but did not reveal any focal irregularities. Consequently, a computed tomography (CT) scan was urgently obtained but it did not show any arterial complications. However, it serendipitously revealed a 2.4-cm lesion on the upper pole of the renal allograft which was not detected during the back-table or ultrasonography monitoring. A biopsy of the lesion was performed, and its histology revealed an epithelial proliferation of large cells with finely granular cytoplasm and medium round nucleus vesicular acidophilus, arranged tubules, and alveoli and cords immersed in a connective tissue stroma. This picture was consistent with oncocytoma. However, because the eosinophilic variant of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (RCC) may morphologically resemble renal oncocytoma, immunohistochemical staining was performed using Ki-67 antibodies and RCC antigens. The results were negative, ruling out chromophobe RCC. The therapeutic options and potential related outcomes were clearly discussed with the patient. Given the low risk of malignant transformation in an oncocytoma [], we found no reason for resection of the lesion or an allograft nephrectomy. Consequently, we opted for active surveillance of the benign tumor with ultrasonography, every 2 months, for the first year and, then, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), every year (Fig. ).

Routine genetic testing revealed compound heterozygosity (c.350A > G, p.Y117C, c.400_401AC > CA, p.T134H) for different TNSALP missense mutations in exon 5 of the ALPL gene, confirming the diagnosis of HPP. On presentation, radiologic assessment of the left hand and arm showed tongue-like lucencies projecting into the metaphyses consistent with childhood HPP. She did not have any clinical features of skeletal involvement of the lower limbs and no motor developmental delay except for a mild waddling gait as a younger child. The patient had a relatively asymptomatic clinical course until she presented at age 11 years with swelling and tenderness of the left ankle that was nonresponsive to paracetamol or ibuprofen. An MRI scan of the ankle suggested a diagnosis of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, which was subsequently confirmed by biopsy. The symptoms of pain and swelling of the lower limb joints showed spontaneous transient improvement at age 13 years. Recurring at age 14 years, the symptoms fluctuated and caused significant pain and disability. These symptoms eventually stabilized when the patient was transitioned to adult care at age 17 years. At age 18 years, she successfully underwent radiofrequency ablation for Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, a cardiac disorder unrelated to HPP.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 37-year-old primipara woman. She had a history of uterine fibroids and cystectomy due to rupture of ovarian endometrial cyst. Transvaginal ultrasound performed at 5 weeks of gestation revealed a 6 cm fibroid in the fundus of the uterus.\nAt 16 weeks and 6 days of gestation, the patient developed abdominal pain and genital bleeding and was admitted to our hospital. On speculum examination, the cervix was impossible to visualize, and slight bleeding was observed. On vaginal examination, a solid mass was palpated in the pouch of Douglas, and the external uterine orifice was displaced above the symphysis pubis. Based on these findings, uterine incarceration was suspected. To reduce the incarceration and relieve her symptoms, she was instructed to assume a knee-to-chest position after micturition. However, at 18 weeks and 4 days of gestation, the abdominal pain and genital bleeding persisted and the physical findings remained unchanged. At 18 weeks and 5 days of gestation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was additionally performed to obtain more detailed findings. MRI showed a large fibroid engaged in the pouch of Douglas and a cranioventrally stretched cervix. The uterus was strongly retroverted; therefore the fundus and the posterior wall of uterus were entrapped in the pelvis between the sacral promontory and pubic symphysis (). Based on MRI findings, the patient was diagnosed with uterine incarceration and threatened abortion.\nAfter that, she remained in the hospital and continued with the same management; however, the maneuver was unsuccessful. Therefore, manual reduction of the incarceration was planned. However, at 19 weeks and 5 days of gestation, IUFD occurred.

The average outside temperature that night was in the mid to upper 60s. The patient was initially found by local police officers lying unconscious in a ditch next to his bicycle. When EMS arrived on scene the patient was cold, unresponsive, GCS 3, covered in ants and without any other obvious signs of skeletal or traumatic injury. The patient was fully immobilized in a cervical collar and on a backboard prior to transport to the ED and was intubated secondary to his low GCS. The patient's vitals at the time showed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 30-40s, palpable pulse but an unobtainable blood pressure on multiple attempts.\nAt 08:22 the patient arrived at the ED and upon transfer to the trauma bed was noted to be in ventricular fibrillation. At that time AED pads were attached and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol was initiated. Trauma protocol labs were sent which consisted of CBC, CMP, serum cortisol, serum ETOH, amylase, TSH, cardiac enzymes, and a coagulation profile.\nDuring the resuscitation the emergency room physician and trauma surgeon noted that the patient was very cold to the touch. A rectal temperature was performed but the temperature did not register. Per trauma protocol, the patient was being given warm IV fluids as well as warm humidified air via mechanical ventilation. It was not until 09:06 that the patient's temperature was accurately recorded to be 24.9\u00b0C (76.9\u00b0F).

    "original_text": "An 82-year-old woman presented with a 2-week history of a sudden onset of acute lower back pain and worsening mobility. She did not report any other significant medical history. A clinical examination revealed a patient who was clinically dehydrated. She was pyrexial (39\u00b0C), tachycardic (pulse rate of 105/minute) and hypotensive (blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg on admission). Abdominal, chest and musculoskeletal examinations and urine analysis did not reveal any significant findings that could be attributed to her worsening sepsis. She had a leucocytosis level of 19,600, which increased to 40,700 in 24 hours, accompanied by worsening pain and pyrexia. She was also noted to be oliguric. Her lower back pain worsened and resulted in her becoming bedridden within 24 hours.\nAppropriate resuscitative measures were initiated upon admission. She was also commenced on broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics. An ultrasound scan and a computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen were performed. These revealed an abnormal infrarenal aorta with evidence of stranding of periaortic fat planes and a localised perforation resulting in a contained leak into the surrounding soft tissue (Figures and ). The iliacs were not involved and there was no evidence of an aneurysm. The blood cultures that were taken on admission confirmed the presence of Staphylococcal aureus. The overall findings were consistent with abdominal aortitis. A white cell scan was not performed as this would have caused a delay to the operation on this patient. She was classified as high-risk for a general or spinal anaesthetic, therefore an endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) was carried out under local anaesthetic. Her common femoral artery was exposed and punctured under direct vision and a sheath was introduced.

She was found to carry familial heterozygous missense TP53 gene mutation in exon 7 causing nucleotide change c.733G>A with corresponding amino acid change p.G245S in the gene protein. Her two other children from the same partner, aged fourteen and four years, also carried the same mutation. Her partner did not carry the mutation and she had no family history of cancer.\nHence she was enrolled in the high-risk cancer screening program, eighteen months later, she presented with a cough with white sputum and upper back pain. Symptoms did not improve with the course of antibiotics, therefore, she underwent further evaluation. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest (Figure , left panel) showed a right upper lobe mass. Bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy of this mass were diagnostic of lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation, clinical stage was T3N2M1, stage IV. Staging positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the osteoblastic lesions involving the thoracic spine. Evaluation by neurosurgery deemed the patient not a candidate for surgical intervention, therefore she was treated with external beam radiation therapy of 30 Gray to the thoracic spine in ten fractions for impending cord compression.\nAs the tumor was EGFR mutated, treatment with erlotinib 150 mg by mouth once daily was recommended. Within two weeks of the treatment, she reported improvement in cough and back pain. Later, she developed flares of moderate cutaneous toxicity (as defined under international EGFR inhibitor dermatological toxicity grading system) to erlotinib.

The patient described the acute onset of left-sided facial weakness that waxed and waned, recurring several times throughout the day, and lasting 2\u20133 minutes at a time. The left facial weakness was also associated with mild, left-arm weakness and \u201cclumsiness\u201d involving fine motor function of her left hand. She noted lightheadedness but denied leg weakness, headache, visual changes, chest pain or shortness of breath. She also noted that symptoms were brought on by use of her upper extremities and when she changed her body position from lying to sitting. She denied any similar symptoms previously or stroke history. Of note, she noticed a rapid improvement in her symptoms to resolution just prior to ED presentation.\nOn examination, her blood pressure (BP) was 183/86 millimeters of mercury (mmHg). She was awake, alert, oriented, and able to describe a detailed history. Her cranial nerves were intact, motor strength was 5/5 bilaterally, and fine motor movements in both her hands were normal. There was no ataxia, extraocular muscle dysfunction, or indication of posterior circulation involvement.\nJust after her initial asymptomatic presentation to the ED, her symptoms recurred when her systolic BP dropped by 20 mmHg upon standing from a supine position. Emergent computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the head and neck demonstrated a severe flow-limiting lesion of the innominate artery ().

He was diagnosed five months ago with a case of ENKTCL, nasal type, stage IV-B with testicular and central nervous system involvement with 23% natural killer (NK) cells on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow cytometry. He was on an active therapeutic plan consisting of cycles of chemotherapy (i.e., SMILE protocol: dexamethasone, methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase, etoposide), to which there was a complete response in the form of negative flow cytometry and computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Five months after the initial diagnosis, prior to the fourth cycle of treatment, a complaint of blurriness of right eye vision was made. Brain CT was done aiming to rule out ocular involvement, which turned out to be unremarkable. At the time of the complaint, visual acuity was 20/30 -2 in the right eye as opposed to 20/20 in the left eye. The right eye showed relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular muscle movements were competent in both eyes. On examination of the anterior chamber, +1 cells were visualized in the right eye only. On dilated fundus examination, there was vitritis in the right eye which obscured the vision. Left eye examination was insignificant. B scan ocular ultrasonography revealed retinal detachment in the right eye. An optic CT revealed vitritis in the right eye; an impression of disease infiltration of the eye was made. The therapeutic plan was a diagnostic vitrectomy followed by systemic therapy.

    "original_text": "This study describes a case of a 43-year-old female with a history of traumatic brain injury secondary to a motor vehicle accident in June 2004. The patient had no history of psychiatric illness. She sustained multiple fractures, including a right-sided occipital fracture, C2 fracture, right scapula fracture and multiple rib fractures. She presented to our outpatient clinic complaining of right-sided headaches and neck and shoulder pain. She complained of pain which was 8/10 on the visual analog scale (VAS) in her neck, right shoulder and right side of the head. She described pain as a tight vice like gripping with paresthesias. The pain was alleviated by heat and massage and aggravated by increased activity and sleep. She was taking morphine 30 mg two times per day.

He visited a local hospital for first aid in 2016. In addition, dry ejaculation has also disturbed for more than one year before medical intervention. The patient did not complain about any episode of hematuria, fever, or loss of weight. TRUS showed an estimated volume of 230 cm3, irregular shape with heterogeneous echotexture, and multiple cysts. A systemic core needle biopsy revealed nodular hyperplasia with inflammation and some atypical glands but no evidence of malignancy. Because of the former failed medical treatments and the recurrent weak urinary stream and urine retention, two transurethral resections of the prostate (TURP) were undertaken during a short 4-month interval (April and July 2016).
