    "original_text": "A 55-year-old man with a history of extensive alcohol and tobacco use presented with a 2-month history of a progressively enlarging, 5-cm ulcerative, and painful midline tongue lesion extending to the floor of mouth resulting in an anterior tongue cleft. This lesion was associated with unintentional weight loss, left otalgia, and submandibular swelling. Bilateral nontender palpable lymphadenopathy in levels I, II, and III were present.\nPrior biopsies by an otolaryngologist in private practice did not demonstrate carcinoma but were otherwise inconclusive with reactive inflammatory changes. However, a positron emission tomography scan revealed hypermetabolic lesions of the anterior tongue as well as lymph nodes bilaterally in levels I, II, and III suggestive of malignancy (). The assessment was a likely T3/4N2cM0 tongue squamous cell carcinoma. He underwent a panendoscopy with biopsies and a physical examination under anesthesia for surgical planning. Biopsy results again did not yield carcinoma but showed granulomatous inflammation without organisms present.\nA multidisciplinary tumor board recommended a rheumatologic workup and an excisional lymph node biopsy. Lymph node biopsy results demonstrated noncaseating granulomatous inflammation with no malignancy (), while laboratory results demonstrated markedly elevated ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) levels. These findings suggested an atypical case of sarcoidosis, and the patient was referred for pulmonary consultation. The patient had developed scattered erythematous macules involving the extremities, palms, soles, and trunk.

On ultrasound the pregnancy was confirmed (6 weeks), and a pelvic mass was incidentally detected without any symptoms. The patient was transferred to our tertiary hospital for evaluation of the incidentally detected pelvic mass. Ultrasound revealed that there was an about 8 weeks sized embryo in the uterus and a 10 cm sized hypoechoic mass on the left, posterior to the uterus. But it was difficult to distinguish the mass from an adnexal mass, leiomyoma (intraligamentary), or other tumor by the ultrasonographic findings. We checked her serum tumor marker, and performed magnetic resonance imaging. Serum CA-125, CA-19-9, CA-72-4, and carcinoembryonic antigen were within normal range. A pelvic MRI without contrast media was checked at 11 weeks of pregnancy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an about 10\u00d710 cm sized mass in the retroperitoneum, and an anteriorly displaced uterus and rectum. This mass had high signal intensity on a T2-weighted image, and there was extension to the central spinal canal through the S3 left neural foramen. The MRI suggested a benign retroperitoneal neurogenic tumor (). After we consulted with the urology and neurosurgery departments, we decided to remove the retroperitoneal mass after delivery or at the time of the cesarean section. The patient underwent routine antenatal care without complications or symptoms, and there was no growth of the retroperitoneal mass on ultrasonography. The patient delivered a male baby with body weight of 2,940 g by cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation and the retroperitoneal mass was excised with assistance from the urology team. The intraoperative frozen biopsy suggested a ganglioneuroma.

She described chest tightness while exercising on a bicycle after 10 minutes. The next day she developed a severe hacking cough at work during a conference call. The cough was associated with disorientation and severe chest tightness. This prompted her to present to the emergency department in February 2018. The patient is a pharmacist, nonsmoker, and denies illicit drug use or recent travel. She had endometrial laser ablation with myomectomy in 2006. Hormonal contraceptives have been used since 2004 and were stopped three months before presentation in hopes of conception. Her last menstrual period was four days before the onset of symptoms. On physical examination, she had chest tightness localizing to the right side and decreased right sided breath sounds. All the routine laboratory work and vital signs were normal. The CXR showed a large right spontaneous pneumothorax with what approved to be a 5.6 cm pleural mass at the right lung base ().\nFollowing the pneumothorax diagnosis, the patient underwent emergent right thoracostomy with pigtail catheter placement. A repeat CXR revealed marked re-expansion of the lung but persistence of the right cardiophrenic opacity of unclear etiology. A follow-up CTof chest showed a 33 mm diaphragmatic defect with a 5.8 x 4.6 x 3.9 cm area of herniated liver corresponding to the presumed pleural mass ().\nFollowing complete thoracic imaging the patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), mechanical pleurodesis, and open repair of the right diaphragmatic defect by Dr. Emily Cassidy (Figures and ). Intraoperatively, the lungs appeared grossly normal.

His high-sensitivity cardiac troponin was 24 ng/L (female reference range\u2005<16 ng/L, male reference range\u2005<26 ng/L). How should he be managed?\nCardiac troponin is released from damaged cardiomyocytes and is one of the most common biomarkers used in the prediction of myocardial infarction. There is considerable debate regarding the use of sex-specific reference ranges for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn), as there is uncertainty whether the use of sex-specific reference limits impact upon clinical management or outcome prediction (). However, as upper reference limits based on sex-specific 99th percentiles for hs-cTn are subtly higher for people recorded as males than those recorded females in population studies (), use of sex-specific cutoffs for hs-cTn assays have been endorsed by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (). The difference has been attributed to people presumed male at birth having a larger cardiac mass as well as subclinical coronary artery disease (). No studies have been performed to examine cardiac mass changes that may occur with masculinizing hormone therapy in people presumed female at birth. There are however data in polycystic ovary syndrome in which high testosterone concentrations are a clinical feature (albeit far lower than testosterone concentrations seen in transgender men). Polycystic ovary syndrome has been associated with higher left ventricular mass index and larger left atrial diameter over 5 years of follow-up, even after adjustment for blood pressure, body mass index, glucose, and lipids (). Large population-based studies have also shown that left ventricular mass correlates with body weight, lean body mass, and fat mass (). There is currently insufficient data to draw an inference regarding the appropriate reference range in people using gender-affirming hormone therapy, and emphasis must be placed on clinical history, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and",

He was hemodynamically stable, with no clotting dysfunction according laboratory tests. He was subsequently transferred to the operating room and underwent a right decompressive craniectomy. The ASDH was caused by a ruptured lateral fissure vein. The brain exhibited slowly progressing swelling after the hematoma and inactivated brain tissue were evacuated. Consequently, immediate augmentation duraplasty using artificial dura mater was performed. On examination, the patient exhibited bilateral mydriasis. Given the slowly progressing brain swelling, this was possibly due to delayed contralateral ASDH or EDH. A CT scan of the brain was performed immediately thereafter, which revealed the emergence of contralateral DEH (Fig. ). Owing to a mass effect from the DEH and severe brain swelling, the patient was immediately taken to the operating room to undergo a left hematoma evacuation and decompressive craniectomy.

She had a history of appendicitis at 12 years of age, cholelithiasis at 30 years of age, myoma at 46 years of age, and at least a 5-year history of dyslipidemia. Proteinuria (1+) had been first identified during a medical checkup 3 years prior and was ignored until increasing to 3+ in 2011. Her parents and brothers suffered from dyslipidemia but had no history of renal disease.\nOn admission, her height and weight were 161 cm and 49 kg, respectively, and her blood pressure was 137/94 mm Hg. On physical examination, slight pitting edema was observed; however, there were no xanthomas. Urinary protein excretion was 4.12 g/g Cre, and the serum triglyceride level was high. She did not exhibit nephrotic syndrome. The other laboratory findings are shown in Table . A computed tomography scan showed neither atrophy nor enlargement of the kidneys.\nA renal biopsy specimen was processed in August 2011 using standard methods, and in the sections for light microscopy, the renal cortex was found to contain 11 glomeruli, 2 of which showed sclerosis. The remaining glomeruli were enlarged by distinct dilatation of the capillary lumina, which were filled with thrombus-like substances that stained slightly with periodic acid-Schiff.

Magnetic resonance imaging at that time reported bicornuate unicollis uterine anatomy, with symmetrical myometrial thickness in both horns. The left cervical canal was noted to communicate with the right lower uterine segment and not directly with the vagina. A thin amniotic band was noted in the superior left uterine horn.

He was a nonsmoker and was diagnosed with IgG-kappa type MM in November 2011. In the physical examination, he was diagnosed with MM. Bony metastasis was present at the time of diagnosis of the disease. A full radiographic skeletal survey showed multiple bony lesions at the ribs, femurs, and hip (Figures and ).\nPanoramic view revealed bony lytic and punch out lesions at the right side of the mandible. This patient had no history of surgery. His weight had decreased by 7 kg, following 22 months of acute intravenous injection (IV) BP treatment after the last chemotherapy treatment session. His blood pressure was 130/80, and he had a normal breathing and pulse rate. Preoperative examination of his oral mucosa revealed no evidence of pathological lesions, and overall oral hygiene was good. The patient was felt healthy and was well nourished, alert, and cooperative.

An 8.0 Endotracheal tube was placed in the trachea. A vecuronium drip at 4 mg/hr was started. Invasive monitoring consisted of a 20 gauge, 10 cmin length arterial catheter placed in left radial artery. A right internal jugular 7-French 16 cm in length triple lumen central venous catheter and a 16-French SVC catheter were inserted under ultrasonographic guidance using Seldinger technique.\nA chest X-ray performed after line placement () demonstrated satisfactory right internal jugular placement with the tip of the catheter positioned in the superior vena cava and without any evidence of pneumothorax. The liver transplant was performed uneventfully. Cold ischemic time was 7 hours and 3 minutes, warm ischemic time was 32 minutes, and portosystemic bypass time was 1 hours and 9 minutes.\nA routine postoperative chest X-ray () displayed a linear density, representing a catheter fragment, at the level of the right ventricle. The patient remained intubated and hemodynamically stable, with no evidence of jugular venous distension. Cardiac monitoring demonstrated sinus tachycardia and cardiac enzymes were negative. A Chest CT () was performed and demonstrated a fragment of distal portion of the catheter projecting at the apical wall of the right ventricle. The internal jugular central line catheter placed by anesthesiologist was removed and careful examination found the catheter to be complete and intact.

After 2 h into the workout, she began to feel chest pain, that was substernal, pressure-like, and throbbing in nature. The pain was non-radiating, six out of ten in intensity, and associated with diaphoresis and shortness of breath. Pain was alleviated in the ED when she was given sublingual nitroglycerin and intravenous morphine. She also stated episodes of a \u201cfluttery feeling\u201d and at times feeling lightheaded. She denied any previous history of a similar episode. She has no known cardiac history. Our patient did state that she never did any kind of exercise except for the activities of daily living. On review of her medical history, she stated that she was taking spironolactone for hirsutism, from August to January 2016 and then May 2017\u2013present, with initial dosing of 125 mg titrated up to 150 mg and then back down to 125 mg due to muscle fatigue. Our patient had intentional weight loss of 30 lbs from March to July 2017. She follows a healthy diet and has a normal body mass index (BMI) of 24. Our patient denied any family history of cardiac disease or heart failure. She admitted to being a former occasional smoker and to drinking alcohol socially. She denied any illicit drug use. She works as a social worker, and reported that she does not experience much stress in her life and denied any \u201cone big life-changing event\u201d or any major stressful news.

    "original_text": "An 85-year-old woman with a history of smoking presented with an abnormal shadow on chest X-ray, which was performed as part of a pre-operative evaluation for osteoarthritis of the knee in December 2012. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 2.8 cm nodule in the right upper lung lobe (Fig ) and fluorodeoxyglucose\u2013positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed uptake only within the nodule. Although transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) was negative, cytology of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the right upper bronchi showed atypical cells suspicious for malignancy.\nThe patient was referred to our hospital for curative pulmonary resection in March 2013. Her physical examination was unremarkable, and her blood examination, including tumor markers, showed anemia with a hemoglobin value of 10.2 mg/dL. The cause of the anemia was not clear despite scrutiny. In April 2013, the size of the tumor shadow decreased from 2.8 to 1.8 cm (Fig ). We strongly suspected the tumor was benign rather than malignant and planned to perform a follow-up imaging examination. The tumor shadow remained unchanged for the next three months (Fig ). In July 2013, the patient was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and began to receive glucocorticoid treatment.

Upon arrival, the patient vitals were as follows: blood pressure of 79/35, pulse of 47, oral temperature of 35.3\u00b0C, and respiratory rate of 18 with an oxygen saturation of 100 percent. His body weight was 87.3 kg, nearly 10 kg above his baseline weight.

The patient's blood pressure was labile during his admission and uncontrolled during this last hospitalization. Upon discharge, the patient was told to follow up with his nephrologist to redress his hypertension.\nThe patient indeed followed up as instructed with his nephrologist, which was the morning of the described ED visit. At the office visit his blood pressure was noted to be 154/62. His doctor added nifedipine to his current regimen of doxazosin, hydralazine, metoprolol, and metolazone.

    "original_text": "A 72-year-old male presented with a two-day history of right upper quadrant pain on a background of a metastatic, small bowel, well-differentiated NET diagnosed 5 years previously. The tumour was a low-grade mesenteric NET with a ki67 of 8% at diagnosis. He had multiple liver metastasis, which were stable. Carcinoid syndrome was well controlled on a long-acting, monthly dose of a somatostatin analogue with last dose being 28 days prior to presentation and due in three days. His comorbidities included hypertension, an infrarenal aortic aneurysm and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He presented with right upper quadrant tenderness and the liver edge was palpable 4 cm below the costal margin. Initial blood tests showed a white cell count of 18.9 \u00d7 109/L, C-reactive protein 212 mg/L and liver function tests within normal limits. Vital signs were reassuring, and an abdominal ultrasound described a thickened gallbladder wall, mobile sludge and an 8.5-mm common bile duct suggestive of cholecystitis (). Computerised tomography (CT) of the abdomen was noted to show multiple segment V liver masses with capsular deformity suggestive of central necrosis. He was initially managed with analgesia and intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam. After a discussion with the patient and consultation with his treating oncologist regarding his relatively stable disease burden and reasonable prognosis, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed.\nDuring cholecystectomy, extensive carcinoid metastases were encountered (). To perform the operation laparoscopically required retraction of the left liver lobe. However, the liver was stiff and inflamed making exposure of the biliary tree difficult. The gallbladder was mobilized, a critical view of safety and an unremarkable intraoperative cholangiogram was obtained. The length of the operation was 1 h and 35 min. Histopathology of the gallbladder showed benign, chronic outlet obstruction, patchy serosal mixed inflammation and one lymph node containing metastatic disease.\nDuring the procedure, the patient developed a persistent tachycardia and an octreotide infusion was initiated.

    "original_text": "A 29-year-old woman who had undergone surgical removal of the ovaries at the age of three years for malignancy presented after failing four egg donor transfer cycles. She believed that the malignancy was lymphoma of the ovaries but was not entirely sure, and pathology reports were unavailable since this had occurred in Lebanon. The male partner was 41 years old without medical issues and had a semen analysis of 3.2 mL, with 49.2 million sperm per mL, 72% forward motility, and 1% normal forms, according to strict morphology. After the third failed transfer, she underwent an estrogen and progesterone mock cycle and two biopsies for Adhesio. As per the Adhesio protocol, biopsies were performed at six and eight days of progesterone administration. This test determined a delayed WOI, which was receptive after eight days of progesterone treatment. Adhesio presented the levels of messenger RNA expression at the time of each biopsy, which was about 90% of the control level on day 8 and less than 40% of the control level on day 6, in this patient\u2019s case. She underwent embryo transfer subsequent to the biopsy, with transfer on the 8th day of progesterone, and it failed. The patient was then transferred to our clinic. Upon presentation, she was recommended to undergo her first ERA test. This test was performed at 100 hours of progesterone in an estrogen-primed mock cycle, giving a WOI of 124\u00b13 hours. Not feeling comfortable transferring at 124-hours of progesterone, given the conflicting results between the two tests, she requested that we repeat the ERA test with biopsies at both 124\u00b13 hours and 192 hours (8 days\u00d724-hours) to coincide with the WOI timing suggested by both the previous ERA and Adhesio tests. Performing the ERA tests at the time of the suggested WOI and not at 120 hours, as suggested by the company, should confirm the previously recommended WOI.",
