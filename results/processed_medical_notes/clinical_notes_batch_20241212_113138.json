The patient\u2019s treatment course for Fournier\u2019s gangrene subsequently consisted of multiple operative debridements, an intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and ultimately a penectomy in July 2017 (Figure ). He continued his post-discharge follow-up at an outside hospital for recuperative care as he became homeless during this time. He received wound care with home healthcare and continued to undergo a follow-up in the outpatient clinic at the urology and plastic and reconstructive surgery departments, where he discussed his desire to undergo penile reconstruction. After discussing all treatment options as well as the risks and benefits of the surgery, the patient agreed to move forward with surgical reconstruction. The patient obtained consent for a free flap procedure, and plans were discussed to proceed with a radial forearm reconstruction of his penis.\nThis procedure involved phallus and neourethra construction utilizing a single radial forearm free flap. First, a 12-cm circumferential circle was marked and dissected out at the planned penis insertion site. Next, two branches of the dorsal penile nerve were carefully isolated and dissected out along with the left deep inferior epigastric and vena comitans that provided approximately 8 cm of pedicle length. An 8-cm segment of the great saphenous vein was also dissected out and transposed to the inferior epigastric vessels to assist with the flap anastomosis. The recipient vessels and nerves were now defined and attention was turned to harvesting the radial forearm free flap.

The patient stated he became dizzy prior to the fall and now complains of pain in his scalp. The patient denied the use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications. At the time of presentation to the ED, he denied active dizziness, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or shortness of breath. Physical exam revealed an alert, oriented, age-appropriate male in no distress.

Cystoscopy showed chronic inflammatory changes in the bladder but no definite tumors or stones. Following the procedure, the patient reported an improvement in both her urethral pain and urinary urgency. The procedural findings and symptomatology changes led her practitioners to surmise that she most likely had interstitial cystitis/urethral syndrome. Consequently, she was diagnosed as having pelvic pain and nonobstructive incomplete bladder emptying. The patient was treated with Ciprofloxacin, Elmiron, and Cysta Q and was instructed to consistently self-catheterize twice daily.\nApproximately 5 months later, the patient presented to the emergency department for increased pelvic pain.

    "original_text": "A 15-year-old unmarried female student from urban area of Uttar Pradesh (India), living in a joint family, presented in the OPD with a history of eating papers for last 2\u20133 years. The symptoms were of insidious onset, continuous and were deteriorating in progress. There was a family history of eating papers in her brother, and our patient's initiation into this habit had been shaped by her brother's behavior. The symptom began when the patient started having a fear that something untoward was going to happen to her mother, and she attempted eating papers to help her get over these fears. Gradually, she developed the belief that if she did not perform this act, the mother would get killed. It became a regular affair in no time since her belief was easily vindicated. Initially, she would feel odd about this behavior and therefore would try to hide from family members and at school.

After 3 months, he developed rapid and recurrent involuntary jerky up and down movement of the head, followed by front and back movement of the neck along with whistling sound suggesting of the motor as well as vocal tics. He was consulted with a neurologist as he refused to go to school due to bullying by schoolmates. He was investigated and diagnosed as Tourette's syndrome. There after he was under treatment for 19 years with haloperidol 5 mg daily with regular follow-up from neurologist. He was improved except eyelid tics. Meanwhile, he started using oral nicotine to control the protruding movement of the tongue. Gradually, he started taking almost 20 packets of oral nicotine (Hans, a local nicotine product) per day. He developed nicotine dependence and oral ulcer. He stopped taking drugs 4 years ago without any advice. He contributed the discontinuation due to sedation and started using alternative medicines (acupuncture). He stopped all types of treatment 9 months ago due to the financial crisis. His facial tics reappeared after 15 days of discontinuation. He started showing SIB and created multiple big ulcers on hand. Furthermore, he started suffering from ruminative thoughts about upcoming duties. For the last 4 months, he developed depressive symptoms like low mood, fatigability, decreased talk, decreased sleep, hopelessness, and death wishes.

These symptoms started two months previously and had progressively worsened. Approximately two years prior to this presentation she had had an evaluation for chest pain that included cardiac testing and a chest X-ray. Eventually she was diagnosed with dystonia and started on trigger point injections at multiple different sites including the left sternoclavicular joint. She developed a left-sided pneumothorax as the result of these injections and underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic pleurodesis for a refractory pneumothorax. She was symptom free for about 20 months. She subsequently had recurrence of her left-sided chest pain which was treated with episodic sternoclavicular joint trigger point injections. Our patient was not able to recall any of the medications used in the injection. Her chest pain progressively got worse and she developed shortness of breath one week prior to her current presentation. The chest pain was substernal, sharp, with 5/10 intensity, aggravated by breathing and had no relieving factors. She denied fever, chills, smoking or drug use. A review of systems was otherwise negative. Her vital signs in the ER were normal except for resting tachycardia, with a pulse of 100 beats per minutes. A physical examination revealed swelling and tenderness of the sternal notch with tenderness to palpation over her left sternoclavicular joint.

    "original_text": "A 3-year-old boy presented with a large bosselated swelling over the cheek extending to the submandibular, submental, postauricular region and which was still further increasing in size (Figure ). A trucut\u00ae biopsy was suggestive of fibromatosis. Computerized tomogram (CT) scan revealed a large soft tissue mass infiltrating the massetter, parotid gland, floor mouth, submandibular gland, the lateral oro-nasopharyngeal wall and the pterygoid muscle. The horizontal ramus of mandible was eroded and the mass extended across the midline. Excision of the mass with segmental mandibulectomy was performed. Reconstruction with a free fibula was deferred for a later stage in view of the young age, large mass and concern of recurrent disease. Since the mucosal defect following excision was not large enough primary closure was performed. Histopathology confirmed juvenile fibromatosis and all cut margins of resection were free of tumour. The patient presented after 13 months with recurrent swelling over the cheek with significant difficulty in swallowing and constant dribbling of saliva due to inadequate mouth closure (Figure ). A CT scan revealed presence of a large recurrent mass in the floor of mouth, infiltrating the infratemporal fossa (ITF) and reaching up to the base of skull (Figure ). In view of the extensive recurrence low dose chemotherapy (weekly vinblastine, methotrexate and tamoxifen) was started. After completion of 12 weeks of chemotherapy, a partial response was achieved. Excision of the mass with ITF clearance was performed subsequently. A portion of tongue and its base along with the lateral oropharyngeal and the soft palate was also excised (Figure. ) The defect following resection was large and a free flap was not feasible as the external carotid artery was ligated at previous surgery. Reconstruction with a PMMC flap for providing mucosal cover and soft tissue bulk for defect was considered. In view of the large mucosal defect a large skin paddle was taken incorporating the nipple",

He had been arrested by Swiss authorities because of suspected internal concealment of drugs of abuse (body packing), which had been confirmed by abdominal CT scan in our hospital approximately 12 h before (Fig. ). During this first visit, the patient had presented asymptomatic and had admitted to carrying cocaine-containing body packets. In addition, he had reported recreational use of marijuana and cocaine. It was also noted that the patient was transsexual; he had breast implants. The patient\u2019s past medical history was unknown. Standard operating procedure in such a case is to perform a CT scan without a consultation at the ED. During the second visit approximately 12 h later, the patient presented with psychomotor agitation, mydriasis and tachycardia. His heart rate was 116 bpm, blood pressure was 116/68 mmHg, respiratory rate was 40/min, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 99% on ambient air and auricular temperature was 38.0\u00b0 Celsius. Communication with the patient was impossible because of his altered mental status and because he spoke a foreign language. The physical examination of heart, lungs and abdomen revealed no pathologies. Neurological examination showed symmetrical spontaneous movement of all extremities and symmetrical gaze to both sides prompted by speech or touch. Glasgow coma scale was 11. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia without signs of ischemia. Due to our knowledge of the ingested body packets, we first suspected cocaine intoxication because of package rupture. We treated the patient with repeated doses of intravenous midazolam and performed an emergency abdominal CT scan to guide potential emergency surgical decontamination. The CT scan showed 60\u201370 packets in the gastrointestinal tract without signs of gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation.

It was also noted that the patient was transsexual; he had breast implants. The patient\u2019s past medical history was unknown. Standard operating procedure in such a case is to perform a CT scan without a consultation at the ED. During the second visit approximately 12 h later, the patient presented with psychomotor agitation, mydriasis and tachycardia. His heart rate was 116 bpm, blood pressure was 116/68 mmHg, respiratory rate was 40/min, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 99% on ambient air and auricular temperature was 38.0\u00b0 Celsius. Communication with the patient was impossible because of his altered mental status and because he spoke a foreign language. The physical examination of heart, lungs and abdomen revealed no pathologies. Neurological examination showed symmetrical spontaneous movement of all extremities and symmetrical gaze to both sides prompted by speech or touch. Glasgow coma scale was 11. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia without signs of ischemia. Due to our knowledge of the ingested body packets, we first suspected cocaine intoxication because of package rupture. We treated the patient with repeated doses of intravenous midazolam and performed an emergency abdominal CT scan to guide potential emergency surgical decontamination.

Computed tomography of the site showed an 11 cm-sized well-circumscribed mass with heterogeneous intensity, calcification and septation (). A diagnostic incisional biopsy was performed, and the tissue that was biopsied showed cartilage with atypical cytological features and focal necrosis. Analysis determined that myxoid stroma surrounded the cartilage, with the presence of some scattered lipoblasts within the myxoid stroma.

The specimen exhibited a well-demarcated ovoid mass with lobulation (), and each lobulated area was found to have different appearances that ranged from a solid gray fibrotic firm lobule, to a brown fibrotic soft lobule with a focal hemorrhage and cystic change, to a solid gray lobule with a focal glistening translucent myxoid appearance and a bluish firm resilient area with a focal calcification. Microscopic analysis revealed that the solid gray fibrotic area showed diffuse proliferation of bland fusiform cells with ovoid elongated nuclei and a moderate to abundant cytoplasm, and fine, delicate capillary vessel networks were noted within the fibrotic area (). The brown fibrotic and hemorrhagic area contained coagulative necrosis of bland fusiform cells with hemorrhage, and a previous biopsy was proposed as the cause for the change in tissue.

    "original_text": "A four-year-old Japanese girl with no remarkable medical history was referred to our orthopedic clinic for treatment of 2 cm of LLD. She had a two-year history of progressive LM in a wide range of the posteromedial aspect of the right thigh and the medial aspect of the right lower leg. At the first presentation, skin lesions exhibited hyperpigmentation, induration, and xerosis. The range of motion of the right knee was full extension to 80\u00b0 of flexion. Radiographs of the right lower extremity revealed dysplastic/atrophic femur and tibia. LLD increased with time and reached nearly 10 cm at seven years of age (). As she and her parents refused to undergo epiphysiodesis of the unaffected side of the lower extremity, we performed simultaneous lengthening of the right femur and tibia using a unilateral external fixator (EBI/Zimmer Biomet Carbon Rail Deformity System; Warsaw, Indiana, USA). She had taken low-dose prednisolone every day or every second day prior to the first lengthening procedure. The dosage regimen had been dependent on the disease activity based on clinical and thermographic assessment. Tibial osteotomy was performed with the Gigli saw, whereas femoral osteotomy was done with a multiple drilling technique. No postoperative immobilization was used, and full-weight bearing was encouraged from the second postoperative day. After 14 days of the waiting period, distraction of the femur and tibia was commenced at a rate of 1 mm and 0.5 mm per day, respectively. Femur was lengthened at the same rate throughout the distraction period, whereas the distraction speed of the tibia was gradually decreased after the lengthening callus showed thin and sparse on radiographs.

    "original_text": "A 90 year old gentleman was admitted on the acute surgical take with right hypochondrium pain. On examination he was pyrexial, tachycardic markedly tender in the right upper quadrant of his abdomen. There was also a reducible non-tender right-sided inguinal hernia present. His past medical history included atrial fibrillation (anti-coagulated with apixaban) alongside ischaemic heart disease, osteoarthritis and a degree of congestive cardiac failure with poor exercise tolerance. On further questioning he had noticed the lump for several weeks but described no tenderness around the lump. Blood workup revealed c-reactive protein of 140 mg/L and white cell count of 15 \u00d7 109. He had mildly deranged renal function at baseline consistent with an element of chronic kidney disease. Other blood tests were unremarkable. A diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was made with an incidental finding of right-sided inguinal hernia. He was commenced on intravenous antibiotics and CT scan of the abdomen arranged to ensure no co-existent pathology given his age. CT scan revealed the presence of a right-sided inguinal hernia containing a thickened vermiform appendix with peripheral fat stranding suggestive of acute appendicitis within an Amyand\u2019s hernia ( and ). Additionally, the scan did confirm the concurrent presence of acute uncomplicated cholecystitis. Senior surgical and anaesthetic discussions took place with regards to operating on this patient to treat his appendicitis and repair his hernia. It was universally agreed that the acute cholecystitis could be viably treated with intravenous antibiotics in the interim. However, acute appendicitis, with its risk of complications, warranted further discussion. Following discussion with the patient, consultant physicians, anaesthetists and surgeons, the decision was made to treat both conditions conservatively with antibiotics.

She denied fever, night sweats, weight loss or respiratory symptoms. There was no family history of breast cancer and no personal history of diabetes, immunosuppression, previous treatment for tuberculosis or recent exposure to a person with tuberculosis. Right axillary lump removed in 2000 the nature of which was unclear. She had migrated to Australia from Bangladesh 6 years ago. She had one five-year-old child and had ceased breast-feeding three years prior. She was not pregnant at the time of presentation and denied recent use of hormonal contraception. On examination, she had a 12 \u00d7 9 cm firm mass in the upper quadrant of her right breast and no associated palpable adenopathy. There was some nipple inversion but no discharge.

    "original_text": "A 53 year-old man was transported from another hospital with the high suspicion of a traumatic aortic rupture after acute blunt thoracic trauma. Following a high speed car accident he was admitted in another hospital with injuries in the chest and fracture of the left femur. A thorax-CT scan was performed without contrast medium because of a known chronic renal failure (creatinine levels = 2.2 mMol/L). It showed hemothorax on the left, minimal left lung contusions (of the posterior segments), rib fractures and a periaortic hematoma at the level of the isthmus area (figure ). Because of a high-suspicion index of thoracic aortic rupture, we decided to do an emergency aortography. It revealed an interruption of the normal contour of the thoracic aorta in the aortic isthmus area. A protrusion of the aortic lumen in the corresponding inner curve of the aorta supported our suspicion for the disruption of the intima and the initiation of a pseudoaneurysm's process (figure ). Therefore, an emergency operation (the interventional management was abandoned because of technical reasons) by using partial right femoro-femoral bypass for aortic isthmus repair was decided. Surprisingly, and after a postero-lateral thoracotomy at the 4th intercostals space, we inspected an \"intact\" outer thoracic aortic wall, without haematoma or related pathology at the aortic isthmus area. However, because we did not totally exclude a possible limited disruption of the intima, or even another pathology (see discussion), we decided to check from inside the thoracic aorta. Following proximal and distal dissection of the aorta, a partial cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated with flow level 2-2.6 L/min to restore a distal aortic pressure of >55-60 mm.

Physical examination revealed normal findings apart from painful right lower quadrant palpable mass. Routine biochemical analysis and CBC were unremarkable. CT examination revealed a 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 cm size conglomerated solid mass with no contrast localization. The patient improved and passed flatus after five days of supportive therapy with IV fluid replacement and antibiotic therapy and discharged from hospital. It was considered as a plastroned appendicitis (peri-appendiceal mass) and periodic ultrasonographic examinations (USG) were planned for follow-up. However, the USG two weeks after CT scan, revealed a 5 \u00d7 3 cm size irregular contoured, heterogenous caecal mass that was neighboring with the urinary bladder. We also proved the increase in size of the mass by physical examination. This finding has led us to the primary diagnosis of a colonic malignancy.\nIn an attempt to rule out a colonic malignancy, an urgent colonoscopy was performed, which was unyielding due to inability to pass beyond the hepatic flexure. Therefore, we performed an FDG PET/CT study to aid in the differential diagnosis, which showed markedly increased glucose metabolism in two masses localized in the right lower quadrant which were 2 cm in diameter (,).\nThe high SUV values (early: 10.8, late: 14.7) suggested that these masses were most likely related with malignant tissue (). Later in several days, the size of mass has decreased on physical and USG examinations, therefore we decided to follow-up conservatively.

He was unable to stand, which was followed by complete loss of sensation in both legs with cyanosis. In addition to his symptoms in lower extremities, he also complained of 1 week history of shortness of breath.\nSix years ago, patient had a saddle pulmonary embolus after a rotator cuff repair surgery. During that episode he had acute shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. A full hypercoagulable workup revealed protein C deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia, but the workup was not considered definitive as patient was on coumadin at the time. He was treated with coumadin for one year and was lost to follow-up afterwards.\nUpon arrival in ER, the initial physical examination revealed hypoxemia (pulse oximetry was in low-mid 80's) and arterial blood gas showed pH 7.44, PaCO2 33 mmHg, PaO2 42 mmHg on room air. His lower extremities were cold and pulseless from dorsal pedis to femoral arteries bilaterally. The blood pressure in the lower extremities was 87/44, while blood pressure in the upper extremities was 114/70, with a heart rate of 108 beats per minute. Neurological examination revealed intact cranial nerves, with preserved comprehension and speech. Muscle strength was normal in the upper extremities, but 4/5 in both lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were normal. Sensation was decreased in lower extremities. EKG showed sinus rhythm at 108 per minute. The patient was treated with intravenous heparin empirically for pulmonary embolism.\nWithin 2\u20133 hours after presentation, patient's symptoms improved with resolution of groin pain, and return of the sensation of his lower extremities.\nCT aortogram of the abdomen and pelvis with lower extremity femoral runoff revealed occlusion in the abdominal aorta below the level of the renal arteries",
