Admission vitals were stable with the significant except oxygen saturation of 70% on room air. Labs on admission were significant for lactic acid of 5.3 mmol/L (), Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), and subtherapeutic INR of 1.5 on Coumadin. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine use. CT scan of the abdomen was initially unremarkable. The patient was subsequently admitted to the ICU for severe acute hypoxic respiratory failure with potential for decompensation and clinical suspicion of mesenteric ischemia given his subtherapeutic INR in the setting of atrial fibrillation along with sudden onset of abdominal pain and elevated lactic acid without a clear cause. Cocaine abuse may have also been a contributing factor to sudden ischemia. A later repeat CT scan revealed nonspecific bowel wall thickening, and a transesophageal echocardiogram performed revealed an active left atrial thrombus, making mesenteric ischemia a higher differential. Due to the added possibility of sepsis and worsening renal function, there was no clear opportunity for surgical intervention, and conservative management was initiated through heparin drip and BiPAP showing initial clinical improvement. By hospital day 3, however, he suddenly became unresponsive. At that time, his labs revealed blood sugar of less than 10 mg/dl and worsening renal failure. The patient was aggressively managed and given multiple ampules of Dextrose 50% and infusion of Dextrose 5% was started (). Because of further decompensation of renal function, he was started on Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) as well.

A neurological examination identified a left hemiplegia with no sensory deficits. An immediate CT brain scan showed a ring-enhancing cortical-subcortical lesion on the right frontal-parietal hemisphere. In view of the CT scan findings, gadolinium MRI of the brain was performed. MRI showed a caudal extension of the lesion with irregular enhancement and a necrotic region (). Blood cultures were collected before initiating antimicrobial therapy.

Based on organism sensitivity, intravenous therapy with ampicillin 3 g/6 h + gentamicin 80 mg/8 h + vancomycin 1 g/12 h was initiated. Steroid therapy was also administered due to the associated moderate mass effect. The patient was then transferred to our Infectious Diseases Department for further workup and management. Forty-eight hours after the initiation of target therapy, the patient was afebrile. Twenty days later, he showed progressive clinical and neurologic deterioration characterized by visual hallucinations, frontal symptoms with disinhibition, and persistent hemiplegia.

The attacks would begin with dizziness and lightheadedness (never vertigo) and eventually progress to the point where she would become nauseous and would vomit. She would then notice she could not walk in a straight line and would need assistance to ambulate. Her hands would become tremulous and she would have trouble writing.

Uniquely, the only thing that could cause the attacks to subside was sleep. Sleeping just 15 min could relieve her symptoms completely. If she could not find time to sleep the episodes would remain unabated. Thus on work days her bouts could last 12 plus hours in duration.

Chest CT with contrasts did not reveal evidence of pulmonary arterio-venous malformations or thromboemoblism. The chest CT was confounded by a significant amount of metal artifact caused by the transvenous pacing leads. A stress echocardiogram was performed to further assess the hypoxemia with exercise.

The seizure occurred few hours before presentation and was associated with altered mental status and fever and a prodrome of headache. He had a history of epilepsy which began after a head trauma and fracture of skull in about 20 years ago. Seizures had been controlled with antiepileptic drugs and the therapy was discontinued few years later.\nAt the time of presentation, the level of consciousness was decreased (Glasgow Coma Score of 7) and he had apparent neck stiffness accompanied by Kerning's and Brudzinski's sign on physical examination. The patient was febrile at the time of examination (oral temperature of 39\u00b0C) and other vital signs were as follows: systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg, heart rate of 110 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 16 per minute. The central and peripheral nervous systems were evaluated completely and no alteration or deficit was detected.

He initially noticed knee pain during knee motion without any major trauma in February 2007 and swelling of his left popliteal fossa two months later. On physical examination, there was swelling without tenderness and local heat of his left posterior knee. Laboratory data were uniformly unremarkable, except for a high level of alkaline phosphatase. Plain radiographs showed an expansive and well-defined osteolytic lesion surrounded by a shell in the cortex of the metaphysis of the left proximal tibia. Computed tomography (CT) of the tibia showed an osteolytic expansive lesion with cortical thinning (Figure ). On MR imaging, the bony lesion was iso-intense on T1 with a mixture of low and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images with an edema-like soft tissue lesion adjacent to the bony lesion (Figure ). First, needle biopsy of the soft tissue mass was performed because the lesion was suspected to be malignant. Histology revealed that the lesion was fibromuscular with lymphoid tissue without malignancy, and surgical treatment was performed. Intraoperative biopsy of the white soft tissue infiltrating the soleus muscle revealed that the soft tissue lesion was similar to the needle biopsy specimens pre-operation. After the soft tissue was confirmed to be reactive to inflammation and without malignancy, the bone lesion, which was occupied with solid white tissue, was curetted without adjuvant therapy, such as phenol treatment or bone grafting. Histological examination of the surgical specimens showed a solid variant of aneurysmal bone cyst with belt-shaped giant cells against a background of spindle cells and scattered osteoclasts (Figure ). Immunohistochemistry revealed cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expressed in not only giant cells but also spindle cells (Figure ), which was confirmed by anti-human COX-2 antibody (IBL, Japan). The posterior knee pain immediately disappeared after surgery. On MR imaging at follow-up 2 months",

He had a past medical history of hypertension, and his family history was not significant. On physical examination there was a 2 \u00d7 2 cm firm swelling present in the left upper neck, the mobility of which was slightly restricted. There was no identifiable primary lesion. Sonograms showed that the mass was hypoechoic, 16 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 20 mm in size, and with a relatively regular border. Back echoes were enhanced, and internal echoes were dissimilar (Fig. ). Computed tomography showed an enhanced lesion in the left upper neck in contact with the carotid bifurcation and the jugular vein (Fig. ). Based on the fine needle aspiration cytological findings, a possible malignant tumor, such as epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma or basal cell adenocarcinoma, was suspected, but no definitive diagnosis was given. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET-CT) revealed FDG avidity in the left-sided neck at a level II lymph node, the size of which was 21 \u00d7 16 mm. There was no evidence of a primary lesion, including the parotid and submandibular glands, on PET-CT (Fig. ). Further, no tumorous lesions were detected in the mammary gland on PET-CT. Therefore, with a provisional diagnosis of suspected cancer of unknown primary site, he underwent left modified radical neck dissection. Intraoperatively, the level II lymph node invaded the internal jugular vein and superior thyroid artery, and these vessels were sacrificed. The parotid and submandibular glands were not involved. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma was suspected on the basis of an intraoperative frozen section.

During the last 14 days preceding hospitalisation he moved with significant difficulty and reported weakness of the lower extremities. 4 days prior to admission he spent most of his time mainly in bed and suffered from paraplegia of lower extremities. After admission to the Neurology Department, initial diagnostics showed the presence of destructive changes within vertebral bodies, arches and spinous processes in the thoracic segment (Th5\u2013Th6).\nCT scans revealed destruction of the thoracic vertebras, infiltration changes in paravertebral soft tissues and pathological mass in the spinal canal. Initial diagnosis included infiltrative malignant tumour of the vertebral column. Consulting neurosurgeon recommended MRI examination. Examination revealed the presence of changes suggesting inflammatory process of the thoracic spine Th5\u2013Th6, inflammatory changes within intervertebral discs and vertebral bodies and changes inside the spinal canal suggesting fluid mass empyema compressing the spinal cord (Figs. , ).\nAdditional information collected from the patient and his family revealed that the patient suffered from the zoonosis, erysipeloid, 2 months priori to admission and was treated. Infection occurred after skin cut on the right leg with the fragment of the pig bone. Patient observed the presence of skin inflammatory process; subsequently, the process spread in the form of phlegmon of the right leg integuments. Patient was initially treated in the Department of Surgery and referred to the Orthopaedic Clinic due to skin phlegmon. Bacteriological tests revealed E. rhusiopathiae.

    "original_text": "A 6 year old girl who was sleeping on the floor woke up at 3 AM with pain and swelling over the left hand. This was initially ignored by the parents. The pain and swelling gradually increased, and she complained of difficulty in breathing about 2 hours later. At this point she was brought to the hospital. There was no history suggestive of a snake bite. Examination revealed a drowsy child with a massively swollen left hand and forearm with shallow breathing. There were two clean puncture marks on the left thumb but no bleeding from them. There was no blistering or necrosis of the swollen limb. The local lymph nodes were enlarged. Examination of the central nervous system showed the child to be drowsy but arousable, not obeying verbal commands and was localizing pain. She had ptosis and grade 2\u20133/5 power in all four limbs and sluggish deep tendon reflexes with extensor plantars. Her pulse rate was 80/min, BP-100/60 mmHg SpO2 \u2013 60% on 5 liters of oxygen by face mask and temperature 98.4\u00b0F. Endotracheal intubation was done and she was ventilated on synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) mode as she had some spontaneous respiratory efforts. Polyvalent anti snake venom therapy was started and a total of 100 ml was given (Haffkine Institute, Bombay), after a provisional diagnosis of snake bite with severe envenomation was made. Over a period of about 4 hours, the weakness progressed and involved proximal muscles first and then distal muscles. She was comatose, had no motor response to painful stimuli, became areflexic and her plantar reflex was not elicitable. Her pupils were dilated with no response to light; she had absent oculocephalic and corneal reflexes.

However, the patient had been previously diagnosed with cerebral infarction before diagnosing CM.\nNearly half a year prior to this admission, the patient ventured out and cut firewood alone after quarreling with her family members. Three days later, she began to feel headache, muscle soreness, and fatigue. Her condition worsened in the following days and she felt extremely weak and even could not walk or eat by herself. The patient was then sent to a local hospital. Cranial MRI revealed multiple ischemic foci located in the junction of cortex and medulla of bilateral frontoparietal region, the periventricular area, and the centrum semiovale. Cranial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed regional stenosis in the A1 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery and the P2 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery. Carotid artery ultrasound reported multiple plaques in the right common carotid artery with appropriately 79% stenosis. Systemic and supportive treatment did not help to improve her condition. The patient still complained of extreme weakness and poor appetite. Four weeks later, another cranial MRI indicated new-onset lacunar infarction in the bilateral frontal lobe. Cranial CT indicated high-density image near the anterior horn of the right lateral ventricle.

The swelling advanced gradually over the year and ulcerated 3 months ago. Patient could walk without any assistance. On examination, there was a firm mass of 30*18*12 cm at the upper part of tibia extending to the calves and a large discharging ulcer of 12 cm diameter anteriorly with necrotic areas. The discharge was yellow, thick in consistency. Range of motion of knee was reduced. Tenderness was present over the left knee and proximal tibia. Pulsations of dorsalis pediis, posterior tibial and popliteal arteries were present. A neurological examination of the lower limbs was within normal limits. Examination of other systems was unremarkable. A clinical blood examination and a chest X-ray at the time of presentation showed no abnormality. Plain radiograph showed a large lesion with soft tissue opacity involving the metadiaphysis of left tibia, causing erosion and destruction of tibia and adjacent fibula, with linear and ring like calcifications suggesting a tumor, possibly an enchondroma, osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma, with extensions into the soft tissue of proximal leg.\nTc99m radio isotope bone scan showed increased tracer uptake in the shaft of left tibia and proximal soft tissue with no skeletal metastasis.\nDue to financial constraint on the side of patient, a MRI was not done.

The patient was helmeted at the time of the crash and there was no reported loss of consciousness. He reported isolated right lower extremity pain without neurologic complaints.\nExam and diagnostics\nThis was an isolated injury with no clinical or radiographic evidence of intracranial, -thoracic, -abdominal, or -pelvic injury. A FAST exam (Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma) was performed prior to our orthopaedic exam, which demonstrated no signs of hemorrhage.\nInspection of the right lower extremity revealed two large wounds to the anterolateral and anteromedial tibial diaphysis. The anterolateral and anteromedial wounds measured approximately 20 cm and 12 cm in length, respectively. Both wounds exhibited gross contamination with road debris as well as exposed muscle and fracture fragments (Figure ). There was no clinical evidence of compartment syndrome. There were no sensory or motor deficits involving the superficial peroneal, deep peroneal, or tibial nerves. A strong dorsalis pedis pulse was palpable, however the posterior tibial pulse was unidentifiable on palpation or Doppler ultrasound. A computed tomography (CT) angiogram was obtained which demonstrated vascular stenosis of the posterior tibial artery at the level of the fracture. All hematologic and metabolic labs were within normal ranges.\nTime from the emergency department to the initial operative encounter\nDual antibiotic prophylaxis, consisting of cefazolin and gentamycin, was administered promptly upon arrival to the emergency department.

The patient described that she had had a \"bulge\" in her vagina for the past 2 years and was currently being treated by her gynecologist for an enterocele with estrogen cream. Elective surgical repair of an enterocele was planned. She complained to the triage nurse of abdominal pain intermittently for the preceding 1 week. She stated that when she coughed something protruded from her vagina and she believed that her rectum had prolapsed. She was initially triaged to the lower acuity area of the emergency department, but due to worsening pain, she was brought back to a room on the acute care side approximately 30 min after her arrival. She described working in her garden when she coughed, experiencing a \"bulge\" extending through and out of her vagina. According to the patient, this \"bulge\" had been worsening for 2 months but had never extended past her labia. The patient complained of severe cramping in the left lower quadrant of her abdomen, but denied any diffuse abdominal pain. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension and breast cancer treated with surgery and chemotherapy without radiation. The patient did not have a history of vaginal or vulvar cancer. Her surgical history was significant for mastectomy and breast reconstruction, laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy and bilateral oopherectomy (5 years previously), and pubovaginal sling (4 years previously).\nOn examination she was pleasant, appearing well and in no acute distress, with a temperature of 36.8 C\u00b0, pulse of 70, and blood pressure of 142/97 mmHg.

In his early childhood, he was diagnosed as having chromosome 22q11 deletion, and he had a history of congenital hypoparathyroidism and thymus hypoplasia. He also had a ventricular septum defect and an atrial septum defect, which had been surveyed without operation. His medical history included surgeries for an umbilical hernia and an abdominal hernia, but he had never undergone a cardiovascular surgery. He was referred to our hospital for the evaluation of a thyroid tumor.\nAn ultrasound examination revealed a tumor 36 mm in diameter in the left lobe, with many microcalcifications, heterogeneous density, and an obscure border line. A fine-needle biopsy of the tumor was performed, and the diagnosis was a suspected adenomatous nodule. A chest X-ray showed a right-sided aortic arch, but no indication of situs inversus was observed. A chest CT scan at the referring hospital showed a right-sided aortic arch and an aberrant LSA running behind the main trachea and the thoracic esophagus, and crossing the midline of the mediastinum. This aberrant LSA originated from the descending aorta as the fourth branch of the aortic arch, after the left common carotid artery, the right common carotid artery, and the RSA arose in this sequence.\nWe also confirmed the anomalies with magnetic resonance angiography (see Figure ). Thus, we suspected that left NRLN might be present. A preoperative laryngoscopic examination showed normal vocal cord function. The patient had no symptoms of dysphagia or regurgitation. Although a fine-needle biopsy of the tumor indicated that the tumor was benign, we decided to perform surgery because the ultrasound examination indicated the possibility of malignancy.\nA left hemithyroidectomy was performed.

The retroareolar mass was previously biopsied, determined to be benign, and had not changed since initial presentation. She complained of worsening pain at the outer mass due to friction from the seat belt.\nUpon physical exam, she was found to have a palpable mass of the upper outer quadrant of the left breast that was freely mobile and firm. She had a second palpable mass in the retroareolar region at the 2 o\u2019clock position that was slightly smaller. This mass was firm and mobile. 3D digital breast tomosynthesis mammography demonstrated a mass within the retroareolar region of the breast and a mass within the upper outer quadrant of the breast posteriorly. No asymmetric breast mass was seen on the right side. No micro-calcifications were evident on either side. Left breast ultrasound revealed a heterogeneous hypoechoic solid mass of the retroareolar region measuring 2.9 \u00d7 3.8 \u00d7 1.8 cm in size that was unchanged from previous imaging.

She has infrequent defecation about 3\u20135 times per week and abdominal discomfort/bloating. When she has bowel movements, she is able to sense the need to defecate, but she is not able to control the BM (incontinence), and she cannot get to a toilet; thus, the BM occurs in her briefs. She lives with a 65-year-old husband, who is unable to help care for her due to his own health problems. Thus, she has homecare assistance three times per day. When she has a BM into her briefs, she must wait until homecare comes next to get cleaned up. On examination, she has irritation/erythema of the skin of the buttocks with some breakdown and some soiling with stool in the briefs she is wearing. She requires a mechanical lift for transfers and has the weakness of upper limbs, no functional movement in lower limbs, and she needs partial assistance to turn in bed for the exam. She cannot assist at all in lowering pants for examination. She has a relatively preserved sensation of the perineal area and weak anal contraction. There is hard stool present on the rectal exam. She also has significant spasticity in the lower limbs.\nProposed treatment: The main issue here is lack of mobility and independence, thus not being able to toilet when a bowel movement is about to occur. Defecation occurs at times when no assistance is available, leading to being left for up to several hours in soiled briefs with resulting skin breakdown. The second issue is that the infrequency of bowel movements is causing hard stools and discomfort, which may be triggering her spasticity. The goals of treatment would be to have regular, predictable bowel movements, either daily or every second day, in a timely fashion, assisted by her home care workers",

She was very distressed and unhappy because her mother forced her to talk with her father. She stated that her father had deserted them for someone else 9 years ago, she did not talk and see him until this time anymore and she found this difficult to accept him and everyday her father phoned her mother and insisted on establishing a new relationship. In this month, she began to take money from home without permission, especially after each time her father called her mother. And she started to have conflicts with her peers and siblings.\nShe was admitted to the paediatric inpatient clinics in two different hospitals because of self-induced vomiting episodes and weight loss before admission to the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. She had no complaints of dysphagia, retrosternal pain and heartburn; physical examinations and detailed investigations including blood tests and abdominal-pelvic ultrasound and endoscopy were normal on both paediatric occasions. Paediatric gastroenterology specialist reported that this medical condition was not associated with any primary oesophageal motility disorders (achalasia, diffuse oesophageal spasm, nutcracker oesophagus, etc.) and secondary oesophageal motility disorders (diabetes mellitus, scleroderma, etc.).

She had a past medical history of CD, and had been treated by reconstructive surgery for silicone stent intubation on her right lacrimal duct at a local hospital 10 years earlier. But, it is noteworthy that the patient had not returned to the outpatient department of ophthalmology for a follow-up examination after the surgery. When the patient initially came to our outpatient department for treatment, we found the silicone stent in the appropriate position by slit-lamp microscope examination, computed tomography (CT), and nasal endoscopy (Fig. A,B). The low density in the center of the silicone tube indicated that the tube is unobstructed, but high-density calcification can be seen at the ends (Fig. B-D).\nAlthough we did not find evident lesions of the lacrimal drainage system due to the previous surgery, dacryocystitis accompanied by secretion formation was seen, located around the lacrimal passage. We observed that the lacrimal passage was obstructed, because when the irrigation solution was irrigated through the lower punctum, the solution created a reflux from the upper punctum, and the patient could not swallow the solution through the throat. Soft tissue density, which was unclear in boundaries, was seen at the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct level on the dacryocystography. We concluded that there was inflammation at the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct level. Thus, a surgical therapeutic schedule was followed. We irrigated the lacrimal duct and instilled antibiotic eye drops for the patient. After the inflammation had settled, the tube removal was performed by an experienced surgeon. During the operation, granulation tissue formation and dacryocyst contracture, which makes the lacrimal sac lose function due to secondary dacryocystitis in the lacrimal drainage system, was observed by nasal endoscopy. Therefore, the surgeon performed an operation that anastomosed the lacrimal duct and nasal mucosa, and placed a lacrimal silicone",

The primary clinical course of her pregnancy was good, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 12 weeks of gestation to assess the solid mass. MRI revealed diffuse enlargement of the right ovary with iso-intensity-to-low intensity on T1-weighted images, heterogeneous relatively high intensity on T2-weighted images, high-intensity signals on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and a low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value [Figure \u2013]. The laboratory values were within normal limits, including those of tumor markers (e.g., carbohydrate antigen 125, carbohydrate antigen 19\u20139, and carcinoembryonic antigen). Based on these findings, a stromal tumor with a low possibility of malignancy was suspected, and the patient was followed up with TVUS and observation during pregnancy. There was no change in size or characteristics of the tumor with TVUS throughout her pregnancy.\nAt 40 weeks and 1 days of pregnancy, the patient was admitted to our hospital due to premature rupture of membranes and spontaneously delivered a male baby vaginally. The baby's birth weight was 2885 g, and his Apgar score was 8 at 1 min and 9 at 5 min. The postpartum clinical course for the mother and baby were unremarkable.\nA month after delivery, TVUS was performed in the outpatient clinic for follow-up of the ovarian mass and revealed a solid mass in the right ovary measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter.

The brain computed tomography (CT) scan at previous center revealed hypodensity in pons and cerebellum. Her history and medical findings were highly suggestive of right vertebral artery dissection, and she was actually referred to our center as a hospital due to the availability of cerebral artery angiography. On admission day in our center, she was lethargic and disoriented and her GCS was 9. Neurologic examination revealed conjugate gaze palsy to the left and impaired adduction in the left eye.

The chief complaint was restricted mouth opening, tenderness over temporomandibular joint, fractured upper central incisors, and intraoral swelling in submental region with extraoral laceration. The patient had no history of loss of consciousness, vomiting, seizure, convulsion, and ENT bleeding after trauma. On extraoral examination, laceration was seen on the lower lip and submental region and abrasion was seen on the tip of the nose and lateral border of the left eye and forehead. The extraocular muscle movements were normal and pupils were equally reacting to light which had a positive response. Complete examination of the body was done for any injuries and there were no positive findings.\nOn intraoral examination, the following were observed: Anterior open bite, restricted mouth opening (20 mm), tenderness while opening mouth over temporomandibular joint on both sides, condylar movement palpable on both sides, fractured maxillary incisor, swelling in the sublingual region, and root stumps in the posteriors. The patient was advised for computed tomography scan, orthopantomogram (OPG), and chest X-ray []. On radiological examination, OPG revealed extracapsular bilateral high condyle fracture with lateral displacement, dentoalveolar fracture in the lower anterior region, and maxillary central incisor. Under the guidance of the General Medicine Department, the chest X-ray revealed no abnormality.\nThe patient was informed and explained about the findings in the radiological examination and consequences if the fracture was not treated at the earliest.

He did not have any history or symptoms suggestive of neurogenic bladder.\nThe patient underwent 3 sessions of hemodialysis and was planned for CAPD catheter insertion with vancomycin prophylaxis. As per protocol, he was advised to void his bladder completely and to pass stools before insertion. An infraumbilical midline incision was made under local anesthesia and IV sedation, an 18-G introducer needle was inserted through the rectus sheath until it reached the peritoneal cavity, and 1.5 L of peritoneal dialysate was instilled intraperitoneally. After instillation of fluid, a guidewire was passed through the needle, with the tip directed towards the suprapubic region. The needle was removed, the tract was dilated using a 16 Fr dilator followed by insertion of a 16 Fr peel away sheath/dilator. The guidewire was removed followed by the dilator, and Tenckhoff swan-neck double-cuff straight catheter was inserted through the peel away sheath. The sheath was peeled away, and a subcutaneous tunnel was created with the exit site facing down and out towards the left iliac fossa. The deep cuff was positioned over the peritoneum, and the superficial cuff was placed in the tunnel. The incision site was sutured in layers. Postprocedure, the inflow and outflow were found to flow without resistance, and the catheter was brought out through a left-sided tunnel.

There was no trauma to the area, but the patient reported playing netball shortly before the pain started. There was no associated nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel or urinary habit. There was no fever and no symptoms of cough or breathing difficulties.\nThe patient had no significant medical history and immunisations were up to date. On examination, she was apyrexial with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute, oxygen saturations of 99% on room air and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. She was warm and well perfused with a central capillary refill time of <2 seconds. She appeared distressed when laying down reporting worsening pain; however, the abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation. Systemic examination was otherwise unremarkable.\nUrine analysis showed no evidence of infection and blood tests revealed a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 23 mg/L and a normal full blood count with white cells of 13.4 \u00d7 109 cells/L. Liver function tests, urea and electrolytes, and venous blood gas were also normal.\nWith normal observations, examination and investigation results and a good response to analgesia in the department, the patient was discharged with a planned review.\nOn re-assessment the following day, she continued to complain of significant pain on the right side of the abdomen with similar features on examination. Owing to the persistence of symptoms, chest radiography (Fig. ) and abdominal ultrasound were performed. Both were reported as normal. With no surgical or medical cause of the pain identified, it was deemed musculoskeletal in origin, associated with playing netball.
