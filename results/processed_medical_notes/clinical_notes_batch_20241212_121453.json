She had a significant loss of weight of 6 kg over the last 6 months. General examination revealed a firm left supraclavicular lymph node. Cutaneous examination revealed the presence of multiple tender nodules with a soft, rubbery consistency with overlying superficial telangiectasia scattered on the scalp [], face [], upper chest [], and lower back, varying in size from 0.5 cm \u00d7 0.5 cm to 2 cm \u00d7 2 cm.\nThe differential diagnoses considered based on her clinical presentation were cutaneous lymphoma, cutaneous metastases, and histiocytosis. Her blood investigations were within normal limits. A skin biopsy from one of the nodules showed hyperkeratosis with prominence of the granular layer. The dermis was infiltrated by a tumor composed predominantly of loose clusters of round cells with eccentrically placed, hyperchromatic nuclei, and abundant amounts of cytoplasm containing neutral mucin [Figures \u2013]. On immunohistochemistry, the cells were pancytokeratin positive. A diagnosis of metastatic poorly differentiated signet cell carcinoma was made based on the histopathological findings. A gastroscopy-guided biopsy done from the gastric mucosa showed poorly differentiated signet cell-type adenocarcinoma. A computed tomography scan and positron emission tomography scan done showed thickening of the cecal wall and omentum with enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes. An explorative laparotomy was done, which showed an obstructive growth in the short segment of the ascending colon with extensive nodal involvement. She was diagnosed to have a synchronous adenocarcinoma of the stomach and cecum. A palliative ileotransverse anastomosis was done. She was started on chemotherapy. She however did not show any response to first-, second-, and third-line of chemotherapeutic drugs. After 6 months of being on chemotherapy, her skin nodules were found to be increasing in size. A simultaneous computed tomography scan showed disease progression. She succumbed to her disease",

He also exhibited left eye visual field deficits, which the patient said had been present for 2 weeks. He described the deficit as starting as a small black dot that slowly progressed to complete blackness. The patient was referred for an immediate full dilated eye exam, where the optometrist ordered an MRI of the brain and orbits. In addition, ambulatory referral to ENT was placed for evaluation of his abnormal palate and differentiation of persistent allergic rhinitis and/or bacterial sinusitis. The emergency department discharged him with cetirizine and oxymetazoline for congestion and counseled him to return if symptoms continued or acutely worsened.\nFour days later, the patient got an orbit and sinus MRI that showed a large multi-spatial nasopharyngeal and nasal cavity mass involving the left sphenopalatine foramen that extended anteriorly into the nasal cavity along the turbinates reaching the left nasal passage, posteriorly to invade and replace the bony sella, laterally through the pterygomaxillary fissure, and caudally anterior to the adenoids with obliteration of the nasopharyngeal airway (Fig. ). The mass measured approximately 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 cm. CT of the facial bones also showed the large multi-spatial nasopharyngeal and nasal cavity mass with associated destructive and expansile bony changes.

Nine days later, while the baby was being breastfed, she had a presyncopal episode, shortness of breath and grunting. All of which suddenly resolved after a few minutes. She was brought to the emergency room where she had a second episode.\nDuring examination, her oxygen saturation was 24% in room air. She was resuscitated with mask and balloon until she stabilized and was subsequently hospitalized. The intensivist decided to do a cardiac and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when a third presyncopal episode occurred on the table. She was resuscitated for a second time with success. An echocardiogram was performed and for the first time, it showed cyclic complete obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract. The recorded echocardiogram is shown in Additional file : Video S1.\nFurthermore, the MRI showed a mobile and large mass in the right ventricle which measured 13 mm \u00d7 9 mm. The mass was attached to the baso septum of the right ventricle and moved completely to the pulmonary trunk during systole. Pulmonary artery flow measurements showed the presence of pulmonary insufficiency. We observed a patent foramen oval (PFO) and a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), both of which had right to left shunts. In terms of the global kinetics of the left ventricle, it was homogeneous compared to a slight dilation in the right ventricle.

    "original_text": "A 54-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital in a comatose state. Radiological examinations revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery. She underwent urgent external ventricular drainage positioning followed by cerebral angiography, resulting in a successful occlusion of the aneurysm with endovascular coiling. After the procedure, she developed a status epilepticus, which was efficaciously treated. A cerebral angiography showed a moderate distal vasospasm and an MRI demonstrated an ischemic area in the left precentral frontal lobe with no clinical correlation. She was discharged and transferred to a rehabilitation hospital.\nSeven months later, a follow-up cerebral angiography showed a recanalization of the aneurysm, which required retreatment. At that point, she had also developed severe hypertension and was able to suspend antiepileptic treatment. During retreatment, intravenous nimodipine was administered because of ongoing vasospasm throughout the procedure. Endovascular treatment was prolonged due to a complex vascular anatomy: after unsuccessfully attempting to perform a stent-assisted coiling procedure, a coiling-only procedure was carried out, thus resulting in a much larger volume of contrast medium administration. Final sequences documented no vessel occlusion or emboli. The patient emerged from general anesthesia with severe right hemiparesis and complete aphasia. A postoperative CT scan showed an edematous area in the left cerebral hemisphere, an abnormal subarachnoid contrast enhancement zone (probably secondary to contrast extravasation) and a focal left parasagittal frontal hyperdense area []. A new CT scan performed at about 20 h after a neurological deflection showed a new left parasagittal frontal hypodense area at the vertex and in the left precentral gyrus (territory of the middle cerebral artery).

Physical examination demonstrated a firm, nonpulsatile, 8-cm swelling in the medial upper arm that was painless during palpation (Fig. ). There were no signs of vascular or neurologic failure. No enlarged lymph nodes were palpable in the axilla. Bone scan revealed increased uptake at the site of the osteochondroma.

In the electrophysiology lab his ECG showed AFL with 4:1 conduction. AFL cycle length was 180 ms, preventing entrainment maneuver. Under direct fluoroscopy guidance, a Bard DECA catheter was advanced to the coronary sinus. Subsequently, an EPT Blazer II 8 mm ablation catheter was advanced to the right atrium and positioned in the CTI area at 6 o\u2019clock position from the left anterior oblique view where ablation was performed at a power of 35 W and a temperature of 45 \u00b0C. After initial series of RFAs guided by temperature and impedance, the tachycardia cycle length slowed down to 190 ms. Therefore, entrainment was then attempted with pacing cycle length of 180 ms at the CTI area from 6 - 7 o\u2019clock positions. However, the atrium was not captured. Further RFAs were performed along the CTI employing maximum power up to 100 W and maximum temperature of 60 \u00b0C for a maximum of 60 s. Ablation was performed across the CTI between 6 and 8 o\u2019clock positions from the left anterior oblique view without a change in the cycle length. Therefore, coronary sinus catheter was then pulled back to be positioned at the lateral right atrial wall. The atrial activation sequence showed a pattern consistent with typical AFL. Then the coronary sinus catheter was repositioned inside the coronary sinus and entrainment was successful from the proximal coronary sinus, with post pacing interval minus tachycardia cycle length of < 10 - 15 ms. These findings were very supportive again of typical isthmus dependent AFL. Therefore, ablation was performed medially, and just posterior and anterior to coronary sinus os resulting in successful termination of AFL and resumption of sinus rhythm. Insurance burns and differential pacing was performed. Post-ablation",

There was no family history of congenital anomalies, stillbirths, miscarriages, or consanguinity.\nAt the initial visit, abdominal ultrasonography indicated an estimated fetal weight of 1,095 g, amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 32, and a small stomach bubble.

    "original_text": "A 21-year-old woman presented with headache of 5 years duration. The headache used to be left-sided accompanied with vomiting, and intolerance to noise and light. The frequency of headache was 3\u20134 times a month. She was diagnosed with migraine headaches, and took the following drugs for migraine: Flunarizine, propranolol, tramadol, and naproxen. She had partial relief with flunarizine. However, she developed episodic retro-orbital pain with nausea. There was no history suggestive of neither prior central nervous system infection nor intraventricular hemorrhage. There was no papilledema. The neurological examination was normal throughout the course of illness. The initial diagnosis was migraine. A combination of above-mentioned drugs was tried sequentially but did not relieve headache. She was evaluated with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain, which revealed the dilatation of left lateral ventricle, with no periventricular lucency. As she did not have any classical clinical features of raised ICP, the headache was not attributed to asymmetric ventriculomegaly. She was asked to continue medications. She underwent MRI twice at the annual interval, with no change in her ventriculomegaly. The constructed interference in steady state three-dimensional sequence revealed a membrane blocking the foramen of Monro but no lesion []. Lumbar puncture was not done to find the etiology of the occlusion of foramen as the patient had unilateral ventriculomegaly, and it was deemed as a contraindication. A final diagnosis of idiopathic occlusion of the left foramen of Monro was made. The proposed mechanism of headache was probably raised ICP due to obstruction of the foramen of Monro. As she did not have adequate relief of headache, a decision for surgery was taken after mutual discussion with referring neurologist and patient.\nShe underwent left precoronal burr hole, and neuroendoscopy. As the patient had left ventriculomegaly, burr hole was placed on left side. The right side ventricle was small, and negotiation of endoscope in the right ventricle would have been technically difficult",

The initial hemoglobin level was 6.3 g/dL, and the hematocrit level was 20.0% with a mean corpuscle volume of 98.0 fL. For 10 years, since he had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction, he had been taking aspirin and clopidogrel.

His blood test results were normal except for evidence of anemia, and echocardiography showed no other abnormal findings related to his cardiovascular condition.\nAn esophagogastroduodenoscopy found several erosions and small healing ulcers on the antrum. The colonoscopy result was normal. These findings were not sufficient to explain the severe anemia. For the small-bowel evaluation, capsule endoscopy was performed. It showed active bleeding from the proximal jejunum; however, the exact mucosal lesions were not determined (). Enteroscopy was planned for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes but could not be performed immediately because of the higher risk of bleeding related to the use of antiplatelet agents during the procedure. He stopped taking both aspirin and clopidogrel to prevent further bleeding. Computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed multifocal and small enhancing nodular lesions in the jejunum in the portal venous phase scan (). Mesenteric angiography showed dysplastic vessels accompanying early filling drainage at branches of the cecal and proximal jejunal arteries. Multiple slow-filling nodular stains in the small bowel were also detected. On the basis of these CT and angiographic findings, the small-bowel lesions were presumably diagnosed as unusual presentations of AD or hemangioma.

Her physical examination revealed mild epigastric tenderness and a palpable lump in the left hypochondrium. Other system examinations were normal. She had a history of the first episode of abdominal pain eight months earlier when she was treated at a local hospital with conservative therapy and improved. Two months later, when she experienced a second episode of abdominal pain, she was evaluated with an abdominal ultrasound, which showed 7.2 x 5.7 cm cystic lesion in relation to the body and tail of the pancreas. There was no calculus in the gallbladder. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan at that time revealed a bulky pancreatic head with 5.5 x 6 cm cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas. There were no internal septa, calcifications, or internal solid component. From her medical history, the attending physician came to know that she was taking valproic acid for generalized tonic-clonic seizure for about four years. She was not receiving any other drugs. Her serum amylase and lipase were significantly raised (361 U/L and 729 U/L, respectively). Viral serology for hepatitis A, B, C, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus were negative. There was no evidence of hypertriglyceridemia and hypercalcemia. There was no history of trauma. After excluding other causes of pancreatitis, she was diagnosed as a case of valproic acid-induced pseudocyst of the pancreas. The Valproic acid was stopped, and she received symptomatic medical treatment and responded well. She was discharged from the hospital five days after admission with the advice of regular follow-up. But, within 10 days of the withdrawal of the valproic acid, the seizures reappeared and levetiracetam was started.

She complained of intermittent tingling sensations in her left leg and a pulsatile mass in the left popliteal region that had been present for a few years. She did not seek medical attention and was still working as a hairdresser. Over time, the numbness and weakness in the left leg worsened. Urgent magnetic resonance imaging revealed a massive left-sided popliteal mass containing thrombus and no musculoskeletal abnormalities. She was immediately referred to the vascular surgery department. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a PAA containing a partially organized thrombus in the left lower extremity (). Three-dimensional computed tomography revealed a solitary fusiform aneurysm of the left popliteal artery and the absence of abdominal and contralateral peripheral aneurysms.

There was no history of trauma. Besides the discomfort in the left elbow, the patient had a history of lumbar disc protrusion and hypertension, which was well controlled with medication. No other medical related history could be traced. Physical examination showed a painless mass (about 1 cm*2 cm) in the ulnar side of her left elbow with no inflammation. Neurologic examination revealed light numbness on the ulnar side of her left hand and fingers. No pathological sign was detected positive. Electromyography (EMG) showed the ulnar nerve across the elbow was injured. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed a subcutaneous irregular abnormal signal in the upper ulnar side of left forearm, hyperintense on T1and T2-weighted image which was considered to be a benign lesion, and joint effusion in the left elbow (Fig. ). X-ray showed degenerated change in the left elbow joint. Laboratory studies revealed the routine blood test, tumor markers, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were all within normal range. The mass was considered to be a cystic form disease which compressed the ulnar nerve. With the guidance of ultrasound, we first located the cyst. Precise puncture and aspiration were made with a 18G biopsy needle (Gallini, Italy) to evacuate mucinous material inside the cyst.

The patient gave history of pain and swelling on lower left side of the jaw 4 years back, diagnosed as moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of left mandibular alveolus involving the ramus due to chronic tobacco chewing since 40 years. The medical history revealed that the patient was surgically operated 4 years back by a wide resection of the tumor with left hemimandibulectomy without disarticulation, left radical neck dissection and reconstruction with pectoralis major myocutaneous flap. Extraoral examination indicated facial asymmetry and a convex profile with deviation of mandible to the left side []. Past dental history revealed extraction of periodontally weakened maxillary teeth from 11, 21 to 27. Intraoral examination revealed maxillary kennedy's class II partially edentulous arch with missing teeth from 11, 21 to 27 and on palpation, the absence of mandibular ridge from left canine region posteriorly with missing teeth 33 to 37.

The lobectomy had been followed by four adjuvant cures of carboplatin GP 16. His main past medical history was hypertensive cardiopathy and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. On a clinical point of view, he had no symptoms and in particular no general physical deterioration. The computed tomography (CT) scan showed a left adrenal mass (7 \u00d7 10 cm enhanced with contrast) associated with a renal vein tumor thrombus (Fig. ). A positron emission tomography scanner showed adrenal mass and renal vein tumor thrombus hypermetabolism proving their tumoral hallmarks. Surgical treatment was decided after anticoagulation treatment initiated (continuous intravenous administration of sodic heparin at the dose of 500 international unit/kg/day); after a left subcostal incision, the left colon was mobilized and the retroperitoneal space approached. Once the adrenal gland was visualized, its main vein was isolated and followed until the renal vein to localize the tumor thrombus. Using kidney cancer surgical technique for vena cava thrombectomy, we isolated all the confluents to the renal vein. After quadruple clamping (renal vein X2, spermatic vein and lumbar vein), the left renal vein was laterally opened in order to perform the thrombectomy, and the main adrenal vein was cut. Total clamping time was 12 min with no arterial clamping and no renal cooling required. The renal vein was washed with a heparinized saline solution and closed with a polypropylene 6/0 running suture.

She had Cesarean section 13 months before with no early complications. Her baby was healthy. Two months afterward, she presented with an abdominal wall mass around the incision. In addition, she had pain and infected vaginal discharge. She was given medical treatment with antibiotics by her treating physician. Two months later, she had surgery for the drainage of her collection with a drain left in place. However, afterward she had discharge from other points in the incision line. Finally after 2 months, she was subjected to another surgery, consisting of wound exploration, excision of the fistula tract, and open drainage. Nevertheless, the discharge continued and she referred to our clinic. On examination, she had a Cesarean section scar in the suprapubic region with some holes with a pussy discharge.\nWe performed fistulography by injecting the contrast material from one of the holes in the skin () under the guidance of computed tomography (CT) (). The radiologist reported 20\u00d79 mm complex fistula tracts in the images. Ultrasound and cell blood count were normal. We decided to perform surgery. Intraoperatively, we first injected methylene blue dye from the fistula opening and followed the tracts in the skin and subcutaneous tissue, muscles, and peritoneal cavity. We thereafter debrided the necrotic tissues. We found the main route to the abdominal cavity, and then we did laparotomy and enterolysis. The tract ended in the anterior wall of the uterus.

He eventually developed worsening coronary artery disease and underwent triple vessel coronary artery bypass surgery 2 years later. Following that, he developed calcific valvular heart disease and severe cardiomyopathy and underwent mechanical mitral and aortic valve replacement (2011), then a dual-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation for primary prevention in 2012. On follow-up, he developed recurrent episodes of VT appropriately treated with ICD shocks, which proved refractory to antiarrhythmic therapy including sotalol, mexiletine, and amiodarone.\nAfter multidisciplinary consultation, he was deemed not a candidate for heart transplant owing to hostile chest and a porcelain aorta, nor a candidate for standard approach of endocardial ablation owing to mechanical mitral and aortic valves. We initially attempted an epicardial ablation using a subxiphoid approach; however, significant amounts of adhesions prevented advancement of the guidewire in the pericardium.

He had vomiting, colicky lower abdominal pain but no distension or constipation. His scrotum was empty from birth but social reasons hampered his presentation to hospital for appropriate medical care.\nHe was in mild painful distress, otherwise he was clinically stable. He had normal male secondary sexual characteristics for his age. There was an 8 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 12 cm firm, tender, irreducible right inguinal mass with no differential warmth. The normal circumcised penis had normal-situated urethral meatus. Both hemiscrota appeared developed but empty (), with no palpable testis in the left inguinal region. A diagnosis of obstructed right inguinal hernia with bilateral cryptorchidism was made. Pcv result was 38% and urinalysis was normal. Abdominal ultrasound noted a 3 cm defect in the right inguinal region through which aperistaltic bowel loops herniated. Both testes were in the right inguinal region and were normal in size, outline, echo pattern, showed normal flow on Doppler interrogation and had no focal mass lesion. The consultant surgeon worked up the patient and did emergency groin exploration.\nRight inguinotomy revealed two testes of equal appearance within the inguinal region. The right testis, terminal ileum and apparently normal appendix were within the hernial sac in the inguinal canal, while the left testis was lying anterior to the sac and abutting on the right superficial ring ().

Magnetic resonance images showed a hypointense mass on T2-weighted images and hyperintense signals on diffusion-weighted images in the left peripheral zone of the prostate (Fig. ). Pathological examination of the 12 core needle biopsy specimens showed atypical cell growth with tubular architecture in 3 cores, i.e. 2 cores of Gleason score 5 and one core of Gleason score 4. Under the diagnosis of prostate cancer of Gleason score 5, the patient underwent radiotherapy (i.e., external radiotherapy 50 Gy/25 fractions and brachytherapy 18 Gy/2 fractions) to the prostate cancer in September 2012. Elevated PSA level normalized promptly after the radiotherapy. Due to the enlargement of ground glass nodule (GGN; Fig. ) in the left upper lung (i.e., from 1 cm, at the time of radiotherapy to the prostate cancer, to 2.1 cm), the patient was referred to our Department and underwent wide resection of the nodule in December 2019. Both frozen section and postoperative permanent section showed atypical cuboidal cell lining in a lipidemic fashion, leading to the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in situ. Follow-up computed tomography 6 months after the wide resection showed a rapid enlargement of a solid nodule (Fig. ) judged as a presumed inflammatory nodule in the right middle lobe at the time of wide resection of the GGN (Fig. ), highly suggesting a primary malignant neoplasm of the lung. The preoperative serum PSA level was still within normal range. Intraoperative frozen section of the solid nodule showed tall columnar atypical cells with trabecular pattern, leading to the tentative diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the lung.

Six years ago, he had undergone endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early gastric cancer, and the pathological diagnosis was a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma extending into the mucosa, but without lymphovascular invasion. On admission, physical examination was unremarkable, and all blood tests were within the normal ranges. Colonoscopy revealed a flat elevated lesion with a slightly depressed area, 20 mm in diameter, in the cecum (Fig. ). After the application of 0.2 % indigo carmine dye, the lesion could be observed more clearly (Fig. ). Magnifying endoscopy with NBI revealed that the surface pattern was slightly irregular and that the microvessels were regular in terms of diameter and distribution in the margin of the lesion (Fig. ). In contrast, in the central part of the lesion, irregularity in the tumor surface pattern and form as well as in the diameter and distribution of microvessels was observed; however, due to mucus, avascular areas were also observed (Fig. ). Magnifying endoscopy with 0.05 % crystal violet staining showed IIIL and VI pit patterns [] in the margin of the lesion (Fig. ), while a VI pit pattern was seen in the central part; however, this finding could not be fully corroborated due to the presence of mucus exudate in the central part of the lesion (Fig. ). In addition, abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed no lymph node or distant metastasis. We judged that the lesion was a primary adenocarcinoma, invading the mucosa and even slightly infiltrating the submucosa. After receiving written informed consent from the patient, the lesion was successfully removed en bloc using ESD without complications.

His seizures were identified to be of left temporal in origin with the help of video EEG recordings. MRI brain showed left-sided MTS. His seizures were refractory to antiepileptic drugs and hence surgical option was considered. Anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) with amygdalohippocampectomy (AH) was done on the left side in December 2001. No psychiatric problems were noted during premorbid evaluation by a psychiatrist except reports of \u2018proneness to irritability\u2019 from relatives.\nIn the immediate postoperative period itself, he developed behavioural disturbance in the form of irritability, excessive talk, over familiarity, and making tall claims like he has a lot of property in his name. He had disturbed sleep and poor appetite. These symptoms lasted for around 3 months and he was on put antipsychotics. Following this, his symptoms improved. He later stopped his medications abruptly and had another episode of similar illness around a year later. Subsequently, he developed around six episodes of similar symptoms in the next 13 years with each episode lasting around 2-3 months. There were only minimal interepisodic symptoms and he was functioning well with no prophylactic medications in between the episodes. Seizures were not reported after the surgery.\nThe current episode was of 1-month duration.

He was found to be icteric with tenderness over his epigastrium, and serum amylase of 1824 U/L with liver panel suggestive of obstructive jaundice (Bilirubin 113, ALP 136). CT of his abdomen and pelvis showed a common bile duct stone with upstream dilatation and a pancreatic neck suggestive of acute necrotising pancreatitis. There were no collections at this point. He underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, sphincterotomy and stone retrieval successfully with no residual stones.\nHe subsequently developed recurrent bouts of pancreatitis, where interval CT showed development of a pseudocyst of up to 11 cm in maximal diameter. After discussion with the patient, plans were made to proceed with laparoscopic cystgastrostomy. However, on the day before his operation, he developed acute abdominal pain refractory to analgesia with hypotension and oliguria refractory to fluid resuscitation. On examination, there was guarding on abdominal palpation in all quadrants. He was diagnosed to have a ruptured pseudocyst and underwent emergent laparoscopic washout, necrosectomy distal pancreaticosplenectomy with cholecystectomy.\nA 12 mm port was used for the periumbilical camera access as well as in the epigastrium and left iliac fossa. Five mm ports were used in the left and right hypochondria 5 mm. On entry into the abdomen, gross pancreatic ascites of 2.2 l was drained. Findings included a ruptured PP and necrosis in the retroperitoneal tissue. Dense adhesions were encountered which required extensive adhesiolysis. The cyst wall was dissected off the pancreas and the stomach. The short gastric artery was divided and spleen mobilised.

    "original_text": "In May 2020, an 86-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and vomiting. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed small bowel intussusception (Fig. ) in right lower abdomen, and proximal bowel loops of the lesion were diffusely dilated. A slightly enhanced nodule was detected at the lead point of the intussusception, which made us suspect the existence of a tumor, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumor, small intestine cancer, neuroendocrine tumor, and leiomyoma. Laboratory examination was significant for iron deficiency anemia with hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL. We considered performing emergency laparotomy at this point, but did not, because the patient\u2019s general condition was stable and intestinal necrosis was not suspected. We considered elective laparoscopic surgery after decompression of the small bowel is better. Hence, conservative treatment by long tube decompression was carried out. Although her general condition improved and the small bowel seemed to be decompressed by abdominal X-ray, the volume of drainage from the long tube remained high, constipation persisted and her hemoglobin level was dropped to 6.4 g/dL in 1 week. Therefore, we decided to perform diagnostic laparoscopy, after transfusion of red blood cells.\nThe operation was performed with 3 ports. Initially, a 12-mm trocar was inserted through an umbilical incision. Two trocars were then inserted in the left flank. After confirming the diagnosis of intussusception and absence of abdominal adhesions, a mini-laparotomy was made to observe whole small intestine. The lesion was easily identified as a mass, approximately 4 cm in diameter, had caused a small bowel intussusception (Fig. ). Considering the possibility of malignancy, such as small intestinal adenocarcinoma, we decided to remove the mass with approximately 10 cm of proximal and distal margin. We did not perform lymph node dissection because the necessity of lymph node dissection for small intestinal adenocarcinoma is controversial, and lymph node metastasis was not suspected during the operation.

She initially presented with lower abdominal pain immediately following vaginal intercourse described as nonvigorous with the patient mostly \u2018on top\u2019, and no history of foreign body use or trauma. CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast performed at the outside hospital revealed an intra-abdominal hematoma with extravasation of contrast questionably from one of the branches of the left internal iliac artery (Figs and ). No adnexal lesions were identified on the CT. Upon arrival, the patient was complaining of constant, sharp, severe bilateral lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea and fatigue. There was no history of loss of consciousness, vomiting, vaginal or rectal bleeding, or hematuria. A past surgical history consisted of appendectomy. Her last menstrual period was 19 days prior to presentation.\nOn examination, the patient was in painful distress. Vital signs were stable. Abdominal examination revealed bilateral lower quadrant and suprapubic tenderness with guarding. Perineal and genital examination revealed no evidence of trauma. Laboratory investigations revealed a white cell count of 12 200/mm3 and hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dl. Basic metabolic panel, partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, lipase, ethyl alcohol level and urinalysis were normal. \u03b2-hCG was negative for pregnancy.\nBased on the CT scan findings, interventional radiology was consulted and selective left internal iliac artery angiogram was performed and identified no active extravasation or pseudoaneurysm. Exploratory laparotomy was then performed to identify the source of bleeding. Preoperatively, blood pressure was 97/47 and the heart rate was 76 bpm.
