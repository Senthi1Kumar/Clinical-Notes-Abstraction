A 2.5-cm diameter tumor with an irregular shape and high density on mammography was identified in the right breast, and a nonpalpable 1.2 cm irregular isoechogenic mass with an angular margin () was found in the left breast on sonography. A core biopsy revealed that the mass in the right breast was an infiltrating ductal carcinoma, and the mass in the left breast was an intraductal papilloma.

Excision of the mass in the left breast was performed under ultrasound guidance. Histopathology revealed an intraductal papilloma (). The patient underwent, an additional, three cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with the taxol regimen and radiation therapy to the right chest wall region.\nAt the six month follow-up sonography of the left breast showed architectural distortion and a mixed echogenic mass 1.5 cm in diameter at the inner portion of the left breast, with an internal anechoic cystic portion suggestive of fat necrosis (). The patient underwent two additional ultrasounds during a 12-month period; the mixed echogenic mass appeared to be shrinking from 15 mm to 10 mm in diameter ().

He had been started on sclerotherapy 4 years earlier because of leg length discrepancy causing gait disturbance. However, this treatment was stopped because there was no remarkable improvement. A year before presentation, the AVM had undergone rapid expansion causing significant pain and high-output cardiac failure. Therefore, an amputation of the affected lower limb was recommended at the other hospital.\nOn admission to Kyungpook National University Hospital, an examination revealed that AVM with soft tissue hypertrophy had spread all over the right leg (). A chest X-ray showed marked cardiomegaly with increased pulmonary vascularities (). Electrocardiography showed normal sinus rhythm with right ventricular hypertrophy. Two-dimensional echocardiography showed an enlarged right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle, but relatively good left ventricular contractility. The pulmonary artery was also enlarged, but there was no pulmonary edema. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the right lower extremity revealed extensive AVM with feeding arteries from the branches of the right profunda femoris and superficial femoral arteries. The venous drainage was through the superficial femoral and deep femoral veins, and there was a marked dilatation of the pelvic vein and inferior vena cava (). The blood investigations were found to be normal.\nOne week before surgery, the patient was scheduled to receive preoperative selective embolization to reduce the size of the AVM and minimize the risk of uncontrolled intraoperative bleeding. For embolization, the radiologist performed catheterization through the left common femoral artery and installed a tourniquet over the right proximal thigh. Soon after, remarkable bradycardia developed due to a baroreceptor reflex-induced abrupt increase in the systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and this procedure was cancelled. After a thorough discussion with the plastic surgeons, orthopedic surgeons, and vascular surgeons, right hip disarticulation was considered to be the best option for improving the patient",

Abdominal pain was of recent onset and mainly in the left upper abdomen but she had fever for at least 6 months. Her pyrexia was high grade (39.5\u201340 C0), intermittent, and most common in the early morning. Clinical examination revealed a firm, vaguely defined, tender mass in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Blood results showed persistently high ESR (>100), high CRP (>240), leukocytosis, mildly raised Alkaline Phosphatase and anaemia (normochromic, normocytic). There was no overt source of infection that could account for the fever. Repeated blood cultures did not yield any bacterial growth. NM Leukocyte HMPAO scan showed no convincing abnormality to help localise an infective focus. There was no improvement in pyrexia after treating the patient with broad-spectrum antibiotics.\nCT scan of the abdomen was performed which showed three heterogeneous masses in left upper abdomen relating to splenic flexure of colon, pancreatic body and tail and left crus of the diaphragm (figure ).

A CT scan showed thickened right parietal pleura with a minimal pleural effusion, but no pulmonary nodules or lymphadenopathies or distant metastases. Because of negative cytology malignancy, the patient underwent a thoracoscopic pleural biopsy on December 2004 that showed an epithelioid monophasic pleural mesothelioma, followed by talc pleurodesis at the end of the procedure.\nThree weeks later the patient underwent a right extrapleural pneumonectomy with coverage of the bronchial stump with a flap of thymic tissue. The pathological examination confirmed a monophasic epithelioid pleural mesothelioma, with lung and pericardial fat infiltration, but no invasion of the diaphragm or pericardium (pT3 N0 M0). The postoperative period was uneventful.\nTen months later the patient complained of a fever and cough. The diagnosis of broncho-pleural fistula was made immediately after the first appearance of cough and fever by bronchoscopy that clearly showed a 2-mm fistula on the mediastinal side of the stump confirmed by the methilene blue passage from bronchus to the chest tube. Rapid fluid drainage and antibiotic therapy allowed us to cure the infection of the pleural space avoiding the formation of empyema. After chest tube drainage, the attempt to conservatively close the fistula using biological glue was unsuccessful. So we decided to use a modified Y Dumon stent (Tracheobronxane Y; Novatech SA, La Ciotat Cedex France) to exclude the right stump. The right arm of the Y was shortened and the open end was closed with a silicone material from which the stent was fabricated, and then inserted in the tracheobronchial tree trough a rigid bronchoscope.

The procedure resulted in normalization of his renal function and no signs of rejection were reported in his follow-up records.\nThe patient was compliant with his immune-suppressive therapy and maintained frequent follow-up visits to his nephrologist during which he had normal renal transplant function.\nIn 2013, the patient travelled outside the country for work purposes. During his overseas stay, he had gradual deterioration in his kidney function for which he was treated conservatively until his creatinine level ranged between 2.0\u20133.0 mg/dL. A kidney biopsy of the transplant was performed in March 2014 and he was informed that no obvious pathology could be determined. Conservative management was continued.\nIn June 2015, the patient returned home and he was admitted for further investigations at our transplant unit. Upon admission, a right iliac fossa pulsatile mildly tender mass was felt and a bruit was clearly audible. His creatinine ranged between 4.0\u20134.5 mg/dL. Duplex ultrasound revealed a 110 \u00d7 90 mm partially thrombosed aneurysm adjacent to the upper half of the transplanted kidney.

The patient had a history of intermittent abdominal pain and hypertension without other risk factors for atherosclerosis. A computed tomographic angiogram (CTA) revealed chronic total occlusion of the abdominal aorta from the inferior mesenteric artery level to the level of both common iliac arteries (). The CTA also showed chronic total occlusion of the left external iliac artery and acute total occlusion of the left popliteal artery (). Through an endovascular thrombectomy, the popliteal artery occlusion was removed, and angiography confirmed good distal run-off through the anterior and posterior tibial arteries (). However, 3 days after the procedure, the patient suffered from the same intractable pain in the left leg. Repeated femoral angiography showed a recurrence of the acute total occlusion of the left popliteal artery. After repeated endovascular treatment, urgent surgery was performed to prevent the reoccurrence of thromboembolism. Exploration of the abdominal aorta found fresh white clots that were adherent to the aortic wall (). Resection of the abdominal aorta below the inferior mesenteric artery was followed by aortic replacement with a 20\u00d710\u00d710-mm Dacron Y graft (Meadox Medicals, Oakland, NJ, USA). Distal anastomosis of the right and left arteries was performed on the common iliac artery and common femoral artery levels, respectively ().

However, due to the abnormal ranges of the platelet count since the first day of admission (ranging from 533\u00d7103/\u03bcL to 1,149\u00d7103/\u03bcL), a bone marrow biopsy was performed postoperatively. The exam showed markedly increased numbers of megakaryocytes, which were clustered with mature cytoplasm and hyper-lobulated nuclei. However, the clusters lacked hematopoietic cells. A cytogenetic study revealed the patient was heterozygous for the JAK2 mutation.

    "original_text": "A 78-year-old Japanese woman (gravida 10, para 2, abortion 8) had a 10-year history of uterine prolapse but she had no gynecological examination. She had no smoking history and her body mass index was 19.7. She visited our hospital because of a 1-month history of bleeding from an ulcerated lesion on the surface of the prolapsed uterus. Upon examination, the uterine prolapse appeared as complete eversion of the posterior vaginal fornix and was manually irreducible and classified as stage IV according to the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System []. On the surface of the completely prolapsed uterus, an ulcerated lesion of 3 cm in diameter was observed and a deep-seated induration was felt. A histological biopsy of a mass in the vaginal wall led to a diagnosis of keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the mass with a depth of 1.6 cm, but the endometrial cavity was not depicted (Fig. ). The mass was located approximately 3 cm from the cervical os with no sign of invasion to adjacent tissue. According to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system, the tumor was vaginal cancer staged as I, and a fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT revealed no metastases to the lymph nodes or other organs. Although the diagnosis of this case was vaginal cancer, the main tumor was located in the uterine cervix because of the completely prolapsed uterus. Therefore, we considered that it is practical to develop the treatment plan according to the uterine cervical cancer.

    "original_text": "A 16 year old male presented to our emergency department having been the victim of a 'drive-by' shooting. He was haemodynamically stable with shotgun wounds to the left side of the head and neck. Primary and secondary surveys were essentially normal barring superficial wounds but a CT trauma series was performed to look for occult injuries and establish pellet trajectories. The report confirmed over 70 lead density pellets scattered throughout the sub-cutaneous tissues of the left head, neck and shoulder. It also revealed a single pellet in the right atrium in the absence of any cardiac or mediastinal injury (see figure ). However, there was evidence of damage to the left brachiocephalic vein with extravasation of contrast. The most plausible explanation for the intra-cardiac pellet was intra-vascular migration from the left brachiocephalic vein to the heart via the superior vena cava.\nGiven the nature of his injuries the patient was moved to HDU for observation and on day 2 went to theatre for debridement and exploration of neck and facial wounds. Conservative management with antibiotics and serial scanning to monitor further bullet migration was favoured over surgical extraction for the intra-cardiac pellet. This decision was based on the patient being asymptomatic, the pellet being in the right side of the heart and clinical experience of previous similar cases.\nA repeat CT scan the following day demonstrated that the pellet had migrated into the right ventricle. A transthroracic echocardiogram on day 3 confirmed normal ventricular and valvular function with the pellet still in the right ventricle. It showed there was no patent foramen ovale or vetriculoseptal defect thereby excluding a paradoxical embolus.

    "cleaned_text": "a 16 year old male presented to our emergency department having been the victim of a 'drive-by' shooting. he was haemodynamically stable with shotgun wounds to the left side of the head and neck. primary and secondary surveys were essentially normal barring superficial wounds but a ct trauma series was performed to look for occult injuries and establish pellet trajectories. the report confirmed over 70 lead density pellets scattered throughout the sub-cutaneous tissues of the left head, neck and shoulder. it also revealed a single pellet in the right atrium in the absence of any cardiac or mediastinal injury (see figure ). however, there was evidence of damage to the left brachiocephalic vein with extravasation of contrast. the most plausible explanation for the intra-cardiac pellet was intra-vascular migration from the left brachiocephalic vein to the heart via the superior vena cava.\ngiven the nature of his injuries the patient was moved to hdu for observation and on day 2 went to theatre for debridement and exploration of neck and facial wounds. conservative management with antibiotics and serial scanning to monitor further bullet migration was favoured over surgical extraction for the intra-cardiac pellet. this decision was based on the patient being asymptomatic, the pellet being in the right side of the heart and clinical experience of previous similar cases.\na repeat ct scan the following day demonstrated that the pellet had migrated into the right ventricle. a transthroracic echocardiogram on day 3 confirmed normal ventricular and valvular function with the pellet still in the right ventricle. it showed there was no patent foramen ovale or vetriculoseptal defect thereby excluding a paradoxical embolus. the patient remained asymptomatic throughout the admission and was discharged after 4 days. out-patient review with x-rays at 6 weeks and 6 months after discharge showed the pellet remained within the wall of the right ventricle (see figure ). he has now been discharged from follow-up.",

Five days earlier, he had felt numbness in his upper and lower limbs bilaterally and noticed weakness in his toes on the second day of illness. He had progressive weakness, and at the time of admission to the hospital, he had weakness in both upper and lower limbs. He had no associated respiratory difficulty, swallowing difficulty, or urinary or fecal incontinence or retention. He denied a history of preceding gastroenteritis and respiratory or other infections. Other than having hypertension, his past medical history was unremarkable. He denied alcohol abuse, smoking, or recent immunizations. On examination, his higher functions were normal, and he had bilateral symmetrical upper and lower limb weakness with prominent lower limb involvement. His distal muscles were weaker (grade 3) than his proximal muscles (grade 4). His limbs were flaccid, and all the reflexes were absent with flexor plantar response. He did not demonstrate any abnormalities in sensory, sphincteric, and coordination examinations. Left-sided isolated partial ptosis was noted without associated ophthalmoplegia (Fig. ), and his pupils were of normal size, symmetric and reactive to light. He had no associated ataxia. He did not complain of any double vision and had no associated fatigability. His other cranial nerves were also normal. His cough reflex and neck muscle power were normal with 500 ml of spontaneous tidal volume. His blood pressure was 160/100 mmHg with a pulse rate of 72 beats/minute and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths/minute.

Her dentist had originally diagnosed periodontal disease, and she was unsuccessfully treated with antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; she subsequently also underwent otolaryngological and radiological examinations of the mouth, but both were negative.\nIn September 2003, a hard palate biopsy led to a histopathological diagnosis of a chorion metastasis from a breast adenocarcinoma, but the results of subsequent mammography, abdominal ultrasound, chest X-ray and neoplastic marker analyses did not reveal any evidence of a tumour. One month later, a second hard palate biopsy revealed an undifferentiated carcinoma with a focal microglandular and diffuse signet-ring cell growth infiltrating the subepithelial chorion mucosa consistent with a gastric origin (Fig. ). Although the patient was asymptomatic, gastroscopy showed an ulcerated lesion of the greater curvature of the stomach, and histopathogy revealed an undifferentiated gastric carcinoma with signet-ring cells (Fig. ).\nShe was admitted to our Institution in October 2003, when a physical examination revealed left supraclavicular adenopathy, left exophthalmus, and a firm and painless erythematous mass of nearly 4 cm on her left hard palate, with no evidence of bleeding at palpation (Fig. ).

He had additional complaints of watering along with burning and gritty sensation of the left eye since past 6 months for which he took an ophthalmic consultation.\nGeneral physical examination revealed both upper and lower limb deformities in the form of webbed fingers and poorly developed palms on the upper limbs and maldeveloped right lower limb [Figs. and ]. Facial examination revealed deviation of the nose to the right, thickened lower lip, and inability to fully approximate the lips even on forceful attempts []. There was no tongue atrophy.\nOn ocular examination, his best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes with +0.50 diopter sphere (Dsph). Near vision was N/6 in both eyes. The examination of visual axes revealed the eyes to be parallel with each other. There was restricted convergence and extraocular movements were totally restricted in abduction, and dextro- and levoversions showed moderate restriction of adduction []. There was no diplopia at near or distance or any kind of nystagmus in any gaze. Lagophthalmos of the left eye and a positive Bell's phenomenon was present due to ipsilateral facial nerve palsy [] and there was loss of conjunctival luster due to exposure.\nRest of the anterior segment evaluation showed normal anterior chamber, briskly reacting pupils, and no opacities in the lens.

Unipedicular VPs were performed with the injection of 2 ml and 2.5 ml of PMMA into each vertebra, respectively (). After the procedure, the visual analogue scale (VAS) reduced from 10 to 8, and her flank pain subsided. This state continued without additional pain relief.\nSeveral days before her visit to our clinic, the patient's back pain worsened and became aggravated when sitting, standing up, or changing her posture (VAS 10). She was also unable to stand or walk unassisted. On physical examination, only tenderness of the L1 spinous process was present and there were no neurological abnormalities. An interval progression of anterior wedging in the L1 vertebral body was detected on lumbar plain radiograph, and MR images showed findings consistent with the refracture of L1 (). Based on these results, we concluded that the previous VP in L1 had failed to relieve her pain and that refracture of L1 worsened the symptoms. We therefore proceeded to repeat VP in the L1 vertebra.\nAfter obtaining informed consent from the patient and her family, repeat VP was performed in the L1 vertebral body using a bipedicular approach with the patient in the prone position. When the bone fillers reached the fractured cavity of the L1 vertebral body, we then slowly injected 3.5 ml of PMMA bone cement on each side under real-time C-arm fluoroscopic guidance to prevent cement leakage and to ensure even dispersion of cement in the fractured lesion (). No cement leakage or dislocation of the previous injectate was detected. During the VP procedure, blood pressure, EKG, and mixed venous oxygen saturation were monitored, and oxygen was supplied via nasal cannula.",

A flap of 25 \u00d7 20 mm was made on the radial side at the base of the proximal phalanx of the right middle finger (), the vascular pedicle was ligated proximally after clamping to confirm finger blood circulation and isolated from the digital nerve, and the flap was elevated. At the same time, the dorsal branch of the digital nerve was identified in the middle phalanx, and the flap was passed under the nerve to preserve the nerve (). The fingertip defect was covered with the flap, and the donor site was closed with a skin graft.

CT revealed extensive osteolytic metastasis involving almost all the right iliac wing and acetabulum together with the right sacral wing (\n). Bone scintigraphy and 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed multiple other skeletal lesions. Biopsy of the pelvic bone revealed an epidermoid carcinoma. A vesical biopsy gave negative results, but because the prostate was clinically enlarged and the prostate-specific antigen level was increased (5 ng/mL), a prostate biopsy was performed and revealed epidermoid urothelial tumoral infiltration. The patient received a first course of systemic chemotherapy with carboplatine (AUC 5) and paclitaxel (80 mg/m2), a first infusion of bisphosphonates (4 mg acid zoledronic), and analgesics.\nGiven the pending risk of fracture and severe pain, the decision was taken in a multidisciplinary consultation to stabilize the pelvis before continuing systemic treatment and to attempt percutaneous osteosynthesis rather than open surgery because of the comorbidities and risk of complications with extensive surgery.

Upon examination, the uterine prolapse appeared as complete eversion of the posterior vaginal fornix and was manually irreducible and classified as stage IV according to the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System []. On the surface of the completely prolapsed uterus, an ulcerated lesion of 3 cm in diameter was observed and a deep-seated induration was felt. A histological biopsy of a mass in the vaginal wall led to a diagnosis of keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the mass with a depth of 1.6 cm, but the endometrial cavity was not depicted (Fig. ). The mass was located approximately 3 cm from the cervical os with no sign of invasion to adjacent tissue. According to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system, the tumor was vaginal cancer staged as I, and a fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT revealed no metastases to the lymph nodes or other organs. Although the diagnosis of this case was vaginal cancer, the main tumor was located in the uterine cervix because of the completely prolapsed uterus.

The patient complained of frequent falls after prolonged walking and short-term memory loss, while her recall of distant memories and visuospatial function were preserved. She reported urinary difficulties, such as urgency and incontinence. In summary, she had a gait disturbance that started around the age of 57, followed by cognitive impairment and urinary incontinence. She managed her activities of daily living without any problem. She had no family history of neurodegenerative disease. Neurological examination revealed a short-stepped, narrow-based non-ataxic gait. No other deficits were noted. Cognitive testing revealed a score of 28 out of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Furthermore, her initial investigation, electrolyte levels and complete blood count were within the normal range, and renal and thyroid functions were within the normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed ballooning of the ventricles (). Lumbar puncture showed a normal opening pressure, which is consistent with normal-pressure hydrocephalus. The patient showed a marked improvement in gait after 50 mL of CSF was removed. Urinary incontinence and cognitive function showed improvement. Next, a VP shunt was inserted, which led to marked improvement in the patient's gait. Brain MRI was repeated after the operation, and no change in ventriculomegaly was noted.\nNine years after the operation, at the age of 70, the patient began to experience frequent falls and a fracture to the shoulder. She underwent shoulder surgery and experienced post-operative delirium with disorientation and aggression. Following shoulder surgery, her gait, cognitive function, and urinary symptoms worsened over 6 months. There was no change in symptoms after valve pressure alteration on the VP shunt. Brain MRI did not reveal any indication of significant changes in the hydrocephalus (). However, neuropsychological assessment showed deficits in memory, frontal/executive, and language domains with an MMSE score of 26.",

The pregnancy was normal without any maternal complications, such as hypertension, diabetes, eclampsia, or infections during gestation. In addition, screening for Down syndrome revealed a low risk that did not indicate a need to conduct amniocentesis for a chromosomal abnormality test. However, the fetal ultrasound demonstrated severe TR, based on Vmax = 3.8 m/s, with estimated diameters of the cardiac chambers of LV = 11 \u00d7 19 mm, RV = 19 \u00d7 24 mm, LA = 12 \u00d7 10 mm, and RA = 13 \u00d7 16 mm. Subsequently, the female was referred to a pediatric cardiologist for advice. Because the age of the female was 40, which is a high-risk factor for birth defects, and since TR is quite commonly observed in fetal ultrasound screening, the cardiologist suggested genomic sequencing analysis of free fetal DNA in maternal blood. However, the parents refused this analysis.\nThe baby was born safely in our institute, and the first echocardiography examination postnatally demonstrated good heart function and normal structure as well as normal sizes of the 4 chambers. However, 6 months later, the baby was brought to our department due to excessive sweating and decreased milk consumption. The physical examination showed that the body temperature of the girl was 36.8\u00b0C, her heart rate was 150 beats per minute, and her respiration rate was 42 beats per minute. The blood pressure of the four limbs was as follows: 92/44 mmHg at the right upper limb, 96/58 mmHg at the left upper limb, 101/60 mmHg at the right lower limb, and 103/54 mmHg at the left lower limb.

The thumb and index fingers were completely amputated at the position of zone I [,] and the middle finger was amputated at zone II (). He was a right-handed field worker who cut rubber. We used a composite graft for the thumb and the index finger. Replantation of the middle finger was abandoned due to severe damage, and reconstruction with a reverse vascular pedicle digital island flap was performed on the day of injury because the bone was exposed at the wound and he wanted to keep the finger length as long as possible.\nSurgery was performed under general anaesthesia. All surgical steps were performed under a microscope. A flap of 25 \u00d7 20 mm was made on the radial side at the base of the proximal phalanx of the right middle finger (), the vascular pedicle was ligated proximally after clamping to confirm finger blood circulation and isolated from the digital nerve, and the flap was elevated. At the same time, the dorsal branch of the digital nerve was identified in the middle phalanx, and the flap was passed under the nerve to preserve the nerve (). The fingertip defect was covered with the flap, and the donor site was closed with a skin graft. The flap survived without any venous congestion.\nThe postoperative sensory recoveries of the flap and the dorsal skin of the distal phalanx were excellent. In the Semmes\u2013Weinstein monofilament test, the sensation of the flap returned to 3.22 (blue) and the dorsal sensation of the radial side recovered to 2.83 (green) early after surgery (). At half a year after the operation, there was no limitation in the range of motion, and the contour was good ().",

At admission, he showed mild confusion, short-term memory deficit but no speech impairment. MRI demonstrated a T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense lesion in the left insular region, which did not enhance with gadolinum (fig. ). The lesion was exposed via a pterional approach and wide splitting of the Sylvian fissure and generously removed; however, it was intentionally not radically removed. No clear limit with the surrounding normal parenchyma could be seen at surgery. Histological examination revealed a moderately increased cellularity (fig. ) compatible with diffuse astrocytoma (grade II according to the WHO classification). In addition, pseudo-cystic areas containing hemosiderin pigment and CD68-positive macrophages, interstitial hemosiderin-loaded macrophages and inflammatory cells were also detected (fig. ). These findings would indicate the presence of a pre-existing hemorrhage. After surgery, the patient's confusion definitely improved, as did the focal epilepsy.

Preoperative computed tomography (CT) and echocardiography revealed a giant cyst (12 \u00d7 10 cm in diameter) occupying a large area around the left atrium and ventricle, and it was present behind the pulmonary artery. Based on the preoperative CT findings, a pericardial or an epicardial cyst was suspected. Additionally, attachment of the cyst to the left atrium, left ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary vein was suspected (Fig. ). Compression of the left atrium and ventricle was considered to be the cause of her symptoms. Her hemodynamic condition was stable. Percutaneous cystocentesis was performed, and 800 ml of serous liquid was aspirated. However, 1 week after cystocentesis, the cyst recurred, and its size was the same as that before the procedure. Therefore, resection was planned.\nIf the cyst was an epicardial cyst, tight adhesion of the cyst to the left atrium, left ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary vein was considered possible. However, we believed that the cyst was more likely a pericardial cyst because a pericardial cyst is more common than an epicardial cyst. Therefore, resection involving video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was planned initially. However, the pericardium was intact and an epicardial cyst was diagnosed intraoperatively. As preoperative CT showed compression of the left atrium, ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary vein, adhesion was suspected. Additionally, the possibility of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was considered. Therefore, open surgery through median sternotomy was performed. The cyst was found to be attached to the visceral pericardium involving the left atrium and pulmonary artery. Contrary to our expectation, the left ventricle was not involved. Additionally, coronary vessels were not involved. The cyst was most tightly attached to the main pulmonary artery. Thus, it was thought to have originated from the pulmonary artery (Fig. ). The content fluid was aspirated via direct puncture, and a heart positioner was used",

At the age of 25 years her weight was 105 kg with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 and her renal function started to deteriorate with progression to requiring hemodialysis by age 30. With development of renal failure, secondary hyperparathyroidism was noted. Due to her obesity, she was not eligible for a renal transplant or a SPK. At this point it was decided to offer her bariatric surgery, and, after extensive discussion, it was felt that a RYGBP was the best option for her in terms of weight loss. At the age of 32 years, she underwent uneventful robotic-assisted surgery; the stomach remnant was attached to the abdominal wall for potential future access.\nOver the next 2 years she lost 60 kg and underwent SPK during which the donor duodenal segment was diverted to a bowel loop distal to her Roux loop implant site into the common channel. Induction immunosuppression with alemtuzumab was followed by maintenance with tacrolimus (trough levels 5-7 ng/mL), mycophenolate-mofetil (2 g daily), and a steroid taper. She was CMV seronegative and received a graft from a CMV positive donor and received standard prophylaxis with oral ganciclovir (GCV) for 100 days. Within 100 days posttransplant, she was readmitted to the hospital with acute CMV disease, which was successfully treated with intravenous ganciclovir.\nShortly after this episode the patient was found to have skin lesions on her right leg, which were diagnosed as calciphylaxis. Her serum calcium at that time was 14 mg/dl and the diagnosis of tertiary hyperparathyroidism was made. A three-and-a-half-gland resection together with subtotal thymectomy was done without any complications; the left lower parathyroid gland was the only normal appearing and half of it was preserved taking care that blood supply remained",

His abdomen was flat and soft; however, he complained of abdominal pain upon pressure in the right lower quadrant. Most laboratory test results revealed normal limits except for elevated white blood count (11,170/\u03bcL) and serum C-reactive protein level (1.6 mg/dL). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (Fig. ) revealed intussusception at the ileocecal region, which appeared as a \u201ctarget\u201d sign with a tumorous oval mass of 56 \u00d7 41 mm as a leading point of intussusception. An urgent operation was performed because of the risk of colonic ischemia due to intussusception. At laparotomy, the bowels had already spontaneously reduced, and a mass was palpable in the ileocecal region. We performed an ileocecal resection, aiming to avoid the potential of relapse of intussusception due to the residual mass. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on day 16 postoperatively. The resected specimen (Fig. ) comprised an oval cystic lesion of 45 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 22 mm that protruded into the enteric lumen at the ileocecal valve. The cyst was filled with brown-colored stiff material and did not communicate with the original enteric lumen upon macroscopy. Histological analysis (Fig. ) revealed that the inner surface of the cyst was completely lined with colonic mucosa and was situated within the intestinal wall of the ileocecal valve. The original muscle layer of the intestine was separated into two layers at the cyst portion and was shared with the muscle layer of the cyst. Thus, we concluded that the cyst was a type of intestinal duplication.

    "original_text": "A 51-year old Caucasian male presented to his local hospital with a history of an enlarging painful mass in his left thigh in 1992. A needle biopsy was in keeping with the diagnosis of a myxoid liposarcoma, and full staging imaging did not reveal any secondary lesions. A wide local excision was performed and subsequent histopathological examination showed a completely excised high-grade myxoid liposarcoma. Fractions of radiotherapy (60 Gy) were administered postoperatively. In both 1997 and 1999, local recurrences occurred, for which surgical excisions with wide margins were achieved. Surgery was supplemented with radiotherapy on both occasions. In 2004, the tumour disseminated to three distant sites including the liver, chest wall, and neck. The metastases were successfully resected. Histopathological examination revealed similar cellular findings do the primary tumour (Figure ). As the surgical margins were clear, no further treatments were deemed necessary at that stage. In 2005, the patient started complaining of back pain but plain spinal radiographs, CT (chest, abdomen and pelvis) and a TC 99m bone scan (Figure ) did not reveal any signs of spinal disease. However, a spinal MRI (Figure ) showed a diffuse and widespread abnormal bone marrow signal not detected previously. A bone marrow aspirate suggested the diagnosis of metastatic disease. During 2006, chemotherapy (Doxorubicin, Ifosfamide, and Trabectedin) and radiotherapy (fractions of 20 Gy) were administered, resulting in good symptomatic recovery, with no disease progression. In 2007, the patient sustained a pathological fracture in his left proximal femur following a fall. An MRI revealed multiple well-defined foci of abnormal signal throughout both femora and in the right pubis and both ischia, in addition to the fracture. He subsequently underwent a proximal femoral replacement at our institution with the view of achieving good pain relief and a reasonable functional outcome. Histopathological examination revealed extensive bone necrosis secondary to radiotherapy, but no viable tumour cells were identified. Single agent Trabectedin was given postoperatively",
    "cleaned_text": "a 51-year old caucasian male presented to his local hospital with a history of an enlarging painful mass in his left thigh in 1992. a needle biopsy was in keeping with the diagnosis of a myxoid liposarcoma, and full staging imaging did not reveal any secondary lesions. a wide local excision was performed and subsequent histopathological examination showed a completely excised high-grade myxoid liposarcoma. fractions of radiotherapy (60 gy) were administered postoperatively. in both 1997 and 1999, local recurrences occurred, for which surgical excisions with wide margins were achieved. surgery was supplemented with radiotherapy on both occasions. in 2004, the tumour disseminated to three distant sites including the liver, chest wall, and neck. the metastases were successfully resected. histopathological examination revealed similar cellular findings do the primary tumour (figure ). as the surgical margins were clear, no further treatments were deemed necessary at that stage. in 2005, the patient started complaining of back pain but plain spinal radiographs, ct (chest, abdomen and pelvis) and a tc 99m bone scan (figure ) did not reveal any signs of spinal disease. however, a spinal mri (figure ) showed a diffuse and widespread abnormal bone marrow signal not detected previously. a bone marrow aspirate suggested the diagnosis of metastatic disease. during 2006, chemotherapy (doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and trabectedin) and radiotherapy (fractions of 20 gy) were administered, resulting in good symptomatic recovery, with no disease progression. in 2007, the patient sustained a pathological fracture in his left proximal femur following a fall. an mri revealed multiple well-defined foci of abnormal signal throughout both femora and in the right pubis and both ischia, in addition to the fracture. he subsequently underwent a proximal femoral replacement at our institution with the view of achieving good pain relief and a reasonable functional outcome. histopathological examination revealed extensive bone necrosis secondary to radiotherapy, but no viable tumour cells were identified. single agent trabectedin was given postoperatively",

Her mother had slight vaginal bleeding for one week at the three months pregnancy without any therapy. She appeared normal at birth at 40 + 1 weeks of gestation and had normal Apgar scores. Birth weight, length, and head circumference were within normal ranges. Family history was unremarkable for neurologic diseases. Her psychomotor development was delayed. Her parents reported that she sat at eight months, and walked with support until 18 months. She suffered from bruxism and characteristic stereotyped hand movements such as clapping and tapping started at the age of 2 years. At the age of 3 years, she developed seizures characterized by staring eyes, hands rubbing and hypokinesis of the head (10 times per day), severely associated with lip and face cyanosis (1 time per day). Her parents reported that her EEG in a specific hospital showed abnormality at three years of age, and the seizures were not adequately controlled after one year of Chinese medicine therapy. Thus, they gave up drug therapy. In the last year, another abnormal behavior was observed. She regularly tapped her lips using the right hand, and bed using the left hand in awake and stopped until sleep. In the last month, the frequency of seizure increased significantly, and seizure symptoms developed more serious. So her parents took her to our hospital for comprehensive examination. She was diagnosed with RTT from her history and clinical findings. A cerebral magnetic resonance image was normal. Mutational analysis of MECP2 revealed a mutation in this affected girl. Twenty-four-hour video-EEG recordings revealed a slowing advantage rhythm (5-6 Hz) of occipital region and extensive slow wave activity in the background activity. Besides, multifocal discharges were noted during awake, especially in the Rolandic region, significantly aggravated to evolution toward electrical status",

Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT) revealed accumulation in the pulmonary nodule, but no other lesion was suggestive of metastasis. The tumor was diagnosed as a primary lung cancer, clinical stage IA1 (T1aN0M0), or metastatic pulmonary tumor, and video-assisted thoracoscopic right lower lobectomy with lymph node dissection was performed. Level 8 and 9 lymph nodes were not enlarged; therefore, lymph node dissection of these nodal station was not performed (Fig. a), while the level 7 lymph nodes were dissected. There was no direct injury of the esophagus, and no apparent esophageal damage was visualized on magnified video endoscopic images (Fig. b). The operation was uneventful. The patient was able to resume oral intake from the day after the surgery.\nThe patient tended to need to make a strong effort to cough, with swallowing and expectoration having become difficult, presumably due to the radiation therapy given to the larynx.
