The fractured shoulder joint had an irreparable massive rotator cuff tear involving the subscapularis, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus and showed fat degeneration (Goutallier classification grade 4). We decided to perform RTSA on posttrauma day 5. She was placed in the beach-chair position and operated on under general anesthesia with associated local interscalene block.

The supraspinatus tendon and the long head of the biceps were divided. The glenoid baseplate was implanted flush to the inferior, anterior, and posterior rims of the glenoid with an inferior inclination of approximately 10\u00b0 and was secured using 4 lag screws inserted though the glenoid. We inserted the hemisphere and confirmed the stability of the implant. The humeral component was inserted using intramedullary cement in 5\u00b0 retroversion.

    "original_text": "A 67-year-old man reported the presence of a small papule lesion around the hairline of the left scalp for more than 40 years; it had not caused him any discomfort. He presented to our hospital for examination of the lesion, which had shown rapid growth over the past 6 months but had not exhibited itching, pain, or bleeding. The patient had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 15 years prior, and he denied any history of alcoholism or drug allergy. There were no similar cases in his family.\nUpon physical examination, the only notable finding was a single, round, 15-mm neoplasm around the hairline of the left scalp, with hyperplasia in the surrounding area and a minimal brown pigmentation and crusting at the margin (). The mass was tough without tenderness, and there was no enlargement of retroauricular or cervical lymph nodes. Histopathological examination of skin biopsies showed that the mass was surrounded by lobules of epithelial cells, some of which had clear cytoplasm (). At the periphery of the lobules was a layer of columnar cells with nuclear palisading that resembled the outer root sheath of hair follicles.

It was difficult to exclude loss of consciousness reliably, but when she was seen by her GP a right hemiparesis was reported, which had resolved by the time of admission to hospital. Her premorbid functional capacity had been good, and she could mobilise independently with the aid of a Zimmer frame and had required minimal assistance with activities of daily living.\nOn arrival to the stroke unit, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) was 15 out of 15 and she had normal power in all four limbs and no sensory loss. Her most striking clinical feature on examination was severe impairment of visual acuity. She was walking into objects and was clearly blind. Despite an objective diminution of her vision, our patient maintained she was able to 'see' things around her. Pupillary reflexes were intact (suggesting an intact anterior visual pathway), with fundoscopy unremarkable. The only other neurological finding was a mild receptive dysphasia.\nA computed tomography scan of the patient's brain (Figure ) demonstrated evidence of acute infarction in the right occipital and left occipito-parietal lobes, on a background of generalised periventricular ischaemia, consistent with a diagnosis of cortical blindness. Her receptive dysphasia resolved early in the course of her hospitalisation, but during her rehabilitiation she nonetheless continued to deny any loss of vision and showed signs of confabulation. When asked to comment on the doctor's tie, she was quick with an answer, but one that was incorrect.

Upon intraoral clinical examination, a deep Miller Class III GR was detected on the buccal aspect of the tooth #2. The root apex was exposed entirely and a degree 3 Muhlemann [] mobility associated to a tooth extrusion was diagnosed. Probing examination revealed pockets of 6 mm on the buccal and palatal mesial aspect and pockets of 5 mm on the buccal and palatal distal aspect. Radiograph showed an advanced vertical bone loss on the mesial and distal aspects of the tooth with an apical lesion and mild root resorption. Thermal pulp tests indicated necrotic pulp. Occlusion was checked, and there was an occlusal trauma. A diagnosis of a periodontal-endodontic lesion in the tooth #2 was then confirmed. After oral hygiene instructions, the patient received mechanical therapy (scaling and root planing) associated with antimicrobial drugs (amoxicillin 500 mg+metronidazole 250 mg 3 times a day during 7 days). An endodontic treatment was performed on the tooth #2 (). Two months later, based on the analysis of the possibility of tooth maintenance and on the patient's choice for a more conservative procedure, the decision was made to preserve the tooth. The aims of the corrective phase of the treatment were to cover the GR, to augment KT around the tooth #2, and to correct the occlusion by an orthodontic treatment.

She had occasional abdominal cramps and early satiety and no history of weight changes or constipation. No other systemic manifestations were elicited; she had a PAP smear test 6 years earlier that was normal. On clinical exam, the only positives were palpable abdominopelvic mass measuring 8 cm and a cervical tumour 3 cm with no evidence of parametrial, pelvic side wall or rectal involvement.\nAn ultrasound revealed a complex cystic mass with vascular mural nodules and ascites seen within the right adnexa ().\nA bulky uterine cervix with a thickened endometrium that was heterogeneous in appearance was also noted. A staging MRI pelvis was also done (). A heterogeneous mass was seen arising from the cervix with endoluminal extension into the endometrial cavity. The mass was causing obliteration of the anterior fornix of the vagina with evidence of parametrial invasion anteriorly and on the left. The lower third of the vagina was normal and there was no evidence of bladder or rectal invasion. Also seen were complex masses with cystic and solid components arising from both ovaries. Moderate amount of ascites, peritoneal deposits and para-aortic lymphadenopathy were also seen. The rest of the solid and hollow abdominopelvic viscera including the visualized bone marrow signals were unremarkable.

He was all along healthy until left breast enlargement was noticed since 9 months of age. Initially, parents thought that the breast problem was transient and did not pay attention to it. However, the mass gradually increased in size over a course of 6 months which prompted the parents to seek medical attention. There was no history of trauma or infection of the left breast. No medication was taken by the mother during or after the pregnancy. The boy was exposed to neither any medication nor any hormonal products. There was no nipple discharge all along, and the family enjoyed good health with no specific history of breast disease. On physical examination, there was a painless mobile cystic mass just beneath the left nipple measuring 4 cm in diameter (). The overlying nipple and skin were normal, and no nipple discharge was yielded upon gentle pressure. The right breast was normal. Examination of external genitalia revealed a normal male appearance with 4 cm penile length. Bilateral testes were descended with normal size, 1-2 mL in volume. The body length was 80 cm (25th to 50th percentile). There was no sign of puberty, hirsutism, or other abnormal pigmentation which signifies underlying endocrine problem.\nUltrasonography of the left breast revealed a well circumscribed subareolar prepectoral cystic lesion, measuring 4.0 \u00d7 1.4 \u00d7 4.0 cm (). Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 4.2 \u00d7 1.6 \u00d7 3.1 cm cystic lesion at left breast which is more hyperintense than muscle in T1 weighted sequence ().

Seven years after surgery, computed tomography (CT) revealed lymph node recurrence at the splenic hilum, which was treated with four courses of cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil. Treatment reduced the size of the lymph node, although 1 year later, lymph node metastasis was detected again at the pancreatic tail and splenic hilum (Fig. ). Chemoradiotherapy (50 Gy in 28 fractions) resulted in a complete response at the lymph nodes. However, 11 years after surgery, a cystic solid tumour was detected at the pancreatic tail using CT (Fig. a\u2013b) and endoscopic ultrasonography (Fig. a). A change in the main pancreatic duct was also detected using endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (Fig. b). No other metastases were seen on evaluation with positron emission tomography/CT (Fig. ), which strongly suggested primary pancreatic tail cancer with lymph node metastasis. Intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma was one of the differential diagnoses that were considered. Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with lymphadenectomy were performed to treat the tumour, which had a diameter of 30 mm and appeared to invade the artery of the gastric tube that had been reconstructed during the oesophagectomy. Thus, the artery was also resected to achieve curative resection. Operative time was 190 min and blood loss was 30 mL. The resected specimen from the pancreatic tail measured 29 \u00d7 22 \u00d7 30 mm (Fig. ). Pathological examination revealed that the tumour was a squamous cell carcinoma, which was compatible with the detection of the previous OSCC. The final diagnosis was pancreatic metastasis from OSCC (Fig. ). The resected metastatic lymph nodes at the splenic hilum also exhibited squamous cell carcinoma cells. The patient was discharged after an uneventful recovery. She is continuing clinical follow-up without adjuvant",

Symptoms of the autism spectrum comprising difficulties in social interaction and communication are reported since childhood. Additionally, he suffers from auto-aggressive tics in terms of beating himself with objects against his head and lower jaw, head movement tics and simple vocal tics. Striking dysmorphic features are not evident.\nExcept a one-time bleeding in week 20 of gestation, pregnancy had been without any complications. No infections, medication, smoking, or intake of alcohol or drugs during pregnancy was reported. The patient was delivered in week 40 of gestation with the help of a ventouse due to irregular cardiac activity. During delivery there were minor signs of birth asphyxia. Birth weight was 2.900 g (25th percentile), birth length 51 cm (50th percentile) and head circumference 33 cm (<3rd percentile). During infancy a prominent frontal fissure was conspicuous. A premature ossification of the sagittal fissure could not be detected.\nThe patient showed psychomotor retardation: he walked alone only by 26 months and was not able to sit alone falling over to one side without shoring up even at the age of 2. Furthermore, tics in terms of eye blinking as well as a muscular hypotonia were described. The patient\u2019s parents reported early autistic features such as difficulties in social communication and interaction with avoiding eye contact and poor interest in social interaction. Development of speech was delayed (first words with 18 months).

Surgical resection (R0) was performed in December 2011. The resected specimen consisted of a mass measuring 10.0 \u00d710.0 cm in maximal diameter. Final pathologic diagnosis revealed a high-risk GIST according to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) criteria (). The patient was not treated with adjuvant treatment after surgery in the local hospital because he had difficulty paying for adjuvant imatinib therapy. On routine follow-up visit in May 2012, local recurrence and metastasis were confirmed by imaging. He was then referred to West China Hospital in May 2012.\nBeginning in May 2012, this patient received first-line imatinib orally with a dose of 400 mg/day resulting in a partial response. Disease progression occurred after the continuation of imatinib for 54 months. The patient was then treated with cytoreductive surgery combined with imatinib and showed a PFS of 7 months. New biopsy of an abdominal metastasis yielded a KIT mutation in exon 11 as well as in KIT exon 13 (V654A), confirming the clinical observation of secondary imatinib resistance (). In May 2017, this patient received second-line sunitinib. After 11 months of treatment, sunitinib was discontinued due to disease progression. The patient refused biopsy for additional mutational analysis for personal reasons.\nAlthough regorafenib had been approved for the third-line treatment of patients with advanced GISTs by China Food and Drug Administration at that time, the patient refused the agent due to the cost and budget constraints. In the meantime, there was a medical-product-donating project for apatinib that patients could get support since they were enrolled in a clinical trial.

    "original_text": "Eleven years prior a seventy-year-old woman had undergone transthoracic radical oesophagectomy and cervical lymphadenectomy for OSCC (pathological T1bN0M0 stage I, according to the 7th edition of the Union for International Cancer Control/American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system). Seven years after surgery, computed tomography (CT) revealed lymph node recurrence at the splenic hilum, which was treated with four courses of cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil. Treatment reduced the size of the lymph node, although 1 year later, lymph node metastasis was detected again at the pancreatic tail and splenic hilum (Fig. ). Chemoradiotherapy (50 Gy in 28 fractions) resulted in a complete response at the lymph nodes. However, 11 years after surgery, a cystic solid tumour was detected at the pancreatic tail using CT (Fig. a\u2013b) and endoscopic ultrasonography (Fig. a). A change in the main pancreatic duct was also detected using endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (Fig. b). No other metastases were seen on evaluation with positron emission tomography/CT (Fig. ), which strongly suggested primary pancreatic tail cancer with lymph node metastasis. Intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma was one of the differential diagnoses that were considered. Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with lymphadenectomy were performed to treat the tumour, which had a diameter of 30 mm and appeared to invade the artery of the gastric tube that had been reconstructed during the oesophagectomy. Thus, the artery was also resected to achieve curative resection. Operative time was 190 min and blood loss was 30 mL. The resected specimen from the pancreatic tail measured 29 \u00d7 22 \u00d7 30 mm (Fig. ). Pathological examination revealed that the tumour was a squamous cell carcinoma, which was compatible with the detection of the previous OSCC.

He was treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (pyridostigmine) and low dose of oral steroids with success. He was doing well till December 2014 when he developed relapse of symptoms in the form of diplopia, ptosis, and fatigability with additional manifestation of dysarthria and dysphagia. His doses of pyridostigmine were titrated to maximum possible doses and a short tapering course of oral steroids was given with addition of a steroid-sparing drug, azathioprine, which was titrated up to 150 mg in divided doses. Patient slowly improved and underwent thymectomy (diagnosed with hepatitis B virus-positive in preoperative screening) in February 2015. Histopathology was suggestive of thymoma B1 with cystic degeneration. He was doing well on symptomatic treatment, till end of January 2016 when he developed relapse of symptoms with dyspnea following an episode of fever with cough.

The mass did not change in size over this period. It was associated with increasing numbness involving her right ring and little fingers that was bothering her during her daily activities especially during the last 2 months. She reported no other masses in her breasts or elsewhere.\nHer referring surgeon evaluated her initially for the possibility of breast cancer by ultrasound and mammogram; both of which were negative. So, he performed FNA initially which was inadequate. Then, core-needle biopsy was performed which revealed monophasic synovial sarcoma.\nPhysical examination of the right axilla showed: 5 \u00d7 5 cm ill-defined mobile mass with smooth surface located in the apex of the axilla with no overlying skin changes. No adjacent masses or regional lymph nodes including axillary and cervical lymph nodes were felt. Her peripheral neurovascular examination was unremarkable except for mild decrease in superficial touch sensation in her right little and ring fingers.\nStaging studies were performed including MRI of the axilla and CT angiogram for local vascular assessment. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with bone scan showed no evidence of metastasis.\nMRI showed well-defined oval-shaped heterogeneous soft tissue mass in close proximity to the axillary artery with no definite encasement.

It was first noticed 15 years ago with a smooth skin surface but now presenting with a few tortuosities over the swelling. It was associated with a dull aching pain with no diurnal variations, no history of any trauma or ulcerations. On examination, a 15 \u00d7 15 cm swelling was seen on the inner and posterior aspects of the thigh with an irregular surface. Dilated tortuous vessels were seen on the surface with no visible pulsations. The skin over swelling was normal. The swelling was well defined and firm in consistency, with no obvious thrill. The swelling was superficial to the muscles, and the skin was pinchable. There was no regional lymphadenopathy. Proximal and distal pulses were palpable. She underwent a CT angiogram that revealed a brightly enhancing vascular tumor occupying the posteromedial aspect of the right upper thigh in the deep subcutaneous plane with the muscles displaced away from the skin (Figure ). A digital subtraction angiogram was also performed that revealed the vascular tumor to be mainly supplied by the right deep femoral (profunda femoris) artery, after the lateral circumflex branch has been given off (Figure ). Therefore, based on the imaging, the patient underwent an anterior approach selective double ligation of the right profunda femoris artery (Figure ). After three weeks, the swelling reduced by 30% and the pain reduced. A repeat angiogram showed a marked reduction in the feeding vessels to the tumor. Therefore, the patient was taken up for wide excision of the tumor. On follow-up, the patient was afebrile and ambulant, and the sutures were removed on the 10th postoperative day.

Preoperative arterial blood gas analysis showed a partial oxygen tension (PaO2) of 80.5 mmHg, partial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) of 38.8 mmHg, and pH of 7.44.

No bullae were evident in the lungs.\nAfter the patient entered the operating room, an epidural catheter was inserted at the eighth and ninth thoracic interspace. Because no endoscopic images were available, we confirmed the exact location of the esophagobronchial fistulae at the proximal part of the left main bronchus using bronchoscopy after intravenously administering 35 mg of pethidine.

A core biopsy of his axillary mass revealed metastatic malignant melanoma. He had no prior history of a primary melanoma. A staging PET/CT revealed abnormal FDG uptake in his left axilla and small bowel. A left axillary lymph node dissection was performed and revealed 2 of 19 lymph nodes involved with metastatic melanoma, BRAF wild type, the largest of which measured 10.1 cm. His medical history was significant for oligodendroglioma, which was surgically resected eight years prior to presentation, followed by radiation therapy for recurrence five years prior to presentation. He received four doses of systemic ipilimumab for his metastatic melanoma without incident. Post-treatment imaging revealed disease progression with new diffuse subcutaneous, lung, liver and bilateral axillary lymph node metastases.\nHe subsequently enrolled on a genetically engineered T-cell trial, targeting tyrosinase. He received fludarabine and cyclophosphamide as a conditioning regimen, then his engineered T-cells were infused, followed by one week of low dose IL-2, (72,000 U/kg IV q8 hours). Per the treatment protocol, unfractionated creatinine kinase (CK) levels were obtained just prior to and for two weeks after infusion of the genetically engineered T-cells. The CK levels were within normal limits during the course of this treatment. He initially experienced disease response, however, four months after his T-cell therapy, he again developed diffuse progression with new hilar lymphadenopathy and progression of his lung and axillary lymph node metastases.\nHe was next treated with three doses of pembrolizumab but post-treatment imaging again revealed disease progression in his lungs. CK levels were not checked during treatment with either ipilumumab or pembrolizumab. Despite multiple lines of therapy, the patient continued to have an excellent performance status, so he thus proceeded to treatment with HD IL-2 (600,000 IU/kg IV over 15 min",

On June 3, 2014, the patient underwent cytoreductive surgery (total abdominal hysterectomy + bilateral adnexectomy + omentectomy). No residual lesions were detected in postoperative imaging. The patient was administered six cycles of chemotherapy with docetaxel combined with oxaliplatin from July 2014 to October 2014 and her CA125 level returned to normal in October 2014. In June 2015, PET-CT showed that the FDG uptake of the nodules by the right iliac vascular region in the pelvis increased and was deemed metastatic; the FDG uptake of the lymph nodes by the abdominal aorta also increased and was deemed metastatic. CA125 level increased to 91.1 U/mL. The patient was administered six cycles of TP chemotherapy regimen from June 2015 to October 2015. The best therapeutic evaluation was PR during the treatment. Also, CA125 level returned to normal during the treatment. In February 2016, CT showed that the lesions near right iliac vessels had enlarged, and CA125 level rose to 172 U/mL. The patient underwent gamma knife radiotherapy for right iliac vascular lesions. After the treatment, the lesion regressed while CA125 level returned to normal.

The patient had no genetic testing and her family history was not indicative of any hereditary disease. She had two previous vaginal deliveries (14 and 11 years ago) and a history of one abortus at 10-week gestation two years earlier. The patient confirmed that she had no symptoms relating to PC in her previous deliveries. She had no genetic testing and her family history was not indicative of hereditary disease. She was asymptomatic and normotensive and had no hemodynamic instability during pregnancy. She was asymptomatic and normotensive and had no hemodynamic instability during pregnancy. Perinatological ultrasonography revealed normal morphology of dichorionic and diamniotic male and female fetuses.\nA multidisciplinary team consisting of urologists, anesthesiologists, endocrinologist, and obstetricians focused on the therapeutic approach. The patient did not receive any medical treatment for alpha or beta blockade preoperatively. She underwent laparotomy with a subcostal incision and transperitoneal tumor resection at 17 weeks of gestation (). During surgery blood pressure (BP) was stabilized with phentolamine and esmolol, with occasional bouts of brief hypertensive periods up to 240 mm Hg systolic pressure. A hypervascular mass with fragile large veins was dissected free of the upper pole of the right kidney, between the vena cava and the lower border of the liver. The estimated blood loss was 1100 ml.

He had undergone a routine CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis for disease progression two days prior to admission, which revealed a massive pneumoperitoneum (Figures , ).

Laboratory tests were unremarkable, except for a white blood cell count of 10.5 x 103/uL with neutrophil predominance (83%). A repeat CT scan showed patent biliary and duodenal stents without a definite source of perforation; however, three suspicious locations were noted by the radiologist containing small foci of free air adjacent to the bowel.\nGiven the initial concern for perforated viscus, the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals.

She also had history of prolonged bleeding from wounds, gum bleeding, petechial rashes since birth. On examination she was conscious and normotensive, pallor present. Few purpuric spots were noted on her upper limbs. Patient was advised to take corticosteroids by her physician, but she was not taking any medication at the time of presentation. Neurologic examination showed an alert individual with normal higher functions with grade 2 power in both upper and lower limbs on right side. Hemiparesis developed gradually over a period of 20 days which corresponded to slow increase in the size of the chronic subdural haematoma and pressure effect over motor cortex. Ocular fundi showed bilateral papilloedema and cranial nerves were normal. Motor, sensory and cerebellar systems were normal. Deep tendon reflexes were exaggerated with plantars being up-going on right side. Spleen was not palpable.\nAt the time of admission, haematological investigations revealed haemoglobin of 9.0 gm/dl with normal total and differential leukocytic counts. Platelet count was 30,000/mm3. Liver and renal function tests were normal.

An abdominal ultrasound examination showed a huge mass of the right lobe of the liver, which was interpreted as an abscess. The patient was transferred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Routine blood tests after admission revealed a direct bilirubin level (5 mmol/L) at the upper limit of normal, with an unremarkable neutrophil count and remaining liver function tests. Tumor markers, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), were all within normal ranges. The physical examination suggested slight tenderness in the right upper quadrant and no rebound tenderness.\nTo further evaluate the lesion, both noncontrast and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans were performed that revealed a cystic mass (10.4 \u00d7 13.6 cm2) in the right lobe of the liver, with a liquid density in the center. A contrast-enhanced CT scan showed enhancement of the wall of the lesion with multiple tortuous vessels revealed during the arterial phase, with a decreased degree of enhancement, presenting as a relative hypodensity during the portal and delayed phases. No enhancement was observed in the cystic area of the mass (Fig. ). Considering the possibility of a liver tumor, we performed an expanded right hemi-hepatectomy. During the surgery, it was found that the liver was enlarged with good texture but had a huge mass protruding to the surface in the right lobe. No obvious abnormalities were found in any of the other abdominal organs. Intraoperative bleeding was estimated at 1500 mL. The patient's vital signs were stabilized using supplement fluid and transfusion of 6 U of red blood cells.\nA large amount of necrosis and hematoma was found in the liver mass. Microscopic examination of the resected tumor indicated that uniform sized spindle-shaped tumor cells were present in nest-like patterns",

Concurrently, he was receiving weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel for HPV-negative T3N2cM0 base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma.\nUpon presentation to our institution, bronchoscopy was performed by interventional pulmonology. This showed erosion of the esophageal stent into the trachea causing a large underlying 5-cm TEF extending from the proximal trachea to the main carina. The fistula was mostly covered by the noted esophageal stents; however, the tracheal stent had migrated into the right mainstem bronchus. We also noted a small mucosal ridge at the proximal edge of the fistula, approximately 4 cm below the cricoid. The migrated metallic tracheal stent was not amenable to removal as it would cause further airway injury and loss of seal of the majority of the fistula. Metallic stent was thus repositioned proximally to cover the proximal aspect of the fistula and the small mucosal ridge (see Fig. ). To secure this stent in position and cover the remaining portions of the fistula, a telescoping Dumon Y-stent was placed via rigid bronchoscopy after balloon dilatation of the noted right mainstem bronchostenosis.

    "original_text": "A 58-year-old man was presented to our hospital with progressive dyspnea and atypical chest pain. Clinical examination found no signs of congestion and angina pectoris. At the age of 51 years old, he had undergone partial right nephrectomy as right RCC was detected. Two years post to nephrectomy, multiple lung metastases from RCC were detected, and the patient was treated with targeted molecular therapy (Sorafenib). This treatment happened to be successful with reduced and disappeared metastatic lesions. However, 4 years post nephrectomy, right adrenal gland metastasis was subsequently detected. He was treated with another targeted molecular therapy (Sunitinib), but limited effect was observed followed by increased lesion, and eventually underwent right adrenalectomy. Post these treatments, lung and adrenal gland metastases were well-controlled through chemotherapy.\nAt the time of admission, transthoracic echocardiography showed a 53 \u00d7 32 mm mass in the RV that moved without extension into the outflow tract nor involvement of the inferior vena cava (IVC) (Fig. a). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a mobile mass with hypervascular tissue characteristics infiltrating the free wall of the RV myocardium (Fig. b). A fluorodeoxyglucose-position emission tomography (FDG-PET) examination showed a mildly FDG-avid mass in the RV free wall and free of other organ metastases (Fig. c).
