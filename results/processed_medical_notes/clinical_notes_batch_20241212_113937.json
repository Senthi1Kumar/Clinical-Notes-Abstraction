She was diagnosed with seizure disorder 2 weeks prior to the current illness and was prescribed carbamazepine at the dose of 200 mg daily. On the 14th day of carbamazepine, she developed those rashes which were purpuric, some of which later turned to blisters, dusky colored, itchy to start with which later were tender, and covered almost 40% of body surface area covering trunk and face with involvement of oral mucosa and eye. It was associated with swelling of the face and mild fever.\nAs the whole country was under lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic, it was impossible for the rural patient to visit the dermatologist. For this, she went to a nearby community health center, from where mobile teleconsultation was made with the help of a community health worker (health assistant).\nOn assisted physical examination with the help of the health worker, it was found that the patient was febrile with areas of blistering and peeling of the skin involving face, trunk, and extremities with crusting seen over lips and eyes (Figures and ). The Nikolsky sign was positive. The erythematous rash was covered almost all over the trunk with epidermal detachment of 40% body surface area.\nThe clinical impression of toxic epidermal necrolysis due to carbamazepine was made after taking detail history and serial clinical findings in video calls and photos sent in the mobile device.\nRegarding the management of the patient in rural setting, carbamazepine was stopped immediately. She was supplemented with a rapidly tapering dose of intravenous hydrocortisone along with fexofenadine, mupirocin ointment, and moisturizer.

Vitals signs at the time of presentation were insignificant except for pulse 101 beats per minute with the normal electrocardiogram. However, she had no any past history of cardiovascular disease. Gynecological evaluations revealed cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma, stage IVB) which instigated further investigations and evaluations. Whole body positron-emitting tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) () revealed right ventricular mass possibly malignancy or tumor thrombus with enlarged lymph node in left inguinal area and retroperitoneum without other distant metastasis. For further evaluation of tachycardia and dyspnea occurred a week before visiting the hospital, transthoracic echocardiography () and pro B-type natriuretic peptide measurement were performed. Pro B-type natriuretic peptide was within the normal range but transthoracic echocardiography revealed right ventricular mass doubtful of malignant mass or tumor thrombus. Hence, she was referred to Department of cardio-thoracic surgery for further evaluation and management. She underwent total bypass surgery and removal of the mass.

She initially underwent closed reduction and splinting; however, subsequent imaging 1 week later revealed loss of reduction. Therefore, we took her to the operating room 2 weeks after the initial injury and performed open reduction and internal fixation with a second-generation, low-profile, fixed-angle, volar locking plate (Acumed, Hillsboro, Oregon).

She also complained of a rubbing sensation in this area with thumb motion. On examination, there was palpable crepitus with thumb interphalangeal joint flexion suggesting irritation of the flexor policis longus tendon. The patient was able to actively fire her FPL (Fig ).

The patient came in Emergency Repart of our Hospital for a epileptic crisis and, in emergency, she was treated with Verapamil 10 mg iv, immediately after with verapamil hydrochloride 20 mg in 250 ml of saline solution iv as maintenance dose. Unfortunally only after verapamil hydrochloride 20 mg in 250 ml of saline solution iv we had the possibility to evaluate the eeg (). At the time of the first visit in Internal Medicine Department, the patient had reactivation of pain and consequently seizures for two days, with a rate of three seizures every 24 h, the so-called breaking-throught crisis. The patient was admitted in Internal Medicine Department with this oral therapy: l lamotrigine, clonazepam, levomepromazina maleato and verapamil hydrochloride 20 mg in 250 ml of saline solution iv. Early treatment modification with fans and the antiepileptic drugs gave a transient improvement of symptoms, but became ineffective in the following epileptic crisis. For this reason we administred a loading dose of lacosamide 100 mg cpr every 12 h and the treatment with verapamil has been slowly decreased until the total suspension. After 48 hours of treatment with new anti-antiepileptic lacosamide in loading dose and anti inflammatory drugs we noted a reduction in pain intensity (mean verbal numeric scale (vns) reduced from 10 to 5 and the total absence of seizures despite the total suspension of verapamil. Only add-on treatment with Lacosamide was effective to stabilize the seizures during pain due to dysmenorrhea. The patient was discharged from hospital after four days with this therapy: lamotrigina 100 mg h 8 AM, 2 PM, 8 PM, nozinan 25 mg 1 cpr at 8 PM, rivotril 15 ggtt at 8 AM, rivotril 25",

Therefore, his aortic injury was managed non-operatively with observation and cardiovascular monitoring. At that point, there was no concern for spinal injury as the total spinal CT scan did not demonstrate bony injury. Unfortunately, retrospective review would show that the upper thoracic spinal segment was only analyzed with axial images. There were no sagittal or coronal reformations. Nonetheless, the patient underwent uneventful pelvic fracture and wrist fracture fixation. During his SICU course, he developed pulmonary complications including pneumonia. This problem further caused bacteremia evidenced by positive blood cultures. Antibiotic treatment was started.

An abdominal enhanced CT scan revealed four hypervascular, round hepatic tumors. One tumor, which was 32 mm in diameter, was in contact with the lateral liver segment and the hepatic hilus; the other three tumors were in contact with the diaphragm and measured 7 mm in segment 4, 17 mm in segment 7, and 15 mm in segment 8 (Fig. a\u2013d).

Physical examination showed no abnormalities but confirmed haematochezia on digital rectal examination. Colonoscopy showed continuous severe colonic inflammation with small ulcers from the anus to the descendent colon, classified as grade 3 in Mayo endoscopic sub-score and 3 points in Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS); complete examination was not performed because of the risk of perforation. Empirical antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, as well as oral and rectal mesalamine were started and partial symptomatic improvement was achieved. Venous thrombosis prophylaxis with subcutaneous enoxaparin, 40 mg per day, was started. At admittance, haemoglobin, white cell count, platelets, fibrinogen and C reactive protein (CRP) were within the reference range. Stool cultures were negative.

He underwent subtotal esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection and removal of the remnant stomach with the abdominal lymph nodes. The alimentary continuity was reconstructed with a pedicled jejunal limb through the antethoracic route. When we separated the diaphragm from the esophagus and removed xiphoid surgically to prevent a pedicled jejunal limb injury, the pericardium was opened. Anastomosis of the esophagus and jejunum was carried out instrumentally with a circular stapler. A postoperative enteral contrast examination showed smooth passage and no deformity of the reconstructed jejunum. The patient was discharged about 4 weeks postoperatively. About 6 months after the esophagectomy, the patient was readmitted to our hospital because of abdominal discomfort and vomiting. His vital signs were stable and unremarkable. He was thin, with a body mass index of 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed that the pedicled jejunum through the antethoracic space was markedly dilated and the abdomen was soft and flat (Fig. ). Laboratory data showed only leukocytosis with no other remarkable findings. A chest roentgenogram revealed an increased cardiothoracic ratio of 70%, and an enteral contrast study showed a bird\u2019s beak deformity. The swallowed barium remained static in the reconstructed jejunum. Computed tomography of the thoracoabdominal region showed the reconstructed jejunum within the pericardium anterior to the heart (Fig. ). We diagnosed the patient with IPDH after esophagectomy and performed an emergency laparotomy. Upon opening the abdominal cavity, we found that the reconstructed jejunum had herniated into the pericardium through an approximately 4-cm-diameter diaphragmatic defect without a hernia sac (Fig. ). The herniation was easily reduced, and the congestion of the incarcerated jejunum resolved. There was no evidence of bowel ischemia. Primary closure of the diaphragmatic defect",

Surgery was completed in about 60 min; however, persistent bleeding was observed from the vagina. Uterine hemorrhage was observed by transvaginal examination, and an attempt of hemostasis did not succeed. After blood loss exceeded 1500 ml, laparotomy was performed for hemostasis. Anesthesia was changed to general anesthesia, which was induced by 5 mg of midazolam, and tracheal intubation was performed after the administration of 50 mg of rocuronium. While preparing the transfusion, plasma expander was rapidly administered; however, systolic blood pressure dropped to approximately 50\u201360 mmHg, hemoglobin to 4.2 g/dL, and hematocrit to 13.4%. The blood loss exceeded 4000 ml; therefore; treatment was changed to total hysterectomy. On rapid transfusion of 1120 ml of packed red blood cell in approximately 15 min by syringe, systolic blood pressure increased to approximately 80\u201390 mmHg. Arterial blood gas analysis performed on the completion of the rapid red cell transfusion revealed that serum potassium level had increased to 8.3 mEq/L. We immediately performed the intravenous administration of calcium gluconate 2250 mg, insulin 10 units, glucose 40 g, and furosemide 40 mg. Her cardiac rhythm remained stable. The hemorrhage continued, and therefore, subsequent administration of packed red blood cells was performed using a potassium absorption filter (KPF-4 Kawasumi Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan). Thereafter the hyperkalemia gradually improved. Ultimately, there was 11497 ml of blood loss, with the administration of 2520 ml of packed red blood cell transfusion, 1920 ml of fresh frozen plasma, and 200 ml of platelet concentrate. Even though the administration of packed red blood cells was continued with the KPF, serum potassium levels were not increased again, and",

Physical examination showed no abnormalities. The patient was admitted with a lower extremity vascular ultrasound examination. Examination of the ultrasound findings suggested the possibility that the patient had multiple plaque formations due to atherosclerosis. In addition, routine blood tests were performed on the patient. The patient had an increased white blood cell count with a value of 11.63 \u00d7 109/l. The patient had an elevated neutrophil count with a value of 9.136 \u00d7 109/l. The patient had an enhanced neutrophil percentage with a value of 78.60%. The rest of the routine blood tests showed normal results.\nDuring admission, the patient developed an unexplained fever and his symptoms continued to worsen. Due to the patient's symptoms mentioned above, routine blood tests were performed again. The results of the examination showed that the patient had a white blood cell count of 17.86 \u00d7 109/l, a neutrophil count of 14.32 \u00d7 109/l and a neutrophil percentage of 80.20%. All routine blood test values were within normal limits except for the white blood cell count, neutrophil count and neutrophil percentage, which were higher than the previous test values.

She is 69 inches tall with a weight of 215 pounds and a corresponding BMI of 31.8 kg/m2. She has a history of inferior pedicle breast reduction surgery performed 20 years ago (Fig. 1). Despite her previous reduction, she has a very large breast volume and footprint that will be difficult to replicate on the reconstructed left side. She desires nipple preservation and wants to keep her native right breast. We proceed with a left nipple-sparing mastectomy through her previous vertical limb and immediate prepectoral reconstruction using a full-height variable-projection tissue expander (width = 16 cm, height = 16.5 cm, projection = 6.8 cm, and volume = 850 ml) with anterior coverage using an acellular dermal matrix. Twelve weeks later, we exchange her tissue expander for the largest anatomical implant available, a full-height extra-projection 775 ml implant (width = 15.5 cm, height = 16 cm, and projection = 7.1 cm). She also undergoes a contralateral reduction of 300 g to achieve better symmetry. The final result is shown in Figure . Despite using the largest and tallest implant available and reducing the right breast by an additional 300 g, the entire upper pole of the left breast was depleted with significant size asymmetry between the breasts. We discussed multiple sessions of lipofilling to fill this defect but felt that an autologous flap would be more definitive. The LICAP flap was chosen to reconstruct the upper pole of the left breast.

Cerebellitis caused by an unknown infectious agent was suspected and a polyvalent intravenous therapy with aciclovir, ceftriaxone and ampicilline was initiated which halted disease progression. Cerebral MRI was unremarkable. During the next months he underwent two neurorehabilitation treatments without relevant efficacy on the residual symptoms, but 10 months after disease onset he rapidly deteriorated.\nOn admission this time he reported severe gait and trunk unsteadiness, difficulties in writing, massive slurring of speech and problems of swallowing.

On initial presentation, good Doppler flow at the foot was noticed; however, over the next few hours, an arterial injury was highly suspected.

Intraoperatively, acute occlusion of the distal popliteus artery at the bifurcation of the anterior tibial and tibioperoneal trunks was observed. A double interposition bypass with great saphenous vein using a posterior approach was ultimately performed, returning excellent flow distally. Finally, a long posterior splint was used to protect the bypass and stabilize the knee.\nOnce the patient had stabilized at the visiting team's hospital, he was referred to our outpatient facility. He was seen 5 days later for definitive management of his MKI. Physical examination was notable for decreased sensation in the CPN distribution, grade 4 weakness with ankle dorsiflexon and eversion, and moderate effusion with ecchymosis.

Auscultation revealed no cardiac murmurs, but an accentuated second heart sound and reduced pulses in the lower limbs. There were no clinical signs to suggest Alagille or William\u2019s syndrome or clinical evidence of neurofibromatosis. Blood tests showed normal inflammatory markers and normal creatinine. The urine dip showed no markers for blood or protein. No regular medication was taken at the time she presented. The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, no significant signs of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy or abnormal repolarization. Echocardiography detected a severe concentric LV hypertrophy (14 mm diastolic septal diameter, 15 mm diastolic diameter of the LV posterior wall) and a long hypoplastic segment in the abdominal aorta with massive arterial collateralization. Cardiac catheterization confirmed the diagnosis of a midaortic syndrome with a minimum diameter of <1.5 mm and a gradient of 50 mmHg between the aortic arch and the femoral arteries (Figure ).

The surgery, however, led to no improvement in the patient's lumbar back pain and lumbar radiculopathy. In order to treat the continuing low back pain, pelvic pain, and spread of radicular pain to both sides of the lower leg, several epidural and caudal blocks were performed. Although the lumbar back pain improved for 7 months with treatment, the patient continued to experience pelvic pain on both sides, corresponding to a score of 9 on the visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0-10 (0 = no pain, 10 = most intense pain ever). Physical examination showed no signs of erythema, or infection. There was tenderness upon palpating both SIJs, but not on the hip joint. Patrick's and Gaenslen's tests were positive on both sides.

During this visit, the patient reported an operative history of an open cholecystectomy by a right paramedian incision, and an appropriate scar was noted on physical examination. No formal records were available. Workup with CT imaging revealed a 2.1 \u00d7 7.0 cm multicystic lesion with mural nodularity in the body of the pancreas () and diffuse pancreatic ductal dilation throughout (). Endoscopic ultrasound and the fine needle aspiration (FNA) measured the duct at 12.6 mm in the head, 14 mm in the neck, and 20 mm in the body, and after endoscopic tissue retrieval, the pathology returned as a mucinous neoplasm with focal atypia. A working diagnosis of IPMN was made. The patient's serum CA-19-9 was borderline elevated at 37 U/mL.\nThe patient described met both Sendai and Fukuoka criteria and so was taken to the operating room for definitive treatment. In the operating room, the pancreas was found to be grossly abnormal with diffuse distortion of the duct throughout the head, body, and tail, thus warranting a pylorus-preserving total pancreatectomy and en-bloc splenectomy to safely remove all of the neoplastic tissue.

The patient worked as a commercial property developer and had only recently started using insulin for diabetes. Poor glycaemic control was clear from his self-reported history and a high haemoglobin A1C (12.8%; normal is <5.7%). He denied having any other medical problems and he did not drink alcoholic beverages or smoke. As detailed below, about 4 months prior the patient had two arthroscopic debridement procedures and completed an 8-week course of antibiotics for a P. acnes infection of his left shoulder region. When he was first seen in our clinic for the recurrent infection, 2 months had passed from the completion of the 8-week course of intravenous and oral antibiotics.\nHis left shoulder problems started approximately 11 years prior. At that time he was not diabetic and had a successful and uncomplicated open repair of a torn supraspinatus tendon. In September 2015, he had a second left shoulder surgery for impingement symptoms, and this included an arthroscopic acromioplasty with debridement of suture material from the prior cuff repair. Around that time, metformin was prescribed for new-onset diabetes, but he was not compliant with taking this medication. A subacromial corticosteroid injection was given 7 months (April 2016) later for persistent pain and progressively reduced motion. Three weeks after the injection, a large abscess had formed and it extended from the glenohumeral joint and subacromial space to the subcutaneous tissue over the acromion.

The patient was treated with oral bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis, 70mg alendronate once a week orally from 2003 to 2007 (4 years) and then from 2009 to 2013 (4 years). The patient presented to the hospital in January 2013 with pain in the right side of the jaw and pain during mastication since 6 months. From her history, clinical examination and radiological findings she was diagnosed to have osteonecrosis of her right posterior body mandible ().

In March 2013, she was admitted with complaints of pain and swelling over the right thigh following a history of trivial fall, and after clinical examination and history taking, X-rays were done which showed an atypical right displaced subtrochanteric fracture through the focally thickened lateral cortex of proximal femur (). The fracture was managed surgically with proximal femoral nailing (). The knee replacement was unrelated to the sub-trochanteric fracture. For the subtrochanteric fracture of femur, regular follow-ups were done postoperatively with serial X-rays. Blood investigations were done, and serum calcium was 9.5mg/dl, and serum Vitamin D3 was 20ng/ml which was optimized with 6,00,000 IU of intramuscular Vitamin D3 and maintained by oral Vitamin D3 medications. At 3 months, the fracture was in delayed union (), and hence, the patient was started on injection Teriparatide 20mcg subcutaneous for a period of 18 months. The patient was kept non-weight bearing.

He underwent subtotal esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection and removal of the remnant stomach with the abdominal lymph nodes. The alimentary continuity was reconstructed with a pedicled jejunal limb through the antethoracic route. When we separated the diaphragm from the esophagus and removed xiphoid surgically to prevent a pedicled jejunal limb injury, the pericardium was opened. Anastomosis of the esophagus and jejunum was carried out instrumentally with a circular stapler. A postoperative enteral contrast examination showed smooth passage and no deformity of the reconstructed jejunum. The patient was discharged about 4 weeks postoperatively. About 6 months after the esophagectomy, the patient was readmitted to our hospital because of abdominal discomfort and vomiting. His vital signs were stable and unremarkable. He was thin, with a body mass index of 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed that the pedicled jejunum through the antethoracic space was markedly dilated and the abdomen was soft and flat (Fig. ). Laboratory data showed only leukocytosis with no other remarkable findings. A chest roentgenogram revealed an increased cardiothoracic ratio of 70%, and an enteral contrast study showed a bird\u2019s beak deformity. The swallowed barium remained static in the reconstructed jejunum. Computed tomography of the thoracoabdominal region showed the reconstructed jejunum within the pericardium anterior to the heart (Fig. ).

The tumor was positive for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2 oncogene overexpression (fluorescence in situ hybridization ratio 9.91). Interestingly, her twin sister also had a diagnosis of PBC; other family history included lymphoma in maternal cousin and colon cancer in maternal uncle. Her case was presented at our institution's tumor board and neoadjuvant chemotherapy was recommended.\nDue to the patient's underlying PBC, she had multiple baseline abnormalities of liver function tests, alkaline phosphatase [two times the upper limit of normal (ULN)] and grade 2 cytopenia from splenomegaly. Therefore, anthracycline-based regimens were avoided due to a concern for decreased clearance of doxorubicin leading to increased cardiotoxicity, as the patient would require trastuzumab as well. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 6 cycles of docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab (TCH) was given followed by bilateral skin-sparing total mastectomy and left axillary lymph node dissection with immediate reconstruction. Docetaxel was initiated with a 25% dose reduction and required a subsequent 25% dose reduction on carboplatin due to cytopenia. Postoperatively, pathology demonstrated a decrease in the tumor mass from 7 \u00d7 4 to 2.5 \u00d7 2 cm, but 4 of 20 axillary lymph nodes were positive for invasive cancer with extracapsular extension (T2N2a). Adjuvant radiation therapy was given to the chest wall and axilla (5,000 Gy).

The pain intensity was 10 out of 10 on the numeric rating scale (NRS). The patient had felt a burning sensation on the tongue, as though tasting something hot, for one year before visiting our clinic. During a previous dental clinic visit, the patient had been diagnosed with temporomandibular joint disorder and put on treatment with daily ibuprofen (2,400 mg). Despite this medical treatment, he did not experience symptom relief. Therefore, the patient was transferred to our pain clinic.\nWith regard to medical history, the patient had experienced an episode of herpes zoster at the T4 dermatome 10 months earlier. On physical examination, the patient had neuropathic pain and allodynia in the distribution of the right mandibular nerve (V3). Flexion of the neck and compression of the occipital area induced heavy pain in the patient's head and neck, causing an inability to sleep in the supine position. However, there were no vesicles on his skin and no tenderness in the temporal area. The symptoms corresponded with trigeminal neuritis rather than classical TN. Thus, we first diagnosed the patient as having atypical TN and prescribed carbamazepine (CBZ) 100 mg bid, alprazolam 0.25 mg bid, and nortriptyline 10 mg daily. In addition, enhanced MRI was performed to identify the cause of neuritis.\nAn MRI of the internal auditory canal (IAC) showed a mass in the right parapharyngeal space through the foramen ovale. For further evaluation, an MRI of the paranasal sinus (PNS) with contrast was performed, revealing a 2.3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5.1 cm-sized, ill-defined, heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right parapharyngeal space and the right masticator space ().

    "original_text": "A 69-year-old male was referred to Emory Eye Center in June 2010 for herpetic stromal keratitis in the left eye. His past ocular history was notable for central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in the left eye 3 years earlier. He underwent multiple intravitreal injections of bevacizumab and triamcinolone for the treatment of CRVO-associated macular edema. He subsequently developed a suspected herpetic keratouveitis resulting in a dense central stromal scar and visual acuity of count fingers despite aggressive topical and oral antiviral therapy.\nThe patient underwent penetrating keratoplasty (PK) with extra-capsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens placement in July 2010. Pathologic examination of the corneal transplant showed microsporidial organisms. Visual acuity improved to 20/80 with use of rigid gas permeable contact lens, and the graft remained clear until March of 2013 when the patient presented with signs and symptoms of early graft rejection. Topical corticosteroids were utilized with no improvement, so repeat PK was performed in October 2014. Pathologic examination of the repeat PK specimen again showed microsporidia despite the absence of intraocular inflammation, hypopyon, or any other signs of clinical infection.\nFive weeks post-operatively, the patient presented with new onset floaters that had been present for 2 weeks. Visual acuity was light perception, and intraocular pressure was 17 mmHg. Anterior segment examination showed trace haze at the cornea graft-host interface, 1+ anterior chamber cells, a normal iris with a round and reactive pupil, and a well-positioned posterior chamber intraocular lens. There was no view of the posterior pole. B-scan ultrasound showed a presumed vitreous hemorrhage. The patient was lost to follow-up and presented again on post-operative week 9. Examination showed keratic precipitates, trace anterior chamber cell, and neovascularization of the iris. There was no view of the posterior segment due to a dense yellow opacity over the pupil (Fig. ). B-scan ultrasound showed vitreous opacities, and the patient was diagnosed",

Laboratory examinations showed that CA 125 was elevated (51.6 U/ml), while other tumor markers, including CA199, 153, CEA, and AFP, were normal. Autoimmune antibodies, including anti-CENP-B antibody, ANCA, anti-AchR antibody, and ANA, were all positive.\nThe patient was first diagnosed with an oral aphthous ulcer and ocular myopathy myasthenia gravis. She was treated with gentamycin and dexamethasone spray inhalation to improve her oral lesions and pyridostigmine to cure muscle weakness. However, the oral ulcers improved slightly and the myasthenia gravis persisted. An abdominal ultrasound showed a hypoechoic mass in the left adrenal gland. A further CT examination showed a 6 \u00d7 5 cm, well-defined round solid mass with central necrosis in the pancreatic tail. There was no calcification detected in the mass. The solid part of the mass had slight enhancement in the arterial phase with many serpentine feeding arteries, moderate enhancement with a draining vein around the tumor in the portal venous phase and persistent enhancement in the delayed phase (Fig. a-e). The fundus of the stomach was compressed by the mass. The boundary between the mass and the splenic artery and vein was not clear, and swollen lymph nodes were not observed in the posterior peritoneum. The mass was initially considered to be a neuroendocrine tumor in the pancreatic tail.\nAt the same time, the patient\u2019s symptoms worsened.

On physical examination, her abdomen was distended with a fundal height corresponding to approximately 20 weeks, which distends more than it should. Vaginal examination showed the presence of a single cervix.

Her HIV regimen includes Atripla and Septrin for opportunistic infections. For accurate diagnosis an ultrasound examination was thus performed. Transabdominal sonography revealed a single live fetus appearing to be extrauterine with transverse lie, which is very close to the anterior abdominal wall. The fetal biparietal diameter of 2.6 cm and crown-rump length of 6.7 cm were measured and corresponded to the 13+ weeks mean and fetal cardiac activity was over 100 beats/min.

She had restrictive lung impairment and was treated for gastric cancer at 60 years. There was no history of any intranasal or intraoral discharge or of oral and maxillofacial trauma, nor were there any signs of perinasal inflammation. There were no noteworthy matters in her social, environmental, and family history.\nAn extraoral examination revealed a diffuse swelling of her left nasal alar base without tenderness (Fig. ). Her left nasolabial fold was less distinct than the right nasolabial fold, and her left ala was deformed because of the markedly elevated alar base.\nAn intraoral examination revealed a swollen left upper gingivolabial sulcus (Fig. ). The mucosal surface was normal, and the swelling fluctuated upon palpation but was not tender. No swelling was observed at the right upper gingivolabial sulcus.\nA panoramic radiograph showed no abnormal findings (Fig. ); however, apical periodontitis of her left upper central incisor was observed. Computed tomography (CT) findings revealed a well-circumscribed oval lesion, approximately 19\u00d714\u00d712 mm in size, inferior to her left nasal alar base (Fig. ). The lesion was relatively homogeneous and showed a lower density than the muscle. Absorption of the maxilla and nasal septum was not clearly identifiable on the CT images. Although an area of high density was observed adjacent to the right piriform aperture, it was difficult to confirm the presence of a lesion.\nBecause she declined further evaluation and treatment, a wait-and-see approach was adopted. Although an increase in the swelling was noted in 2005, it remained untreated. Because of the recurrence and further aggravation of the swelling, she finally requested surgical removal of the lesion on 19 January 2010.

She was evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging, which showed fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensities in the anterior and posterior circulation territories, some showing restricted diffusion suggestive of infarcts of varying ages [Figure \u2013]. Vessel imaging was normal. Her chest radiograph showed multiple shadows, which was initially interpreted as secondary to aspiration []. Arterial blood gas analysis showed type 1 respiratory failure (on O2by mask 6l/mt-p O242.7, p CO231 hco3 26, p H 7.54). She was intubated and ventilated in view of altered sensorium, respiratory distress and hypoxemia.\nPresentation in the early postoperative period following orthopedic surgery with focal neurological deficits, multiple cerebral infarcts and respiratory failure made us consider pulmonary embolism and postoperative stroke as the first possibility. There were no features to suggest fat embolism. Lower limb venous Doppler did not show any deep venous system thrombosis; however, the pelvic veins could not be studied. Her cardiac evaluation, including transthoracic echo and 24-h ECG, were normal.\nThe patient showed improvement in sensorium and weakness by the next week, but was having persistent hypoxemia (on ventilator SIMV, PS 12, PEEP 5,",

In his examination, there was no evidence of degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine. Careful physical examination revealed nebulous soft swelling below the fibular head. There were no signs of tibialis anterior or peroneal muscle atrophy. However, there was weakness in foot eversion, ankle dorsiflexion, and great toe extension. Plantar flexion and foot inversion were normal. We also found diminished sensation in the first web space of the left foot and positive Tinel\u2019s sign near the fibular head.\nElectromyography (EMG) findings demonstrated denervation of the anterior tibial and peroneus muscles. No abnormality was found in the conduction velocity of the tibial and sural nerves. Radiographs of the knee showed normal findings. Ultrasonography (USG) revealed the 38 \u00d7 21 \u00d7 16 mm cystic mass localized between the muscle structures.

Ultrasonography revealed a round, relatively well-defined, mixed echoic nodule in the right lobe.

Neither significant atypia nor mitotic figures were identified (). Total thyroidectomy with central lymph node dissection was performed.\nGrossly, the right lobe of the thyroid gland showed a well-circumscribed yellow to white, partially encapsulated mass, measuring 2.3\u00d72.0\u00d71.8 cm.
