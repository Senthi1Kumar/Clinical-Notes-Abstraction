While he initially noticed the mass about 2 months earlier, he presented for evaluation now because of acute onset of pain, weakness and paresthesias in the right arm. He was admitted to the general medicine service for pain management and underwent an initial work up for his right shoulder mass, including advanced imaging and a core biopsy. Physiatry was consulted due to his functional deterioration that precluded him from returning to his previous independent living arrangement. He demonstrated diffuse, mild weakness throughout the right arm that was variable and seemed to be correlated with his reported pain level, but his most consistent and weakest movement patterns were his grade 4/5 weakness in finger abduction and distal interphalangeal joint flexion. He had reduced pin prick sensation over the volar surface of digits 3\u20135, palm and forearm of the right arm and hand. He was not able to perform transfers to or from his manual wheelchair due to his level of pain.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient's abdomen and pelvis was performed and showed intraabdominal bleed and multifocal liver lesions. Initial complete blood count (CBC) revealed a hemoglobin of 7 g/dL and he was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells prior to transfer to our institution. On arrival, CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis showed multiple dense, heterogeneous masses throughout the liver with associated perihepatic and intraperitoneal hemorrhage and areas of tumor blush were noted but no extravasation was seen to suggest active hemorrhage. There was also multiple enlarged periportal and upper mesenteric lymph nodes, likely representing metastatic adenopathy. There were no lesions present on the pancreas. CT chest was obtained and showed no evidence of intrathoracic metastatic disease. Initial blood work revealed normal liver function tests, appropriate response in hemoglobin to transfusion and negative viral hepatitis panel. Tumor markers revealed AFP elevation to 8705 ng/mL, normal Carcinoembryonic Antigen and Cancer Antigen 19-9. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis showed multiple lesions throughout the liver with targetoid appearance. There was no evidence of cirrhosis and these lesions did not have imaging characteristics of typical HCC (Figure ). It was suspected the multifocal liver lesions were HCC given the elevated AFP. However, the MRI was not consistent with HCC and a liver biopsy was obtained. Pathology results were consistent with poorly differentiated, large cell-type neuroendocrine carcinoma with metastatic disease to the liver (Figure ). The patient had an unremarkable colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy six months prior to presentation therefore, it was suspected the primary origin of NET was in the small bowel.

He was hospitalized for localized zoster in the right groin and front thigh for 23 days. Eight days after tooth extraction, the patient developed a local rash with pinching pain and was diagnosed with extensive HZ of dermatomes T12 to L2 by a dermatologist. The oral medication was initially 200 mg celecoxib twice a day, 75 mg pregabalin, and 250 mg of famciclovir three times a day, for 7 days, respectively.

The VAS pain score was 10 in the onset of breakthrough pain and 0 in the resting. The initial dermatologist tried to increase the dosage of pregabalin, but the patient reported intolerable dizzy and lethargy without any alleviation of his breakthrough pain.

Two days after hospitalization, the patient reported no reduction of the intensity and number of episodes of breakthrough pain, after which epidural blockade was performed to resolve the pain. However, during the process, breakthrough pain recurred and the patient was unable to keep his lateral position and switched to a supine position; therefore, the treatment was suspended. The patient received repetitive infusions of 4 g of vitamin C in 250 ml of physiological saline solution, without adjusting the dosage of pregabalin and tramadol hydrochloride.

Since both his past medical history and an abdominal ultrasound performed on admission were unremarkable he was discharged with the indication to see a Nephrologist. At the Nephrology outpatient clinic, because of the reduced eGFR and of the presence of proteinuria (300 mg/24 h), an hospitalization for further investigations was planned.\nWhile waiting for the admission, a couple of weeks later, the patient was admitted to the emergency room in another hospital for abdominal pain and dyspnea. On admittance the ECG tracing performed showed sinus rhythm with diffuse repolarization abnormalities. Further exams revealed an increase of troponin (54 ng/ml) and transaminases levels (GOT 50 U/L; GPT 125 U/L) and a cardiac ultrasound showed a severe left ventricular dysfunction with right heart failure. Patient was thus admitted to the coronary intensive care unit. During his hospital stay the possibility of acute myocarditis was excluded because of the absence of a recent viral syndrome and the negativity of IgM antibodies against the viruses most commonly affecting the cardiovascular system and because of the low inflammatory indexes. An abdominal ultrasound demonstrated abdominal and pleural effusions, regular size and morphology of spleen and liver, no pancreatic changes; both kidneys had normal size but showed irregular margins and a reduced thickness of the cortex, no hydronephrosis nor stones were observed. A magnetic resonance demonstrated an increased volume of the cardiac chambers with a severe reduction of the function of both ventricles (EF20%), however no signs of reduced myocardial perfusion, valvular defects or other tissue changes such as inflammation, fibrosis or edema could be demonstrated.

MRI of the left knee demonstrated a medial tibial plateau fracture with two millimeters of articular depression and extension of the fracture to the tibial spine (). MRI of the right knee demonstrated a hypointense linear T2 signal surrounded by diffuse hyperintense signal suggesting a medial tibial plateau stress fracture with surrounding bone edema, without articular collapse or extension (). These fractures were at the level of the physis, and there was surrounding sclerosis on plain radiographs. Given the collapse of the articular surface in his left knee, the patient was indicated for open reduction internal fixation with allograft bone. The patient underwent the aforementioned procedure without complication, and the patient remained nonweight bearing to his bilateral lower extremities ().

Six months following the index surgery, she had a recurrence treated with repeat curettage, liquid nitrogen local adjuvant, and placement of bone substitute graft.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large soft-tissue mass surrounding the first metatarsal circumferentially and abutting the second metatarsal (). There was high T2 signal with no T1 signal changes at the base of the second metatarsal. Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated an expansile lucency at the proximal aspect of the first metatarsal base toward the dorsal lateral side ().

    "original_text": "A 21-year-old virgin woman attended at the gynecological outpatient department of our hospital with acute pelvic pain and bladder distension. She was unable to urinate during the previous 12 hours. She had a history of increasing difficulty of passing urine and pelvic pain during the last menstruation two weeks before. She had no history of surgical intervention and her medical history was insignificant. Her menstrual cycles were regular since menarche at 10 years of age.\nOn examination, she had normal secondary sexual characteristics. Examination of the genital area showed almost complete adhesion of the labia minora and bladder outlet obstruction (). Pelvic ultrasound and laboratory work-up were normal. Dermatological examination of the vulva was unremarkable. Upon further questioning she noted that she had vaginal pain, burning, and profuse yellow vaginal discharge three weeks before. Her family doctor indicated that the vulvar vestibule was thinned, sensitive, erythematous, and edematous as a result of irritation from the discharge. She was referred to a gynecologist but she refused to go and to take any medication.\nAfter discussion of therapeutic options and informed consent was taken, a small space was obtained from the weakest point of the adhesion with a thin clamp (). Topical therapy with prednisolone, estrogen, and 2% clindamycin cream was administrated on the labia minora for three days. The labial space was gradually increased with local anesthesia and a thin clamp for this time. After three days we could not manage to achieve the desired result, so the patient underwent surgical intervention with general anesthesia.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 36-year-old gravida 0 woman. At the age of 7, she underwent ventricular septal defect closure for the right ventricular outflow tract. At the age of 11, she received a mechanical aortic valve replacement. Since after the replacement, she has been receiving warfarin orally at a dosage of 4.5 mg/day. She conceived naturally and she was referred to our hospital for perinatal management. Oral administration of warfarin was discontinued at 5 weeks of gestation and she began self-injection of heparin. At 21 weeks and 5 days of gestation, she was admitted to our hospital with a high risk of spontaneous abortion and was put on intravenous ritodrine. This successfully prevented a miscarriage. At 21 weeks and 6 days of gestation, we started a continuous infusion of 25,000 units of heparin daily. On the 22nd week, transesophageal echocardiography showed a movable thrombus in the aortic valve. The size of the biggest thrombus was 26 \u00d7 8 mm (). We increased the dosage of heparin to 28,000 units daily and restarted the administration of warfarin. Following this, the thrombus reduced in size, and at 23 weeks and 5 days transesophageal echocardiography showed no signs of thrombosis in the patient. At 32 weeks and 2 days of gestation, a routine cardiotocography showed a decreased fetal heart rate; thus, an emergency Cesarean section was performed under general anesthesia because of the presence of warfarin in the blood.

    "original_text": "A 41-year-old male presented to clinic with a 2.5-year history of painful right MG atrophy and fasciculations following a previous gastrocnemius tear after a fall from a treadmill. He was initially seen by neurology where his right MG appeared significantly wasted compared to his right lateral gastrocnemius. On examination, fasciculations were present and limited to his right gastrocnemius with no reliable inciting triggers. On motor examination, his strength was MRC Grade 5/5 in all muscle groups, including plantar flexion and inversions, and deep tendon reflexes were 2+ and symmetric. Further workup with electromyography (EMG) revealed a possible focal neuropathy of the right tibial nerve branch supplying the MG, as evidenced by increased insertional activity, 3+ fasciculations, and 1+ spike and wave activity in the MG. All other EMGs on muscle group testing were normal. There was no evidence of radiculopathy, plexopathy, or proximal sciatic neuropathy. Subsequent MRI illustrated his tibial and common peroneal nerve had normal morphology without any structural evidence or injury to explain his EMG findings. Ultimately, the decision was made for a right tibial nerve exploration at the level of the popliteal fossa with decompression and possible grafting of the MG branch.\nOn exploration, both the medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles were easily identified along with the sciatic nerve and associated tibial and common fibular nerve branch points. Of interest, there were three distinct muscle head contributions to the MG. It was unclear, however, whether this anomaly was congenital or secondary to his previous injury. Nerve identifications were confirmed with intraoperative checkpoint nerve stimulator under direct visualization. Three MG branches were identified arising from the tibial nerve. Unexpectedly, we found large vasculature including, 1 artery and 2 veins, directly abutting deep to the MG branches []. Vascular surgery was consulted intraoperatively, and ligation of these vessels was performed to completely decompress the nerve. After ligation and full dissection of the MG branches, the muscle fasciculations and ongoing twitching had diminished",

Urine culture obtained in the office grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient was started on a 2-week course of Ciprofloxacin, and a percutaneous nephroureteral stent was placed in anticipation of definitive stone management with percutaneous nephrolithotomy. A urine culture was obtained from the renal pelvis at the time of nephrostomy tube placement. The renal pelvis urine culture was negative. However due to a high risk of infection-related complication, the patient was continued on Ciprofloxacin empirically until the time of surgery. RM underwent right percutaneous nephrolithotomy without complications, although difficult stent removal due to encrustation resulted in prolongation of the case by an additional 1.5 hours. Renal stone fragments were sent for culture and revealed no growth. Stone composition was a mixture of calcium phosphate (75%) and calcium oxalate monohydrate (15%). CT obtained on postoperative day one showed a residual 9 mm fragment in the upper pole and a 2 mm fragment in the renal pelvis. The patient underwent second look nephroscopy three days following the initial surgery to retrieve the residual fragments. He developed fever to 38.6",

The patient had a past medical history of intestinal obstruction due to foreign bodies for which she underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy at age 6.\nThe UGI series showed a distended stomach that reached the pelvic cavity (Fig. ) as well as a marked dilatation of the duodenal bulb. The passage of contrast was evidenced up until the second portion of the duodenum. A control at 24 h showed contrast in the colon and rectum, however, contrast was still present in the stomach and duodenal bulb. These radiographic signs were suggestive of partial obstruction.\nThe UGI endoscopy was performed that showed normal structures until the duodenum, whose first portion was partially obstructed with food and foreign bodies (Fig. ). The objects were removed and a mucosal protrusion was observed that limited the passage of the endoscope to the second portion of the duodenum. These findings prompted a exploratory laparotomy where duodenotomy was performed between the second and third portions of the duodenum and an incomplete duodenal membrane with a 2 mm diameter concentric orifice was found and excised (Fig. ). A foreign body (plastic disc) (Fig. ) of ~2 cm of diameter was also found in the second portion of the duodenum.\nThe patient progressed favorably with an established diagnosis of resolved partial intestinal obstruction (intraduodenal membrane in third portion) and follow-up appointments with Gastroenterology, Surgery and Clinical Psychology.\nA 5-year-old female patient was referred to the outpatient Gastroenterology clinic due to abdominal distension, frequent vomiting and constipation with episodes of diarrhea of 1 month of duration.

A month later, she underwent CP shunt placement for cyst formation after resection. The postoperative course was uneventful and she was well without shunt-related problems for 26 years. She developed a brain abscess related to the shunt catheter at the age of 55. A surgical removal of the catheter was attempted, but was not technically possible, and only the segment from the clavicle to the breast was removed with ligation of the two remaining ends. The two disconnected catheter segments remained in situ and were not retrieved. A year later, she was taken to a local hospital with continuous right-breast pain. The diagnosis of acute mastitis was made and she was referred to our institution for further examination. On presentation, her right breast was swollen with erythema (Fig. ). There was no abdominal pain and change in bowel habits. Funduscopic evaluation was normal with no signs of increased intracranial pressure. Her temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, and laboratory tests revealed a decreased platelet count of 103 000/\u03bcl, elevated AST of 97 U/l, ALT of 72 U/l and C-reactive protein level of 1.4 mg/dl. The breast abscess was drained under local anesthesia. Cultures taken from the abscess showed enteric organisms including Enterococcus avium, Klebsiella oxytoca and Bacillus. Abdominal CT showed that the shunt catheter was in the splenic flexure of the transverse colon with no other abnormalities (Fig. ). Colonoscopy was performed to survey the colon and the shunt catheter was found inside the lumen at the splenic flexure (Fig. ). Acute mastitis caused by enteric organisms which had migrated through the shunt catheter after penetration into the transverse colon was the presumptive diagnosis, and the catheter removed under general anesthesia.

The patient developed the above mentioned symptoms after an acute episode of seizure. He also gave a history of five such episodes in the last two years, but he was not on any treatment for seizures. The patient was using an artificial denture for the upper jaw since one year. The patient became unconscious for 5-10 minutes after the last episode of seizure, after which he could not find his denture. He realized that he had accidentally lost his denture during the episode and ignored the whole event. Subsequently he had sudden onset of foreign body sensation in the throat and, later on, he developed progressive hoarseness and difficulty in breathing for which he consulted our hospital. The patient complained of throat pain, painful swallowing and difficulty in speaking associated with discomfort in the throat. There was no hemoptysis or chest pain. During clinical examination, the laryngeal contour was normal and crepitus was present. There was no stridor or chest indrawing. Examination of the oral cavity and oropharynx was normal. During auscultation, normal bilateral air entry was observed. A diagnostic laryngoscopy was performed, and revealed an inflamed edematous mucosa in the subglottic area with a whitish structure believed to be a foreign body (missing denture) or a growth in the subglottic region.

The ECOG performance status of the patient was 1 due to mild pain at her right hip, she had no history of hypertension and since pazopanib has shown effectiveness also in cytokine-pretreated patients with metastatic RCC \n[], we decided to administer pazopanib as 5th line treatment. Her medical history was insignificant for other diseases than metastatic renal carcinoma. The concomitant medication during pazopanib treatment consisted of fentanyl transdermal at 25mg and tramadol hydrochloride.\nAfter 21 days of pazopanib therapy the patient referred to the emergency department with epileptic seizure, impaired vision at both eyes and bilateral, temporal and pulsutive headache. The physical examination revealed hypertension 165/105 mmHg (grade III toxicity), suspension of both direct and indirect papillary reflexes for both eyes and bilateral blurred vision and diplopia. On neurological examination there was no evidence of lateralizing or focal features. Blood tests, including CBC, blood chemistry, coagulation study and gasometry, were unremarkable.

After admission, a thoracentesis was performed, for shortness of breath relief, and pleural fluid had findings consistent with a reactive effusion. A computed tomography (CT) scan was done, revealing splenic enlargement and two solid mass lesions measuring 10 cm and 12.5 cm in greatest diameter with ill-defined margins within the spleen.

She was scheduled for debulking surgery; however, she presented to our emergency department with worsening abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. A physical examination showed dry mucous membranes, capillary refill < 3 seconds, and jugular venous pressure of 4 cm. Her chest was clear on auscultation with dual heart sounds. Her abdomen was distended with generalized tenderness but no guarding or signs of peritonism. Bowel sounds were present. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen and pelvis was performed which demonstrated the large right ovarian tumor, peritoneal tumor deposits, and ascites. There was extrinsic compression of her sigmoid colon due to the tumor without radiological signs of large bowel obstruction. There were no other abnormalities of her bowel. She received intravenously administered fluids for rehydration, anti-emetics for nausea, and intravenously administered morphine for abdominal pain.

He did not report any hoarse voice, dyspnoea or dysphagia. There was no loss of appetite or weight. On examination there was a palpable well circumscribed lump arising from the left thyroid lobe measuring 5 \u00d7 3 cm. There was no tracheal deviation and the lump moved on swallowing.

After two months of the intracerebral hemorrhage, she was transferred to a rehabilitation center. In the third month after the tracheotomy, massive hemorrhage occurred through the tracheotomy tube when tracheal suction was carried out. The patient demonstrated cyanosis, respiratory failure, and shocks so that the cuff air in tracheotomy tube was maximally expanded. However, the bleeding did not stop. The tube was immediately removed while the suction was consistently carried out. A cuffed endotracheal intubation was tried through the oral cavity but the attempt was a failure due to visual obstruction. The cuffed endotracheal tube was inserted deep into the tracheal opening, and the cuff was expanded, followed by moving up the tube. The bleeding stopped at last. She was immediately transferred to an intensive care center, and blood test was carried out.

His cardiopulmonary exam was unremarkable on the initial exam. Due to poor images on a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and soft tissue chest CT scan was also performed which revealed a severely stenotic bicuspid aortic valve with fusion of the left and noncoronary cusps as well as an ascending aorta dilatation of 4.8 cm and aortic root dilatation of 4.5 cm with concern for an aortic root abscess (Figures , , and ). The patient's hospital course was complicated by an embolic stroke and embolic phenomenon of his right thumb, requiring stabilization prior to surgical intervention. The patient underwent an uncomplicated bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement with a 23 mm Magna Ease Tissue valve, a patch exclusion of the left coronary sinus abscess, and aortoplasty. A coronary artery bypass grafting with a saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery was also performed, as the abscess had involved the LAD artery as well.

He underwent ERCP with stenting of the bile duct. The patient also had a spiral CT and an endoscopic ultrasound of the pancreas. These tests helped to determine resectability. He underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) on Sept. 8, 2008 for a pancreatic head adenocarcinoma. He had a standard whipple performed, with removal of the gallbladder and distal stomach, as well as the head of the pancreas and duodenum. There were no intraoperative events and no gallstones were spilled. He received adjuvant chemotherapy for 7 months. The chemotherapy was gemzar, oxaliplatinum and tarceva. The patient had routine follow-up and surveillance for recurrence every 4 months the first year and every 6 months for the second year. This included a CT scan and CA 19-9 level. Over the course of one year he was admitted to the hospital on several occasions for low-grade fever, for which the diagnosis was not established, and at times treated as an outpatient for multiple urinary tract infections. During these episodes the patient always had a normal white blood cell count and normal neutrophils/lymphocytes on differential. At no time did he complain of any abdominal pain or any difficulty tolerating food. All CT scans during this first year were negative for recurrent malignant disease.\nAt approximately 18 months in follow-up, the repeated computed tomography (CT) scan showed a non-specific abnormality in the right lobe of the liver, suspicious for a mass.

She gave a history of three previous histologically proven molar pregnancies since her marriage two years ago, treated in a peripheral hospital. The patient continued to have vaginal bleeding for a month after the procedure. The serum \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) was found to be 15,444 IU and a chest X-ray, renal and liver function tests were normal. She underwent a repeat uterine curettage in her base hospital which showed necrotic endometrial tissue. Unfortunately, she continued to have intermittent vaginal bleeding and hence referred to our hospital after 10 days. Her \u03b2-hCG on presentation was 4 458 IU and the ultrasound showed endometrial thickening, so she underwent dilatation and curettage. Histopathology reported necrotic decidua only. The patient was given the oral contraceptive pill and followed up regularly in the OPD with serial quantitative \u03b2-hCG estimations until it was undetectable after 4 weeks.\nHer subsequent clinic attendance at our hospital was irregular. The patient returned to the OPD in June, 2004 and reported to have had three more molar pregnancies treated at her initial hospital with suction and curettage in May, 1995; June, 1996; and three weeks prior to presentation. Histopathology report revealed avillous sheets of trophoblastic cells with hemorrhage and necrotic background. She was followed up in her base hospital in the last two pregnancies with serial quantitative \u03b2-hCG, until it became negative. By the time she came to us after 3 weeks of her last molar pregnancy, she complained of abdominal pain and shortness of breath. A chest X-ray showed bilateral cannon ball opacities in both lung fields which were thought to be due to metastatic choriocarcinoma; her \u03b2-hCG was 987 576.5 IU.

In July 2015, she presented with severe bleeding hemorrhoids secondary to IBS, which required hemorrhoidectomy and anal sphincterotomy in August 2015. The week before the surgery she developed pharyngitis and was treated with azithromycin, which resulted in mucousy diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. She tested negative for C. difficile antigen and toxins at that time.\nA week after surgery, she developed a perirectal abscess that had formed at the site of the sphincterotomy and was prescribed orally administered ciprofloxacin. Despite moderate symptom improvement, in September 2015 she required an abscess incision and drainage procedure and Penrose drain insertion. Prior to the surgery she was given a single dose of clindamycin. An additional 2-week course of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole was then prescribed. In late September 2015 she was admitted to the hospital for two nights due to further complications related to the abscess and was then diagnosed as having a perianal fistula.\nIn November 2015, she was prescribed clindamycin for an episode of group C streptococcal-positive pharyngitis.

The patient had a single-chamber ICD implanted in July 2008, followed by implantation of the LAP monitor in September 2008. Both the ICD and LAP monitor were implanted via the left subclavian vein from a superior approach with two separate subcutaneous device pockets created in the left pectoral region. The patient had recurrent fevers with core body temperature measurements recorded by the LAP monitor up to 39.8\u00b0C for 3 days prior to hospitalization, and in-hospital blood cultures growing methicillin-sensitive S. aureus.

    "original_text": "A 28-year old native female patient complained about recurrent pain in the right hip joint without previous trauma progressing by physical strain starting about 1.5 years before. A MRI of the pelvis performed 3 months before admittance showed a swelling of the capsule and reduction of the cartilage in the right hip joint which was considered as an early arthritis or coxitis. After treatment with physiotherapy and oral non-steroidal antirheumatic medication the symptoms were regressive and no further diagnostic procedures were performed.\nCaused by recently aggravation of pain in the right hip joint within the days before, the patient was not able to stand and walk and the range of motion (ROM) was painfully reduced. Blood samples were normal except slightly increased CRP of 4.2mg/l (reference: <0.5mg/l) without any local signs of inflammation in the pelvic region. X-ray of the right pelvis showed a slight joint space narrowing with affection of the acetabulum and the femoral head (Fig. ). An effusion was detected by ultrasound, aspiration of the hip joint led to no further diagnosis as aerobic and anaerobic cultures were sterile. The MRI showed a joint space narrowing in the cranial part of the acetabulum with increased subchondral sclerosis as well as a synovial enhancement with bone marrow edema in the femoral head and the corresponding acetabulum.\nThe further clinical examination with detailed reconstruction of patient\u00b4s history revealed a surgical procedure with extirpation of a lymph node from the left supraclavicular region two years before. The histological result was suspicious for tuberculosis with marked granulomatous lymphadenitis and caseous degenerated confluent necrosis, but tuberculin test and sputum sample examinations by microscopy and culture medium were negative. A CT without any proof of lymphadenopathy and pulmonary infiltration could not confirm this suspicion.

She had been evaluated before for the same, but without any positive diagnosis. The patient denied any history of trauma or any alteration in her bladder and bowel habits, or of any symptoms which is suggestive of intermittent claudication. Upon neurological examination, the power in all the muscle groups in her lower limbs was normal - 5/5 as per the MRC Muscle scale (used with the permission of the Medical Research Council). Her ankle and the knee reflexes were normal and she had no sensory indifference in any of the dermatomes in the affected limb, as compared to the normal limb. There was no wasting of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle. Straight leg raise test and a crossed straight leg raise test were both negative. Her stance was also normal. While sitting in a squatting position, the patient complained of an exaggeration of her symptoms. We thereafter made a differential diagnosis of either a sciatic nerve tumor or a Pyriformis syndrome. Radio imaging with help of an MRI scan revealed the presence of a sciatic tumor alongside the sciatic nerve, near the ischial tuberosity on the right side (\n). The unusual location of the lesion was in favor of a schwannoma rather than a neurofibroma (\n).\nThe patient was counseled for the operative intervention that would remedy her persistent symptoms. A subgluteal approach was taken for the surgical corridor. Intra-operatively, a 3\u00d73 cm\n2 well circumscribed lesion was seen lying within the sciatic nerve. It was carefully dissected off the nerve fascicles and fully removed (\n).
