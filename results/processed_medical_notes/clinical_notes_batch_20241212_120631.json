She received a root canal treatment for about five times before, but complained of spontaneous pain on the mandibular right second premolar. She had no specific medical history. The mandibular right second premolar was tested positive response to percussion, so it was diagnosed as previously initiated therapy, and symptomatic apical periodontitis. A nonsurgical root canal treatment was explained to the patient. She understood the treatment options and risk factors and signed the consent forms to proceed with the nonsurgical root canal treatment.\nOn the first day of the treatment, the IAN block anesthesia using 2% lidocaine (1:100,000 epinephrine, Huons Co., Ltd., Sungnam, Korea) was performed, and canal irrigation was done. Two days later, she called to our clinic and complained of feeling numb on her lower right lip and chin area. She also complained about feeling weird when chewing. Since hypoesthesia was suspected, we recommended her to visit our clinic as soon as possible. She visited our clinic two days after the call. She complained about dull sensation lasting on her lower right lip and chin area which is suspected to be a mental nerve innervations region. A Light touch test and pin prick test was performed and scored one-tenth comparing to the normal left side on her lip and chin. Hypoesthesia was diagnosed, so oral steroid was prescribed for a week and the patient was informed about the tapering procedure. Also, on the same day, mapping on the hypoesthetic region was performed ().\nAfter a week, she felt better but tickling sensation persisted on the region.

Laparotomy revealed a large tumor arising from the sigmoid colon infiltrating left lateral wall of the bladder and the lower end of the left ureter. Anterior resection with primary anastomosis, partial cystectomy, and excision of lower end of the left ureter with reimplantation over a JJ stent were carried out. The ureteric JJ stent was removed at six postoperative weeks. IVU carried out at 3 months showed delayed opacification of left kidney with moderate hydronephrosis. Left percutaneous nephrostomy with nephrostogram revealed a tight stricture at the lower end of the ureter [].\nA guide wire was negotiated through the stricture and a JJ stent was placed over it. Initial X-ray suggested that the lower end might have been in the bladder, but subsequent films cast a doubt that the stent might be extravesical in location [].\nCT scan of the pelvis demonstrated the lower end of the stent to be posterior to the bladder wall. As the patient refused another open surgical exploration, a rendezvous procedure was planned. Cystoscopy did not show the lower end of the stent to be in the bladder and the left ureteric orifice could not be identified. Fluoroscopy demonstrated the stent to be posteroinferior to the bladder. It was then decided to resect down to the stent under fluoroscopic guidance. Methylene blue was injected through the nephrostomy to aid identify the area of resection. The stent was then identified in the perivesical fat [].\nA guide wire was passed through the old stent and a new stent was inserted.

    "original_text": "A 33-year-old Chinese male patient presented to Urology Department because of a retroperitoneal mass that was incidentally found by computerized tomography (CT) during a health examination. He was asymptomatic and had no abdominal or back pain, episodic hypertension, palpitation, or lower limb edema. Post medical history and physical examination were unremarkable. Laboratory tests including complete blood count, liver and renal function and D-Dimer were normal. Tests for paraganglioma such as 24-h urinary catecholamine and somatostatin receptor imaging were negative. Contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed a stenosis of IVC in the suprarenal segment (Fig. a), a 34 mm \u00d7 30 mm \u00d7 33 mm retroperitoneal mass on the right side of the infrarenal IVC (Fig. a and b) and a small mass about 10 mm in diameter in the retroperitoneal area that was considered an enlarged lymph node (Fig. c). No thrombosis was found in the IVC. Therefore, a diagnosis of retroperitoneal tumor with possible lymph node metastasis was considered.\nTo further confirm our diagnosis, a retroperitoneal laparoscopic exploration was performed. During the surgery, we found that both mass were diverticular aneurysms of IVC (Fig. a). There was a very narrow neck between the larger aneurysm and IVC (Fig. b). A hem-o-lok clamp was applied on the neck of aneurysm (Fig. c), and the aneurysm was resected from the IVC successfully. Since the smaller aneurysm was about 1 cm in diameter without thrombosis, we did not resect it during surgery. However, the stenosis of IVC may cause venous hypertension which can be a risk factor for aneurysms progression. Therefore, we referred the patient to Vascular Surgery Department for pressure gradient test across the suprarenal IVC to determine the following therapy.

He was given pain medications, and he later followed up with his primary care physician, who ordered an MRI of his thoracic spine. The thoracic spine MRI showed diffuse marrow abnormality involving the entire thoracic spine, including anterior and posterior elements as well as visualized portions of the ribs. There was also epidural extension of the tumor at T5 level resulting in relatively severe central stenosis and displacement of the thoracic cord. Baseline imaging consisted of a bone survey which demonstrated numerous myelomatous lesions throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton.\nLaboratory studies at that time demonstrated hypercalcemia and elevated creatinine, concerning for myeloma. He was started on a course of steroids with Velcade and Revlimid, and involved field radiation therapy to the thoracic spine was started with a total dose of 3000 cGy given in 10 fractions. Serum protein electrophoresis demonstrated an M-spike of 0.8 g/dL within IgG lambda. Bence Jones proteinuria was present in the range of 2 g. Biopsy of his bone marrow was consistent with aggressive myeloma with elevated plasma cells (18%), and a thorough cytogenetic evaluation demonstrated multiple abnormalities, including monosomy 13, t(4;14), deletion of 17p and 13q, and gain of 1q21. The patient was stage III (both ISS and R-ISS). He was seen shortly after diagnosis for evaluation of stem cell transplantation, and, given such a high risk of his underlying myeloma, the patient was recommended to consider allogeneic stem cell transplantation from an alternative donor source.

After radiologic evaluation, acute osteoporotic compression fracture of the L4 vertebra was found. The patient had experienced L1 vertebroplasty and T12-L2 screw fixation for L1 compression fracture at another hospital before 2 years ago. Percutaneous vertebroplasty for L4 vertebra was performed under fluoroscopic guide. After incision of the skin, an 11-guage vertebroplasty needle was placed percutaneously on the posterior part of the vertebral body via bilateral transpedicular approach. The needle was pushed through the cortex, situated the center of the pedicle as possible, and then directed into the vertebral body. The anterior third of the body was an ideal location for the needle placement. The contrast medium (Iohexol) was injected to estimate bone cement distribution and minimize bone cement leakage and intraoperative complication such as pulmonary thromboembolism. When a thin toothpaste consistency was achieved, the bone cement was injected into the vertebral body under continuous fluoroscopic control. The filling process was stopped immediately when leakage of bone cement was observed into lateral space of body. After the procedure, his back pain was improved immediately. But he complained severe pain which radiates down the right leg on standing position. The patient was unable to bear weight on his right leg after the procedure. Neurologic examination revealed right leg hypoesthesia but straight leg raising test was negative. Lumbar simple X-rays after procedure showed leakage of bone cement to right lateral side of the L4 vertebral body (). Lumbar computed tomography (CT) scanning revealed extraforaminal leakage of bone cement to outside of right L4 pedicle and it caused significant compression of L4 nerve root ().

She became pregnant and had no complications other than a 4-cm diameter fibroid in the anterior wall of the uterus. Her pregnancy progressed uneventfully though posterior wall low-lying placentation, but not placenta previa was noted. She underwent routine examinations at 33 weeks of gestation, and transvaginal ultrasonography revealed abnormal blood flow at the cervical region. She underwent MRI (Figure ), which also revealed abnormal findings. She was estimated to have a high risk of massive obstetric hemorrhage though a precise diagnosis could not be obtained. She was transferred to the maternal-fetal intensive care unit in our hospital.\nRadiologists in our hospital interpreted the MRI as either invasive placentation into the cervix or cervical vascular anomalies, though they had never seen images like these. An expert opinion of the transvaginal ultrasonography finding (Figure ) was as follows. The cervix was open. Placental parenchyma was low lying but not covering the internal os.

In September 2018 he performed a contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which documented an expansive lesion in the left and suprasellar region, with a maximum diameter of 17 mm, hyperintense in T2-weighted sequences with an inhomogeneous contrast distribution due to the presence of internal colliquative areas (). The left side of the mass was in contact with the optic chiasm. The initial radiological diagnosis was of pituitary macroadenoma. No visual field alterations were detected, and the pituitary hormone function tests were within the normal range. The patient was therefore candidate for elective surgery; however, after a few days he complained of a worsening of the headache and the appearance of a ptosis of the left eye.

Imaging on arrival revealed an age indeterminate C7 vertebral fracture, which was treated with conservatively with a cervical collar and pain control. Shortly after admission, her hospital course was complicated by acute on chronic hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring rescue BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) support and admission to the intensive care unit. The patient became encephalopathic, and arterial blood gas revealed respiratory acidosis with significant carbon dioxide retention of >105 mm Hg. The patient was intubated for impending respiratory failure.\nComputed tomography thorax was performed and showed a left-sided opacification initially treated as a left-sided pneumonia. However, her respiratory status failed to improve despite being on adequate antibiotic therapy, and she failed recurrent spontaneous breathing trials while off sedation. These findings lead to the discovery of significant neuromuscular weakness and the left-sided opacification.

The patient was conscious and oriented, presenting dysphonia, hemoptysis, and increasing respiratory distress that led to the intubation of the patient by an anesthetist in the emergency room. Her physical examination revealed a subcutaneous emphysema, edema, and tenderness in the cervical area, and other facial and extremity abrasions and ecchymosis. The cervical and thorax CT-scan demonstrated an anterior traumatic lesion of the larynx with severe emphysema of the cervical and supraclavicular area and fracture of the cricoid and thyroid cartilage ().\nAfter the patient stabilization, the patient was evaluated by otolaryngology and immediately admitted to the operating room. During surgery, a transversal fracture of thyroid and cricoid cartilage was found. The thyroid fracture was repaired and the cricoid cartilage was fixed to the thyroid cartilage with 3-0 prolene and tracheostomy was performed (). The patency of the laryngeal lumen was maintained with an endotracheal tube, which was removed one week later.\nThe patient was initially admitted in intermediary care unit and fed through a nasogastric tube. The postoperative evaluation with flexible endoscopy revealed a bilateral paresis of the vocal cords and significant reduction of laryngeal sensibility and saliva aspiration. During her stay in the intermediary care unit the patient case was complicated with a pulmonary infection with multisensitive Pseudomonas aeruginosa which was successfully treated with piperacillin-tazobactam for 21 days. During this period the patient started sessions of speech therapy to help improved vocalization and deglutition. Before discharge the patient was submitted to surgical gastrostomy because of persistent food aspiration.\nAt 3-month follow-up the flexible endoscopy revealed a normal mobilization of both vocal cords ().

In addition, the patient suffered from chronic abdominal pain (over all quadrants).

She had no history of gynecological diseases, procedures, or uterine trauma. Her menstrual cycle was regular without any symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a myomatous mass with homogenous intensity present on the posterior uterine wall close to the internal ostium of the uterus, which shaped the inner pouch structure that was filled with a small amount of fluid (Fig. a). Upon initial examination, it appeared to be a rudimentary uterine horn; however, hysterosalpingography showed the patency of bilateral fallopian tubes connected with the fundus of the anterior uterus.\nAlthough the pregnancy was uneventful after natural conception, the myomatous mass and the pouch had become enlarged (Fig. b). At 38 + 4 gestational weeks, the patient underwent an elective cesarean delivery because the enlarged mass interfered with a vaginal delivery. Although involution of the uterus was uneventful and her menstruation did not occur during the four months after delivery, she presented at our department again with lower abdominal pain. The normal uterus was empty and about 7 cm in size. MRI showed that the myomatous mass was just as large as it was during pregnancy, and the fluid inside the myomatous mass had increased (Fig. c).\nTo improve her abdominal symptoms, she underwent laparotomy six months after delivery. During laparotomy, the uterus was completely normal with normal fallopian tubes and ovaries. A hard mass was found behind the uterus covered by thin serosa (Fig. a) and connected to the posterior uterine wall in the mid-line (Fig. b). The root of the tumor was about 3 cm in diameter.

    "original_text": "A 49-year-old woman had a snakebite on her left foot while walking on the street. The killed snake was identified as T. stejnegeri. The patient developed severe pain and swelling in the left foot, local erythema, and ecchymosis a few minutes after the bite. She was taken to a nearby clinic where she was given base treatment, including cleaning the wound and hemostasis. For further treatment, she was subsequently transferred to the hospital. On examination, the vital signs were found to be stable and the left foot was markedly swollen. The neurological examination was essentially normal on admission. She was immediately treated with three 10-mL intravenous injections of polyvalent anti-snake venom serum. Meanwhile, she was also injected with adsorbed tetanus toxoid. She also received ceftriaxone and other supportive therapy. The laboratory findings were as follows: mild leukocytosis and negative coagulation function and fibrin degradation products. The patient developed right-side weakness and speech disturbances on the fourth day after the bite. She also had nonfluent aphasia with difficulty in expression and understanding and right spastic hemiparesis involving the face, arm, and, to a lesser degree, the leg. The examination revealed that edema in the left lower extremity was obvious. The nervous system examination showed that the consciousness was clear. The patient had mixed aphasia. The bilaterally round pupils, about 3 mm in diameter, were sensitive to light reflection. Further, the nasolabial fold was shallow on the right, the tongue deviated to the right, and the right limb muscle strength was 0.

She had been diagnosed with a uterine myoma and a perirectal mass by pelvic magnetic resonance imaging at a local medical center. The patient\u2019s vital signs were within the normal range. Abdominal examination revealed a hard mass in the left lower quadrant (LLQ) of the abdomen with no acute peritoneal signs. Gynecological examination revealed no findings suggestive of gynecological malignancy; however, her serum cancer antigen (CA) 125 level was elevated (89 U/mL). Other blood tests were negative for leukocytosis or C-reactive protein elevation, which was not suggestive of systemic inflammation. Serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and CA19-9 were also within the normal range.\nThe IUD was removed by a gynecologist. Contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) revealed a huge enhancing mass connected to the greater omentum in the left lower abdomen and a perirectal mass connected to the uterus, suggestive of peritoneal carcinomatosis (). Positron-emission tomography performed for diagnosis of the primary malignancy revealed a suspected carcinomatous lesion in the LLQ in addition to multiple masses with fluorodeoxyglucose uptake near the right lower quadrant and the perirectal area (). Endoscopic examination for assessment of alimentary tract malignancy did not reveal any lesions suggestive of malignancy. Therefore, surgical exploration was performed for tissue confirmation.\nLaparoscopic exploration was impossible because of a frozen abdomen secondary to the omental mass. Therefore, a median laparotomy was performed and revealed a firm mass which was strongly adherent to the left lower parietal peritoneum and connected to the greater omentum around it.

On clinical and radiographic examination, Miller's Class I recession of 3 mm was diagnosed in relation to 14 and 24 [].

The kindergarten teacher reported that the girl had had a frequent cough during the day.\nThe teachers tried to give her first aid through several back blows with no success and contacted the emergency medical services. By the time the emergency medical personnel arrived on the scene, the child was no longer there, having been transported to the closest hospital by car by one of the teachers. In the emergency room, after inspection of the upper airway, a trained anesthesiologist attempted endotracheal intubation with the use of a laryngoscope multiple times, with no success. The patient arrived at the hospital emergency department in about 10 min after the initial incident and the physicians declared death after 20 min of resuscitation maneuvers for foreign body ingestion asphyxia.

Patient had 4-5 episodes of vomiting which was red in color and 200 mL at a time. He also had mild dull aching pain and malena for the last 2 weeks. Patient was a chronic alcoholic. On examination there was severe pallor. On investigating the patient, Hb was 4.0 gm/dL, and other blood investigations were within normal limits. He already had an upper GI endoscopy () done outside stating large ulcer with undermined edge along lesser curvature at fundus with no active bleed. EUS Doppler done outside also () suggested a possibility of a heterogeneous mass lesion in fundus, likely leiomyoma. FNA which was taken at that time showed inflammatory cells. Patient also had a CT report which stated () a possibility of distal pancreatic carcinoma encasing splenic vessels and infiltrating the adjacent structure. After referring to gastroenterologist at our institute, repeat UGIE suggested a large submucosal lesion of 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 cm with central necrotic ulcer with evidence of recent bleeding (leiomyoma). As there was contradiction in findings of UGIE and CT, we proceeded in direction having probable diagnosis of some pancreatic neoplasm invading the wall of stomach. But as the stomach in CECT was normal and patient was bleeding recurrently we decided to do a triple phase CT before concluding our diagnosis. We finally got a triple phase CT of the abdomen () done at our institute which revealed a splenic artery pseudoaneurysm with multiple splenic infarcts. After resuscitation and transfusing 5 units of PRC we planned a laparotomy.

Computed tomography (CT) images showed a left lower posterior mediastinal paravertebral tumor measuring 4.2 \u00d7 3.0 cm with no observed direct invasion to any adjacent structures. The oval-shaped tumor had a smooth and clear edge and roughly uniform density, with a CT value of approximately 0 HU. It was located in the left posterior region of the descending aorta (Fig a). The patient denied having any symptoms, such as fever, cough, or pain. His medical and family history of disease was unremarkable. Upon admission, his physical examination and blood and urine evaluations were also unremarkable. CT imaging revealed that the tumor was located in the mediastinum (Fig b), and there was no blood vessel connection with the descending aorta (Fig c); thus, pulmonary sequestration was excluded. The patient's symptoms, signs, and CT images also excluded enlarged lymph nodes and lymphomas. The preoperative diagnosis was a neurogenic tumor. Considering the position and benign nature of the lesion, we planned a transdiaphragmatic retroperitoneoscopic resection of the left lower posterior mediastinal tumor.\nThe patient lay in a modified flank position under general anesthesia. The retroperitoneal space was expanded with an in-house balloon dilatation apparatus, and the trocar was placed as previously reported. A 30\u00b0 angle laparoscopy was used during the procedure.

The Gerota's fascia was opened, and further dissections were all conducted in the non-vascular plane between the renal fat capsule and the Psoas muscle. Care was taken to avoid injury to the renal artery. After wide dissection in the plane, we located the lesion at the midline end of the arcuate line of the diaphragm and under the diaphragm muscle.
