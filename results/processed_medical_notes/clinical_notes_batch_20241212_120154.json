The symptoms had appeared, for the first time, two months prior to the patient's presentation. During the clinical examination, there were no palpable masses of the abdomen and an abdominal distention could not be clearly diagnosed, due to patient's obesity. The patient complained also about loss of appetite during the last two months.\nRegarding the standard serum investigations, we observed anemia (HCT 30%), without any other abnormal values of biochemical tests. There was an ultrasound requested, if there was a significant amount of intraperitoneal ascites discovered. Tumor markers were also measured in serum, where Ca 19-9 and CEA serum levels were higher than normal values (Ca 19-9 = 204.4 IU/mL and CEA = 83.5 ng/mL). The computed tomography (CT) control of the abdomen showed that the peritoneal cavity included a significant amount of ascites, and a cystic mass (8 cm in diameter), with small calcifications within its wall, was found in the right iliac fossa, possibly a mucocele of the appendix. Moreover, no enlarged lymphnodes of the abdomen were observed. Colonoscopy and gastroscopy findings were negative for pathology. A small amount of ascitic collection was drawn percutaneously for cytologic examination. The result was a small number of observed lymphocytes in the setting of large amount of mucous matrix. There were no malignant cells observed.\nThe patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy for definite diagnosis. The abdomen was full of gelatinous ascitic liquid and diffuse implantations of the peritoneum. Extended adhesions of the small intestine to the abdominal wall due to neoplastic implantation were found as well. A large mucocele was identified arising from the appendix. The disseminated picture of the disease indicated a cytoreductive surgery procedure. Biopsies were taken from the abdominal wall and the mesenterium. They revealed elements of peritoneal mucinous neoplasm of high malignant grade and microscopic lesions",

His periorbital swelling improved with this therapy, but as the prednisone was tapered he began experiencing symmetric bilateral proximal muscle weakness and soreness of the upper and lower extremities. This was accompanied by a hyperpigmented rash on the trunk, extensor surface of the arms, and upper thighs with associated soft tissue swelling. Two weeks after the completion of the prednisone taper, he began experiencing dysphagia to solids more than to liquids and suffered several choking episodes. This forced a change in his diet to thick liquids; as a result, by the end of the month he had lost 60 pounds. Given his worsening symptoms, he presented to our outpatient clinic in July 2014.

    "original_text": "A healthy 15-year-old girl was referred following a five day history of a unilateral red left eye. The eye was becoming progressively more inflammed, with epiphora, photophobia and blurred visual acuity.\nOn examination, the visual acuity in the affected eye was 6/6 compared with 6/5 in the other eye. The conjunctiva was inflamed with a follicular reaction including the corneal margins superiorly. There were enlarged pre auricular nodes. A diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis was made and viral plus bacterial swabs were taken.\nThe patient was commenced on fucithalmic to prevent secondary infection and told to re attend if she deteriorated. Five days later, she returned feeling that the eye had become more tender with increased swelling of the lids plus tenderness over the maxillary sinus.\nOn examination, there was marked oedema of the upper and lower lids accompanied by erythema. The tarsal conjunctiva revealed follicles. Extra ocular movements were full but uncomfortable on elevation. Pupil, colour vision examination and direct visualisation revealed a healthy disc. She was apyrexial and systemically otherwise well.

    "original_text": "An 82-year-old male with squamous cell carcinoma of the left posterior mandibular gingiva underwent a partial mandibulectomy (#35 tooth to the left mandibular angle) combined with left supraomohyoid neck dissection. Reconstruction of the composite tissue defects of the mandible was conducted with a radial forearm free flap (RFFF) for the soft tissue and a customized 3D-printed titanium block at other general hospital in Korea. The RFFF failed due to venous thrombosis, and the titanium block set in the mandibular defect was exposed out of the left submandibular area as well as the oral cavity, resulting in a wide orofacial fistula. Soft tissue reconstruction was performed using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap to close the fistula and cover the exposed titanium block. However, the soft tissue coverage failed again and the chronic fistula was followed by severe scar contraction. When the patient was referred to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery in Asan Medical Center 6 months after the first surgery, there was a severe infection around the exposed titanium block (Fig. ). The presence of residual tumor was confirmed in MRI images taken after visiting our clinic. Therefore, we removed the titanium block and residual failed RFFF and performed further resection from the mesial surface of the #42 tooth to the ascending ramus of the left mandible. For the wide defect of the composite tissue defect, left side mandibular reconstruction was done with a FFF. The contour of the fibula was designed on a virtual surgery simulation and a 3D surgical template was printed (Aview(R) Modeler; Coreline Soft, Seoul, Republic of Korea). The harvested fibula was osteotomized into two parts to align with the planned contour of the reconstructed mandible.

One month later pain started and limitation of ROM of the right ring finger gradually worsened. Because of his clinical disorders, a trigger finger was diagnosed by another orthopedic who performed a steroid injection. The treatment was ineffective, then he referred to our department in November 2015. The clinical examination showed a small scar on the palm, located proximally to the fourth metacarpophalangeal joint and the ROM of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint of the ring finger was limited to 40 degrees of extension and complete (100 degrees) in flexion, both in passive and active motion. The feeling of numbness just under the scar, the first steroid injection that was not effective and the young age of the patient, led us to perform an ultrasound examination of the hand tendons (), which showed a suspect tear of the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon of the ring finger, proximally to the pulley A1 that appeared thickened. The surgical exploration of the tendon was the treatment of choice, which was performed 2 months and 10 days from the injury.\nThe incision was made at the pulley A1 and extended Brunner-like proximally in direction of the scar.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis showed a 3 \u00d7 2 cm lesion in the endometrial cavity with superficial myometrial invasion without any enlarged pelvic or paraaortic nodes. She underwent robotic staging surgery for carcinoma endometrium in February 2015 using the da Vinci Xi robotic platform. As there is facility for fluorescence imaging in the robotic platform, it was decided to use ICG for sentinel mapping in her. Consent for the procedure was obtained from the patient and also from the hospital\u2019s ethical committee.\nConcentration of ICG used was 0.5 mg/mL, a 4 mL of this solution was injected intracervically at 3 and 9 o\u2019clock positions, both submucosally and deep into the cervical stroma. The injection was done after port placement but before the docking of the robotic platform. After complete inspection of peritoneal cavity and collecting pelvic washings, the fluorescent imaging was switched on. The time taken from the cervical injection till this point was 20 minutes. Under fluorescence imaging, the site of intracervical injection was well lit up but no lymphatics or lymph nodes were identified in the pelvic nodal areas. We then looked into the paraaortic area with fluorescence imaging and saw a lit up lymphatic channel crossing the right common iliac and lighting up of a right periaortic node (). Bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and removal of the lighted up paraaortic nodes were done.

    "original_text": "A 31-year-old Brazilian woman presented to our Surgery Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery for evaluation of cystic lesions in her teeth 13 and 15 and a swelling on her right maxilla (Fig. ). In her anamnesis, she reported that she had already had endodontic treatment for her teeth 13 and 15 without regression of the lesion. Her teeth 14 and 24 had been previously removed for orthodontic treatment. A radiographic and computed tomography (CT) examination showed a radiolucent lesion, diffuse, of approximately 20 mm, involving the teeth 13 and 15. The initial diagnosis was inflammatory periapical cyst (Fig. ).\nShe underwent preoperative laboratory tests and an excisional biopsy of the lesion was undertaken under general anesthesia. The choice of the use general anesthesia was due to the size of the lesion and possibility of enucleation without removal of the teeth involved. The collected material was sent for pathological examination. The result was compatible with CGCL (Figs. and ), which differed from our diagnostic hypothesis. After the definitive diagnosis, she was advised to carry out regular monitoring because of the risk of recurrence.\nShe self-monitored for a period of 10 months; she then presented again with a complaint of swelling on the site, but without the presence of pain. A new CT scan was requested and indicated recurrence of the lesion, which now involved the region\u2019s incisor, canine, and premolar (Fig. ). New laboratory tests were carried out: alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone (PTH).

    "original_text": "A 74-year-old healthy Korean woman presented with a history of intermittent epigastric pain. Her husband and son were known to have developed gastric cancer. The patient underwent endoscopic examination of the stomach in December 2005, which demonstrated a depressed mucosal lesion in the anterior wall of the distal gastric body (). Histological examination revealed signet ring cell carcinoma. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) excluded gastric wall thickening, lymphadenopathy and distant metastasis. The diagnosis was type IIb early gastric cancer for which surgery was recommended, but she declined for an unspecified reason.\nThe patient took antacids and digestive medicines irregularly, and underwent a repeat endoscopy in September 2006, which showed no interval changes. However, at the third endoscopy in October 2009, a satellite lesion was detected in the greater curvature of the distal gastric body adjacent to the previously confirmed malignant lesion. Histological examination of the satellite lesion confirmed signet ring cell carcinoma of the stomach, identical to the primary lesion.

The patient was referred to the office after an emergency department visit for her chronic abdominal pain. The workup showed normal laboratory values with a nonspecific, lobulated soft tissue lesion located within the mesentery of the upper abdomen measuring up to 3.2 cm on computed tomography with intravenous and oral contrast. The patient noted her pain had developed and had been persistent since she underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis roughly one year prior. She described her pain as sharp in nature with intermittent flares. The patient reported that eating exacerbated her symptoms. She endorsed anorexia as well as weight loss. Physical examination at that time was considered unremarkable. The patient\u2019s medical history included gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastritis, depression, and a seizure disorder. The patient\u2019s surgical history included a cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis, hemorrhoidectomy, tonsillectomy, and an appendectomy. Family and social history were non-contributory.\nBased on the initial radiographic results and the location of the mesenteric lesion, the patient was referred for endoscopic evaluation and possible biopsy. They were then started on a trial of proton pump inhibitors. The patient had multiple visits to her primary care provider and was eventually transitioned to sucralfate as her symptoms were unresolved. The patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy that revealed LA Grade B gastroesophageal reflux disease, a 2 cm hiatal hernia, and diffuse gastritis. Repeat computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast was performed revealing a lobulated lesion at the level of the kidneys within the anterior mesenteric fat, concerning for an enlarged lymph node or a neoplastic mass as demonstrated by the arrow in Figure .

CT scan confirmed the presence of the mass and described a tumor in the left adrenal gland, with mild inhomogeneous solid characteristics and an oval size of approximately 42x38x32mm (Fig.).

Tumor tissues for the molecular analysis to sequence c-KIT were not available, so he was treated with a 1-year adjuvant treatment with imatinib at a daily dose of 400 mg daily, according to 2009 international guidelines.\nOn October 2012, a follow-up abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan detected a 45\u00d732 mm unique local relapse, and treatment with 400 mg a day imatinib was administered again. A tumor biopsy was not performed due to the patient\u2019s refusal.\nA CT scan performed after 6 weeks from imatinib onset showed that the lesion increased in size, with no areas of reduced contrast enhancement. Imatinib dosage was then increased to 800 mg a day, but a subsequent CT scan performed after 6 weeks showed no signals of treatment response. The lesion was unique at CT scan and was amenable to radical surgery; on February 27, 2013, the patient underwent surgical disease excision. A large implant of recurrent GIST was visible on the peritoneal surface of the abdominal wall, 8.5 cm in longitudinal diameter. It was apparently increased with respect to the previous CT scan, despite the fact that the patient had not interrupted imatinib administration. An enlarged epiploic appendix of the sigmoid colon was removed for histology, and a peritoneal washing was performed for cytology.

He was able to move his fingers. Wound debridement and reduction of the elbow were carried out on the day of admission, which was followed by skin graft. The wound was completely covered with the grafted skin, and infection was also controlled by the end of April. The radiograms taken on May 25, 1977 showed the preserved distal physis of the radius. Transposition of the distal end of the osteotomized proximal ulna shaft to the remaining distal metaphysis of the radius was performed on June 8, 1977 ().\nOn the radiogram of the right forearm, taken 4 weeks after the reconstructive surgery, new bone formation in the ulna periosteal tube was shown, and complete bone reformation of the ulnar ray was seen 3 months after surgery. Hypertrophy of the ulna was seen 6 months later. At the time, the boy demonstrated almost normal right hand function with a stable wrist (). Then, the boy was lost to follow up for a while. On January 5, 1979, the boy revisited the outpatient clinic complaining instability of the right wrist with degradation of right hand function. The radiograms taken on the day disclosed pseudoarthrosis at the metaphysis of the radial ray of the bifurcated single bone forearm (). A periosteal corticocancellous graft harvested from his right tibia was grafted to the nonunion site on January 10, 1979 (). Radiograms of the right forearm, taken 6 months after bone graft disclosed solid union.

The patient reported a sudden onset of nausea and vomiting prior to these episodes. He described a room-spinning sensation when he awoke associated with ringing in the ear. He regained consciousness within one to two minutes. While attempting to stand, he again lost consciousness. In the ED, the patient denied any symptoms.\nIn the ED, his physical examination was significant for symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Vitals included blood pressure of 88/54 mmHg and a heart rate of 85 beats/minute. The patient was afebrile. The patient's initial laboratory workup results are presented in Table . His electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. His chest X-ray findings were unremarkable. A CT scan of the patient's head showed an apparent hyperdensity in the left intracranial internal carotid artery just proximal to the bifurcation, representing an artifact or the presence of an embolus. It also showed an apparent sellar mass with calcifications and suprasellar extension. A CT scan of the abdomen showed cholelithiasis and was negative for any acute pathology.\nThe patient was admitted for further evaluation of syncope. Sepsis was considered given his leukocytosis and hypotension. A CT scan of the head showing a questionable embolus was followed by a neurological evaluation to test for a possible stroke. The patient was admitted to a telemetry unit to rule out syncope due to cardiac arrhythmias. Intravenous fluids were started to treat his hypotension.\nOn the patient's second day of admission, the intensive care unit team was consulted for persistent hypotension.

The patient complained that her nose and mouth corner were crooked and that her face was swelling. In clinical examination, the patient had a slight asymmetry in the right midface as a result of buccal and palatal cortical expansion from the right maxillary canine to the molar region, resulting in depression of the nasal alar and mouth corner (Fig. ).\nA panoramic radiograph showed an increased bone density on the right maxilla and zygoma and obliteration of the right maxillary sinus. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 4.5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4.5 cm, expansile ground-glass opacity lesion involving the right maxillary sinus, right maxillary alveolar process, zygoma, and hard palate. Bone scan revealed an irregularly shaped hot uptake in the right maxilla, and no abnormally increased uptake was observed at any other sites (Fig. ). The physical examination did not show any other lesions, and the patient had no history of pain, trauma, loosening of teeth, or trismus. Based on the typical radiologic findings, the patient was diagnosed with FD, and no additional biopsy was performed. The patient had regular follow-up every 6 months to monitor the lesion\u2019s progress. At the 1-year follow-up, the development of tooth germ within the lesion was normal, and slight expansion of the lesion to the bucco-lingual side was observed.

The tumor, about 3 cm in diameter, was located on the right side of the lower rectum 3 cm above the anal verge. The pathological analysis of the biopsy sample revealed that the tumor was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that the rectal cancer invaded into the muscularis propria without distant metastases and that lateral pelvic lymph node (LPLN) was not enlarged with a maximum long-axis diameter <3 mm. The most important problem was that the patient had a huge benign prostatic hypertrophy, the size of which was 85 \u00d7 80 \u00d7 70 mm (Fig. a\u2013c). To achieve complete TME with negative CRM, a hybrid transabdominal-transanal approach for ISR was conducted.\nFirst, vascular division and mobilization of the left colon were performed laparoscopically. The transabdominal approach was continued until the anterior dissection of the rectum became difficult due to a huge prostatic hypertrophy. Next, the circumferential rectal incision and subsequent intersphincteric dissection were performed under direct vision to enable attachment of a single port device (GelPoint Mini; Applied Medical). After closure of the anal orifice, the GelPoint Mini was placed to start the transanal approach. Posterior side of the rectum was first dissected until the transanal approach was connected to the dissection layer made by the transabdominal approach. The dissection procedure was extended to the lateral side. Bilateral pelvic splanchnic nerves were identified at the 5 and 7 o\u2019clock positions. At the anterior side, the proper dissection layer cannot be easily identified because of the perineal body and the enlarged prostate. Once the dissection plane between the rectum and the prostate could be identified, it was relatively easy to continue along the same plane. The assistance provided by the laparoscopic approach was useful to determine the appropriate dissection line in the transanal approach.",

This was the first episode of dislocation. The shoulder was closed reduced by the Kocher\u2019s technique within 3 hours of trauma, and a post-reduction radiograph was taken to confirm concentric reduction. The shoulder was immobilized for 3 weeks ( and ), following which rotator cuff strengthening exercises were initiated. The patient was followed up, after the shoulder was reduced at 3 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months, and then, the patient reported after 2 years. This patient was a non-alcoholic healthy college-going student who was not on any medications. At 6-month follow-up, the left shoulder radiograph showed a sclerotic sector of the head with cortical erosions near the greater tuberosity ( and ). A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done which revealed a geographic area of the anterior part of humeral head with an altered marrow signal, which was iso- to hyper-intense on short tau inversion recovery sequence, with a hypointense rim on T1 sequence. The differential diagnosis was a bone bruise or osteonecrosis of the humeral head. However, due to the sclerotic changes on the radiographs, possibility of osteonecrosis could not be ruled out and this required displaced medially, outside the bicipital groove ( and ), and the rotator cuff was normal. The patient had a stable shoulder with mild pain at the extremes of motion. A radiograph of the pelvis with both hips was normal, without any sclerotic changes of the femoral head. The patient was treated with cuff strengthening exercises, and he resumed all routine activities including leisure sporting activities. Bisphosphonate was not administered.

Abdominal ultrasonography showed extensive heterogeneous mass with cystic area in between measuring 25.0 cm \u00d7 17.6 cm \u00d7 8.0 cm compromising the entire abdominal cavity.\nIn the last month, the abdominal pain became worse in intensity. The patient had a weight loss of 6 kg in these 3 months.

The initial differential diagnosis was neuroblastoma and lymphoma.\nTumor resection was conducted the next day after admission []. Due to its proportions, midline laparotomy was indicated. The large mass was not adhered to the abdominal wall, its pedicle was located in the mesentery, and there were some adherences with the small intestine. After lysis of the adherences, the mass was enucleated without injuring any mesenteric vessel. The mesenteric origin of the mass suggested by the magnetic resonance was confirmed during the intraoperative period.

    "original_text": "In June 2011, a 56-year-old male was referred to our department by head and neck surgeon in order to improve his upper denture retention and stability. The patient was diagnosed with a squamous cell carcinoma of the maxillary gingiva (T4N0M0) in May 2005 and underwent an extended left maxillectomy, an anterior and middle cranial base resection, a left ophthalmectomy, and a flap reconstruction using the rectus abdominis muscle were performed. On physical examination, a recessed deformation on the left side of his face could be seen because of the left ophthalmectomy. The function of the left levator palpebrae muscle was eliminated to the level of a slight elevation by using the frontal muscle. A metal plate was anchored to the inferior wall of orbit. The left ethmoid bone, inferior nasal turbinate, the maxilla, alisphenoid, medial and lateral pterygoid muscle were already excised during the mesh titanium plate reconstruction of the anterior wall from the maxillary orbital region. Intraorally, the left maxilla had been excised from the midline, with the rectus abdominis muscle flap sutured directly to the soft palate. The peripheral mucous membrane around the left upper lip was already scarred, without the oral vestibule, and the flap margin had moved along with the surrounding soft tissue.

Brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance examinations revealed acute cerebral infarction in the right MCA territory and an extra-axial mass with homogenous enhancement in the medial portion of the right sphenoid ridge (). Magnetic resonance angiogram showed complete occlusion of the right ICA terminus (). The infarction included the right uncus, insula, medial occipitotemporal gyrus, basal ganglia, corona radiate, and precentral gyrus (). The tumor, which was consistent with a sphenoid ridge meningioma, encased and compressed the right ICA terminus. Cerebral angiography demonstrated complete occlusion of the right proximal M1 portion with slightly limited collateral circulation to the right MCA territory and a radiographic blush from the surrounding meningioma (). Flow in the right MCA had been partially reconstituted by supply from the ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery and the posterior cerebral artery, but was much reduced. A CT perfusion study obtained shortly after arrival showed dramatic prolongation of time to peak and mean transit time of the right MCA territory, indicating obviously decreased regional cerebral blood flow in the involved territory ().\nThe patient was admitted and started on dual antiplatelet therapy, induced hypertension, and volume expansion. However, over the ensuing 48 hours, the left hemiparesis deteriorated steadily to muscle power grade 2 in upper and lower limbs, and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated enlargement of the area of the diffusion weighted abnormality (). Emergency extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass was performed uneventfully.

He underwent right radical nephrectomy and tumor thrombectomy performed under extracorporeal circulation. Cardiac function was investigated, including coronary angiography and transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. These studies documented normal cardiac function and normal morphology of the coronary arteries. Pathological examination of the surgical specimens demonstrated pT3cN0Mx conventional (clear cell) renal carcinoma, Fuhrman Grade 3 with negative surgical margins. A regular follow-up program was started. A few months later, hepatic and contralateral renal metastases were detected. The patient started treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sorafenib on a dose-escalation protocol. Treatment led to an initial partial response followed by stable disease for 6 months. During December 2008, in a setting of stable disease, he underwent hepatic resection and enucleation of the left renal mass. The hepatic and renal masses were confirmed to be metastases. Early radiological assessment after surgery showed no residual hepatic or renal disease, but possible involvement of the mesenteric lymph nodes. Sorafenib treatment was therefore restarted at a standard dose of 800 mg/day. Treatment led to complete disease response within a few months, and was very well tolerated by the patient, who did not experience any of the typical adverse effects of the drug.\nDuring February 2011, after 30 months of sorafenib treatment (6 months at 1600 mg/day and 24 months at 800 mg/day), the patient started to complain of worsening chest pain precipitated by normal physical exercise.

A nodule had appeared on the site where she had undergone a left thyroidectomy for nodular hyperplasia two years previously. On physical examination, the nodule was found to be hard and painful when pressure was applied, and intermittent swelling of the left upper limb was noted, leading to suspicion of a chronically occluded left subclavian vein. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 3-cm mass-like lesion in the left supraclavicular area with suspected internal jugular vein invasion (). The diagnosis of the nodule as suspicious for metastatic carcinoma was made by sonography-guided fine needle aspiration cytology. Further testing, including positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, was performed on the assumption that the nodule reflected lymph node metastasis from an unknown primary site. Blood tests and tumor marker levels were normal. On PET/CT, the maximum standardized uptake value was 7.7 in the left supraclavicular area (). However, no detectable primary site was found. We then planned the surgical excision of the tumor in order to make a definitive histological diagnosis, in accordance with the patient\u2019s desire to remove the tumor. The neck was extended in the supine position, and a left collar incision was performed. Contrary to our expectations, a tumor was found that arose from the internal jugular vein.

A pathologic fracture was suspected upon initial radiographs, and as a result, an incisional biopsy was performed, which revealed a fibroblastic osteosarcoma. She was transferred to our institution after the biopsy and was diagnosed as having in clinical stage IIB according to the Enneking's classification. She had received preoperative chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin (100 mg/m2, every 3-4 weeks, total 780 mg/m2) and doxorubicin (60 mg/m2, every 4 weeks for a total of 293 mg/m2). Despite the treatment, the patient's poor clinical response and her parents' refusal to definite surgery led us to change the chemotherapy regimen. After seven courses of bleomycin, cyclophosphosphamide and actinomycin D, the tumor was resected with a wide margin, and reconstructed with a tumor prosthesis-bone cement composite. The changed chemotherapy regimen was considered to be effective based on the clinical and histologic response, and the patient had received 4 more courses of chemotherapy with the same agents. The patient complained of dyspnea during the last course of postoperative chemotherapy and was brought in for a cardiac consultation. The echocardiogram and endomyocardial biopsy revealed the patient to be afflicted with dilated cardiomyopathy, which was consideraed to have been caused by doxorubicin. Her cardiac symptoms were mild and well-controlled with diuretics, and she had been doing well for 12 yr until a mass in her neck was discovered.\nFine-needle aspiration cytology revealed papillary carcinoma in the right lobe of thyroid. She underwent total thyroidectomy without neck dissection and a pathologic evaluation of the tissue revealed the papillary carcinoma of conventional type ().
