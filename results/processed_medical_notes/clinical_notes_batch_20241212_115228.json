Fistula division and primary anastomosis of the esophagus was attempted on the third day after birth in another hospital. However, because of long gap atresia, he underwent cervical esophagostomy and feeding gastrostomy. Two years later, he underwent an Ivor Lewis operation, pyloroplasty, and feeding jejunostomy. However, leakage from the anastomosis site occurred and re-anastomosis was attempted on the 7th postoperative day. However, the leakage could not be controlled and the patient became hemodynamically unstable due to septic shock. Therefore, reposition of the gastric conduit in the abdominal cavity and a cervical esophagostomy were performed (). After a difficult recovery period, he was transferred to our hospital with a body weight of 12 kg at age 2. He was followed up for 5 years with the expectation that he would grow with jejunostomy feeding. However, he suffered from severe growth retardation and his body weight was just 15 kg when he became 7 years old. He was referred to our clinic for corrective surgery.

The transverse and descending colon pedicled with a left colic artery was harvested and anastomosis in the isoperistaltic direction was performed. The cervical esophagus was recovered from an esophagostomy and proximal anastomosis with the colon was made. Distal anastomosis was made to the upper body of the remnant stomach.

The procedure lasted 3 h because of thick adhesions that needed to be cleared. At the end of the procedure, total blood loss was 2 litres, and two Units of Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBC) were infused. During the surgical procedure, a central venous catheter was placed in the internal jugular vein by ultrasound-guided puncture of the vessel, but an inadvertent puncture and cannulation of the right subclavian artery occurred before catheter placement. Because of the ultrasound-guided procedure, the anesthesiologist thought to have cannulated the carotid artery and applied local pressure for a few minutes. Two hours later, when the patient was in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) around midnight, a chest X-ray to check the correct position of the central venous catheter revealed a massive hemothorax (), while the patient was hypotensive and responder to crystalloids and blood infusions. A chest drain was inserted without any substantial output but a small amount of clotted blood. The patient rapidly worsened, despite appropriate resuscitation with 10 U of PRBC, 8 U of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP), 3 U of cryoprecipitate and 1 U of platelets from apheresis. A second chest X-Ray to check tube position revealed a tension hemothorax (). The team in charge of the patient, comprising the anesthesiologist that did the general anaesthesia for the surgical procedure, made the diagnosis of suspected subclavian artery perforation and tension hemothorax with both hypovolemic and obstructive shock. The team decided to bring the patient in the hybrid room to control the likely bleeding for the right subclavian artery.

There was a negative history of chewing tobacco in any form.\nClinical examination revealed a bony hard swelling of the right side of the mandible, approximately 5 x 4 cm in maximum dimension, extending from the angle of the mandible to 2 cm short of the midline. The swelling was tender on palpation, with defined edges, and was fixed over the bone. No crackling or crepitus was elicited and the overlying skin was unremarkable. However, paraesthesia of the skin over the ipsilateral chin and lower lip was elicited.\nOn intraoral examination, no abnormality of the oral mucosa was detected and the patient was edentulous. Tenderness was elicited on palpating the alveolar mucosa on the right side, up to the retromolar region. The neck was palpated; however, no significant cervical nodes were found. An orthopantomogram was taken which showed a large radiolucency with irregular borders extending from the lower right canine region to the right angle of the mandible (Figure ).\nClinical findings and previous biopsy reports were correlated and the diagnosis was inconclusive.

    "original_text": "A 29-year-old female presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Her past medical history was significant for bilateral retinoblastoma. Her right eye was enucleated at four months, and one year later retinoblastoma was identified in the contralateral eye. She underwent external beam radiation and chemotherapy with vincristine and cyclophosphamide for three years. At age 12 she developed osteosarcoma of the right femur for which she received adriamycin, ifosphamide, and methotrexate for one year, with subsequent limb salvage surgery with allograft. At age 29, she presented to our hospital and underwent imaging that demonstrated a vascular mass in the posterior bladder with incidental findings of fibroid uterus and right ovarian cyst. Exploratory laparoscopy, cystoscopy with biopsy, and pelvic washing revealed a bladder neoplasm consistent with high-grade leiomyosarcoma. Gynecologic evaluation showed an endometrial polyp with simple hyperplasia without atypia in the curettage specimen and rare atypical malignant cells suggestive of either an adenocarcinoma or a spindle cell neoplasm. Further radiological surveys of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not reveal any metastatic disease, although a bone scan showed a moderate focus of activity in the right proximal humerus; this was subsequently consistent with enchondroma.\nThe patient underwent a radical cystectomy with ileal conduit and simple hysterectomy. The cystectomy specimen showed a tan, partially necrotic papillary tumor with edematous and focally hemorrhagic surrounding mucosa. The tumor did not extend throughout the bladder wall, and there was no connection between the posterior wall of the bladder and the anterior aspect of the uterus. The hysterectomy specimen revealed multiple leiomyomatous lesions in the anterior and posterior uterine walls and cervix that varied from small microscopic lesions to up to 3.2 cm in largest diameter.\nHistopathological analysis demonstrated two distinct leiomyosarcomas: one arising from the urinary bladder, the other from the uterus. These were established to be unrelated, representing two independent primary sarcomas. The bladder leiomyosarcoma was high-grade with mitotic figures averaging 80/10 high power fields. The tumor was positive for Rb, p53 (1-2",

Unenhanced transverse CT scan of the abdomen revealed an ill defined, lobulated mass that measured about 13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 7 cm in size and it appeared as a heterogeneously low attenuated mass with numerous areas of coarse calcification. It was located in the left side of the retroperitoneal space and involved the body and tail of the pancreas (). Contrast-enhanced CT was performed after mechanical injection of 130 cc of nonionic iopromide (300 mg/ml of iodine) into the antecubital vein at a rate of 2.65 ml/sec. After initiating infusion of contrast material, we used scanning delays of 30 seconds before starting to obtain the arterial phase images. Imaging in the portal venous phase was performed after a scanning delay of 70 seconds from the initiation of infusion of contrast material. On the contrast-enhanced transverse CT scan obtained during the portal venous phase, subtle enhancement was noted in only the periphery of the mass and most of the mass remained without enhancement ().

    "original_text": "A 44-year-old male initially presented with pain in his lower extremity. He visited a nearby hospital that referred him to our institute where a working diagnosis of a bone tumor was made. The plain radiograph shows an osseous lesion on the left posterior pelvis. Computed tomography (CT) depicted an osseous lesion arising from the left sacral ala. The osseous lesion was covered by a layer with intermediate signal intensity on the T1 weighted image and high signal intensity on the T2 weighted image from magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnosis from the image was an osteochondroma, which was covered by a cartilaginous cap. The maximum size of the tumor was ~6 cm and the thickness of the cartilaginous cap was <2 cm (). The histology of the needle biopsy of the cartilaginous cap showed a proliferation of chondroid tissue without atypia, suggesting an osteochondroma.\nOn diagnosis of the osteochondroma, a resection was performed. With the patient in the lateral position, a skin incision was made along the iliac crest to the contralateral paravertebral muscle, with a distal convex shape at the sacrum. The distal multifidus muscle was detached from the lamina of the sacral and lumber vertebrae. The posterior ilium and vertebrae were exposed, and the tumor was resected. Following resection, a vertebral fusion between L5 and S1 was performed using pedicle screws (). No complications associated with the operation appeared. The pathological diagnosis of the resected material was osteochondroma. The patient was able to walk without a crutch though dull back pain existed 6 months after the surgery with the degree of the pain getting worse. Image analysis 11 months after the initial operation revealed new cartilaginous nodules.

The child was highly irritable and pale looking and as per the parents, suffered from intermittent low-grade fever. History revealed that the girl was delivered as a healthy baby of an apparently healthy mother in a hospital setting. She was in perfect health at birth with a normal birth weight. BCG vaccine as a part of national immunization protocol was given to the baby at the age of 6 weeks. She received other vaccines on time. As reported by the parents the vaccination was followed by development of an erythematous papule over the arm, which ulcerated after 1 month. However, the ulcer never actually healed completely in spite of various topical medications. The ulcerated lesion kept increasing in size slowly for the next 3 to 4 months; finally, developing into a large plaque of size 5 cm \u00d7 8 cm []. The lesion was painless. At around 1 year of age however, the parents noted appearance of multiple bony swellings involving fingers, foot, root of nose, and vertebral column. [Figures \u2013] The swelling over the fingers was painful and associated with ulceration and discharge. The skin overlying foot and back swelling was relatively normal, except for mild ichthyotic changes.

During the admission she developed sudden onset left-sided weakness and altered levels of consciousness, as well as rigidity and one isolated temperature spike. The concern was raised that she may be or might have been suffering from neuroleptic malignant syndrome and her neuroleptics were stopped as a precaution (Table ). She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the MMUH in Dublin with a suspicion of neuroleptic malignant syndrome or encephalopathy. Computed tomography (CT) brain imaging was normal at the time. As neuroleptic malignant syndrome was suspected, olanzapine was stopped. However, her creatinine kinase levels were normal as was her body temperature. Hence, neuroleptic malignant syndrome was deemed to be unlikely. An electroencephalogram during admission showed changes suspicious of encephalopathy and MRI imaging showed no acute abnormality. A working diagnosis of metabolic encephalopathy was established but extensive investigations yielded no cause for the encephalopathy.\nDue to prolonged altered levels of consciousness and unexplained altered mental state, the Liaison Psychiatry service was consulted in January 2016.\nOn examination, she responded with a mouthed single word greeting, but made no other attempt at verbal interactions. She inconsistently followed the examiner with her gaze, but stared out of the window for most of the examination.

In the first quarter of 2015, during the removal of cranial epidural hemorrhage, percutaneous catheterization of central veins via the right femoral vein was attempted because of the need for intravenous infusion. After the surgery, the patient was sent to the intensive care unit for postoperative care. A few days later, the patient was discharged home; he demonstrated a slight weak muscular tension in his right upper extremity and had difficulty in speaking extended sentences. Approximately 1 and a half months after the surgery, the patient was re-examined by CT. The CT scan showed that 1 guidewire had ascended in the superior vena cava and the heart. Despite this finding, the hospital was unable to perform the surgery to remove the guide wire, and the doctors suggested that he should have a follow-up visit in every few months. The patient ignored the guide wire, took no medication, and continued to lead a normal life. In January 2016, the patient received another CT scan which revealed that the guide wire had arrived at the cerebrum. However, the patient did not have any symptoms of discomfort.

He had spent his day at a company party and then spent time with family before going to his garage to do mechanical work, as he regularly does. Throughout the day, he had consumed a significant amount of alcohol, which he suspects was about 18 beers, slightly more than his typical 10-15 beers daily, though he reported that drinking as much as 18 beers was not unusual for him. While working in his garage that night, he sent his significant other concerning text messages and she went to check on him. She found him cyanotic in the face while hanging with a rope around his neck. She likely saved his life as she removed the rope from his neck and called emergency medical services who brought him to our hospital. The patient reported being amnestic to these events and only being aware of them as his significant other had reported them to him.\nThroughout the patient\u2019s hospitalization, he was pleasant and cooperative with care. A thorough psychiatric review of systems did not reveal any conditions, except for alcohol use disorder (severe) and tobacco use disorder (severe). He said that he has been using both substances for more than 20 years. Collateral information was obtained from the patient's fianc\u00e9e, who said that he has been drinking daily for some time.

The pulses of the dorsalis pedis artery and posterior tibial artery were not detected.

There was no history of trauma. Then she had intermittent pain in the same tooth and antibiotics were given. Later she developed a swelling on right cheek and felt severe pain so the tooth 16 was extracted by the same dentist about 3 months back. As the pain and swelling did not subside even after extraction, incisional biopsy was performed twice from the region of 16 both from the socket and vestibule by oral and maxillofacial surgeons.

    "original_text": "A 34-year-old female who has no previous clinical illness presented in 2000 with a large irregular mass, estimated clinically to be around 5 \u00d7 6 cm by physical examination, involving the right breast while she was lactating. There were no other signs or symptoms. FNA was done to rule out breast cancer, and the specimen showed few foamy macrophages and rare clusters of ductal cells, with focal secretory lactational changes. Based on that, it was determined that the specimen was negative for malignancy. The tumor continued to grow, and in June 2004, FNA of the right breast was repeated and showed large staghorn-shaped sheets of uniform ductal cells with no cytologic atypia along with myoepithelial cells. There were fragments of fibrotic stroma and bare nuclei scattered in a bloody background, and so, a diagnosis of fibroadenoma was made. Two months later, the patient underwent excision of the tumor in another healthcare facility. Examination of the slides showed an overgrowth of epithelial and stromal components in pericanalicular and intracanalicular patterns with irregular large cystic spaces showing protruding leaf-like structures (). The stromal cells showed plump elongated slightly dysmorphic nuclei with occasional prominent nucleoli. Other areas showed significant cellular growth of the stromal spindle cells which appeared to be arranged in long intersecting fascicles and growing in herringbone pattern ().

Chest radiograph showed diffuse consolidation of the left lung. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a large abscess with an air-fluid level in the left upper lobe and extensive consolidation of the whole left lung (Fig. a). He was diagnosed with severe pneumonia with a lung abscess. Antibiotic therapy was started empirically with meropenem and vancomycin. Antibiotic therapy administered for 5 days did not demonstrate a satisfactory clinical outcome. Thereafter, he underwent CT-guided percutaneous catheter drainage of the lung abscess with a 1-Fr pigtail catheter, and 42 mL of pus fluid was evacuated. However, the catheter became clogged the next day, after which the patient developed respiratory failure and required a ventilator. Chest CT revealed pneumonia of the right lung and residual abscess content due to incomplete initial drainage (Fig. b). We suspected that pneumonia of the right lung was caused by aspiration of the abscess content due to the right lateral position of the patient at the time of the CT-guided percutaneous catheter drainage. Frequent bronchoscopies were performed to remove the endobronchial pus; however, his respiratory failure worsened further and he underwent tracheostomy. To achieve and maintain effective drainage, insertion of a larger size catheter to replace the 10-Fr catheter was planned. Since the route was expanded sufficiently without a lung trauma, large enough catheter, 28 Fr, was chosen as a new one in favor of avoiding clogging.

Several months after the treatment, a dark brownish to violaceous patch with edema arose from his right upper eyelid and gradually spread out to the lower eyelid (). Clinically, an ecchymosis caused by a trauma or other hemangioma was suspected more than a recurrent angiosarcoma, because the lesion was about 3 cm away from the surgical scar from the previous operation on the right forehead, and it presented as an edematous, purpuric patch such as the black eye. A skin biopsy taken from the upper eyelid showed numerous irregular anastomosing vascular channels lined by a single layer of somewhat enlarged atypical endothelial cells dissecting collagen bundles in the dermis (). Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed a positive reaction for CD31 and D2-40 (). A pathologic diagnosis of well differentiated angiosarcoma was made, and it was identical to that of primary angiosarcoma of the right forehead 3 years ago.\nAll routine laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, a urinalysis, the blood glucose level, the liver and the kidney function and the chemistry profile were within normal range. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography findings showed no evidence of distant metastasis.

Prior to the onset of her symptoms she had undergone a C5-C6 anterior fusion for cervical radiculopathy. A complete rheumatologic workup to determine the cause of her neuropathy was negative. An electromyogram showed no evidence of radiculopathy or neuropathy. A cervical MRI revealed chronic flattening of the spinal cord, but the patient had no clinical evidence of myelopathy such as sensory or motor deficits on physical exam. Previous treatment strategies included unsuccessful carpel tunnel and trigger thumb release. On initial presentation her medications included methadone 10 mg twice daily and oxycodone 60 mg four times daily as needed; however, she continued to rate her pain as a 9 out of 10 in severity.\nThe patient was originally treated with a right stellate ganglion block containing ropivacaine and clonidine. This was performed under fluoroscopic guidance by injecting local anesthetic at the junction of the C6 uncinate process and vertebral body [], creating a sympathectomy to the head, neck, and upper extremities. This intervention resulted in complete symptom relief in her right upper extremity for two weeks. The patient then underwent left stellate ganglion block with similar results in her left-upper extremity.\nGiven the successful treatment of her upper extremity peripheral neuropathy with sympathetic blockade, a trial of lumbar sympathetic blockade was initiated in her lower extremities. Lumbar sympathetic blockade was performed by injection at the anterolateral surface of L2-L3 vertebral bodies []. Each side of the sympathetic blockade was separated by a time frame of approximately two weeks. Both lumbar sympathetic blocks produced symptom relief for approximately two weeks similar to the upper extremity blockade. These procedures were repeated after a two-month interval. At that time, she was still experiencing partial relief from the first series. She again remained completely pain free for several weeks following the injections.\nAs the pain partially returned, pregabalin was added to her medication regimen.",

In the past, the patient underwent repeated drainage of effusions secondary to lymphangiomatosis. The lymphangiomatosis continued to worsen and resulted in pulmonary and cardiac involvement leading to cardiac tamponade requiring a pericardial window in 2004. Ultimately, the patient underwent video-assisted thorascopic surgery and partial thoracic duct embolization. Prior to the described admission, the patient had a recent admission for abdominal discomfort and was found to have a non-bleeding gastric ulcer. The biopsy report was negative for signs of malignancy; however, she did have a progressively growing pancreatic mass resulting in obstructive jaundice. At the time the patient was treated with pancreatic duct dilation and stent placement. A pancreatic biopsy was not done at that time due to an unacceptably high risk of bleeding given the pattern of vascularity. Additionally, the patient was diagnosed with cervical adenocarcinoma shortly prior to the current admission. She did not receive any treatment prior to being hospitalized.\nAt the time of this admission, the patient presented with diffuse weakness, nausea associated with non-bloody and non-bilious vomiting, worsening swelling of the upper and lower extremities for 2 months and a decrease in appetite. Vital signs on admission were a heart rate of 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, temperature of 98 \u00b0F measured orally and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination was significant for scleral icterus, abdominal distension with a fluid wave, extensive edema in the upper and lower extremities as well as diffuse jaundice. Cardiopulmonary examination did not reveal any acute findings. Of note, there was a chronic sacral lesion with peripheral erythema and edema. Laboratory workup including complete metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood counts (CBCs), and additional testing, as summarized in , were significant for a mild leukocytosis",

Her long medical history dated back to when she was just 1 year of age when she developed diffuse polyarthritis, mainly targeting both wrists and ankles. Her parents took her to the pediatric rheumatologist who diagnosed her with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and treated her mainly with prednisone and methotrexate. During the following years, and because of the lack of compliance to her medications, her arthritis was not well controlled. Therefore, she suffered from intermittent arthritis mainly affecting her wrists and hand joints which were associated with pain and swelling with spontaneous remissions. At the age of 7 years, she started having problems with her eyes; however, she had poor follow up for her condition. She presented multiple times to her local ophthalmologist with recurrent attacks of redness in her eyes and until just 1 year prior to presenting to us, when she was 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with bilateral anterior uveitis.\nThe ophthalmologist who referred the patient reported her complaint of redness and blurred vision in both eyes since 2 months and on slit lamp examination she had right eye vitreous snowballs and a hazy view along with the presence of anterior chamber inflammatory cells in both eyes but more in the right eye. She also had a history of dry eyes and was on lubricating eye drops.\nOn presentation to our clinic the patient was on oral prednisolone 5 mg/day, hydroxychloroquine 200 mg/day and omega 3 since 1 month. On slit lamp examination, keratic precipitates and inflammatory cells in the anterior chambers of eyes (+ 3 in the right eye and + 2 in the left eye) were found.

Accordingly, total vertebrectomy following bilateral video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was scheduled for ligation of feeding intercostal arteries and exfoliation of the tumor.\nAfter administration of 100% oxygen, general anesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl, remifentanil, and rocuronium. For maintenance of anesthesia, we used propofol and remifentanil in consideration of motor evoked potential monitoring.

There was no history of cognitive impairment. She suffered from multiple medical conditions including: atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and a recent mitral valve repair complicated by postoperative delirium.\nShe was admitted medically to a rural Irish hospital in November 2015 for management of a raised INR. During the admission she developed sudden onset left-sided weakness and altered levels of consciousness, as well as rigidity and one isolated temperature spike. The concern was raised that she may be or might have been suffering from neuroleptic malignant syndrome and her neuroleptics were stopped as a precaution (Table ). She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the MMUH in Dublin with a suspicion of neuroleptic malignant syndrome or encephalopathy. Computed tomography (CT) brain imaging was normal at the time. As neuroleptic malignant syndrome was suspected, olanzapine was stopped. However, her creatinine kinase levels were normal as was her body temperature. Hence, neuroleptic malignant syndrome was deemed to be unlikely. An electroencephalogram during admission showed changes suspicious of encephalopathy and MRI imaging showed no acute abnormality. A working diagnosis of metabolic encephalopathy was established but extensive investigations yielded no cause for the encephalopathy.\nDue to prolonged altered levels of consciousness and unexplained altered mental state, the Liaison Psychiatry service was consulted in January 2016.\nOn examination, she responded with a mouthed single word greeting, but made no other attempt at verbal interactions. She inconsistently followed the examiner with her gaze, but stared out of the window for most of the examination. On physical examination she presented with waxy resistance to passive movement and psychomotor retardation. The impression was that these features were most likely related to a catatonic exacerbation of her bipolar affective disorder, in the absence of an organic explanation. She was diagnosed",

    "original_text": "We discuss the case of a 46-year-old female who presented with a history of a recurrent lump in her right breast with no known comorbid conditions. Three years prior to the presentation, the patient had been examined at another healthcare facility for the presence of a tumor in the right breast. The physicians at this facility had performed breast conservation surgery to excise the tumor. However, the patient had experienced a subsequent recurrence. A core biopsy had been then performed, but the histopathology had turned out negative for an underlying malignancy. A modified radical mastectomy (MRM) had been then performed for her recurrent tumor, divulging positive margins on biopsy.\nThereafter, the patient presented to us with a residual mass in the right breast (Figure ).\nA core needle biopsy of the mass was subsequently performed; the histopathology report revealed a herringbone and short fascicular pattern with the cells appearing to be spindle-shaped with eosinophilic cytoplasm demonstrating vesicular to hyperchromatic nuclei and the presence of inconspicuous nucleoli. The immunohistochemical analysis further divulged the absence of cytokeratin markers and p63 and the presence of desmin. These findings are delineated in Table .\nThese immunohistochemical findings insinuated a final diagnosis of a spindle cell sarcoma. Owing to the extensive scarring from the previously performed MRM, the feasible option for treatment was a wide local excision along with an LD flap reconstruction surgery. The flap reconstruction surgery was planned in order to cover up the large wound postoperatively. However, the patient refused the surgery, citing her financial constraints. Instead, a wide local excision with a negative margin resection was performed, allowing the excision of the major/minor pectoralis muscle and exposing the ribs beneath. Interestingly, no flap construction surgery was performed. A postoperative image on the sixth day of the surgery revealed the presence of granulation tissue at the base, facilitating the healing of the wound by secondary intention despite a surgical operation with deep margins (Figure ).\nThe patient continues to do well",

She did not have any other complaints.\nA review of her antenatal records revealed that she had sought medical attention at her local clinic for lower abdominal pain at eight weeks and four days and once again at 14 weeks and two days of gestation. Both episodes of lower abdominal pain were managed conservatively.\nThroughout the pregnancy the patient continued to experience on and off abdominal pain which became better as the pregnancy progressed.\nShe denied any per vaginal bleeding during her pregnancy.\nOf note, the patient said that her mother had developed hypertension when she was pregnant.\nThe results of her serologic tests for human immunodeficiency virus as well as rapid plasma reagin were negative at the antenatal clinic. Her hemoglobin concentration at 22 weeks of pregnancy was 10.7g/dL. Methyldopa and nifedipine were commenced for pregnancy-induced hypertension from 22 weeks of gestation. During antenatal care visits at 26 weeks and three days, 30 weeks and three days, 34 weeks and four days, and 37 weeks and three days she was normotensive. At 38 weeks and four days her blood pressure was 150/100mmHg.\nThe patient had an ultrasound scan done at 33 weeks and three days at a local clinic which showed a single viable breech intrauterine pregnancy with a left lateral upper segment placenta, slightly reduced liquor volume and some small free fluid in the hepatorenal area. The estimated gestational age by scan was 34 weeks and two days. From the time of this ultrasound scan, the presentation by clinical examination which had previously been documented as cephalic was then documented as breech.\nBesides the on and off abdominal pain, her pregnancy had been uneventful until she developed periumbilical pain prompting her to present to our unit.",
