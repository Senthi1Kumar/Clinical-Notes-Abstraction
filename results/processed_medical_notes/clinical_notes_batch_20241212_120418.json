    "original_text": "The patient is a 50 year old male who received a LURT 8 years prior to presentation. He had previously undergone bilateral native nephrectomies 2 months prior to transplant for PKD. His early course was complicated by biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection, vascular type, 5 days after transplant, which was effectively treated with anti-thymocyte globulin and intravenous immunoglobulin. He subsequently went on to enjoy excellent graft function. Initially, he was maintained on standard triple immunosuppression with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and prednisone.\nTwo years prior to presentation, he developed numerous squamous cell carcinomas of the skin treated with resection and radiation. One of these lesions was an invasive poorly differentiated SCC (Bowen\u2019s type) of the left auricle, requiring auriculectomy and reconstruction. Tumor margins were negative. His immunosuppression was reduced by stopping his MMF.\nOne year prior to presentation he developed a parotid mass found to be SCC by fine needle aspiration. It was felt that this was a metastatic lesion from the auricular tumor. At this time, he was switched from a dual immunosuppressive regimen of tacrolimus and prednisone to sirolimus (SRL) and prednisone. He underwent a left parotidectomy and neck dissection with pathology showing invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated. The tumor was 4.6 cm with lymphovascular and perineural invasion. Surgical margins were negative, but 5 out of 23 periparotid and cervical LNs were positive for metastasis with focal extranodal extension. He underwent radiation therapy and cetuximab. A surveillance PET CT performed 6 months after treatment revealed 5 bilateral pulmonary nodules, which grew over 2 months from 6 mm to 10 mm.

In November 2011 she was admitted to her local hospital because of hepatic decompensation with ascites and endoscopic finding of grade III esophageal varices at high risk of bleeding. She was referred to our Unit in order to confirm the suspicion of HCC. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) of focal liver lesions was consistent with the diagnosis of multifocal HCC. A biopsy specimen obtained from the major nodule showed HCC (Edmondson grade II). Due to the detection on Doppler US of a high flow arteroportal fistula within the major HCC lesion, she underwent percutaneous transcatheter endovascular embolization. Control endoscopy showed grade I-II esophageal varices. Since the patient was considered not eligible for endovascular treatment of HCC, but had a good liver function (Child-Pugh class A), treatment with sorafenib was started in December 2011.

    "original_text": "A 21-year-old Swiss woman with a radiological-controlled bilateral straight leg axis presented at our department after 10 years of non-operative treatment of an OD lesion at the medial femoral condyle of her left knee. Her main complaints were an intermittent blocking of her knee joint and discomfort during and after arduous activities. A MRI revealed an OD lesion grade III according to Bruns []. The cartilage surface at the OD site was intact on MR images (see Fig. ). After thoughtful case evaluation and discussion with the patient we considered that conservative management was no longer effective and indicated surgery.\nThe operative therapy consisted of an initial arthroscopy. The cartilage layer at the OD location was intact. Yet, under probe testing it was unstable and could be partially detached from the subchondral bone. We did not consider retrograde drilling which can be indicated in grade III lesions. We then continued with a mini-open arthrotomy of her left knee and detachment of the OD lesion (1 \u00d7 2 cm), which presented with healthy appearing cartilage but necrotic bone, leaving a medial hinge. This was followed by debridement of the subchondral bone until all necrotic bone was removed using a motorized burr, deep drilling (1.2 mm drill) into the subchondral bone/medial condyle (\u201cvitality drilling\u201d), implantation of a cancellous bone graft, relocation of the cartilaginous OD fragment and refixation with two 2.0 mm (24 mm in length) titan screws. The quality of the surrounding cartilage was good and without lesions. The border to the origin of the posterior cruciate ligament was intact with good containment. The OD fragment was fixed in a stable manner. She was free of pain 6 months postoperatively.

He was found by his niece sitting in the bathroom batting away imaginary flies and crying, stating that he could not remember anything which prompted his niece to call emergency medical services (EMS).\nThe patient was emotionally labile and could not remember his name or address at the time of presentation. He was hyperverbal and difficult to interrupt, and his speech was disorganized. The patient stated that prior to admission, he left his home and suddenly could not remember how he got to the location he had traveled to. He then returned home and entered the bathroom to look for a belt to hang himself with, because he could not remember any of the evening's events. He stated that he felt lonely and helpless and that he had suicidal thoughts. The patient stated that his sleep had been poor. He endorsed a perceptual disturbance of seeing fleas that were trying to infest his body. He also endorsed an auditory hallucination of a male voice calling his name. Collateral information from his niece, who called the EMS, revealed that the patient had been acting bizarre with two previous episodes of new-onset wandering behavior in the past six months, both associated with heavy alcohol use. She also reported that the patient had a 15-year history of schizophrenia and that he had had similar episodes in the past, which were usually brief and resolved without the need for hospitalization. During a similar episode three years ago, the patient began attacking his family members and was hospitalized after the police were called.

When presented in clinics, the paresthesia had disappeared, but he still could not move his left ankle. The sensory exam was normal, as were his deep tendon reflexes (DTR), superficial reflexes, and pathologic reflexes. In the neurologic exam, he was alert and oriented, and his cranial exam responses were intact. Previously, he had undergone surgery for a varicose vein in his right leg ten years ago and endoscopic surgery for a gastric adenoma three years ago. He did not have a history of peripheral neuropathy or systemic diseases, such as hypertension or diabetes. A lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a ruptured disc, which was compressing the nerve root on the left side of L4/5, and degenerative spondylosis in L5/S1 (). The electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction study (NCS) showed decreased amplitude and prolonged latency in the left peroneal and tibial compound muscle action potential and normal sensory findings. This means that there was lumbar radiculopathy in L4/5 (). The brain CT and plexus MR did not show any specific findings. With several days of daily rehabilitation physiotherapy, his lower back pain partially improved, while his motor power was not recovered. A follow-up NCS and EMG did not show any changes. Surgery for decompression and fusion in the lumbar spine was performed. After the surgery, the weakness still did not change. At postoperative day 8, the deep tendon reflex was increased on the left ankle and ankle clonus was noticed. The whole spine MRI and brain MRI were immediately executed, and they revealed a small area of restricted infarction in the right parietal cortex with anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stenosis on the left side (). For a detailed stroke investigation, electrocardiography and echocardiography were performed, and the results showed no specific problems.",

Adjuvant radiation was performed to the axilla at the time, but the patient was not deemed suitable for adjuvant immunotherapy because of a past medical history which was significant for dilated cardiomyopathy after previous viral myocarditis.

He was an ex-smoker of 20 years with a 30 pack-year history and drank 8 units of alcohol/week. He had a ECOG of 1 and was still active and in full time employment.\nIn November 2019, the patient was referred to our tertiary centre for work-up of a suspected pancreatic cancer as his CT showed an irregularity in the tail of the pancreas. An endoscopic ultrasound was done to obtain tissue which returned as pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The patient's case was discussed at the Hepatobiliary Multidisciplinary Team meeting, and it was decided that a Positron Emission Technology (PET) scan should be performed given the previous diagnosis of melanoma. The PET scan showed a 2.1-cm mass with a SUV max of 5.64 at junction of pancreatic body and tail, but no other significant uptake was seen. The decision was made for surgery. Given a significant amount of inflammation around the pancreas during laparotomy, the surgeons performed a distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and partial colectomy.

Collaterally she initially presented to the emergency department (ED) in July of 2014 as a stroke notification. At that time, she was found to have an acute bilateral ischemic cerebrovascular accident with hyperleukocytosis of 200 x 109/L, anemia and thrombocytopenia. At that time of hospitalization, she was also found to have acute myocardial infarction and deep venous thrombosis of the left popliteal vein for which she was treated with dual anti-platelet therapy and full dose anticoagulation. Due to altered mental status in setting of multiple acute pathologies she was intubated for airway protection and admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further management. She underwent a total of four weekly cycles of hydroxyurea and rituximab which she tolerated well. Subsequently, she was placed on hydroxyurea. After initial rituximab, she had further treatments for maintenance. By December 2016, it was determined that she was in remission and thus was discontinued on all CLL treatments and recommended to continue clinic follow-up every three to six months. WBC after remission was noted to be less than 10 x 109/L. Home medications consisted of enalapril, sitagliptin, metformin, insulin glargine, atorvastatin and folic acid.\nIn October 2018, two years after initial ED visit, she presented with a chief complaint of itchy rash on her upper and lower extremities.

The patient was asymptomatic on his original presentation but subsequently developed nausea and vomiting along with right lower quadrant abdominal pain in the following days resulting in admission to the general surgery service for treatment of appendicitis. The patient did not have any contributory family, drug, or psychosocial history.\nOn chart review, the patient had an extensive past oncological history dating back to 2014 after resection of an enlarging, exophytic, ulcerating chest mass on the right side just lateral to the midline. Pathology from the wide local excision of this mass demonstrated estrogen receptor (ER) positive, progesterone receptor (PR) positive, and HER2/neu negative metastatic adenocarcinoma with an unknown primary source at the time. He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy to rule out a primary gastrointestinal malignancy, however, both were normal. He was followed closely by medical oncology and treated with tamoxifen for hormone therapy. Due to an enlarged anterior mediastinal wall lymph node discovered on routine CT surveillance in May of 2017, the patient underwent CT-guided biopsy and positron emission tomography (PET). The biopsy was negative for malignancy, however, the PET demonstrated abnormal, hypermetabolic activity within a retrosternal nodule, intense activity in a mixed focus in the manubrium, and several hypermetabolic nodes within the mediastinum. It also showed an abnormal hypermetabolic focus in the cecum suspicious for a colon primary (, ).

On initial examination, pupils were equal, round, and reactive bilaterally with no afferent pupillary defect; however, a right afferent pupillary defect was noted on subsequent examinations. A decreased red reflex was noted in the right eye. Slit lamp examination of the right eye revealed a posterior lenticular membrane with a small area of blood adherent to the lens capsule.

Twenty months ago, he suffered a midshaft open fracture (type IIIA) of the left tibia in a traffic accident. So, he underwent an open reduction and external fixation with Illizarov, which was removed after completion of bone union. Physical examination revealed no direct tenderness, swelling, and neurovascular deficit. Range of motion of the knee joint was normal (range, 0\u00b0 to 135\u00b0). On the knee stress test, the patient showed posterior drawer grade III instability, and there was no posterolateral rotary instability. The quadriceps active test and posterior sagging test were positive.\nPCL reconstruction was performed under the final diagnosis of chronic rupture of the PCL. The femoral tunnel was created under arthroscopic guidance with the patient lying in supine position. We passed a guide wire through the tunnel for the passage of the graft tendon. Then, the operating table was tilted to the left side and the knee was externally rotated to partially expose the popliteal fossa.

She experienced swelling and discomfort in her left lower extremity 3 days ago. She was not able to walk easily and could not be relieved after rest, then she was transferred to our hospital for further treatment. Computed tomography indicated deep venous thrombosis in the left lower extremity and significant stenosis of the left common iliac vein and compression by right iliac artery. May-Thurner syndrome with deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed (Fig. a). The patient had a varicose vein in the left lower extremity for more than 10 years and had a great saphenous vein high ligation and exfoliation at the referring local hospital 10 days ago. and she had no personal or family history of hypercoagulable disorder, The D-dimer was 8.3 mg/L on admission.\nThe patient received enoxaparin sodium (6000 AXa IU every 12 h) for anticoagulant therapy immediately. We performed lower extremity angiography for the patient. The delay between the thrombotic event and the procedure was 9 days. A filter was placed in the inferior vena cava. Then urokinase (1 million u/day) was pumped. The venography after 2 days showed that the residual amount of thrombus decreased significantly. Three days later, venography showed that the stenosis in left common iliac vein was exposed clearly. Then a 12 mm*40 mm XXL balloon was used for expanding the stenosis two times, but the stenosis in left common iliac vein recurred due to elastic retraction (Fig. e). So, stent implantation was decided and two 14 mm*60 mm and 12 mm*60 mm stents were placed in the left iliac vein (Fig. f-g). The venography showed that the stenosis was completely relieved and the blood flow was unobstructed. The filter was taken out and the angiography showed that the inferior vena cava had smooth blood circulation. The CT showed that the stenosis of iliac vein was relieved",

She had been experiencing symptoms of vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and abdominal and lower back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis demonstrated a complex adnexal mass and computed tomography (CT) imaging studies demonstrated a lesion in the upper lobe of the left lung, and an adenoma of the left adrenal gland. Transvaginal ultrasonography confirmed a multilocular mass (6.0 \u00d7 5.0 \u00d7 5.6 cm) centered in the right adnexal region.

    "original_text": "A 56-year-old woman presented in February 2013 with a large breast mass that exhibited skin changes and had significantly increased in size over the past 4 months. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension, high cholesterol, and arthritis of the right knee. Her past surgical history revealed a hysterectomy at age 42 and two cesarean section deliveries. There was no family history of breast cancer. Menarche was at age 9 and she was a gravida 6, para 4.\nOn physical examination, our patient was a well-developed, well-nourished female with an obvious right breast mass. At the time of presentation the mass measured 18 cm in greatest dimension. The skin was bright blue, although still viable, and was stretched over the mass such that it was difficult to distinguish the nipple from other areas of skin. At the time of surgery, her nipple-areolar complex became grossly necrotic (). No axillary, mediastinal, or clavicular lymphadenopathy was appreciated and the contralateral breast was grossly normal.\nUltrasound examination of the right breast revealed a large, lobulated solid mass that was hypoechoic and involved the entire central right breast.

His initial abdominal ultrasonography had reported renal ectopia with both kidneys located in the left iliac fossa.

Routine laboratory studies did not document any abnormalities (i.e., blood urea nitrogen: 9 mg/dL, creatinine: 0.95 mg/dL, normal serum electrolyte concentrations, normal urinalysis). A repeated renal ultrasound documented two ectopic kidneys located superiorly and inferiorly in the same anatomic location. Renal dimensions and parenchymal thicknesses of the superiorly and the inferiorly situated kidneys were 115 \u00d7 36 \u00d7 33/11 mm and 116 \u00d7 59 \u00d7 53/21 mm, respectively.

Accordingly, in search of a renovascular etiology of hypertension, renal Doppler ultrasonography was performed.

The patient was a known case of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis with five relapses. After her last relapse, she has received oral corticosteroids for 6 months.\nOn admission, the patient was drowsy but arousable and responding to verbal commands. She subsequently developed respiratory distress and required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Laboratory evaluation on critical care admission revealed a low white blood cell count, severe pancytopenia, low hemoglobin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin and triglycerides level []. The clotting test revealed hypofibrinogenemia with a normal value of international normalized ratio and activated partial thromboplastin time []. The ultrasound of the abdomen showed mild ascites with hepatosplenomegaly.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain with contrast revealed findings consistent with multiple sclerosis. There was no postcontrast enhancement to suggest activity. No acute ischemic changes and no evidence of hemorrhage seen. There were no MRI findings suggestive of encephalitis.\nBased on the clinical features and laboratory results, a provisional diagnosis of the macrophage activation syndrome was made. Bone marrow aspiration and additional serology tests were performed. In bone marrow aspiration, macrophages showed evidence of hemophagocytosis. Hepatitis (B and C) as well as HIV serology were found to be negative. The CMV, parvovirus, VZV and rubella IgM antibody tests were also negative. Blood and urine cultures were negative at the time of admission and throughout her hospitalization. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biochemistry was normal, and its aerobic culture was negative.

He underwent carotid endarterectomy for left internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis in previous hospital 1-year before, but he experienced left visual disturbance after surgery. Postoperative examinations revealed that the operated CCA was completely occluded. Additional surgery was not performed. His visual disturbance gradually progressed, and he was diagnosed as neovascular glaucoma. None of ophthalmological therapy could improve his symptoms. Neurological examination on admission revealed anisocoria. The size of pupils was 3.5 mm and 5.5 mm in the right and left side, respectively. Light reflex was absent in the left side. Left visual disturbance was severe (20/400 vision). Intraocular pressure was elevated up to 38 mmHg in the left side. No parenchymal lesion was observed on brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, MR angiography demonstrated that the left CCA and left vertebral artery were completely occluded. 123I-IMP single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed an impaired reactivity to acetazolamide in the territory of the left ICA []. On cerebral angiography, the left CCA was occluded at the origin. Left anterior cerebral artery and MCA were opacified via the anterior communicating artery on right carotid angiogram. Left subclavian angiogram showed the development of collateral circulation to the left ICA through the left ECA. Thus, the deep cervical artery extensively supplied collateral blood flow to the distal part of the left occipital artery. The blood flowed to the proximal part of the left ECA with a retrograde fashion, and then to the left ICA via the left ophthalmic artery [].

The right heart was difficult to assess, but the right ventricle appeared markedly enlarged with diffuse trabeculations and hypokinesis. The cardiologist team was concerned for noncompaction of the right ventricle or arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD).

This had been preceded by an episode of sore throat 10 days previously. He was found to be hypertensive with a blood pressure (BP) of 158/104 mmHg and he had marked peripheral oedema. He was not known to be hypertensive and he had no other past medical history. Urine dipstick was positive for 3+ of blood and 4+ of protein. His urinary protein to creatinine ratio (PCR) was elevated at 283. There was a significant increase of his serum creatinine from 108 to 152 \u03bcmol/l. He received three doses of intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg, followed by oral cyclophosphamide 100 mg once daily and prednisolone 60 mg once daily. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and antinuclear antibodies were negative. A renal biopsy was performed which showed diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis with marked IgA staining compatible with Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein nephritis (Figures and ). Over the following few days his serum creatinine increased to 300 \u03bcmol/l, but subsequently returned to 151 \u03bcmol/l. His rash and the other systemic features also resolved. In the absence of any crescents in the renal biopsy, the cyclophosphamide was discontinued and he was discharged home on oral prednisolone 50 mg daily. However, because of severe indigestion despite taking omeprazole 20 mg once daily, the prednisolone was reduced to 30 mg once daily soon after.\nUpon review 2 weeks later the patient's rash had returned and he remained hypertensive with a BP of 145/95 mmHg.

In January 2001, a CT scan revealed a right adrenal mass and multiple left side kidney masses. She underwent left partial nephrectomy and right adrenalectomy. At that time, the surgical pathology showed renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, Fuhrman grade 3/4. The tumors were located in the upper and lower portion of the left kidney. The surgical margin at the upper portion kidney was positive. Right adrenal masses were also excised which revealed adrenal gland with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type. Surgical margin of adrenalectomy was negative. The patient subsequently had repeated left partial nephrectomy performed in 2004, and again in 2007 for tumor recurrences. The pathology revealed metastatic renal cell carcinoma. On January 27, 2010, the patient underwent left kidney radical nephrectomy, which revealed multifocal renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, Fuhrman grade 3/4. The largest tumor nodule was 2.5 cm, with tumor extended focally to renal sinus adipose tissue. Tumor located in 0.1 cm from the nearest soft tissue resection margin. The patient was subsequently started on hemodialysis after surgery. In May 2010, the patient underwent evaluation for possible kidney transplant. During the workup, an ultrasound of the abdomen showed a hypoechoic nodule in the body of the pancreas. A CT scan revealed multiple small enhancing nodules throughout the pancreas, best seen on arteriography, which suspicious for metastatic disease of the pancreas (Figure ). On September 20 2010, the patient underwent distal pancreatectomy. Histologically, the tumor consisted of cells arranged in trabecular and alveolar structures with clear or eosinophilic granular cytoplasm, compatible with a metastatic RCC, clear cell type, involving pancreatic parenchyma (Figure ).

The weakness initially affected his right leg, with subsequent progression to his left leg. He then noted 'muscle twitching'. There had been no preceding illness or insect bites. For several months prior to his illness he had been painting his house and reportedly was exposed to mold. Examination showed mild decrease in strength at the hips and knees with a somewhat more pronounced decrease at the ankles and toes, more prominent on the right side than the left. Strength in the arms was preserved. Fasciculations were observed in the arms and legs. Initial sensory exam revealed decreased position in the toes and decreased vibration in the legs. Cerebellar examination was unremarkable. Reflexes were present and symmetrical except for absent Achilles' reflexes. He was unable to stand from sitting without using his arms for support, nor able to walk unassisted. Electrodiagnostic studies (initial; see below) revealed findings consistent with a polyneuropathy, possibly multifocal. Laboratory testing (see below) did not reveal a cause for the patient's difficulties. An elevated protein in the cerebrospinal fluid was thought consistent with an acquired neuropathy. He was given a presumptive diagnosis of a chronic acquired demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and received a course of intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg over four days) without symptomatic relief.
