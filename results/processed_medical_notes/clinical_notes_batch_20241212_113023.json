He chewed betel quid for twenty years but quit seven years ago.\nOn physical examination, his neck was soft and non-tender with a mobile 2-cm node at the left submandibular region. Intraoral assessment confirmed a tongue with full range of motion and a 3 \u00d7 3 cm exophytic ulcerative lesion of the left buccal mucosa with no bony invasion (). The CT neck demonstrated hyperdensity along the left buccal mucosa ridge measuring 2.3 \u00d7 1.9 \u00d7 2.3 cm as well as a centrally necrotic ipsilateral lymph node at level 1B (). The CT chest was unremarkable and the CTA of lower extremities showed severe peripheral vascular disease. The histological study of the incisional biopsy revealed invasive keratinizing moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, the case was examined by the institutional tumor board and classified as a cT4aN1M0. Based on findings, the tumor board recommended surgery as primary treatment. Accordingly, three-dimensional (3D) printed models, a pre-bent reconstruction plate and surgical cutting guides for the mandible resection were obtained prior to the procedure.\nThe surgery began with a standardized tracheostomy. Because an 8-cm skin defect at the left cheek was planned as part of the oncological resection, the surgery continued with the elevation of a cervicothoracic rotation flap. We utilized a medially based skin flap. The incision was made from the margin of the cheek skin resection (near to the left commissure) toward the tragus.

Eight weeks of physical therapy did not relieve his pain. Physical exam revealed no knee effusions, no ligamentous instability, and full range of motion. The McMurray test on the left knee resulted in pain along the medial joint line and a popping sensation. Left knee MRI revealed a large posterior horn medial meniscus with intrasubstance signal in the posterior horn likely representing degeneration (). MRI of the right knee revealed an increased signal in the posterior horn with an enlarged medial meniscus. Due to the MRI findings and persistent symptoms, arthroscopic treatment was recommended.\nThe patient underwent arthroscopic repair of the left medial meniscus without complications. A small peripheral tear in the superior surface of the medial meniscus allowed access to the intrasubstance degeneration (). The tear was repaired with two all-inside meniscal repair devices (Figures and ). Its meniscocapsular attachments were normal. The patient was discharged in good condition on crutches with partial weight bearing. He returned to full sports contact after 4\u20136 months of physical therapy.\nA 16-year-old male, the above patient's brother, who is a professional dancer presented with 2 days of worsening right knee pain. He was treated for patellofemoral syndrome with three months of physical therapy. Audible sounds on flexion and extension of the knee were heard and full extension of the right knee was not possible. Physical exam revealed a large effusion. MRI of the right knee revealed a bucket-handle medial meniscus tear ().

    "original_text": "The patient is a 56-year-old Caucasian male who has been an inpatient at a state psychiatric hospital for the past 18 years. The patient has been residing at various state-run psychiatric hospitals for past 33 years. He was diagnosed with a schizoaffective disorder in 1976 at the age of 15. His symptoms include auditory hallucinations, loose association, disorganized thought process, rapid speech, and self-injurious behavior. He has had a history of psychogenic polydipsia for the past five years. He demonstrated symptoms of repeated compulsive fluid intake, resisted restriction of fluid intake, and required restriction of movement outside the unit depending upon the severity of polydipsia or water intoxication. Also, weight gain was evaluated in terms of normalized diurnal weight gain (NDWG), which is the percentage increase in weight from morning to evening. During episodes of polydipsia, no sign of severe water intoxication, such as confusion, delirium, seizures, or coma, were observed. His vital signs were stable with each episode. The patient was given trials of ACE inhibitors and second generation antipsychotics like clozapine, but these were discontinued due to ineffectiveness and undesirable side effects. These included significant incidence of agranulocytosis and orthostatic hypotension with clozapine [] and electrolyte disturbances with ACE inhibitors. Therefore, another pharmacological strategy was warranted. The decision was made to initiate a therapy of acetazolamide. Informed consent was obtained from both the patient and his guardian before starting medication. Fluid restriction had been the key treatment of PPD; however, this did not resolve the polydipsia, and often the treatment was time-consuming and difficult. There is evidence that both the conditions, psychogenic polydipsia and water intoxication, are resistant to several pharmacological treatments.

Her father was 167 cm in height; he began to develop at the age of 14 and had his first spermatorrhea at 18 years. Her mother was 157 cm in height, and her menarche began at the age of 12 years. Both parents stated no history of other hereditary and infectious diseases.\nThe patient was delivered via cesarean section, no postpartum asphyxia or hypoxia and no abnormal Apgar score. Her birth weight and length were 3.3 kg and 48 cm, respectively. She had normal teething, and mental and physical development before the age of 6 in line with her healthy peers. At the age of 6 years, she showed a slow growth rate, growing approximately 1\u20132 cm every year, with a gradual decline in intelligence, understanding, and learning ability. Five years ago, at the age of 10, her bone age was determined to be 8 years. The patient was then diagnosed with \u201cdwarf syndrome\u201d and treated with growth hormone. However, no height growth was obvious, and thus the treatment was terminated after 1\u20132 months.\nUpon physical examination, the patient\u2019s height was 136 cm and the weight was 29 kg, which are both below the third percentile of children of the same age and gender.

The patient was on medication for hypertension and hypothyroidism. She was also diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis 10 years ago and was cured after treatment. The patient had been taking antiplatelet agents for 9 years after intra-arterial stent insertion due to right internal carotid artery stenosis. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed because the patient had a fever of 37.8\u00b0C one week before admission. A negative result was reported. On the second day of admission, a fever of 38\u00b0C or higher was observed; thus, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed but negative results were confirmed. Chest radiography showed no specific findings other than the old pulmonary tuberculosis lesion in the right upper lung. Later, the fever subsided.\nOn the 4th day of admission, chest CT showed no specific findings except for the multifocal post-infectious old lesions in the right lung, and there was no change compared to the previous chest CT (). Therefore, on the 5th day of admission, an excisional biopsy of the right femur was performed. Considering that the possibility of COVID-19 infection was excluded, the patient was transferred to a room different from the previous one after the excisional biopsy was performed. After the biopsy, a fever of 37.5\u00b0C or higher was noted and the C-reactive protein was elevated.

Standard chest X-ray showed a left lung perihilar lesion, probably suggesting pneumonia. As a consequence, the patient started a broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy without resolution of her symptoms. Thus, after 2 weeks, chest X-ray was repeated and showed persistence and stability of the left lung lesion. About 1 month later, the patient came for the first time to our attention for appearance of vomiting, dyspnea, fatigue and abdominal pain (visual analog scale 7). Abdominal physical examination revealed a painful hepatomegaly. She underwent a total body computed tomography (CT) scan that showed multiple focal liver lesions, solid left lung tissue and multiple secondary brain lesions (two left frontal cerebral lesions, one right parietal lesion and two cerebellar lesions) (fig. ). As a result, a liver biopsy was performed. Since all investigated tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, carbohydrate antigen 125, neuron-specific enolase, glycoprotein hormones alpha polypeptide) were increased, it was not possible to identify the primary site of localization of the tumor and to reach a definitive diagnosis. Given the rapidly progressive impairment of her clinical conditions and performance status, we administered an empirically not targeted chemotherapy with gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 die 1 and oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 die 2 q 2 weeks although we did not yet have definitive histopathological results. About 1 week later, the results were provided. Although the sample was poor, the diagnosis was evocative of lung adenocarcinoma (TTF-1 positive, cytokeratin 7 positive). However, since a further deterioration of her clinical condition was observed, a biopsy was repeated in order to have an additional sample for molecular analysis. This second histological report was diagnostic for LCNEC of the lung. Tumor cellularity showed focal TTF-1 and diffuse synaptophysin positivity (",

The orthopedic examination revealed lameness in the lower right hind limb and a bony thickening at the level of the metatarsophalangeal joint between the II and III digit phalanges, covered with normal skin. The complete blood count, serum chemical and electrolyte analyses were within normal limits, apart from elevated levels of calcium and phosphorus, which were attributed to the young age (5 month) of the animal (Table ). The dog underwent a radiographic examination. Two well-defined lesions within the right II and IV phalanges of the right pelvic limb were found (Fig. a), in the shape of well circumscribed, mineralized new bone formation with a trabecular pattern. The dog underwent surgery to remove the lesion on the II phalange, and the excised tissue was sent for a histopathological examination. This revealed well-differentiated bone tissue, hyaline cartilage, and fibrous tissue in addition to hematopoietic tissue and connective tissue. Based on the histopathological findings, multiple cartilaginous exostoses (ostechondromatosis) were diagnosed. In the 1 month follow-up examination, the dog showed progressive ataxia of hind limb, a stiff gait and hyperesthesia in the thoracolumbar vertebral column. Radiographs of the hips and vertebral column exposed similar lesions to those in the pelvic limb. They were located in the distal part of the femur, on the tail and on the thoracic spinous processes of the lumbar vertebral bodies (Fig. b, c) and on the ribs (Fig. b).\nAt the age of 8 months, the dog was presented to the Wroc\u0142aw University of Environmental and Life Sciences at the Department of Internal Medicine with Clinic of Horses, Dogs and Cats for neurological assessment.

Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction, 63%) and no regional wall motion abnormalities. Anesthesia induction and maintenance were performed as usual, and routine cardiac anesthesia monitoring was conducted. The mitral valve replacement was a 27-mm St. Jude Medical valve prosthesis (St. Jude Medical, Saint Paul, MN, USA), and the Maze operation proceeded well under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Myocardial protection was performed via an infusion of cold cardioplegia via the aortic root cannula. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography showed no paravalvular leakage. Immediately after an aortic cross clamp, the cardiac activity was converted to normal sinus rhythm but returned to atrial fibrillation after a few minutes.

She had been feeling unwell for the previous two days and had put her symptoms down to a common cold. She had a background of hoarse voice for more than a year for which she never sought medical attention. On arrival to the department she was found to be stridulous and in respiratory distress. She received immediate airway management in the A&E with one millilitre of Adrenaline mixed with four millilitres of normal saline nebulised and 200 milligrams of Hydrocortisone intravenously.

    "original_text": "We present here the case of a 58-year-old postmenopausal Caucasian woman with metastatic malignant melanoma of unknown origin of the right breast. The patient came to our emergency department in December 2014 after noticing a lump in her right breast. Upon physical examination, a well-circumscribed mass of 2 cm was confirmed in the lower external quadrant with no skin involvement and no enlarged lymph nodes. A thorough examination of the skin revealed no other lesion. The patient had no previous history of malignant melanoma or of removal of suspect skin lesion.\nThe mammography and sonography examinations showed an oval 16 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 13 mm, well-delimited hypervascular mass, parallel to the skin (Fig. ). Our patient underwent sonographically guided core biopsies. The microscopic examination showed a poorly differentiated tumor with medium to large cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and pleomorphic nuclei. The immunohistochemistry evaluation was negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors, as well as for E-cadherin and HER-2. It was positive for protein S-100 and vimentin, therefore compatible with the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. The KI-67 was 100%.\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a 3 cm lesion with no cutaneous or pectoral infiltration (Fig. ) and a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan showed a hypermetabolic mammary mass with a homolateral metastatic axillary adenopathy.\nThe case was presented to the multidisciplinary tumor board of our referent tertiary center. It was decided to repeat the biopsies in order to confirm the diagnosis. Thus, our patient underwent a second biopsy of the breast lesion and of the axillary adenopathy (5 February 2015) seen on the PET-CT scan.

She had a past medical history of dengue fever 5 years ago but no other significant comorbidities. She had no calf tenderness or swelling and no family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or history of previous VTE. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus rhythm and no features suggestive of pulmonary embolism.\nInitial investigations included a full blood panel with inflammatory markers (all within normal range) and a plain chest radiograph which demonstrated a mass in the right upper zone (). Computer tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) scan demonstrated an 8 x 6.5 cm soft-tissue lesion within the right upper lobe (). This mass appeared to extend from the right hilum to the pleural surface and contained multiple small arterial branches. Her delivery date was brought forward pending further investigations. Positron emission tomography CT (PET-CT) demonstrated this lesion to be intensely fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avid ().\nBlood serology demonstrated raised immunoglobulin E (IgE) titres. Investigations for tuberculosis were proven negative, and the patient had a positive radioallergosorbent test (RAST) for Aspergillus fumigatus.

At the end of the second stage of labor which had lasted for 2 hours, the patient began to cough; she also complained of shortness of breath and pain over the chest and the neck regions.\nPhysical examination revealed conscious patient; the blood pressure was 120/90 mmHg, pulse was 96/min, and the oxygen saturation was 98% on 3 L/min of oxygen. The patient had mild dyspnea with breath rate of 24 cycles/minutes. No edema was present and the patient was afebrile; the cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal.\nPalpation showed crepitus underneath the skin of the anterior neck and bilateral subclavian regions consistent with subcutaneous emphysema. The patient had not undergone any radiological examination due to the imminent delivery and the stability of the respiratory function. She received oxygen by facial mask and remained stable. 15 minutes later, the labor ended with a vaginal delivery requiring an episiotomy. The patient delivered a healthy, live infant with Apgar score of 10/10 in the first and fifth minute. One hour later, the cripitations extended to the upper anterior chest wall and to the face including the eyelids without any deterioration in respiratory status. A chest X-ray showed pneumomediastinum with subcutaneous emphysema extending to the soft tissue of the axillary region. Computed tomography (Figures and ) confirmed pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema extending to the thoracic, cervical, and abdominal regions. It showed also a minimal pneumothorax.

Since she was a high-risk and an elderly patient, we decided to perform EVAR. The anatomical conditions of the aneurysm were complex, including a short proximal neck (length: 13 mm), narrow terminal aorta (diameter: 15 mm) showing calcification, and severe calcification of the access route. She underwent EVAR using the Zenith\u00ae endovascular graft (Zenith: Cook Medical, IN, USA). Postoperative CT imaging revealed narrowing of the left leg of the stent, poor dilatation of the junction of its right leg, and signs suggestive of type III endoleak (junction leakage) and type I endoleak from the proximal neck. We performed retouchup of the proximal neck with a noncompliant balloon and kissing touchup for the narrow areas and junction; the improvement in the narrowing of the leg and resolution of endoleak were then confirmed by CT. The aneurysm diameter decreased to 41 mm within 1 year. However, after 18 months, she was admitted to our hospital with appetite loss and back pain. Blood tests indicated a hemoglobin level of 6.8 g/dL and a serum creatinine level of 2.46 mg/dL. Plain CT imaging indicated the enlargement of the aneurysm and the presence of a massive retroperitoneal hematoma. Considering these findings, dissection of the aorta at the pararenal site was suspected, and endovascular reintervention was considered impossible under the prevalent conditions. Laparotomy was believed to be a high-risk procedure for the patient, primarily due to her age, and the patient and her family refused further surgical treatment.

Because of the failure of conservative treatment, the patient had undergone five separate debridement and direct closure operations in the previous hospital, which all failed to heal the wound.

The groin defect was approximately 3 cm\u00d75 cm (), with continuous lymph leakage, requiring the dressing to be changed approximately seven times per day.

She presented to our department because of gradual difficulty in raising her left arm and worsening pain. Physical examination on presentation did not reveal any swelling or feeling of heat in the left shoulder. The range of motion of the left shoulder showed extremely severe restriction; namely, flexion 80\u00b0, abduction 60\u00b0, and external rotation 0\u00b0, and prominent impingement symptoms were found. On plain radiographs and computed tomography (CT), prominent shoulder arthropathic changes and numerous calcified lesions around the joint were found. On plain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), around the shoulder an irregular hypointense region was identified in the center on T1-enhanced images and on T2-enhanced images (). Routine blood examinations did not reveal any obvious abnormalities. This patient was diagnosed with synovial osteochondromatosis associated with a massive tear of the rotator cuff and shoulder arthropathic changes, for which the treatment RSA was chosen.\nIntraoperative findings: A delto-pectoral approach was used. Full-thickness tears of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons were found. When the joint capsule was incised, synovial proliferation and a whitish mass-like lesion, seemingly adherent to the synovium, were found. The intraarticular mass was resected to the extent possible, but the cartilage in the humeral head was severely damaged, while that in the glenoid cavity had almost disappeared. After loose body resection, RSA was performed.\nThe postoperative course was uneventful, with the left shoulder pain disappearing from early in the postoperative period. At one year postoperatively, there was no recurrence of pain and the left shoulder range of motion showed improvement to flexion 140\u00b0, abduction 130\u00b0, and external rotation 30\u00b0.

Bacterial cultures of the fluid were negative and its analysis revealed the presence of glucose (86 gm/dL), proteins (2,8 gm/dL), LDH (5045,00 UI/dL), and white blood cells (1280/mm3) with 90% PMN, suggestive of lymph fluid.\nThe first therapy was a compression bandage and leg rest, which resulted in no success. Therefore, a VAC therapy with continuous 75 mm Hg pressure was used for seven weeks. No wound closure was observed after that time and a persistent lymphocutaneous fistula was developed. Hence, a magnetic resonance lymphangiography (MRL) was performed. On the MRL images, the deep system remained unharmed, but two major lymphatic vessels of the superficial system were found to be directly afferent to the wound dehiscence ().\nRegarding the MRL results, a microsurgical lymphatic venous derivation was planned. Indocyanine green was used intraoperatively to identify lymphatic vessels, by performing an intradermal injection into the dorsal aspect of the four interdigital webs of the ipsilateral foot. During intraoperative exploration, no fluorescence was noted after the indocyanine green injection, probably due to the competence of the deep system. In contrast, two red lines corresponding clinically to a lymphangitis were observed on the skin along the anterior aspect of the leg, from the dorsum of the foot up to the knee wound. According to the MRL coordinates, these lines were the two major afferents lymphatic vessels. Secondarily, a new attempt with an injection of methylene blue in the dorsal aspect of the",

The clinical features of the patient at baseline were summarized in Table . The patient had a history of tubal ligation and denied asbestos exposure.\nFifteen years ago, the patient was diagnosed with a uterine myoma, which was about 8 cm in diameter. Instead of undergoing surgery, she opted for regular check-ups. One month ago, she developed abdominal pain and ultrasonography showed a 12 \u00d7 11.4 \u00d7 9.8 cm heterogeneous mass behind the uterus, with a cystic dark area of 3.4 \u00d7 2.3 cm (Fig. ). Ultrasound suspected as degeneration of uterine myoma. A further CT examination also considered it as a myoma fatty degeneration (Fig. ). Therefore, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy.\nIntraoperative observations were described as below: There was a small amount of viscous fluid in the pelvic cavity. The uterus was enlarged to the size of 2 months gestation. There was a mass about 12 cm in diameter behind the uterus with a pedicle attached to the uterus. The mass was multilocular cystic with myxoid fluid. The surface of the left ovary was dotted with minute neoplasms. No obvious metastatic lesions were observed elsewhere.\nThe mass was removed and a quick-freezing examination was performed. The results indicated that it was a mesenchymal tumor and adenomatoid tumor was possible. We treated her with a total hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy. The final pathology of paraffin confirmed it as localized well-differentiated benign mesothelioma (Fig. A). The results of immunohistochemistry showed that the 3 molecules Calretinin, D2\u201340, CK were positive, while p53, EMA were negative (Table ).

There were no recent gastrointestinal events, skin diseases or pressure sores.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan on admission demonstrated avascular necrosis of the left hip joint with joint destruction and many fluid collections in the soft tissue around the joint. Blood tests showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 20 210 \u00b5l\u2212\n1, and a C-reactive protein level of 29.5 mg dl\u2212\n1. Synovial fluid tapping revealed a WBC count of 80 000 \u00b5l\u2212\n1. Synovial fluid cultures and blood cultures were sent for analysis.\nSeptic arthritis of the left hip joint was diagnosed and the patient was treated with antibiotics including metronidazole and underwent surgical drainages of the hip. After initial surgical drainage, the patient developed multiple organ failure including cardiovascular instability, decreased urine output and acute respiratory failure due to septic shock and was admitted to our general intensive care unit (GICU). During the next 4 days in the intensive care unit, the patient continued to be septic with elevated temperatures (39.2 \u00b0C) and continuous leukocytosis (20 000 \u00b5l\u2212\n1). During this period, intensive supportive management included the administration of vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics.\nOn a detailed workup of sepsis, multiple bloods, sputum, wound and stool cultures were obtained. Diagnosis of septic arthritis was confirmed by a positive synovial fluid for .

Initial physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 126/81 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 20 per minute, and pulse rate of 103 per minute. On auscultation, heart sounds were tachycardiac and no murmur was heard. Examination of the lungs did not show significant pathological findings. The electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia and inverted T wave on the anterior and inferior lead. Except for a plasma D-dimer level over 5,000 ng/mL (upper normal limit: 500 ng/mL), other laboratory findings were normal. Initial arterial oxygen pressure was 73 mm Hg, arterial carbon dioxide pressure 29 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 94% at room air. Pulmonary computed tomography showed multiple filling defects of segmental branches of pulmonary arteries (). With the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism, intravenous heparin was started. In recalled previous history, he denied any predisposing conditions like as airplane travel or deep vein thrombosis.\nTransthoracic echocardiography (TTE) found wormlike, free-floating masses in the both atria (). The right ventricle was moderately dilated () and mild tricuspid regurgitation was seen. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure was 80 mm Hg, and the inferior vena cava was dilated.

She was suspected to have invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IAP) and was placed on oral voriconazole (400 mg bid).
