Laparoscopic right nephrectomy was performed using the transperitoneal approach to identify pathologically clear cell carcinomas, pT3, G2 > G3, INFb, and v+.\nA small high absorption area in the lower pole of the left kidney was observed on CT 7 years after surgery, followed by imaging inspection for 2 years after surgery (Fig. ). However, MRI revealed an increasing mass of 24 mm in diameter, which was presumed to be RCC requiring treatment intervention. His serum creatinine level gradually increased to approximately 2 mg/dL. Therefore, stereotactic irradiation with 70 Gy in 10 fractions was selected for the renal mass to minimize renal damage. Unfortunately, after irradiation, his serum creatinine gradually increased to 9 mg/dL, and HD was induced, although the left renal mass continued to shrink.\nSoon after induction of HD, a 15-mm renal mass in the upper pole of the left kidney (Fig. ) and a single mass in the right lung were revealed by CT (Fig. ). Stereotactic irradiation with 70 Gy in 10 fractions was applied to the mass of the upper pole of the left kidney, and 60 Gy in 8 fractions was applied to the mass of the right lung. The irradiated lesions were stable, without growth.\nA soft tissue mass with destruction was noted on the right scapula by CT scan 2 years after the last irradiation; this was diagnosed as a bone metastasis of RCC by positron emission tomography-CT (Fig. , ). Systemic treatment was deemed necessary. The IMDC risk with only 1 factor of lower Hb (12.6 g/dL) represented an intermediate risk.",

    "original_text": "A 38-year-old woman with a medical history of type I diabetes mellitus and SPS initially presented to inpatient rehabilitation with intractable and painful muscle spasms due to SPS. The diagnosis of SPS was confirmed by elevated anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody levels (>250 IU/mL). Her symptoms were episodic in nature and triggered by light palpation along the lower limbs. Emotional distress also worsened symptoms. Episodes would last up to 8 h per day. Examination was notable for severe and painful muscle flexor spasms, which were clonic and diffuse. The spasms were particularly notable in her left lower limb with corresponding left ankle inversion, and right upper limb with elbow flexion and forearm supination. The patient underwent serial up-titration of oral baclofen up to 15 mg 3 times a day and diazepam up to 20 mg every 6 h, with concurrent IVIG cycles, with only transient symptom control. Her symptoms made her non-ambulatory and limited her tolerance to using a wheelchair for mobility. She also required moderate-to-maximum assistance for bed mobility, transfers and lower limb dressing. The patient was subsequently referred to the spasticity clinic to be assessed for ITB therapy.

The patient reported a recent minor fall with direct injury to the anterior side of the knee, and later complained of persistent pain and noise arising from the knee while rising from a chair and climbing stairs. Walking on a level surface was uncomfortable with pain on both medial and lateral sides of the knee. Clinical examination showed no evident wasting of the quadriceps muscle, likely due to considerable obesity. Physical examination showed moderate valgus malalignment of both knees. No restriction of movement was observed with 0 to 130 degrees of flexion; however, a typical metal-on-metal grinding sound was heard from the anterior knee compartment during flexion and extension of the knee. There was significant tenderness on both medial and lateral femorotibial joint lines. Radiographs showed a displaced polyethylene liner of the patella with moderate femorotibial osteoarthritis ().

The swelling, which had worsened over the course of 15 years, was not painful. The patient however experienced discomfort while eating and talking. A detailed examination revealed the presence of a smooth, elastic, soft, circular, and pedunculated tumor-like lesion, with a diameter of approximately 40 mm, on the right buccal mucosa. This resulted in swelling of the right cheek without any facial nerve palsy ().

We took a panoramic X-ray photo, there were few teeth, and occlusion was collapsed. A light shadow that appeared to be a tumor is found under the residual root of the right maxilla. The panoramic photo did not show jaw bone resorption (). An oval-shaped neoplastic lesion with a well-defined border of 40 mm \u00d7 20 mm was noted on MRI. The lesion was located between the epithelium and smooth muscle of the buccal mucosa. Both T1- and T2-weighted images showed high signal intensity (). Fat suppression and diffusion-weighted images showed low signal intensity. The lesion was surrounded by tissue with low signal intensity on the T2-weighted image. The tumor is growing and pushing the buccal muscle and fascia without destroying normal surrounding structures. A malignant tumor is negative from the findings of MRI, and for the long course, it was determined that the lesion was a benign lipoma. The tumor was resected under local anesthesia, and a biopsy was submitted for microscopic examination. The pedunculated tumor was excised with an electric knife, and the wound was sutured.

In the same night, pollakisuria and dysuria occurred, and the patient noted a permanently painful foreign body sensation in the areas of the prostate and anus, as well as perineally. Furthermore, he complained of a burning sensation in the urethra, a slightly reduced urinary stream, and nocturia of varying frequency. In addition to the ongoing chronic pain, the patient suffered from week- to month-long episodes of increased pain with no discernible trigger. Overall, the pain and other symptoms progressed over time.\nOver the years, various specialist urological examinations were carried out and several attempts at treatment with various empirical antibiotic therapies and analgesics were made. Also, nerve stimulation therapy was applied, and a probatory surgical removal of both seminal vesicles and an extension surgery on the anus were performed. None of these measures resulted in any improvement in pain or other symptoms. The patient was then referred to us by the urologists for a probatory pain treatment with LA.\nAt the first consultation with us the patient was in a particularly severe pain phase. He complained of permanent pain and discomfort perineally and in the areas of the prostate, anus, and urethra, associated with pollakisuria, dysuria, and nocturia (more than ten times per night).

At the age of 5, there was no obvious cause for his movement retrogression, which involved an abnormal gait, uncoordinated gait, swinging, easy wriggling and poor physical strength compared to his peers. His bilateral shoulder joints were asymmetrical, and his right shoulder was lower. He was observed to have scoliosis and scapular winging. The proximal muscle strength of his upper limbs was grade 4, his distal muscle strength was normal, and his muscle tension was slightly high. Muscular atrophy was mainly seen in the shoulder, back, and proximal extremities, his bilateral knee tendon reflexes were weakened, and his bilateral achilles tendon reflexes were not evident.\nHis creatine kinase was 666.7 U/L (normal range 50\u2013250 U/L). His cranial MRI was normal, and the MRI of his thigh muscles showed bilateral lateral femoral, rectus femoris, and left semimembranosus, and the long head of the biceps femoris was significantly atrophied. His audiovisual evoked potential was normal. Electromyography showed that the motor unit potentials of the quadriceps femoris on both sides were low and that the time limit was narrow. There was a moderate denervation potential, which showed pathological interference when contracting vigorously: the right deltoid and biceps had normal motor unit potentials. The scope and time limit were narrow, a small amount of denervation potential was seen, but recruitment was complete when contracting vigorously: The bilateral gastrocnemius muscles were normal.

The mass was first identified by the patient three years prior and had an insidious onset that continued to increase in size. The patient's primary care physician ordered an X-ray of the pelvis to evaluate the patient's left iliac mass.\nThe patient denied any preceding unintentional weight loss, whole body aches, fatigue, and night sweats over that time span. Past medical history is complicated by insomnia secondary to his history of depression and anxiety. There was no history of trauma to the area. The patient reported the mass as nontender to direct palpation but complained he occasionally hit the mass against objects during everyday activity which results in subjective pain and tenderness. He also complained that the mass catches on his clothing and makes wearing a belt difficult. He denies any neurologic changes or deficit. He has no family history of bone tumor, M.H.E., and osteochondromas.\nOn examination, there was a nontender hard mass and area of swelling (approximately 4 cm by 3 cm measure by ruler) located posterosuperior to the left anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) of the iliac wing. Direct palpation of the mass demonstrated that it was fixed to the underlying bone while the skin was free and mobile over the mass.

The histopathologic features include polymorph nuclear leucocytes and atypical histocytes with oval nucleus with pale granular cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical staining with CD1a (cluster of differentiation 1 a) and S100 were positive. Chemotherapy including vinblastine and prednisone was initiated. During follow-up, pneumothorax persisted and another chest tube was inserted on the left side. Since the patient was unresponsive to medical treatment 2 weeks after admission, chemical pleurodesis with talc (2 cc) was performed. The pleurodesis was performed through tube thoracostomy. No intrapleural analgesics were used. The tube was clamped for 1 hour and unclamped at the end of procedure. During the clamped period, patients recommended to rotate on each side for 10 minutes. At the end of 10 days follow-up, patient developed bilateral pneumothorax with subcutaneous emphysema despite tube thoracostomy. Thoracoscopic bullae excision with pleural decortication was performed 10 days after talc pleurodesis (\n).

The cause of the abscess was unknown, but a private surgeon incised it at multiple sites and drained the content. The patient was supposed to take care of the wound dressings herself, but she and her family were overwhelmed by the copious amount of odorous exudate and needed professional wound care. After three weeks of irrigating the wound with saline and using regular gauzes, the patient presented to the wound clinic for help. At the first visitation (a, Day 0), the patient had a low-grade fever, was not feeling well with nausea and dizziness, and had severe pain on the whole back (score of 8 out of 10 on a visual analog scale []). She stated that she is depressed, anxious, and stressed, afraid of losing her life. The abscess covers the area of the whole trapezius and part of the latissimus dorsi on the left side of the trunk and upper part of the right trapezius, and wounds are subcutaneously connected. Infection and inflammation were present with a heavy odorous purulent exudate. The tissue was necrotic with the presence of slough and some granulation visible at the base of the wound after irrigation with the edges of the wound rolled and indented. Because of the severity of the infection, a swab was taken to identify the bacterial origin of the infection.\nIrrigation of the wound was performed with a saline solution via a tube adapted to a syringe.

    "original_text": "A 28-year-old man visited us with the chief complaint of a markedly protruding forehead. The patient wished for a surgical correction because he often experienced awkward social interactions (). Radiologically, the forehead was seen to have protrusion and extension with hyperpneumatization of the frontal sinus (). Prior to the operation, the patient had a frontal slope of 19\u00b0, confirming the need for surgical correction in this case ().\nA bilateral coronal incision was made following the general design. The dissection was performed up to and including the supraorbital crest and the periosteum of the external supraorbital margin on both sides. The periosteum was incised 2 cm superior to the supraorbital margin. As a result, the dissection included the medial side of the supraorbital margin. After an interoperative skull anteroposterior X-ray was used to determine the extent of frontal sinus, a landmark was denoted with a pencil. The frontal sinus was entered at the landmark using an electrical burr. The anterior wall of the frontal sinus was removed using a craniotome; the posterior wall and nasofrontal canal were remained untouched. The excised anterior wall was spread completely with a bone bender, and re-arranged using a titanium mesh plate.

After the crash, she complained of severe pain and deformity of her left forearm. She never had any previous trauma. Her past medical and familial history were not remarkable.\nThe primary survey revealed a stable hemodynamically. We found an obvious deformity in the left forearm during the physical examination with swelling and limited range of motion due to pain. There was a multiple pinpoint wound at the anterior side of her left elbow and also at the lateral side of her left forearm. The initial clinical photograph is depicted in Figure .\nThe plain radiograph examination showed a displaced fracture of the left proximal third ulna, accompanied by a displaced fracture of the proximal radius (Fig. ).\nBased on the physical and radiograph examination, this type of fracture is similar to the Monteggia fracture type III except for proximal radial disruption that occurs laterally through a Salter-Harris type II fracture rather than a radial epiphysis dislocation. In our case, the radial epiphysis remained.\nAfter the accident, the patient immediately underwent surgical debridement. The multiple open wounds were irrigated with large amounts of sterile saline. After the surgical debridement, the forearm was immobilized using a backslap in a supine position and elbow flexion 90o.\nThe definitive treatment has been done 5 days later. We performed open reduction and internal fixation of both fractures. The ulna was reduced and stabilized first using a 3.5 mm one-third tubular plate (ORMED).

His comorbidities include hypertension managed with oral antihypertensive drugs and diabetes mellitus type 2. He has no significant allergies and never underwent any surgical procedure. He brings an ultrasound, which shows a 4 cm heterogenous mass in segment 8. His alfafetoprotein level is elevated to 76 ng/mL. He has no symptoms and looks in good performance status. We scheduled him for a triphasic CT scan, which shows a lesion of 4.3 cm with brisk arterial contrast and venous washout. According to the LIRADS classification, this lesion could be considered a class 5 with diagnostic features of hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient was discussed in our multidisciplinary tumor board including hepatobiliary and transplant surgeons, hepatologists, radiologists, pathologists, oncologists, and interventional radiologists. The plan was to submit the patient to curative intent treatments given his early presentation according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging System (BCLC), namely surgical resection or liver transplantation; radiofrequency ablation was excluded given the tumor\u2019s dimensions. Given the good performance status, the position of the lesion (which was right below the Glissonian capsule) and the liver function of the patients, the MDT decided to schedule the patient for surgery. We therefore saw the patient in clinic and discussed the procedure. Informed consent was signed, and liver function was tested using ICG retention rate. We used 0.5 mg/Kg corresponding to 40 mg in this 80 kg patient.

Echocardiogram found a prolapsed posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with massive regurgitation, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 68% and a normal sized left ventricle. The patient denied of similar symptoms in her past history.\nTherefore, she was preliminarily diagnosed of acute left heart failure caused by mitral regurgitation and scheduled for valve repair surgery. Routine coronary angiography was performed to exclude coexisting coronary artery disease. However, the left main coronary trunk could not be catheterized. Meanwhile, collateral vessels could be seen flowing from right coronary artery (RCA) to fill the left coronary system (Fig. ). The patient was then suspected of left main coronary atresia or complete occlusion. She received CT coronary angiography for further diagnosis, which confirmed absence of left coronary ostium, with abnormally small LAD and left circumflex arteries (LCX), both filled by collateral vessels arising from RCA.\nDuring operation, the patient's mitral chordae of the posterior leaflet was found ruptured, with dysplasia of papillary muscle (Fig. ). Then, a successful mitral valvuloplasty was first performed. Although with worry that the small caliber left coronary system may not be a suitable target for surgical revascularization, we performed CABG with left internal mammary artery anastomosed to proximal LAD anyway",

The patient began to have chest tightness and breathing shortness after general physical activity 1 year ago and coughing (dry coughs mainly) 2 months ago. A small amount of white sputum was noted after a severe cough, which was heavy at night and light in the daytime. The patient was diagnosed with \u201csevere aortic stenosis\u201d using color Doppler echocardiography at several hospitals, and was admitted to the aforementioned hospital with \u201csevere aortic stenosis (bicuspid deformity) and left ventricular outflow tract stenosis,\u201d which was confirmed using transthoracic echocardiography. The patient had a history of hypertension for 10 years and usually took antihypertensive drugs to control blood pressure. The physical examination revealed a clear respiratory sound of bilateral lungs without rhonchus and moist rales and a systolic 3/6 grade murmur in the third intercostals of the left border of sternum. The liver was not enlarged and had no swelling in both lower extremities. The laboratory examination of brain natriuretic peptide was normal. Transthoracic echocardiography showed asymmetric hypertrophy of the left ventricle with a maximum thickness of 20 mm, the diameter of the left ventricular outflow tract of 13 mm, and the anterior flow velocity of the aortic valve of 4.3 m/s. Cardiac MRI revealed myocardial hypertrophy, left ventricular outflow tract stenosis, aortic stenosis, and bicuspid deformity (Fig. ), indicating the requirement of aortic valve replacement and left ventricular outflow tract dredging.[ Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (Fig. ) showed aortic stenosis and left ventricular outflow tract stenosis.

She was brought by ambulance to our emergency department. On physical exam, her injuries were closed, her arm and forearm compartments were soft, and she was neurovascularly intact. Radiographs of the humerus, forearm, and wrist demonstrated a left distal third humeral shaft fracture () as well as a left Galeazzi fracture, with a midshaft radius fracture and disruption of the distal radioulnar joint (Figures and ). She was placed in a well-padded long arm posterior plaster splint extending from the posterior shoulder to the fingers, with an additional coaptation component to the splint to stabilize the humerus fracture.\nWithin 24 hours of admission, the patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation of both her humeral shaft and radial shaft fractures. The decision was made to reduce and fix the humeral shaft first. The humeral shaft fracture was amenable to reduction and fixation with an extraarticular locking plate through a posterior approach with the patient in the lateral decubitus position. Because of the manipulation of the forearm, which may be required during reduction and plating of the humerus, we chose to avoid fixation of the radius and the possible transfixion of the distal radioulnar joint until after the operation on the humeral shaft was completed.\nThe surgery was performed under general anesthesia. The patient was positioned on a radiolucent table in the lateral decubitus position with the left arm which was supported over a foam roller.

    "original_text": "A 37-year-old woman was referred to the cardiac electrophysiology service for management of paroxysmal AF. Her past medical history was significant for a remote cholecystectomy. Cardiovascular and respiratory examination did not reveal any abnormal finding. A pulmonary vein isolation ablation was attempted, but an extremely thick inter-atrial septum precluded transseptal puncture and access to the left atrium. The patient\u2019s AF was managed with propafenone in the interim.\nTransthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiogram revealed a clot-like mass lining almost the entire left atrium, extending into the left atrial appendage (). A second opinion from a specialist in echocardiography concluded that the differential diagnoses included thrombus, fat, or tumour, and recommended a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) for further characterization. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed a sheet-like mass adherent to the septal side of the left atrial cavity, measuring 4.7 \u00d7 1.3 cm (). The mass is isointense to myocardium on pre-contrast T1 imaging, mildly hyperintense to myocardium on the T2-weighted sequence and hyperintense on Short-T1 Inversion Recovery (). Based on the signal characteristics and enhancement, although the elongated sessile appearance was noted to be atypical, the conclusion was that the mass was most in keeping with an atrial myxoma. The patient underwent open cardiac surgery and excision of the atrial mass ().

There were no intraoperative complications, and initially the patient did well after surgery. The patient reported that she had a history of osteopenia in the lumbar spine as well as lower back discomfort preoperatively. Lower back pain is a common presenting symptom in cases of pelvic organ prolapse. The lower back pain gradually increased after surgery with an acute exacerbation four months postoperatively leading to an evaluation by her urogynecologist and then neurosurgical consultation. The pain was exacerbated with movement and bending. The patient denied any fever, vaginal bleeding, radicular pain, or abdominal pain. She did have a small amount of clear vaginal discharge. Other surgical history included an appendectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and prior vaginal bladder suspension for prolapse in 2006. A detailed physical exam found a small area of exposed mesh fibers at the vaginal apex. There was no evidence of meningismus, spinal tenderness to palpation, or motor or sensory deficit. Laboratory studies for ESR and CRP were elevated at 65 and 0.62, respectively.

    "original_text": "Case 2: Ms. M was a 64-year-old woman whose medical history was significant for several visits to different doctors seeking treatment for somatic complaints, including progressive blindness, headaches, hypertension, pelvic pain, vaginal swelling, lower extremity pain, and swelling. She was brought into the ER from her primary care doctor\u2019s office for complaints of pelvic and leg swelling, which she attributed to poor diet. She expressed great concern over her problems being persistently ignored at all ERs she had been to.\nMs. M was found hiding in the closet of a primary care doctor\u2019s office early in the morning before it was open for business. Apparently, she saw the janitor approaching and got scared. When the police were able to get into the closet, they discovered a knife, a pair of scissors, and a child's toy phone (which she had been using to call her doctor) in her possession. She revealed that she had gone to the office out of exasperation because she believed that no doctors were listening to her concerns.\nShe informed the team of the inpatient psychiatric unit about her history of hypertension and migraine headaches. All radiological imaging was negative for structural problems. She became increasingly irritable and accused the treatment team of not having her best interests in mind.

Her hip pain and limping gait were started about 2 years ago and 5 months ago, respectively. She had no special trauma history and discomfort on her hip joint until two years ago. She had no prior operation history on left hip joint. Body mass index was 23.8 kg/m2 and bone mineral density was \u20130.59.\nPlain radiographs on pelvis including anteroposterior and frog leg lateral view were taken initially (). Lateral center edge angle, acetabular inclination, and femoral head extrusion index were 5\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 41.6% respectively. It also demonstrated the joint space narrowing compare to the right side. She was diagnosed with a secondary osteoarthritis as a consequence of hip dysplasia.\nSince the use of pain killer for several months was not helpful for her pain, the patient wanted a surgical treatment, so was elected to undergo total hip arthroplasty. During the operation, the patient was placed in right lateral decubitus position and the surgical approach was posterolateral. After skin incision, gluteus maximus was split as a usual manner. After cutting the short external rotator and the joint capsule, the joint was dislocated and neck was cut. There was no muscle attached at the tip of the greater trochanter (). Fatty change of gluteus medius and minimus and tensor fascia latae were detected on preoperative computed tomography scan (). During the posterolateral approach, one can see the bulk gluteus medius at the tip of the greater trochanter. The operation was carried out and all trial implants were inserted in the acetabulum and femur.

Upon examination, the patient was conscious without chills and other discomfort, and the incision was severely swollen and filled with hemorrhagic content. Analgesic therapy was given, but the patient did not feel pain relief. Early on the second morning, the patient started to become irritable and apathetic and the incision was inflamed. The following afternoon, at approximately 3 p.m., the patient felt increasing pain out of proportion to the physical findings accompanied by progressive swelling, numbness, and weakness of the limb. The skin around the wound was darkened, and tension blisters were visible (Fig. ). The patient was delirious on the third morning after surgery, the systemic skin turned yellow, and there was a large amount of dark red, bloody discharge drainage from the incision with bubbles of gas, and a foul, sweetish, unpleasant odor was smelled in the incision. A physical examination revealed subcutaneous crepitus extending along the length of the limb, roentgenograms revealed the accumulation of gas in soft tissue (Fig. ), the lower limb skin temperature decreased, the dorsal artery of the foot could not be touched, and the patient had no response to pain in the lower extremities.

In the past, the patient had no allergic reactions after ingestion of several nuts, such as peanuts, almonds, and walnuts. She had no history of atopy, thyroid disease, or hepatitis. There was no family history of allergic diseases. She also did not have a pet at home.\nThe first episode of allergy onset was after ingestion of several dried seeds, including sunflower seeds, 2 years ago. The patient complained of moderate allergic reaction with symptoms of dyspnea and oropharyngeal pruritus within about 5 min of eating the dried seeds. She visited the emergency department and regressed on administration of antihistamine and corticosteroids. The second episode occurred 5 months after the first event. The patient presented a moderate degree of allergic reactions, such as acute urticaria, oropharyngeal pruritus, and dyspnea, after eating only sunflower seeds. Twenty minutes after taking an antihistamine, she recovered from the allergic symptoms. The third episode with severe anaphylaxis occurred 13 months after the second event. The patient complained of abdominal pain, urticaria, and lost consciousness within a few minutes of accidentally consuming a salad and a smoothie that included sunflower seeds at dinner. No cofactors were associated. She was admitted to the emergency department, and her blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) were 85/60 mmHg, 104 bpm, and 95%, respectively.
