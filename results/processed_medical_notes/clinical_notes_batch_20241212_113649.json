She had hypertension (treated with \u03b2-blockers) as a cardiovascular risk factor. She was diagnosed with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with liver metastases one month previously. The patient was not considered for surgical resection, she was scheduled for chemotherapy, and, consequently, no antineoplastic treatment had been initiated yet. Prophylactic anticoagulation was not indicated On clinical examination, her blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg with a pulse of 100 beats per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and normal heart sounds. The 12-lead electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 102 beats for minutes and ST-segment elevation in all leads except aVR where ST-segment depression was noted (Figure ). Her laboratory test results revealed a baseline troponin T level of 1212 ng/ml (normal range < 26 ng/ml). Also, the echocardiography findings revealed akinetic walls from the mid to apical septum and anterior and inferior walls. The ejection fraction was estimated to be 39%. Therapy was started with clopidogrel, aspirin, and low-molecular-weight heparin. The patient underwent a coronary angiogram from the right radial approach, which revealed the presence of an extended thrombus in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), and another thrombus was found in the second segment of the right coronary artery (RCA) with thrombolysis in myocardial ischemia (TIMI) III flow and without any atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary artery tree (Figure and Figure ), therefore, balloon angioplasty and/or stent placement was not considered. The patient was taken to the coronary care unit (CCU) and tirofiban infusion was administered for a period of 48 hours. In view of persistent breathlessness, pulmonary embolism was suspected. There were no symptoms or clinical signs suggestive of deep venous thrombosis. A computed tomographic pulmonary angiography was performed and showed a distal pulmonary embolism (Figure ).

    "original_text": "A 50-year-old woman positive for hepatitis B virus underwent a right hemihepatectomy extended to a medial part of Couinaud segment IV for HCC in May 2000. The initial tumor was mainly located in Couinaud segment V and was 10 cm in diameter with capsule invasion. Histologically, it was moderately differentiated HCC with thick trabecular pattern with microscopic vascular invasion. In January 2001, partial resection of the medial segment was performed due to recurrence in the form of intrahepatic metastasis. During a period of 8 years after second surgery, no recurrence sign was detected by 5-year regular imaging follow-up at our hospital. In December 2008, the patient consulted a home doctor for chest discomfort and then was recommended to our hospital again for the purpose of general examination. The serum value of alpha-phetoprotein (AFP) increased to 248369 ng/mL (normal rage; <20 ng/mL). Computed tomography (CT) revealed a heterogenous mass, 9 \u00d7 7 cm in diameter, in the remnant liver (). The mass had expanded to the adjacent organs, inferior vena cava (IVC) () and the pericardium (), indicating a diagnosis of intrahepatic recurrence from HCC. Angiography revealed that the remnant liver was supplied by left hepatic artery with no tumor stain (). Because selective angiograms showed a hypervascular tumor supplied from the descending branch of the inferior phrenic artery (IPA) () and the phrenic branch of the internal mammary artery (IMA) (), transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) was selected first. However, TAE could not relieve her chief complaint, and after evaluation that there were no other distant metastases, complete surgical resection was planned on January 2009.

On intraoral examination, there was a smooth firm bulge of the soft palate and left lateral pharyngeal wall, occluded the oropharynx. Posterior nasal examination showed the extension of the swelling into the nasopharynx.\nMagnetic resonance imaging showed large lobulated well-defined homogenously hypointense lesion on T1 WI and hyper intense lesion on T2 and STIR WI in the left para-pharyngeal space extending from the skull base to the hyoid bone. Medially, it was bulging in the nasopharynx and the oropharynx, significantly compromising the airways ().\nThe deep lobe of the left side parotid gland was not separately identified from the lesion, and it was abutting the neurovascular bundle of the parotid gland from the inner aspect.\nAfter obtaining the patient\u2019s informed consent, surgery was planned to approach the deeper lobe of parotid gland and para-pharyngeal mass by transparotid, transmandibular swing approach in order to achieve radical excision of the mass.

At this time, he underwent MRI, which was used to compare the discrete extension of the signal alteration areas, especially the subinsular regions. In March 2015, he resumed chemotherapy with TMZ at a dose of 100 mg/day and the patient then lost 12 kg of body weight, which was associated with anorexia, insomnia, and depression. In May 2015, he suffered a seizure requiring hospitalization. In June 2015, the patient resumed the old chemotherapy regimen with TMZ (2,000 mg every 28 days for 5 days), and a follow-up with MRI; however, the tumor size continued to increase. In January 2016, the neuro-oncology team decided to discontinue treatment with TMZ considering the risk/benefit and planned a surgical re-approach. This was followed by chemoradiation and lasting 6 cycles of PCV associated with CBD. The CBD dosage was ranging from 300 to 450 mg/day.\nDuring chemoradiation, the patient had an excellent clinical performance, practiced sports and had few symptoms of fatigue and/or nausea.\nAt 1 month after the end of chemoradiation, control MRI (Figure ) was characterized by exacerbation and the ultra-precocious phenomenon of PSD with increased edema and inflammatory disease characterized by extensive areas of contrast enhancement associated with tissue hypoperfusion",

On further questioning, he admitted to eating a large amount of fried, unshelled sunflower seeds the day before the symptoms started. He had a colonoscopy ten years ago which revealed a tortuous colon but no polyps or diverticulosis. There was no history of colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease in the family. On presentation, vital signs were within normal limits. The abdominal exam revealed decreased bowel sounds, tenderness in the periumbilical area and right lower quadrant, no rebound tenderness was noted, and McBurney's sign was negative. All laboratory investigations, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and lipase, were within normal limits. A CT of the abdomen was pertinent for a transition zone in the terminal ileum with wall thickening, fat stranding, and dilation of the bowel proximal to the transition zone (Figure ). These findings were indicative of small bowel obstruction secondary to possible distal ileitis. The patient was managed conservatively with intravenous fluids and was kept nil per os.\nThe next morning, the patient had two large volume bowel movements, after which his abdominal pain significantly improved.

She had a history of fibromatosis, but no previous history of trauma, operation or inflammation in this region. On physical examination, a 5-cm large pulsatile swelling with blowing bruit was found over the left cervical region and multiple fibromas were found in regions of face, neck, and trunk. Neurological examination revealed muscular strength of grade IV according to the \u2018manual muscle test (MMT)' grading system and hypoesthesia of right limbs, including touch and pain sensation. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) and DSA revealed a left high-flow internal carotid-jugular fistula at the first cervical level and twisted left internal carotid artery (ICA) (Figures ). Blood flow from the vertebrobasilar artery and right ICA via the circle of Willis supplied the left anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery and drained backwards into the petrosal segment of left ICA (Figures ).\nWe chose embolization of both the fistula and parental artery, because no appropriate covered stent could be used to pack the fistula in the condition of reservation of left ICA. The purpose of first endovascular treatment was to isolate the fistula, by blocking both the backward blood flow from right ICA and the forward blood flow from left ICA. A Headway-21 stent catheter was selectively inserted into the distal part of fistula in the segment of carotid cavernous sinus, meanwhile an Echelon-10 microcatheter was placed in the distal part of stent catheter.

She reported no weight loss and she denied the use of tobacco or excessive alcohol consumption. She had a history of skin atopy, reporting sensitivity to wool, and a history of an episode of anaphylactic reaction of unknown cause 2 years previously.\nPhysical examination of the neck was normal. Indirect laryngoscopy and endoscopy with a flexible endoscope revealed a smooth, red-yellow, cystic formation localized in the left hemilarynx between the false vocal cord and the aryepiglottic fold. Chest X-ray was normal. A tracheal computed tomography (CT) scan in 5 mm sections confirmed the existence of the mass (Figure ). The thyroid cartilage appeared intact and no nodal involvement was detected.\nWe proceeded to perform microlaryngoscopy under general anaesthesia and removal of the mass (measuring 4 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 2 cm) using a CO2 laser. Pathological examination revealed a mass with a smooth surface. On macroscopic inspection the cut sections were yellow-grey and solid with a soft and elastic consistency. On microscopy, it was not clear whether its structure was bundled or micronodular, consisting of bundles of woven eosinophilic tissue, with sparse fibroblastic cells, several small vessels and rare atrophic glandular regions. There were also a few collections of lymphocytes and granulocytes. Staining with Congo red stain, under polarized light, revealed blue-green birefringence throughout the mass due to the presence of amyloid. No signs of malignancy were seen.\nFurther examinations were done to rule out systemic amyloidosis.

Treatment with an antidepressant (duloxetine) was started. The patient experienced no improvement and a second examination by another neurologist was undertaken 2 months later. Again no focal neurological signs could be detected. Due to the weight loss, an occult neoplasm was suspected but not detected during an extensive inpatient investigation at a medical department during February 2012; however, the MRI showed bilateral white matter lesions (WML) and an old lacunar lesion located at the left striatum, the latter was not seen in the previous MRI from May 2011. Since the patient also suffered from mild hypertension, vascular encephalopathy was thought to be the cause of the progressive cognitive decline. Extensive neurocognitive testing was carried out in a rehabilitation centre in May 2012 and disclosed a severe decline of attention, memory and executive functions corresponding to subcortical dementia (Fig. ). When the patient was seen for a further diagnostic work-up at the SMZ-Ost-Donauspital in July 2012, the weight was 47\u202fkg and a weight loss of 20\u202fkg was reported over the past year.

He had a history of intermittent fever of mild to moderate grade and dry cough since 4 months. His breathlessness had progressed relatively rapidly over 1 month and now limited his daily activities. He also had associated anorexia and weight loss. He had been treated symptomatically by his local physician and later underwent investigations for the persistence of symptoms. A chest X-ray [] showed a complete white-out of the left lung with ipsilateral mediastinal shift suggesting complete lung collapse. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the thorax showed an endobronchial lesion in the left main bronchus with complete collapse-consolidation of the left lung; it also showed an endobronchial lesion in the right lower lobe []. He underwent a fibreoptic bronchoscopy which confirmed a left main bronchial growth and a right lower lobar bronchial growth and a guided biopsy of these endobronchial lesions [] was done. The histopathology report of the left sided lesion was necrotic tissue and the right sided lesion was reported as a neuroendocrine tumor (carcinoid tumor).\nSubsequent to these investigations, he was transferred to our hospital for increasing the severity of his symptoms. He presented to our hospital in respiratory distress and required endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation. We performed a bronchoscopy which confirmed the outside report and repeated endobronchial biopsies. Review of these and the external biopsies showed a high-grade malignant tumor composed of sheets ofhighly pleomorphic cells containing a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentrically placed hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Few cells showed wreath like/horseshoe-shaped nuclei [].

Medical history was significant only for hypertension. On examination, he was conscious, oriented, and hypotensive (103/55 mm Hg). There was hypogastric tenderness and exposed bone through an open wound near his left elbow. Neurovascular status was preserved in both the upper and lower extremities. There was no damage to the spinal cord elements. Anteroposterior pelvic radiograph revealed pubic diastasis of 4.7 cm and a midline fracture through the sacral body with 1.0 cm of displacement (). A pelvic binder was placed to decrease intrapelvic hemorrhage and repeat plain films demonstrated acceptable closure of his pelvic diastasis (). After binder application and the placement of two large-bore intravenous cannulas administering crystalloid isotonic solution, hemodynamic stability was achieved and the patient was deemed stable a contrast-enhanced computed tomography CT scan revealed hemoperitoneum, 1.3 cm of pubic diastasis, and a complete, midline sacral fracture through the spinal canal and posterior sacral elements extending from S1 to the coccyx (). To rule out urologic injury, a CT cystogram was obtained, which revealed no evidence of bladder or urethral rupture. An urgent irrigation and debridement with surgical fixation of his left open ulnar shaft fracture were performed.

Prior to pregnancy, the patient had regular menstrual periods and cycles lasting 30-32 days on average with a variability of +/- 5 days. Papanicolaou (Pap) smear conducted 5 years prior to pregnancy revealed a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion that was negative for human papillomavirus (HPV). A subsequent Pap smear conducted 2 years prior to pregnancy was negative for abnormality. She denied a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), sexually transmitted infections (STIs), tubo-ovarian abscess, colitis, appendicitis, and endometriosis. Despite not having any chronic medical conditions, being a non-smoker, and having a healthy, active lifestyle, the patient had a history of unexplained infertility for which she underwent an extensive medical workup and multiple treatment modalities.\nThe patient previously used an intrauterine device for contraception, which was removed approximately 4 years prior to this pregnancy. Approximately 2 years prior to the start of pregnancy at her routine gynecologic exam (during which she had her second Pap smear, as noted previously), the patient stated that she was trying to become pregnant. Two weeks prior to this exam, her male partner had an overall normal semen analysis. The patient at this time was provided with prenatal guidance regarding timed intercourse and anticipatory guidance. She was also instructed to take daily prenatal vitamins and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Roughly 4 months after this appointment (at this point 8-9 months of actively trying to become pregnant) the patient sought out additional procreative guidance after unsuccessfully conceiving.

At the time of admission, her Fisher scale was on grade 2 and the Hunt and Hess scale was on grade 1. She had no motor or sensory deficit but had signs of meningeal irritation. There was no history of trauma, hypertension, diabetes, or other disease. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain was conducted immediately and showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (). Thus, the patient was diagnosed with SAH and accepted regular treatment with intravenous mannitol and nimodipine, and the headache was greatly relieved. Seven days after headache symptom onset, the patient underwent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) examination under general anesthesia, and the result showed the presence of an aneurysm of the left PCA at the P1-P2 segments, measuring 4 \u00d7 5 mm with a neck of 1.5 mm (). Then, the patient underwent stent-assisted coil embolization of the aneurysm (). Stent-assisted coil embolization did not cause any neurological complication, and the patient's headache disappeared gradually within days postembolization. One week after coil embolization was conducted, brain CT examination was reperformed, and the result showed no abnormality in brain parenchyma. The patient was discharged and required to continue treatment with oral antiplatelet agents aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day), which started the day after endovascular coiling treatment.\nOne month after endovascular therapy, aspirin, and clopidogrel were abandoned by the patient due to gingival bleeding and skin ecchymosis.

    "original_text": "This is a case of a 74-year-old male presented to our hospital with a one-week history of pain underneath the right jaw before and during meals. A week earlier, he had developed a sudden onset of swelling and pain underneath the right jaw associated with eating and the anticipation of eating. He did not have any constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, and fever. He was seen by the primary care physician. During the physical exam, it was noted that he had developed right submandibular salivary gland enlargement and was referred to an otorhinolaryngologist, who observed a stone at the opening of the salivary gland duct and cervical lymphadenopathy, as well as submandibular gland enlargement, on examination. A clinical diagnosis of sialolithiasis complicated by sialadenitis was made initially. It was presumed that cervical lymphadenopathy was a result of sialadenitis. At that time, imaging was not performed, as there were no symptoms concerning salivary gland tumor or abscess. He was prescribed cephalexin 500 mg twice daily for five days, which he took with some relief of pain. However, three days later, the patient presented to the emergency department with generalized weakness and fatigue. On examination, he was found to have a firm, palpable right submandibular salivary gland and bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, right greater than left.

On July 3, 2018, with no obvious cause for symptoms, her family sent her to the local hospital for treatment. On July 3, 2018, head computed tomography (CT) showed subarachnoid hemorrhage (Fig. ). On July 4, 2018, CT angiography revealed no obvious abnormalities. After she underwent conservative treatment at a local hospital for 5 days, she achieved relief from the headaches. To obtain a diagnosis and further treatment, she visited our hospital. Physical examination revealed a positive meningeal irritation sign and a positive Kernig sign, and the 2 transverse fingers displayed positive cervical rigidity; no other obvious abnormalities were found. There was no history of hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, or other conditions. She denied a history of trauma or surgery. Head digital subtraction angiography (DSA) performed at our hospital on July 8, 2018, showed fenestration at the junction of the middle and upper portions of the basilar artery with an aneurysm; spontaneous pseudoaneurysms could not be excluded, the bilateral posterior communication was obviously open, and the posterior cerebral artery was well developed (Fig. A, B).\nThe patient underwent stent-assisted fenestration and channel occlusion under general anesthesia. An Enterprise stent 4.5 \u00d7 22 mm in size was placed in the normal fenestration malformation channel with the 2 ends of the stent completely covering the openings of the lesion channel. Target 360 NANO (1.5 mm \u00d7 3 cm) and helical (1.5 mm \u00d7 2 cm, 1 mm \u00d7 2 cm) spring coils were placed to fill in the fenestration malformation channel.

There were no other associated cardiac anomalies. Despite normal blood pressure and absence of radiofemoral pulse delay, it was important to exclude associated mild degree of coarctation. 2D echocardiography showed turbulent color flow across the descending aorta, but the maximum pressure gradient recorded by continuous Doppler was 12 mmHg.

It is the institutional protocol to perform a minimally invasive Mckeown procedure with a modifed three-field lymphadenectomy.\nThe computed tomography findings of the anatomical variation had revealed a complete mirror image pattern of the viscera and vasculature in the abdomen and thorax []. It was hence decided that the patient would initially undergo a left thoracoscopic mobilization of the esophagus (Phase 1) in the prone position followed by laparoscopic gastric mobilization of the stomach (Phase 2) and finally a neck anastomosis (Phase 3).\nPatient was placed in the prone position on double-lung ventilation using a single lumen endotracheal tube was the standard approach. Operating surgeon, camera and surgical assistants stood on the left side of the patient with monitor on the right side. Abdominal part of the procedure was done in the supine position with split legs apart.\nAn initial optical trocar (10 mm) was placed, and thoracoscopic inspection of the anatomy was done. A left sided azygos arch was initially noticed arching above the left main bronchus. Mediastinal pleura were opened using monopolor hook in a U and inverted U fashion above and below the azygos vein respectively. The azygos vein was isolated skeletonised and divided in between sutures [].

There were no other complaints such as fever, weight loss, or coughing. He had undergone arthroscopy a year earlier to treat osteoarthritis. A second arthroscopy was performed with synovial tissue biopsy in July 2010; microbiological analysis revealed the presence of M. tuberculosis and acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Antibiogram showed a normal sensitivity pattern. Histopathological assessment revealed granuloma with caseous necrosis, suggesting tuberculosis. Chest radiography revealed bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates with a micronodular pattern. Immunological examination for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was negative. The patient began receiving treatment with anti-tuberculosis drugs as part of a regimen, including rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Pain symptoms initially improved. However, 2 months after starting the treatment, he started experiencing pain and swelling, and developed a fistula in the contralateral knee. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed signs of osteomyelitis in the right femur and tibia (Fig. ), and surgical drainage with bone biopsy suggested tuberculosis. However, there was no microbiological growth in mycobacteria-selective culture medium. After 6 months of treatment, the patient presented with a fistula in his left knee, which was positive for AFB. M. tuberculosis was isolated from a selective medium in a reference laboratory. However, sensitivity tests could not be performed. Once again, immunological assessment and real-time PCR results were negative for HIV. Immunoglobulin values were normal. His therapeutic regimen was subsequently extended. In the eighth month of treatment, the fistula was still observed in his right knee, and the collected material revealed the presence of AFB. MRI revealed the presence of periarticular collection. One year after the initiation of isoniazid/rifampicin treatment, there were no fistulas and findings of MRI suggested improvement. In August 2012, after 24 months of isoniazid/rifampicin treatment, the patient returned to the outpatient clinic presenting with a new fistula",

The pain began approximately two hours before her presentation, and she described it as diffuse and stabbing with a 10/10 severity on the visual analog pain scale. She also indicated the pain was nonradiating, not exacerbated with movements, and associated with nausea and multiple episodes of nonbilious, nonbloody emesis. The patient did not report any history of diabetes, pancreatitis, gallbladder stones, trauma, or autoimmune disorders. At the time, the patient did not report the use of any medications.\nThe patient was alert and cooperative. Her initial vital signs were within reference ranges except for slightly elevated blood pressure (128/86 mmHg) and respiration rate (21 breaths per minute). We noted dry oral mucosa, but no other findings of the physical examination were remarkable. Her initial blood work was remarkable for a minor elevation in aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) and a positive acetaminophen level (Table ).\nTwo hours after the patient\u2019s arrival at the hospital and upon further questioning, she disclosed that the night before her presentation, she ingested 20 pills of Coricidin.

The patient reports no history of trauma. Physical examination reveals that the patient was a febrile. There was no evidence of a rash or wound and weakness or numbness, but the patient did note swelling of the involved extremity. Normal pulse times were noted in all four extremities. Pushing/pulling provoked pain. Of note, the patient reported a recent molar extraction as her only past surgical history. The pain persisted and increased in severity over the course of several months before amagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained. MRI interpretation revealed a large marrow-replacing lesion in the distal femoral shaft with a posterior cortical breach and associated posteromedial soft tissue component ( and ). Subsequent biopsy demonstrated osteomyelitis, and cultures revealed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureusas the offending microorganism. The patient elected to proceed with surgical intervention to ream and irrigate the femur and debride the abscess present in the posteromedial aspect of her Cierny\u2013Mader 3A distal femoral osteomyelitis. Pre-operative antibiotics were held until more cultures were obtained.\nA thorough review of the MRI revealed that the main foci of infection of her distal femur and posteromedial fluid collection were roughly 12 cm proximal to the superior pole of the patella. On measuring 12 cm from the superior pole of the patella to the lateral thigh, a 6-cm longitudinal incision was made. Bovie electrocautery was used throughout the procedure to coagulate superficial vasculature. A longitudinal incision was made in the iliotibial band in line with that of the skin.

He denied any previous episode of melena or hematochezia or bleeding from another site. The patient did not have any other associated symptom, and had no other co-morbidities, or medication use. Upon referral, he was uncomfortable and looked pale. He was vitally unstable, with a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg and a pulse rate of 120 beats/min. The examination revealed the presence of clotted blood on the anal verge, and some tarry stool on digital rectal examination. The hemoglobin level was 7.7 g/dl, the hematocrit was 22.8, and the blood urea nitrogen was 8 mg/dl. The prothrombin time and the partial thromboplastin time were normal.\nResuscitation was performed with transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells and intravenous fluids. He was admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring. After admission and stabilization, upper and lower endoscopies were performed without demonstrating the bleeding site. They only revealed clotted and red blood throughout the colon.\nTechnetium-labeled red blood cell bleeding scan was done to localize the site of bleeding. This scan showed no evidence of early focal increased uptake in the abdomen to indicate active gastrointestinal bleeding during early images, but in the delayed images, it revealed that there was a focal uptake in the right and transverse colon. After that, capsule endoscopy was also performed without findings. As the angiography became available, the patient underwent selective angiography without findings noted at that time.

    "original_text": "A 48-year-old woman was admitted to the Epilepsy Center in July 2005 because of refractory seizures. Seizures began when she was 22 years old, after a bus accident while she was going to work. The bus crashed into a motorcycle, with no loss of awareness. Once outside the bus, she remembered her face was covered with blood and having seen the motorcycle rider being thrown from his motorcycle. After the accident she was admitted at an intensive care unit for a few days and was studied for the THI. During the recovery period it was very difficult for her to walk, and because of continuing lack of sensitivity in both legs she underwent electromyogram (EMG) three months after the accident. The EMG results were normal.\nFour months, from the accident seizures began, were characterized by paroxysmal behavioral and motor episodes with a frequency of two to three seizures in a week. She also had absences (lack of response) and sometimes got lost in the street (compatible with dissociative fugue). She received a diagnosis of posttraumatic epilepsy and was treated with antiepileptic drugs like phenytoin, carbamazepine and diazepam. Despite this medication, seizures continued. At this point she was referred to psychotherapy and a psychiatrist prescribed antidepressants for associated depression. That treatment lasted ten years. Because of lack of response to the treatment (the same seizure frequency), many years later she was referred to our Epilepsy Reference Center.\nAfter evaluation by a neurologist she was admitted at the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit in July 2005 and underwent Video-EEG. Neurologic examination was normal, as were an MRI of the brain, interictal SPECT, and interictal electroencephalogram (EEG).

Major clinical manifestations included lumbago and radiating pain along the femoral nerve distribution with decreased sensation and paresthesia of the left lower extremity. She also had limitation of motion of the lower limb, which was relieved after rest. The patient visited a local hospital in July 2018 and received no definite diagnosis. She was given vitamins and calcium supplementation, but her pain was not alleviated. In August 2018, her pain worsened and swelling also appeared in the left thigh. She visited the Department of Neurology of our hospital on September 6, 2018. Electromyography revealed injury of the left femoral nerve; she received mecobalamin and vitamin B12, but pain failed to improve. The patient had no history of trauma. Her medical history was unremarkable.\nPhysical examination at admission revealed firm, tender mild swelling of the left proximal thigh, with normal overlying skin. Adduction and flexion of the left hip were limited and elicited pain. There were no other remarkable abnormalities. Plain radiographs showed increased density of the greater trochanter of the left femur (Fig. ). CT displayed thickened cortex in the anterior surface of the left proximal femur with specks of calcification and inhomogeneity of the adjacent bone marrow cavity (Fig. ). Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an oval mass in the bone marrow cavity of the proximal femur, which was 5.5 \u00d7 2.1 cm in size and hypointense in the T1-weighted image and hyperintense in the fat-suppressed T2-weighted image.

Following this, a left heart cardiac catheterization was done, displaying a triple-vessel coronary artery disease with 80% occlusion of the mid-right coronary artery, 99% occlusion of the obtuse marginal artery, and diffuse disease of the left anterior descending artery (Figure ) that warranted four coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with a single implanted aortic valve replacement (AVR).

    "original_text": "A-79-year-old male complained of visual hallucination for last 1 year. The visual hallucinations included sentences written on the wall, bright coloured flowers in a garden, unfamiliar people moving around him, and the dead people waving at him. For the last few months, he was specifically seeing a Japanese lady waving at him. He described that the image changes with an eye blink. The visual hallucinations included static and moving objects. The images disappeared on closing eyes. Till 2 months back, visual hallucinations were infrequent and lasted for 1\u20132 min. However, for the last 3 months, the visual hallucinations occurred many times each day and lasted for 15\u201330 min. He was fully aware that these images were unreal. However, due to sleep deprivation and no respite despite resorting to sleeping pills and with the feeling that he was taken to a surreal world through his blindsight, he requested for medical help. There was no history of auditory or tactile hallucination, delusion, forgetfulness, and change in personality, behavioural problems or any involuntary movements.
