The mass had existed for at least six months and was slowly increasing in size. Hypertension, diabetes, hyperuricemia, and hypercholesterolemia were mentioned in the medical history. No previous significant pathology or surgery was reported in the head and neck area. Computed and magnetic tomography, with 1.25 mm thickness cuts in the transverse plane and with image reconstruction cuts of 1.25 and 2.5 mm in coronal and sagittal planes, respectively, revealed a lesion of 1.64 cm \u00d7 4.8 cm in dimensions which occupied the right buccal space, originating from the right major zygomaticus muscle, and extending to the right anterior part of the parotid gland (Figures and ). There was homogeneity in composition with a distinguishable contrast intake in comparison with the healthy side and discrete vessels throughout the circumference of the lesion. The tumor had smooth outlined limits with projections in the anterior area of the right parotid gland and the lateral portion of the masseter muscle. A malignant lesion in the buccal space could not be excluded from the differential diagnosis. However, the characteristics of the lesion were not exactly compatible with typical malignancies of the area, including salivary gland carcinoma and lymphoma. Blood tests did not reveal any specific findings, with white blood test count on the lower normal levels. The patient did not present any B-type symptoms or showed any signs of localized lymphadenopathy. FNA biopsy was performed, retrieving numerous lymphocytes and nonspecific atypical cells, and was characterized as nondiagnostic (). The patient refused to undergo a second FNA biopsy. The decision for excision under general anesthesia was then taken as the possibility of a malignant lesion could not be excluded.

She did not report any previous episodes of constipation. She was reviewed at our emergency department and was found to have a distended tympanic abdomen that was soft all over with no tenderness. Bowel sounds were sluggish and a digital rectal examination revealed an empty rectum. A plain abdominal film showed a hugely dilated loop of bowel, arising from her pelvis, which had the appearance of a coffee bean (Fig. ). The plain abdominal radiograph confirmed the presence of a sigmoid volvulus. A rectal tube was inserted carefully to decompress the volvulus which succeeded and gave her immediate relief from her symptoms. She was admitted to our pediatric surgical ward and had a nasogastric tube inserted and was started on intravenously administered antibiotics. The next day she was asymptomatic but a contrast enema showed the twist to be evident with an incomplete obstruction (Fig. ). Due to the findings on contrast enema she went for endoscopic decompression of the volvulus under general anesthesia. The twist was causing venous congestion and was successfully reduced (Fig. ). A rectal tube was left in place post endoscopic reduction for 24 hours. She was asymptomatic thereafter but her parents requested discharge and they were granted their wish as they wanted to travel to their country. In her country she was investigated and was advised conservative management and observation.

A second resection was performed in May 1999, and during the next 16 years, the patient underwent several surgical approaches that were consistently followed by disease recurrence. Some of the procedures were conservative surgeries, but others were radical procedures that left her with several deforming scars. She presented to our clinic in January 2015 with a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that evidenced a right, triangular aspect, paracellarlesion, extending to the homolateral cavernous sinus (13 \u00d7 9 mm), which was suspected to be a residual lesion that would have achieved the cavernous sinus by contiguity growth after several surgeries. Her last surgery had been performed in April 2014 and was followed by local radiotherapy in May 2014. She was asymptomatic and not willing to undergo a new invasive procedure. She decided to be followed without further intervention.\nFor the next 18 months, she was clinically stable and asymptomatic, but she returned in July 2016 with intense pain on the right side of her face that required multiple hospital visits for intravenous analgesia.

A physical examination revealed swelling and tenderness on the patella, the lateral aspect of the distal femur, and the medial aspect of the proximal tibia. Because of the pain, the knee could not be examined properly. The range of motion was severely limited by the pain, but a neurovascular examination was normal. Standard radiographs showed prepatellar intra-articular effusion and an isolated avulsion fracture with the elevation of the tibial attachment of the PCL (\n). The diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by computed tomographic scanning, and other bone lesions were excluded (\n). The tibial fragment measured 11 \u00d7 4 mm and presented a maximal displacement of 7 mm. No other ligamentous, meniscal, or chondral injuries were observed in a magnetic resonance imaging examination (\n). Because of minimal displacement, we decided to treat the avulsion fracture in a conservative way. The knee was immobilized for 6 weeks, with a long leg cast with 30 degrees of knee flexion. The patient was asked to walk with crutches, avoiding weight bearing. After removing the cast, the patient was allowed to begin gentle range-of-motion activities and weight bearing. The patient was asked to report for regular clinical and radiological controls every 4 to 6 weeks until 3 months after the trauma. No pain or instability was detected during a physical examination, and magnetic resonance imaging showed progressive consolidation of the fracture over time.

The patient had limitation of jaw movements and mouth opening was only 15 mm []. There were no other bony or soft tissue injuries noticed during examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, which showed a hematoma within the temporalis muscle []. Thus, a diagnosis was established as hematoma and the patient was taken up for surgical evacuation of hematoma. Intraoperatively, a mouth opening of 40 mm was achieved and the patient was discharged on the sixth postoperative day with some muscle relaxants and advised forceful mouth opening physiotherapy. At the time of discharge, the patient's mouth opening was 30 mm and review on the first, third and sixth week postoperatively showed that there was recurrence of trismus, which was progressive and the patient's mouth opening was limited to 2 mm [].\nA computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which showed calcified masses within temporalis muscle suggestive of extraskeletal bone formation []. A provisional diagnosis of MOT was established and the patient was taken for surgery with a treatment plan of excision of calcified masses and coronoidectomy. Intraoperatively, flakes of calcified masses were removed along with a part of temporalis muscle and ipsilateral coronoidectomy was performed. Intraoperative mouth opening of 38 mm was achieved and postoperatively forceful mouth opening physiotherapy was advised along with muscle relaxants.

The swelling was initially smaller in size and had progressively increased over time. The patient gave a history that she had consulted a private practitioner 2 months ago who had planned for excision of salivary gland tumor. A well-defined, ovoid, multilobular swelling of size 8 cm \u00d7 9 cm with superioinferior extent from left zygomatic arch to about 4 cm below the lower border of the mandible and anteroposterior from the anterior border of masseter to 1 cm beyond posterior border of mandible was noted. The left ear lobule was slightly raised and everted []. Facial and eye movements were normal on examination. Intraoral examination reveals a nonhealing suspicious ulcer over the left posterior buccal mucosa distal to second molar of size 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm. Clinically there were no neck nodes.

He was otherwise fit and healthy with no comorbid illnesses or regular medications. Examination findings were consistent with an inflammatory middle ear effusion with a bulging tympanic membrane associated with right sided facial nerve palsy. Tuning fork tests demonstrated a conductive hearing loss in the affected ear. All other cranial nerves were intact. The patient was admitted under ENT for intravenous antibiotics and steroids.

With resolution of his middle ear infection, a pale red-pink mass was visible behind the tympanic membrane.\nFurther imaging demonstrated a middle ear mass with partial disruption of the facial canal. A subsequent angiogram demonstrated an avascular middle ear mass. Mixed hearing loss was demonstrated in the right ear on audiogram. The patient was electively taken to the operating theatre for a middle ear exploration and mastoidectomy with the intention of confirming the nature of the tumour and performing a subtotal removal. Intraoperative frozen section raised the possibility of a neuroendocrine tumour. The patient was successfully discharged on postoperative day 1.

    "original_text": "Three years before his admission to our hospital, a 26-year-old Chinese man began to manifest, for no apparent reason, restricted affect, poor speech, diminished sense of purpose, and diminished social drive. His affect was diminished no matter what his parents told him. He lacked interest in doing anything, and did not talk to others. When his parents asked him questions, he answered only \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. Sometimes his speech was disorganized and incoherent. He also lost desire to work at his job as a bank clerk, although he previously performed well. He preferred to stay at home and did not want to participate in activities or have contact with friends. His sleep and appetite were poor. He showed no disturbance of consciousness. After these symptoms continued for about 6 months, he was taken by his parents and hospitalized in a local psychiatric ward. General physical and neurologic examinations and routine laboratory investigations at that time showed no notable abnormalities.

There was no evidence of tumour recurrence after 5 years of follow up. She did not have any other previous abdominal surgery and no significant past medical history.\nAt the time of her presentation, she had mild fever but did not have vomiting.

She was diagnosed with Beh\u00e7et disease at the age of 34 years; she presented with recurrent oral ulceration, recurrent genital ulceration, and pseudofolliculitis with characteristic acneiform nodules. She had no eye lesions. Her condition was well controlled with prednisolone (PSL) 8 mg/day oral dose. She fell pregnant spontaneously and visited our perinatal center for her prenatal care. As she was detected with hypertension at her first visit, we recommended that she check her blood pressure regularly at home. She developed fever, oral ulcers, and arthralgia at 16 weeks of gestation, due to which a relapse of Beh\u00e7et disease was suspected. Because her condition was controlled well with PSL, the daily oral dose of PSL was increased from 8 mg to 10 mg. At this time, ulceration and pain of the vulva were not observed. She visited our outpatient clinic for a regular prenatal examination at 18 weeks and 4 days of gestation, which was when an ulcer localized in the vagina was incidentally observed (). The ulcer was painless and the patient had no symptoms in the vulva either (). Chlamydial and gonococcal infection were not detected, and cytology of the vaginal wall showed no findings suggesting malignancy. As the other symptoms of Beh\u00e7et disease were resolved after the dose of PSL had been increased, the same dose was maintained. At the next prenatal care visit, at 22 weeks and 4 days of gestation, the vaginal ulcer had disappeared and other symptoms of Beh\u00e7et disease were not seen. At 28 weeks and 0 days of gestation, atypical genital bleeding and vaginal ulcer recurrence were observed (). At the same time, recurrence of the oral ulcer and arthralgia as well as a mild increase in the fever were observed; based on these symptoms, she was diagnosed with a relapse of Beh\u00e7et disease and the daily dose of PSL was increased from 10 mg to 15 mg. The vaginal ulcer disappeared at 29 weeks and 2 days",

The first episode was in June 2006 managed as biliary colic after rule out of ischemic heart disease and based on ultrasound report of distal common bile duct (CBD) stone (measuring 5.5 mm). At that time, all liver enzymes and liver function tests and alkaline phosphatase levels were normal.

They occurred after he had lifted heavy objects. The headaches occurred when he sat or stood up, but they subsided when he was lying down. He had received no treatment for this, but 3 days before admission, his headaches had worsened. On the day he was admitted, he experienced dull pain of 8/10 on the VAS in the occipital and frontal areas, as well as in the cervical area, and this was accompanied by nausea. So he visited the department of neurosurgery as an outpatient and was admitted. There were no strange findings in his past history. He had no past history of trauma or dural puncture in the head or spine. A physical examination performed on the day he was admitted showed no strange findings either. But a brain MRI showed he had diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement and a subdural effusion (). A CSF study showed the CSF opening pressure in the sitting position to be 40 mmH2O, there was increased protein at 64.5 mg/dl and the glucose level was 59 mg/dl. A cytologic examination of the CSF and a bacterial culture test showed no strange findings. Spinal MRI showed a dilated epidural venous plexus. An RNC showed that the CSF leaked to the left at the cervical level and to the right at the middle thoracic level. It also showed that the radioactive tracer was quickly being excreted through the bladders and kidneys (). These findings were diagnosed to be a CSF leak/SIH in the cervical and thoracic levels.

    "original_text": "A 3-year-old boy was brought into hospital because of developmental regression. His medical history revealed little problems, except for a bronchiolitis caused by respiratory syncytial virus, for which he had been in hospital as a toddler. Uptill a few months earlier his neuromotor development had always been on schedule. Six months before admission to our hospital he was hospitalized in a different clinic with convulsions, thought to be caused by a viral infection with enterovirus. Afterwards he progressively developed constipation, limping, and an inability to play in his normal manner. The boy is the firstborn son of two nonconsanguineous parents of Afro-Caribbean origin. The mother and maternal grandmother of the boy are known to have ROWD. A maternal uncle was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus.\nDuring the diagnostic workup in a neighbouring general hospital an MRI scan of the spinal cord was performed (). It showed a spinal vascular malformation with a large aneurysm at the level of the lower thoracic spinal cord, causing massive compression of the lumbar spinal cord. The boy was transferred to our university hospital for further diagnosis. Spinal angiography (under general anaesthesia) identified the vascular malformation as a spinal arteriovenous fistula with an associated large venous aneurysm at the level of the fistula. The dilated arterial feeder as recognized from MRI originated from the intercostal artery at T9. It was thought to be a single fistula. Due to the low weight of the boy, only a limited amount of contrast could be administered and more distal thoracic levels were not checked. An embolisation of this AVF at T9 was carried out, using a coil and a liquid embolic agent (). The idea was that the aneurysm would gradually shrink in time, whereas initial aneurysm occlusion would result in an oedematous reaction with increase in spinal cord compression.

    "cleaned_text": "a 3-year-old boy was brought into hospital because of developmental regression. his medical history revealed little problems, except for a bronchiolitis caused by respiratory syncytial virus, for which he had been in hospital as a toddler. uptill a few months earlier his neuromotor development had always been on schedule. six months before admission to our hospital he was hospitalized in a different clinic with convulsions, thought to be caused by a viral infection with enterovirus. afterwards he progressively developed constipation, limping, and an inability to play in his normal manner. the boy is the firstborn son of two nonconsanguineous parents of afro-caribbean origin. the mother and maternal grandmother of the boy are known to have rowd. a maternal uncle was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus.\nduring the diagnostic workup in a neighbouring general hospital an mri scan of the spinal cord was performed (). it showed a spinal vascular malformation with a large aneurysm at the level of the lower thoracic spinal cord, causing massive compression of the lumbar spinal cord. the boy was transferred to our university hospital for further diagnosis. spinal angiography (under general anaesthesia) identified the vascular malformation as a spinal arteriovenous fistula with an associated large venous aneurysm at the level of the fistula. the dilated arterial feeder as recognized from mri originated from the intercostal artery at t9. it was thought to be a single fistula. due to the low weight of the boy, only a limited amount of contrast could be administered and more distal thoracic levels were not checked. an embolisation of this avf at t9 was carried out, using a coil and a liquid embolic agent (). the idea was that the aneurysm would gradually shrink in time, whereas initial aneurysm occlusion would result in an oedematous reaction with increase in spinal cord compression. postoperative high-dose dexamethasone was given to prevent oedema of the spinal cord. the boy recovered well with spontaneous movements of the lower limbs and preservation of sensibility. because of his symptoms and",

The fracture was subsequently stabilized with tension band wiring with two Kirschner wires (K-wire) & figure of eight stainless steel wire. The immediate post operative period was uneventful. He was discharged after stitch removal with knee support and was advised partial weight bearing with knee bending exercises in between. However, he indulged in heavy manual work including bicycling after 15 days of surgery. This led to loosening of implants and failure of reduction. He reported after 2 months of failure with pain, swelling and stiffness of the knee joint. X-rays revealed wide displacement of the fragments with loose implants ().\nThe options for such a case were either patellectomy or apposing the fragments by some means. Patellectomy would lead to difficulty in apposing the ligaments as there were gross displacements of the fragments leading to contracture of soft tissues on either side of the patella. Apposing the fragments would require extensive soft tissue dissection and lengthening of the quadriceps tendon resulting in extensive scarring and stiffness. As we were accumulating experience by using Ilizarov in various situations, we opted for it to mend the difficult situation in this case.

Hence, the patient was diagnosed as Crohn's disease and medication with salofalk and steroid treatment was introduced to treat the acute inflammatory attack. However, during her hospitalization period, she began to display progressive nausea and vomiting, suggesting that a small bowel obstruction had developed due to a stricture as a complication of the Crohn's disease.

The patient was explored and dilated small bowel segments, which ended 10 cm proximal to the cecum because a stricture was found (). Multiple lymph nodes with a slightly thickened mesoperitoneum at the strictured ileal segment were palpated. Furthermore, an endometrial cyst 2 cm in diameter, originating from the left ovary, was also detected. The strictured ileal segment was resected and end-ileostomy was performed. Anastomosis was avoided because of the excessive dilatation of the proximal part of the ileum and suspicion of an inflammatory bowel which carries high risk for anastomotic leakage.

The onset of swelling was associated with fever. It was initially of pea size and rapidly increased to the size of a marble, over a period of 1 month. It was not associated with pain or discomfort.\nOn extra-oral examination, the mass measured 3 \u00d7 3 cm and was located at the junction of middle and lower third of the face, 2 cm lateral to the angle of the mouth. The mass was freely movable and no ulceration was observed on the overlying skin. Intra-orally the swelling involved the buccal mucosa at the occlusal plane and extended from the distal aspect of first primary maxillary molar to the distal aspect of permanent maxillary first molar. Bi-digital examination revealed that the swelling was firm in consistency, mobile, and appeared to infiltrate the surrounding soft tissue. The mucosa overlying the swelling was intact. Intraoral examination also revealed dental caries in relation to mandibular left primary second molar.\nAspiration of the swelling did not show any contents. A radiograph of the intra-oral swelling, taken by placing an intra-oral film between the buccal mucosa and the posterior buccal surfaces did not show any radiopacity. Intra-oral periapical radiograph in relation to mandibular left primary second molar revealed deep dental caries involving the pulp. Ultrasonography of the left cheek was carried out. This showed a well demarcated solitary isolated tumor involving the buccal mucosa.\nSurgical excision of the lesion was planned under general anesthesia. Prior to surgery routine blood investigations were carried out. After achieving general anesthesia with oral intubation, infiltration was given over and around the swelling with local anesthetic containing 2% adrenaline. A horizontal incision was made anteroposteriorly using electrocautery along the buccal mucosa and over the most prominent part of the swelling. The swelling was relieved all around from its mucosal attachment including the buccal pad",

Her mother reported that this was not the first time she was experiencing ocular movement limitation during headache. A similar ocular motility disorder had developed when she was 2 years old and lived in the United States at that time. She had been diagnosed with a typical cranial neuropathy in the right eye, which had improved after administration of a steroid. The visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. The right pupil was poorly reactive to direct and consensual stimulus. The ocular motility examination showed a limitation of ocular movement except abduction in the right eye []. There was no ocular injection, chemosis, or pain on eye movement. The fundus showed normal appearance of the optic disc in both eyes. All serologic tests, including tests for thyroid function and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies, were within normal range. Thin-section cranial MRI with MRA of the brain was performed and it revealed a 6-mm nodular enhancement located within the cisternal segment of the right oculomotor nerve, suggesting oculomotor nerve schwannoma without any vascular malformation [Fig. and ]. Although the MRI of the brain performed 1 year earlier had failed to reveal any abnormal lesion at the time, we reviewed the images and found a 3.7-mm thickening lesion of the cisternal segment of the affected oculomotor nerve on the constructive interference in steady-state axial T2 MRI []. Therefore, we concluded that the schwannoma, which had been 3.7 mm in size 1 year earlier, had gradually increased in size and led to oculomotor nerve palsy. The neurosurgeon recommended gamma",

Five years prior to the incident of right knee pain, he was diagnosed with osteonecrosis of the left lateral tibia. His rheumatologist prescribed Celebrex which managed the left knee pain well. However, the following year, the patient was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver resulting from his antiretroviral medications. Celebrex was discontinued because of the contraindication with liver disease, and Tylenol was initiated for his left knee pain. The patient considered this management plan to be acceptable, particularly in light of his life-threatening liver disease, which became his focus of care. His liver disease had stabilized, and his left knee pain was well managed when the current incident of right knee pain struck.\nThe patient presented with severe pain in his right knee and was unable to weight bear with his leg fully extended. Bone scan in February 2006 revealed osteonecrosis of the right knee, osteopenia in both hips, small fractures bilaterally in the second and third metatarsals, and osteonecrosis of the right medial femoral condyle. The endocrinologist prescribed weekly Fosimax, plus a high dose of calcium and vitamin D and K supplements. The patient preferred not to take Tylenol because of his liver disease, and so his rheumatologist prescribed Tramidol taken at night to relieve morning joint pain.\nNearly one year later, MRI showed osteonecrosis and a medial meniscal tear of the right knee (see ), and the patient was referred to an orthopedic surgeon to explore surgical options. The surgeon advised that minor debridement was not an option because of the lack of healthy bone, and that a total knee arthroplasty would likely be advised within the next two years. The patient was resistant to the surgical option because of his advanced liver disease and concern for potential complications under anesthesia.\nThe orthopedic",

A recent colonoscopy demonstrated a 3 cm friable mass in the transverse colon at approximately 70 cm. There was a polyp in the cecum which measured 4 mm, polyps in the ascending colon measuring 1.5 cm and 4 mm, and a polyp in the sigmoid colon measuring 8 mm. Histologically, he had an invasive adenocarcinoma arising from a tubular adenoma in the transverse colon. There were findings of tubular adenomas with high grade dysplasia in the descending colon as well as tubular adenomas in the sigmoid and ascending colon. A carcinoembryonic antigen level was normal, and a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was only significant for circumferential wall thickening in the transverse colon. The patient underwent a subtotal abdominal colectomy, removing all lesions. The pathological evaluation identified moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the transverse colon with twenty-three benign lymph nodes.\nDue to the patient's cancer in the transverse colon, with another synchronous high grade dysplastic lesion in the descending colon, and a maternal history of a young gynecologic cancer, genetic analysis of the patient's germline and tumor was performed. Results were obtained from the Molecular Oncology and Cancer Genetics Laboratory, Huntington Medical Research Institute, Pasadena, CA. DNA sequencing of the patient's germline identified a cytosine (C) to thymine (T) transition at codon 414, exon 9, and c.1240 C > T, heterozygous in one",

The lesion originated in the ascending branch of the left mandible, and the first surgical procedure was performed in March 1997 followed by disease recurrence in April 1999. A second resection was performed in May 1999, and during the next 16 years, the patient underwent several surgical approaches that were consistently followed by disease recurrence. Some of the procedures were conservative surgeries, but others were radical procedures that left her with several deforming scars. She presented to our clinic in January 2015 with a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that evidenced a right, triangular aspect, paracellarlesion, extending to the homolateral cavernous sinus (13 \u00d7 9 mm), which was suspected to be a residual lesion that would have achieved the cavernous sinus by contiguity growth after several surgeries. Her last surgery had been performed in April 2014 and was followed by local radiotherapy in May 2014. She was asymptomatic and not willing to undergo a new invasive procedure. She decided to be followed without further intervention.\nFor the next 18 months, she was clinically stable and asymptomatic, but she returned in July 2016 with intense pain on the right side of her face that required multiple hospital visits for intravenous analgesia. MRI revealed an extensive heterogeneous lesion with contrast enhancement centered on the right cavernous sinus anterior to the cavus of Meckel and exhibiting anterior extension towards the upper orbital fissure (measuring approximately 19 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 16 mm). To identify new treatment possibilities, we decided to perform a new biopsy and conduct molecular testing (Fig. ). A BRAF mutational analysis by the allele-specific protein chain reaction (PCR) certified test revealed the presence of a BRAF c.1799 T > A;p.V600E mutation corresponding to a V600E amino acid substitution.

The right facial artery and vein were prepared as a recipient vessel. Consequently, there was a defect of 15 cm in length between the facial vessels and the pedicle of a latissimus dorsi muscle free flap, which was harvested. We used a vascular pedicle of an anterolateral thigh flap as an interposition artery and vein graft. For the vascular graft, an incision was made on the right thigh.

The EUS revealed that a large pseudocyst close to 14 cm in size replaced the pancreas. Patient then underwent the placement of two double pigtail 7 F 4 cm stents. Several days after this procedure patient also underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and J tube placement at the other facility before being discharged.\nPrior to being admitted to our facility patient started developing abdominal pain, was subsequently admitted to another facility and was transferred to our facility for a higher level of care. CT scan at the transferring facility showed a large pancreatic pseudocyst with necrosis. Patient was noted to have a WBC of 13, 000, and increased anion gap with lactic acidosis at the time of hospitalization. Critical care consult was obtained; patient became septic and was admitted to ICU.\nThe patient was taken to endoscopy suit for EUS-guided cystogastrostomy. The two previously placed pigtail stents were visualized. The cyst was punctured via the transgastric approach using a 19-gauge needle; a 0.035 jag wire was then inserted into the cyst under fluoroscopic guidance. The cystotomy was performed using a cystotome from cook endoscopy. We then dilated the tract using 15 mm balloon. We then placed a 10 mm \u00d7 6 cm fully covered SEMS.

    "original_text": "This case describes a 29-year-old woman who was first diagnosed with ameloblastoma as a child at 7 years old. The lesion originated in the ascending branch of the left mandible, and the first surgical procedure was performed in March 1997 followed by disease recurrence in April 1999. A second resection was performed in May 1999, and during the next 16 years, the patient underwent several surgical approaches that were consistently followed by disease recurrence. Some of the procedures were conservative surgeries, but others were radical procedures that left her with several deforming scars. She presented to our clinic in January 2015 with a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that evidenced a right, triangular aspect, paracellarlesion, extending to the homolateral cavernous sinus (13 \u00d7 9 mm), which was suspected to be a residual lesion that would have achieved the cavernous sinus by contiguity growth after several surgeries. Her last surgery had been performed in April 2014 and was followed by local radiotherapy in May 2014. She was asymptomatic and not willing to undergo a new invasive procedure. She decided to be followed without further intervention.\nFor the next 18 months, she was clinically stable and asymptomatic, but she returned in July 2016 with intense pain on the right side of her face that required multiple hospital visits for intravenous analgesia. MRI revealed an extensive heterogeneous lesion with contrast enhancement centered on the right cavernous sinus anterior to the cavus of Meckel and exhibiting anterior extension towards the upper orbital fissure (measuring approximately 19 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 16 mm). To identify new treatment possibilities, we decided to perform a new biopsy and conduct molecular testing (Fig. ).

The child was referred to the dentist one hour after trauma, reporting intense pain in the traumatic area. At extraoral clinical examination, the presence of contusion lesion and abrasion on the chin was observed (). Considering the traumatic impact on the chin and the possible damage to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), a panoramic radiograph was taken to evaluate this area. The radiographic image indicated normal TMJ structures, without injury (). Thus, extraoral injuries treatment was restricted to the cleaning and disinfection of the damaged soft tissue.\nIntraoral examination revealed the presence of lateral luxation towards the lingual surface of mandibular right lateral incisor (without mobility) and alveolar fracture of the area of teeth mandibular right and left central incisor with lingual displacement (). When mobility was checked, alveolar process showed movement as a unit of the displaced segment, which characterizes the alveolar bone fracture. The alveolar fracture was not visualized on radiographs, since they were taken only after dental trauma treatment. The preoperative radiograph was not taken because the child was in pain and the image was not necessary for the choice of treatment.\nAlthough the traumatic impact caused two injury types to teeth and supporting tissue (lateral luxations and alveolar fracture), the management performed was the same for both situations. After anesthesia with local and intraligamentary infiltration of the displaced teeth, using a full cartridge of 2 percent lidocaine with 1 : 100,000 epinephrine, the mandibular right lateral incisor and the bone segment of mandibular right and left central incisor were repositioned by digital pressure.

    "cleaned_text": "a male patient, aged 8 years, suffered a traumatic injury in the area of the chin and mandibular right and left central incisor and mandibular right lateral incisor after he had been pushed against a wall by a friend at school. the child was referred to the dentist one hour after trauma, reporting intense pain in the traumatic area. at extraoral clinical examination, the presence of contusion lesion and abrasion on the chin was observed (). considering the traumatic impact on the chin and the possible damage to the temporomandibular joint (tmj), a panoramic radiograph was taken to evaluate this area. the radiographic image indicated normal tmj structures, without injury (). thus, extraoral injuries treatment was restricted to the cleaning and disinfection of the damaged soft tissue.\nintraoral examination revealed the presence of lateral luxation towards the lingual surface of mandibular right lateral incisor (without mobility) and alveolar fracture of the area of teeth mandibular right and left central incisor with lingual displacement (). when mobility was checked, alveolar process showed movement as a unit of the displaced segment, which characterizes the alveolar bone fracture. the alveolar fracture was not visualized on radiographs, since they were taken only after dental trauma treatment. the preoperative radiograph was not taken because the child was in pain and the image was not necessary for the choice of treatment.\nalthough the traumatic impact caused two injury types to teeth and supporting tissue (lateral luxations and alveolar fracture), the management performed was the same for both situations. after anesthesia with local and intraligamentary infiltration of the displaced teeth, using a full cartridge of 2 percent lidocaine with 1 : 100,000 epinephrine, the mandibular right lateral incisor and the bone segment of mandibular right and left central incisor were repositioned by digital pressure. the bone fracture reduction was difficult to execute because of its extension (). next, a splint made with resin composite (filtek z350 xt, 3m espe) and 0.7 mm orthodontic wire was placed onto the labial surface of",

    "original_text": "We report a 73-year-old woman, who presented with a sacral fracture that had already been diagnosed in an outpatient setting. In addition, there was strong evidence of a renal cell carcinoma of the right kidney. Despite sufficient pain treatment and accompanying physiotherapy, the patient's mobility was severely restricted by pain at the time of presentation. The patient rated her pain as 9 on a visual analogue scale (VAS) with 10 as the maximum value. Osteoporosis was also suspected and confirmed by bone density measurement, so therapy with bisphosphonates was started in accordance with the guidelines (). In the preinterventional CT of the pelvis and abdomen, a bilateral fracture line running sagittally through the lateral mass of the sacrum could be seen ().\nOn the left, the fracture line traverses the transforaminal zone at the level of the second sacral vertebra. Both in this examination and in an additionally performed MRI, no metastases of the suspected renal carcinoma were observed in the areas of the body examined. The morphology of the sacral fracture was also most consistent with an insufficiency fracture. In order to enable the further therapy of the renal tumor and to achieve sufficient pain reduction, in an interdisciplinary tumor conference, it was initially decided to treat the sacral fracture by CT-assisted balloon sacroplasty. In order to avoid further fracturing and prolonged hospitalization of the patient, we decided on simultaneous treatment of the bilateral fractures. In addition, a biopsy was to be taken for histopathological analysis for definitive exclusion of metastasis. The intervention was performed under intubation anesthesia and anesthesiological monitoring. The patient was placed in the prone position in the CT scan machine. As is routine practice, a single-shot antibiotic was administered (cefazoline 2 g IV). The short axis of the sacrum was selected as the entry plane. Access to the fracture zones was established from dorsal to ventral by two Kirschner wires, which can be directed and angulated easily without causing further damage in the osteoporotic bone. Along the Kirschner wires",
