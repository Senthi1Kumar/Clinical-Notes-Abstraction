The patient had no congenital swelling of the left buccal mucosa at birth and no history of systemic disease or relevant family history. The patient had undergone maxillary molar restoration treatment 2 years earlier, after which she reported biting regularly on her buccal mucosa. On most occasions, the wound had healed within a week, so she had not sought medical treatment. An extraoral examination revealed no facial swelling or asymmetry. However, an intraoral examination revealed an area of diffuse swelling on the left buccal mucosa measuring about 15 mm \u00d7 30 mm and containing a papillary lesion with multiple red, blue, and clear pebble-like vesicles (Figure ). On palpation, the lesion was nontender and soft. The swelling had not expanded to the veins and was pulsatile. An orthopantomogram confirmed that the adjacent bone was intact. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a soft tissue mass with a clearly distinguishable outline of the buccinator muscle (Figure ). The lesion was surgically excised under local anesthesia with a margin of 3 mm and a depth of 2 mm via the inside surface of the fascia of the buccinator muscle. The outcome was favorable. Pathologic examination of the specimen revealed expanded lymphatic vessels lined by thin endothelial cells and containing lymphatic fluid. A diagnosis of lymphatic malformation was confirmed on histopathology and immunohistochemical studies. Immunohistochemistry was negative for vascular markers such as CD31 and CD34, and the lymphatics stained specifically for D2-40 (podoplanin) (Figures , , ). On follow-up, the wound was found to have healed with no evidence of trismus or recurrence. The patient continued to be recurrence-free at her 2-year follow-up. Informed consent was obtained from the patient,",

Further workup revealed a left cortical and cerebellar hemisphere ischemic stroke. TEE was performed as part of stroke management, which was uneventful. Feeding and scheduled oral medicines were started via a Dobbhoff tube, and further stroke management was optimized. On the third hospital day, she developed acute respiratory distress, warranting endotracheal intubation. Chest radiograph revealed a near complete opacification of right hemithorax with slight mediastinal shift (). Preliminary diagnosis was aspiration pneumonia. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics was started after cultures were obtained. Bronchoscopy showed copious, thick, and purulent secretions in the right middle and lower lobar area. However, quantitative culture of bronchoalveolar lavage showed no bacterial growth.\nThe pleural effusion persisted despite thoracentesis. Samples obtained were consistent with exudative effusion (low amylase, high lactate dehydrogenase, low glucose). A chest tube was inserted and drained a fair amount of purulent-appearing fluid. Overtime, her chest tube drainage slowed down but diminished-but-persistent effusion was still obvious in the chest X-ray. Due to notable clinical improvement in her pulmonary status, the patient was weaned off the mechanical ventilatory support and extubated after the 14th day of intubation. Per protocol, she was then referred to the speech therapist for a swallow assessment. A fluoroscopic dynamic swallow assessment showed a clear leaking from the esophagus.

Morrey [] classification of joint stiffness has two main groups based on etiology and anatomical location of the contracture.\nExtrinsic stiffness was limited to soft-tissues or extra-articular processes. Intrinsic stiffness related to joint processes such as defective consolidation and degenerative joint diseases. Intrinsic contracture often presents an associated extrinsic component and is thus considered to be mixed contracture [].

In Type II, there would be contracture of soft tissues associated with heterotopic ossification. In Type III, there would be contracture of soft tissues associated with a consolidated joint fracture, without dislocation. In Type IV, the contracture of soft tissues would be associated with defective consolidation of the joint fracture. In Type V, a cross-joint bone bar would be present.

Physical examinations revealed scattered ulcers and erosions in the mouth (Fig. ). Laboratory examinations showed that CA 125 was elevated (51.6 U/ml), while other tumor markers, including CA199, 153, CEA, and AFP, were normal. Autoimmune antibodies, including anti-CENP-B antibody, ANCA, anti-AchR antibody, and ANA, were all positive.\nThe patient was first diagnosed with an oral aphthous ulcer and ocular myopathy myasthenia gravis. She was treated with gentamycin and dexamethasone spray inhalation to improve her oral lesions and pyridostigmine to cure muscle weakness. However, the oral ulcers improved slightly and the myasthenia gravis persisted. An abdominal ultrasound showed a hypoechoic mass in the left adrenal gland. A further CT examination showed a 6 \u00d7 5 cm, well-defined round solid mass with central necrosis in the pancreatic tail. There was no calcification detected in the mass. The solid part of the mass had slight enhancement in the arterial phase with many serpentine feeding arteries, moderate enhancement with a draining vein around the tumor in the portal venous phase and persistent enhancement in the delayed phase (Fig. a-e). The fundus of the stomach was compressed by the mass.

An external eye examination showed hard and cold edema of the lower eyelid, ocular motility with limitation in adduction, and discreet ipsilateral proptosis. Hertel exophthalmometry was used to measure the degree of ocular protrusion and the value obtained was 18,2 mm for the right eye and 25 mm for the left eye ().\nThe best corrected visual acuity was full (20/20) in the right eye and 0.8 (20/25) in the left eye. No refractive error was detected in any of the eyes. Biomicroscopic examination of the right anterior segment did not reveal any abnormal findings, although the left eye showed conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, and keratitis.\nIntraocular pressure was measured using an applanation tonometer and it was found to be 11 mmHg in the right eye and 16 mmHg in the left eye. No pathological findings were detected during fundoscopy. The optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the left eye revealed no abnormalities. The cause for low vision in the left eye was found to be eyelid edema and keratitis. The cause for left eye motility reduction was the extraocular muscles (EOM) affected by the lesion. The affected EOM were the lateral rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique.

The patient\u2019s boat went over a wake of a larger boat passing by. He bounced off his seat in a vertical direction and subsequently landed on his tailbone. After the high impact fall, he complained of both immediate lower back and diffuse abdominal pain but did not seek out urgent medical help.\nTwo days after the initial incident, he started to become pale and diaphoretic; additionally, his ICD delivered three shocks over a 30-min period. He presented via ambulance service to a local community hospital in hemorrhagic shock with a blood pressure of 63/22 and heart rate of 118 beats/min. A primary survey was pertinently positive for hemodynamic instability and diffuse abdominal and lower thoracic spine tenderness.\nHe was resuscitated with 1\u202fL of normal saline leading to an improvement of his pressure to 106/88. Initial laboratory investigations included a hemoglobin of 95\u202fg/L, lactate of 6.1\u202fmmol/L, creatinine of 129, and a supratherapeutic INR of 8.8. An initial non-contrast CT abdomen and pelvis showed moderate hemoperitoneum with sentinel clot in the left upper quadrant and pericolic gutter, as well as the area adjacent to the posterior wall of the stomach. An additional finding of a severely comminuted, minimally displaced burst fracture of the T10 vertebral body was noted ().

    "original_text": "A 26-year-old Korean male was diagnosed with stage IV poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma of the lower body with multiple liver metastases in August 2009. The initial diagnosis was made at an outside hospital using abdominopelvic computed-tomography (CT) and endoscopic biopsy of stomach. The pathologic specimen at the time of diagnosis was not procured. The patient was initially treated with systemic chemotherapies, including three cycles of S-1 and subsequently four cycles of FOLFOX chemotherapy, resulting in the progression of liver metastasis. After second-line chemotherapy, the patient was transferred to our institute (Asan medical center, Seoul, Korea) for further management in September 2008. Baseline tumor tissue was obtained via endoscopic forceps biopsy before treatment. As third-line chemotherapy, the patient was enrolled in an open-labeled, phase II trial evaluating the efficacy of everolimus 10 mg/day, and he achieved a partial response by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) as the best response after 1 year and 2 months (Figure A and B). The tumor remained stable with a partial response over 2 years in this initial treatment of everolimus. However, after 29 months of initial everolimus treatment, abdominopelvic CT revealed the progression of liver metastasis. An episodic pneumonia due to streptococcus occurred right after disease evaluation, and the patient underwent antibiotic treatment for a month. Subsequently, the patient underwent salvage chemotherapy with FOLFIRI but failed after 3 cycles with disease progression. Sequential three cycles of oral paclitaxel and six cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy were applied to the patient for 4 months to maintain stable disease.

The lesion was also examined by fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), which showed high FDG uptake (maximum standardized uptake value, 15.45) and demonstrated a recurrence of thyroid cancer (Figure \n). After providing written informed consent, the patient underwent surgical resection of the recurrent thyroid cancer with the new procedure. The patient was positioned under general anesthesia in a supine position on the operating table with her neck hyperextended. Through a transverse cervical incision made just along the previous surgical scar, a tracheotomy was performed. The tumor was easily detected through the tracheostoma, then delineated by palpation. The mucous membrane of the trachea was minimally incised along the right-hand border of the tumor and a mucosal flap was elevated (Figure \n). The left-hand side of the trachea including the membranous wall and cartilage of the tracheal mucosa was maximally preserved, to maintain the vascular supply to the trachea. Finally, the membranous wall of the trachea was preserved to within one-third of the left-hand side (Figure \nA). Bleeding from both cut edges of the tracheal mucosa was confirmed. There was no extracapsular spread and the tumor was removed completely with the muscular layer of the esophagus. Intraoperative frozen examination revealed that the tumor was completely resected. A right sternocleidomastoid muscle flap was elevated and inserted into the cavity resulting from the tumor resection and sutured between the esophagus and the trachea. The membranous wall of the tracheal mucosa was also sutured submucosally. A temporary tracheocutaneous stoma was made.",

The patient had previously undergone a classic pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple) procedure with concurrent hemicolectomy 6 years prior (in 2011) for a T3N0M0 adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head that had invaded the mesentery of the proximal transverse colon. After the 2011 surgery, pathology revealed a poorly differentiated PDA along with a PanIN grade 2. The final pathology showed negative surgical margins, positive perineural spread, and 0/33 specimen lymph node involvement. From June 2012 to October 2012, the patient underwent and completed adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine, capecitabine, and radiation at an outside hospital. She was carefully followed by her medical oncology team with serial CA 19-9 monitoring and abdominal MRIs on an ongoing basis. Due to her young age, in 2011, she underwent genetic screening and no germline mutations were identified. Since the time of the primary resection, the patient had been high functioning and healthy, with the exception of some problems of early satiety and recurrent cholangitis. These sequelae were attributed to close proximity of the gastrojejunostomy and hepaticojejunostomy, with possible reflux of intestinal contents up the afferent limb, all partially managed by diet changes.\nIn 2017, a biannual screening MRI with intravenous contrast showed a new pancreatic lesion measuring 2.3 \u00d7 2.2 cm in the tail of the pancreas (). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy identified it as a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. From 2011 to 2017, she had had close followup with serial CA 19-9, and a measurement of this marker after identification of the lesion on MRI showed an elevation, which was confirmed on repeat testing (61 and 55 U/mL; normal <37 U/mL).

Prior to the current illness, he had been in the hospital multiple times for failure to thrive and respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation with high amount of supplemental O2 and inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) as he developed pulmonary hypertension (PH). Echocardiography showed progressive enlargement and hypertrophy of his right ventricle and at times bidirectional shunting across his ASD. A diagnostic cardiac catheterization as a preoperative evaluation was performed, which showed elevated pulmonary vascular resistance indexed (PVRi) at baseline (8.8 WU\u00b7m2), which decreased with inhaled oxygen alone and iNO (3.8 WU\u00b7m2). Additional catheterization data at baseline condition showed a right atrial mean pressure of 6 mmHg, right ventricular end diastolic pressure of 6 mmHg, and pulmonary artery pressure 51/19 mmHg with mean 32 mmHg. The patient was started on home O2 therapy with nasal cannula. The current hospitalization occurred prior to a planned fenestrated patch repair of his ASD.\nHe was initially admitted to the general ward and soon transferred to the pediatric ICU for severe hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.

The patient had undergone maxillary molar restoration treatment 2 years earlier, after which she reported biting regularly on her buccal mucosa. On most occasions, the wound had healed within a week, so she had not sought medical treatment. An extraoral examination revealed no facial swelling or asymmetry.

On palpation, the lesion was nontender and soft. The swelling had not expanded to the veins and was pulsatile. An orthopantomogram confirmed that the adjacent bone was intact. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a soft tissue mass with a clearly distinguishable outline of the buccinator muscle (Figure ). The lesion was surgically excised under local anesthesia with a margin of 3 mm and a depth of 2 mm via the inside surface of the fascia of the buccinator muscle. The outcome was favorable. Pathologic examination of the specimen revealed expanded lymphatic vessels lined by thin endothelial cells and containing lymphatic fluid.

Immunohistochemistry was negative for vascular markers such as CD31 and CD34, and the lymphatics stained specifically for D2-40 (podoplanin) (Figures , , ).

There was no family history of congenital heart disease, seizures, syncope, early sudden death, or family members requiring pacemakers or defibrillators.\nThe patient's ECG showed sinus rhythm at 50\u201360 bpm with normal PR, QRS, and corrected QT (QTc) intervals (). Due to the bradycardia, a Holter monitor was performed to evaluate her HR variability. The monitor showed sinus bradycardia with an average HR of 59 bpm and a minimum of 37 BPM. There was no atrioventricular (AV) conduction delay, and repolarization appeared normal. At rates greater than 110\u2013120 bpm, there were frequent polymorphic premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and bigeminy with runs of nonsustained bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (VT) at 211 BPM, suspicious for a clinical diagnosis of CPVT. Additionally, brief runs of a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) at a rate of 220 bpm were also noted (). The parents reported that their daughter was active at these times and free of any symptoms.\nAn echocardiogram performed to assess cardiac anatomy and function revealed an overall normal appearing heart with normal LV chamber size and systolic function, but with heavy trabeculations in the LV apex, suggestive of LVNC.

She denied any previous history of tobacco use or prior radiation exposure. Antibiotics resolved her dental pain without improvement of the right parotid swelling. She was then evaluated by head and neck surgery. Computed tomography (CT) of the head and neck revealed a 1.9 cm heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the anterior, superior superficial parotid gland without any enlarged nodes. She did not have any preoperative facial nerve involvement or lymphadenopathy. She underwent a total parotidectomy with clinically uninvolved margins. The complete facial nerve was dissected free of the neoplasm with gross preservation of function. Postoperatively, she had some weakness in the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve, along with weakness in closing her superior palpebral fissure of the right eye. Pathology of resected lesions revealed salivary duct carcinoma that was 1.7 cm in maximum dimension, positive for cytokeratin 7, HER2/neu equivocal 2+, and androgen receptor-positive. The tumor was negative for p40, mucin, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, TTF-1, SOX100, mammaglobin, p63, and s-100. HER2/neu was 1+ FISH not amplified.

Vitals revealed an elevated heart rate of 100 beats per minute and decreased respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute. Physical exam was significant for lethargic mentation and denuded abdominal wounds under her pannus. Bi-level positive airway pressure and intravenous clindamycin were started due to hypercapnic respiratory failure and concerns for infection. Chest X-ray showed hyperinflated lung volumes without obvious signs of pneumonia (Figure ). Arterial blood gases demonstrated elevated serum bicarbonate, consistent with chronic carbon dioxide retention. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and emergently intubated due to worsening respiratory status. General surgery recommended discontinuation of clindamycin in favor of local wound care.\nOn hospitalization day seven, palliative care was consulted around goals of care and tracheostomy tube placement. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube or gastrostomy tube placement were discussed for nutrition; however, the ICU and surgical teams presented concerns of abdominal wall thickness and potential displacement into the peritoneal and abdominal cavity. The family was counseled regarding the risks and benefits and elected to proceed with a tracheostomy tube and PEG placement with full code status. Standard approaches for tracheostomy and PEG tube placement were performed. Directly post-procedure, however, the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocols with phenylephrine, midazolam, cardioversion, and amiodarone were successively given in addition to a heparin drip, which stabilized the patient.

He became unresponsive during the injection with subsequent brief convulsive activity for which he was given 2 mg of midazolam. Emergency medical services was called and found him obtunded with shallow breathing and low oxygen saturations requiring ventilation assistance. On arrival to the ED his breathing was spontaneous and erratic with low oxygen saturations. He remained somnolent with slurred speech, unable to answer questions appropriately or follow commands. Preparations were made for intubation given altered mental status and low oxygen saturations; however, oxygen saturations and mental status improved within the first 10 minutes of arrival and ultimately intubation was not required.\nOn cardiopulmonary monitor he was noted to have an irregularly irregular heart rhythm. Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 82 beats per minute. Hemodynamically he was stable. He converted to normal sinus rhythm 20 minutes later. He reported no history of atrial fibrillation.

He was diagnosed with LC in 2001 and had 3 documented cases of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He underwent deceased donor liver transplantation due to uncontrolled ascites and hepatic encephalopathy in October, 2003. Fibrotic changes of the peritoneum were not observed during the operation. He underwent emergency operation for bleeding control after LT on postoperative day 3. His maintenance immunosuppressive agents were tacrolimus (FK), mycophenolic acid (MPA), and prednisone. His general condition continued to be stable. He was admitted for cholangitis 2 times in 2012 and treated with antibiotics without any interventions. He was admitted with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting 11 years after LT. His WBC count was within normal range (5.41 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L) and CRP level was increased (2.54 mg/dL). He complained of abdominal pain and distention, but rebound tenderness was not detected. The abdominal X-ray was not suggestive of mechanical obstruction. Contrast abdominal CT revealed a large amount of ascites and the small bowel wrapped within a fibrotic capsule (). His symptoms continued for 10 days after presentation and he, therefore, underwent surgical treatment. During the laparotomy, a thick fibrous membrane wrapping around the small intestine and colon was revealed. Careful dissection and excision of the thick membrane were performed to release the small intestine without additional injury to the intestinal serosa (). After surgery, tamoxifen 20 mg was administered twice a day and FK was replaced with mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus, target trough level: 5\u201310 ng/mL). Prednisolone was restarted at 4 mg twice a day. He was able to start oral feeding 5 days after surgery and was discharged 2 weeks later without any complication. The tamoxifen was maintained for 3 months. He was symptom-free for 1 year with continued treatment with sirolimus and predenisone.",

The size of the largest mass was 3.5\u00d73cm (Figure ). No family history of hereditary diseases was reported. The baby was delivered in the 38th week of gestation via Cesarean. Her birth weight was 2650g. She was unable to close her mouth and thus feeding was not possible. Her respiration was normal. The size of the swelling masses increased slowly after birth. Because of the feeding problems, an immediate surgery was planned. General anesthesia was placed in spare to manage intraoperative complications including blood asphyxiation and other airway-related problems. The feeder vessels were seen to originate from the alveolar ridge. Hence, a transfixion suture was placed slightly away from the lesion on the alveolar ridge so as to achieve pre-excision hemostasis and minimize the chances of intraoperative bleeding, which could endanger the airway.\nAll lesions were well defined, firm, round, smooth and pink in color on the cut surface. All alveolar masses were excised surgically without complications under general anesthesia on the sixth day after the birth of the baby, who was discharged on the third postoperative day. Postoperative recovery and surgical site healing were satisfactory.\nThe excised masses were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The tissue was submitted for histopathological examination. Immunohistochemical analyses were also carried out using a panel of antibodies, including vimentin, Ki-67, smooth muscle actin (SMA), synuclein (Syn), neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S-100. Corresponding positive and negative controls were performed in parallel for all the antibodies tested.\nMicroscopic examination showed a benign tumor composed of sheets of closely packed, large, rounded polygonal cells with abundant granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm and round to oval and lightly basophilic nuclei (Figure ).",

Biochemical and radiological assessment showed features of acute pancreatitis in terms of elevated pancreatic enzyme level, and CT abdomen finding showed edematous pancreas with normal ductal system. It was attributed to hormonal replacement therapy after thorough investigation. Although the patient had stopped the implicated medications, she still had recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis.\nSince there was no obvious cause found for her recurrent episodes of pancreatitis, autoimmune pancreatitis was suspected.\nThen, she underwent endoscopic ultrasound in 2015 which revealed mass swelling at the duodenal ampulla, and biopsy was taken. The biopsy showed ampullary adenoma with high-grade dysplasia (Figures and ).\nThen, the patient decided to go abroad for further assessment where she underwent Whipple's procedure and histopathology confirmed the presence of ampullary adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.\nUnfortunately, she continued to have recurrent episodes of pancreatitis despite the removal of the ampullary adenoma.\nIn 2016, while she was admitted under care of a surgical team for another episode of pancreatitis, she was reviewed by the rheumatology team to rule out autoimmune condition. Therefore, IgG4 level was tested (1.49 g/L (149 mg/dl)). The biopsy was reassessed and found to have increased IgG4-positive plasma cells around 30\u201340 per high-power field with the background of adenoma with high-grade dysplasia. Accordingly, she was diagnosed to have both IgG4-related disease and ampullary adenoma.\nShe was started on oral prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg and rituximab therapy with significant improvement over 1 year of follow-up as the pancreatitis attacks have reduced from around once in every month to around once in every 3 to 4 months after 3 months of rituximab therapy, and currently she remained attack free for around one year.",

There was no fever, jaundice, features of gastrointestinal bleed or altered sensorium. Ascitic fluid cytology (at private laboratories) was reported as positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis on polymerase chain reaction and the patient was started on antitubercular therapy. However, he had deterioration of liver function tests and the therapy was discontinued.\nOn examination, he had moderate ascites and mild pedal edema. Routine investigations revealed mild elevation of blood urea to 96 mg/dl and serum creatinine to 1.2 mg/dl. Biochemical and cytological analysis of the ascitic fluid showed it to be exudative in nature (protein 4.7 g/dl, total cell count 140/cu.mm.). Cytospin smears prepared from ascitic fluid showed lymphocytes and mesothelial cells in a mildly hemorrhagic background. In addition, occasional clusters and papillary fragments of cells having moderate amount of cytoplasm and central vesicular nucleus with distinct nucleoli were found [Figure \u2013]. Focal acinar arrangement was noted. The clusters had a smooth outer border. The observed cell clusters resembled mesothelial cells, however ruffled cytoplasmic borders and intercellular \u201cwindows\u201d were not identified in these clusters.\nFurther history was elicited, which revealed that the patient had undergone right radical nephrectomy two years earlier.

His past medical history included COPD, hypertension and chronic hyponatraemia. There was no history of immunocompromise however he was malnourished. Of note, there was no history of foreign travel, intravenous drug use or household pets however the patient had undergone four dental fillings in the preceding 12 months. Neurological examination indicated MRC grade 2/5 power throughout the left upper and lower limbs with increased tone. The patient was apyrexic with a CRP of 68 mg/L.\nA CT brain revealed a right frontal mass lesion with surrounding oedema which was concerning for malignancy when taken in conjunction with the weight loss. Investigations for a primary tumour were negative including a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis in addition to upper GI endoscopy. Tumour markers did not reveal any abnormality. Additional testing for immunocompromise including HIV was negative and no primary source of infection was identified. A subsequent MRI brain revealed a total of five ring-enhancing lesions with vasogenic oedema distributed throughout both cerebral hemispheres with the largest measuring >2 cm (Fig. ).\nCommencement of dexamethasone (8 mg twice-daily) initially resulted in a good clinical response. Image-guided excision of the right frontal abscess was undertaken and culture results identified Nocardia farcinica. Despite appropriate treatment with intravenous linezolid combined with imipenem and the subsequent addition of co-trimoxazole, repeat imaging demonstrated a continued increase in size of the remaining abscesses. Two further operations were performed over a 4-week period in addition to ongoing anti-microbial therapy. Resection of all abscesses was achieved through right frontal, right parietal, left parieto-occipital and left temporal craniotomies.

Blood pressure was 100/70 mmHg, pulse rate 100 beats/min and capillary refilling time (CRFT) was less than 2 s. On abdominal examination, there was no free fluid. Lung fields were clear on respiratory system examination. Other systems examination was normal.\nHer NS1 antigen was positive and serotype was identified as DEN1. She was managed as dengue fever with continuous monitoring. On the 3rd day of fever, she complained of retrosternal chest pain and undue tiredness. At that time her cardiovascular system examination was normal and electrocardiogram (ECG) showed acute T wave inversion in V2-V5 leads. Troponin I was negative and 2D echo showed global left ventricular hypokinesia and mild impairment of LV function. Ejection fraction was 40\u201345%. She was treated as having dengue fever complicated by myocarditis. Intravenous hydrocortisone 200 mg 8 hourly was administered for 2 days to reduce myocardial inflammation. On the 4rd day following admission, she complained of abdominal pain and ultrasound scanning revealed free fluid in hepato-renal pouch. Blood pressure was 100/70 mmHg, pulse rate 70 bpm, and CRFT was less than 2 s. She was taken to High Dependency Unit (HDU) and was managed as having DHF complicated with myocarditis with continuous monitoring and with careful administration of fluid to avoid fluid overload.

Iris neovascularization, 360\u00b0 closed angles with intraocular pressure of 48 mm Hg, and a choroidal mass with total retinal detachment were noted.

A diagnostic needle biopsy of the uveal mass revealed the presence of atypical cells in necrotic background suggestive of malignancy. The patient underwent lid-sparing exenteration of the right eye []. Histopathological examination of the exenterated specimen revealed the presence of mucoepidermoid carcinoma with multiple tumor emboli within the blood vessels of the orbital tissue [Fig. and ]. Extensive invasion into the orbital tissue, muscle fibers, sclera, choroid and optic nerve was noted. Postoperative period was uneventful. Before orbital exenteration, she also underwent computed tomography-guided biopsy of the cavitary lesion in the left lung that revealed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) [Fig. and ]. In view of the systemic spread, radiotherapy was advised.

Before departure, she was assessed by paramedics and deemed fit to undertake the eight-hour transatlantic flight to the United Kingdom.\nOn landing, she was referred to the local hospital emergency department where she was seen approximately 12 hours after the injury. She was in pain but was hemodynamically stable and had a patent airway. She was noted to have cutaneous injuries with associated swelling on the left side of her face and body but there was no obvious auditory, ophthalmic, dental, or internal organ trauma on clinical examination and no associated fractures on radiologic assessment. Her past medical history was unremarkable, with no regular medication or known drug allergies and she had normal developmental milestones. She was referred to a specialist center for a review of her cutaneous injuries, given oral morphine for her pain, and transferred across by ambulance.\nDetailed examination of her cutaneous injuries at the specialist center revealed a combination of blistering, friction-abrasion type injuries with bruising and swelling on the left malar area, cheek, and chin which were consistent with superficial partial-thickness burns.
