She first noticed a peanut size palpable accessory breast lesion at 10 weeks of pregnancy and during pregnancy the mass gradually increased along with pain. A similar symptom occurred in her last pregnancy 5 years ago, but the mass in left anterior chest wall was limited in the peanut size during the whole gestation period. A delayed surgical intervention was suggested. But the lump gradually regressed and disappeared after delivery.\nOn breast examination, two breasts looked symmetric with a couple accessory breasts below. The left accessory breast was obviously bigger than the right one that only had a light areola around a small nipple. An elastic, mobile well-circumscribed mass measuring approximately 15 cm \u00d7 15 cm was palpated on physical examination of the left accessory breast. Moreover, it was edematous and congestive with an increase in local temperature (Figure ). The breast ultrasound further demonstrated the mass was a relatively homogeneous solid with short stripe blood flow signal. A single live fetus of 37 weeks gestation was observed by abdominal ultrasound scan. So mammography and dynamic contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) were not performed. The patient also refused the core needle biopsy.\nDue to progressive enlargement of the lump, diabrosis with bleeding occurred on the third day after admission. Since the fetus had been mature in the 37th week of gestation, we decided to perform the excision of the mass and accessory breasts after caesarean section.

The cup\u2013disc ratio was 0.9 in the right eye and 0.2 in the left eye. The BCVA of the right and left eyes was hand movements and 6/60, respectively.

In addition, electroretinography (ERG) from the right eye were reduced and delayed to rod and cone stimulation, whereas ERG from the left eye appears to be normal. On the other hand, OCT examination revealed the presence of schisis involving the outer nuclear layer and to some extent in the inner nuclear layer and extending to involve the temporal half of the fovea. There also appeared to be an ODP with some areas of adjacent schisis to it but not extending to the fovea. OCT examination of the retinal nerve fiber layer confirmed marked optic atrophy in the right eye, but this was normal in the left eye. Overall, these findings were consistent with a left ODP maculopathy, which was quite significant since there was a loss of photoreceptors and the outer nuclear layer. However, there was no evidence of widespread retinal dystrophy in either eye.\nFollowing a discussion with the patient, he agreed to proceed with the least invasive of the treatment options, which is focal retinal laser treatment.

No history of abdominal pain, constipation or any other bowel disturbances were present. There was no history of trauma and urinary or other abdominal complaints. There was no history suggestive of an inguinal hernia in the past, and nor was there a history of any type of surgical intervention.\nPatient was clinically examined and multiple openings were noticed in right inguinal region with faecal and pus discharge (Fig. ). Diagnosis of spontaneous faecal fistula was made and possibilities of appendicular abscess, tuberculosis of intestine, Crohn\u2019s disease carcinoma colon, and actinomycosis were kept. Fistula was a low output fistula and patient was started on medical treatment and investigated thoroughly. On CT scan a small gut loop communicating with anterior abdominal wall and bilateral renal and hepatic cysts was reported with provisional diagnosis of enterocutaneous fistula and autosomal polycystic kidney disease.\nThere was no improvement in patient\u2019s condition and patient had continuous faecal discharge. Exploratory laparotomy was planned. On opening the abdomen, a loop of distal ileum (about 20 cms proximal to ileocaecal junction) was found to be adherent to the internal inguinal ring which was retrieved back into the abdominal cavity (Fig. ). There was perforation over the loop stuck in the deep inguinal ring. Resection of the segment of ileum (Fig. ) involved was done with ileo-ileal hand sewn anastomosis. Mesh repair was not done for hernia defect due to faecal contamination and cellulitis. The internal inguinal ring was closed from inside of the peritoneal cavity with plicating sutures.

    "original_text": "We present a case of a 58-year-old female patient with a large recurrent ventral hernia. Six years before, the patient had been operated on for the umbilical hernia, with the simple repair without a mesh. The patient was an active smoker who suffered from morbid obesity with a body mass index of 43 kg/m2 and COPD as comorbidities relevant for this case report.\nThe patient was introduced to the surgeon during hospitalization at the gastroenterology department where a diagnostic workup due to a clinical picture of chronic small bowel obstruction was conducted. While taking the anamnesis, the patient reported frequent abdominal cramps, swelling, and pain in the area of the hernia that had intensified in the last few weeks. The physical examination revealed a large irreducible ventral hernia in the lower abdomen that was quite painful on palpation, but soft and, at that time, without signs of incarceration or strangulation. Taking into account the clinical picture with threatening hernia incarceration, the surgeon did not opt for preoperative optimization of the patient in terms of smoking cessation and starting a weight loss program but made an indication for semielective surgery.\nOn operative procedure, greater omentum, part of the transverse colon, and a cluster of small bowel loops with signs of chronic obstruction were found as hernial content. After adhesiolysis hernial content was reduced into the abdominal cavity.

An abdominal CT scan revealed pancreatic cystic lesions and pancreatic duct dilatation, and the patient was referred to our hospital for further examination on December 27. The patient had a history of hyperlipidemia for which she was being treated, but no history of pancreatitis or abdominal trauma, and no notable family history. The patient did not smoke or drink alcohol. Examination results on admission were as follows: height, 157 cm, weight, 40 kg, and body temperature 37.2\u00b0C. The patient was alert and her abdomen was soft and flat with no palpable masses. The patient had tenderness in the epigastrium but no rebound or guarding.\nHer blood chemistry revealed a slight elevation of the pancreatic enzymes amylase and elastase 1. While no other evidence of inflammation could suggest active pancreatitis, a slight elevation of the tumor marker CA19-9 was detected.\nAbdominal ultrasonography (US) revealed a multilocular cystic lesion of 45 mm in length with node-like projections in the body of the pancreas. The main pancreatic duct was noticeably dilated from the body to the tail. The pancreatic parenchyma was overall atrophic, and her echogenicity was moderate. Comorbidity with chronic pancreatitis was suspected. An abdominal CT revealed a cystic lesion with a relatively thick septum-like structure in the body of the pancreas. A solid component with slight contrast enhancement was noted inside the cyst. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed a multilocular cystic lesion in the body of the pancreas, and continuity with the main pancreatic duct that was slightly dilated more distally was suspected (fig. ).

Both of those lesions were surgically excised at the time of development. She had also developed a right orbital tumor at the age of 13, which was monitored without any treatment.

In the biopsy sample, a lot of dilated capillaries were observed in the mucosa (fig. , arrows), indicating that the lesion was a capillary hemangioma/malformation, but not infantile hemangioma. Radiation therapy and surgical excision were considered but rejected due to a risk of visual loss since the lesion was too close to the optic nerve. Fortunately, the right proptosis with ocular pain had almost disappeared 2 months later with no treatment other than the biopsy.

All these had affected her marriage of three years to a point of divorce. On evaluation she was found to have a normal female genotype with well-developed secondary sexual characteristics. Pelvic examination revealed a vaginal dimple with no palpable uterus (Fig. ). An abdominal ultrasound scan revealed presence of both ovaries with a streak like or rudimentary uterus. The rest of the pelvic organs were normal. A preoperative diagnosis of vaginal agenesis due to MRKH syndrome was made. A decision to do surgery of creating a new vagina by using a modification of the McIndoe procedure was decided. Counseling of the patient about the surgical procedure with emphasis on the expectations was done. We explained to the patient that the procedure would improve her sexual life but would have no effect on her ability to conceive which she accepted and consented to the operation. Bowel preparation using soap enema plus overnight fasting was done prior to the operation. After induction of anesthesia, the patient was put in lithotomy position. The vulva was cleaned with antiseptic solution then draped. A urethral catheter of size 16 was inserted into the bladder. A transverse incision was made on the vaginal dimple to open into the rectovesical space. Bunt dissection was continued until a length of about 9 cm and 3 cm in width was achieved.

Her past surgical history was pertinent for a bilateral tubal ligation in 1991. After examination by her general gynecologist, she was found to have an enlarged uterus. No additional preoperative testing was performed. In November 1996, she underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The frozen section diagnosis revealed a uterine stromal tumor with rare mitotic figures. The final pathology diagnosed an International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA endometrial stromal sarcoma extending to the outer one third of the myometrium []. The fallopian tubes, ovaries, and uterine serosa were negative for malignancy. The uterus weighed 647 grams and measured 12.9 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 7 cm. Her postoperative course was uneventful and she required no further therapy. She continued her followup care under the management of her general gynecologist and remained without evidence of disease for two months.\nA surveillance computer tomography of the abdomen and pelvis performed in January 1997 showed three 4-5 mm nodular densities in the right lower lobe of the lung. The densities were too small to biopsy and no comparison films were available. The patient was asymptomatic and therefore was managed conservatively. The lung densities remained stable in size until August 1997 when one density was found to have increased to 15 \u00d7 14 mm. A lung biopsy of the largest lesion was suspicious, but not diagnostic for a malignancy. The enlarged lung density was thought to clinically represent recurrent disease and the patient was referred to a medical oncologist in her area who recommended cytotoxic chemotherapy.

A swab culture was done, which led to the identification of Citrobacter koseri. The patient was admitted to the general ward for further workup and initiated on intravenous (IV) ciprofloxacin (400 mg every 12 hours).\nThe patient had undergone right upper lobectomy and thymectomy 35 years ago via posterolateral thoracotomy followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. A chest computed tomography scan revealed chronic empyema with a right apical calcified sac with an air-fluid level and chest wall abscess, for which continuity to the pleural space could not be excluded ().\nAn elliptical skin incision was made around the fistula orifice at the second and third intercostal spaces (ICSs) along the right side of the sternum at the costosternal junction. After removing the infected bony chest wall, we entered the empyema cavity and evacuated the pus and necrotic materials. A sump drainage tube was inserted into the cavity for subsequent irrigation and drainage.\nTreatment with IV antibiotics was continued, and daily chest tube irrigation with 1 L of taurolidine-mixed purified water was performed for local infection control. Subsequently, a pleural fluid culture study was performed every 5 days, and no bacterial growth was observed. However, the patient remained febrile for 36 days after the initial operation; thus, we delayed the second stage of the operation. After discontinuing the irrigation using the chemical agent, the patient was afebrile and in a suitable condition for thoracomyoplasty.

The parents provided the history of living in a one-roomed dwelling of a slum, which also served both as a computer hardware assembling and repairing workshop of the father and, usually, was cluttered with computer accessories. History suggested that the child had ingested a battery cell while playing in the vicinity of the dismantled spares of computer sets and started retching, vomiting, coughing and choking and turned pale soon after swallowing something. The caregivers had an unsuccessful attempt at retrieving the object. The father had brought along with him a sample of the battery cell to support the suspicion, which resembled a five rupees coin with smooth edges.\nA high-risk informed consent was taken after counseling the caregivers for the procedure, explaining in detail the risks with the advantages and disadvantages involved in anesthesia and the course of actions of further interventions. In the preliminary history and clinical examination, the child had dehydration and mild stridor, but showed no batter marks on the body to exclude a case of child abuse. X-ray PA view of the chest and neck was performed immediately in the emergency room, which confirmed the impaction of the foreign body [].\nThe toddler was rushed to the observation room of the emergency services at our center.

    "original_text": "A 61-year-old man underwent resection of a part of his tongue due to tongue cancer and was admitted to our hospital for hepatocellular carcinoma with about 5 cm diameter of tumor at the liver segment IV. Computed tomography (CT) showed that the tumor was enhanced during the arterial phase and washed out during the portal phase, and the tumor pressed the right anterior branch to the main branch of Glisson and the middle hepatic vein; hence, the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma was made (Fig. ). The indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min was 21.8%. Child-Pugh score was A. The patient tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody. He had a history of excessive consumption of alcohol, and alcoholic liver damage was considered as a possibility. Partial hepatectomy with segments IV + V and cholecystectomy with cystic duct-tube drainage were performed. Intraoperative findings indicated that the anterior branch of bile duct was exposed at the resected area, and some small bile ducts were ligated. On POD 1 following hepatectomy, bile leakage developed from the drain placed in the foramen of Winslow. CT showed fluid collection in the cavity between the liver and fistula to drain. Cholangiography via the endoscopic bile duct enhancement showed no communication between the common bile duct and abdominal cavity. Drip infusion cholangiography (DIC)-CT revealed the bile duct of the peripheral side. We maintained simple drainage to reduce the cavity. On POD 19, this patient had fever and CT revealed that the fluid collection has increased (Fig. ). Percutaneous drainage to the cavity near the liver cut surface was performed. Cholangiography via the c-tube did not show the anterior branch of the bile duct. Fistulogram from the drainage tube at the abdominal cavity showed the bile duct at segments V and VIII (Fig. ). We diagnosed the bile leakage from the isolated bile duct of segments V and VIII. Further management was needed to control the persistent biliary leak of 200\u2013250 mL/day",

His family reported that he had periods of depression during his late teenage years, when he left the merchant navy after only a few weeks, and in the third and fourth decade of his life. He neither sought nor received any treatment for these episodes. He never married, had no children, and did not work after leaving the navy. He lived alone following the death of his cohabiting parents and relied heavily on his siblings and nieces for assistance with food shopping and house maintenance. Notably, his mother had a history of recurrent depression with inpatient psychiatric admissions requiring ECT.\nThe patient\u2019s family report him having always been different in personality. He struggled in social settings, found it hard to make friends, and had never been in a romantic relationship. He was obsessional about routine and was known as a child to pace and exhibit repetitive actions when anxious. He also had very specific and intense interests, such as obsessively learning the Latin names of plants. He had not previously been diagnosed with a childhood or developmental mental disorder. His only medical history consisted of a tonsillectomy and childhood scarlet fever. He took no regular medication, did not smoke cigarettes, and consumed no alcohol, and there was no recreational drug use. He was not known to the social care service and had no forensic history.\nAt the start of the current episode, the patient was referred for an urgent mental health consultation by his GP owing to concerns about his mental state over the preceding few weeks.

There was no family history of migraine or stroke. She did not smoke and had never used oral contraceptives, hormonal treatment or illicit drugs. She had been otherwise healthy. Earlier on the day of presentation, the patient experienced an aura of tingling in her left hand that rapidly progressed to involve her left face and leg. The patient subsequently developed a complete left hemiplegia. One hour after the onset of symptoms, the patient was found to also have a complete left hemisensory loss. Her symptoms resolved completely as she was undergoing a head computed tomography (CT) scan and CT angiography, both of which were normal. There was no evidence of cerebral vasculopathy. Following the CT angiography the patient developed another episode of transient left hemiplegia that rapidly improved but left a residual mild pronator drift.

Past history included an admission to hospital 8 years before for fever, swelling and severe pain of the right knee. Needle aspiration, as well as irrigation and debridement, was performed and the patient was diagnosed with septic arthritis.

She showed no signs and symptoms of neurological complications, except for pain and allodynia, before and after the cardiovascular surgeries.\nDuring the first examination at our pain clinic, she complained of spontaneous burning pain and severe allodynia from her neck to her hand; her left hand was swollen, pale, and hot.

Because she was being administered anticoagulant therapy, many of the available neural blockades could not be used, except for a regional intravenous nerve blockade (Bier block, with 20 mL of 0.5% lidocaine). This neural blockade was performed 4 times per week concurrently with oral administration of a tricyclic antidepressant, nortriptyline (20 mg); this treatment resulted in the gradual reduction of pain and allodynia, which allowed the patient to receive physiotherapy. One month after treatment, pain and allodynia symptoms were nearly eliminated and swelling had also diminished. Additionally, her upper limb motor disturbance was significantly improved.\nOne hour after the 18th Bier block, the patient suddenly experienced a major epileptic seizure and lost consciousness during physiotherapy.

Blood test showed the presence of mild inflammation, with a CRP value of 7 mg/l (within normal values) and an elevated white blood cell count of 18 G/l. The rest of the laboratory results were normal. Emergency ultrasonography was unhelpful because of air interference. An abdominal CT scan () showed diffuse subcutaneous abdominal emphysema extending to the pelvis on the left side that was more pronounced on the right inguinal fossa with a bowel loop in contact with the abdominal wall. An emergency laparotomy centered on the McBurney incision showed feces and pus within the subcutaneous compartment. Furthermore, at the level of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, an inflammatory diverticulum could be seen fistulizing between the lumen of the sigmoid colon loop and the necrotic subcutaneous tissue.

    "original_text": "A 53-year-old Caucasian British woman originally presented to her local hospital in 2002 with shortness of breath secondary to atrial fibrillation. During the admission, chest radiography revealed widespread pulmonary nodular infiltrates, and a subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the presence of widespread pulmonary metastases, most marked in the lower lung fields (Figure ). The CT scan also demonstrated extensive retroperitoneal and para-aortic lymphadenopathy and hepatic abnormalities consistent with metastases, but no obvious primary site for the disease (Figure ).\nBefore admission, our patient had no symptoms of liver dysfunction and her medical history was otherwise unremarkable. She had no family history of malignancy. Routine haematology, clotting, serum biochemistry and liver function tests, hepatitis screen and tumour markers were all within normal limits. After the standard medical management for atrial fibrillation was completed, a CT-guided biopsy of the predominant hepatic lesion was performed.\nHistological examination of the biopsy confirmed the presence of an infiltrating tumour with pleomorphic elongated cells that stained positively with the vascular markers Factor VIII, CD31, and CD34. These morphological and immunohistochemical features were consistent with the diagnosis of HEH. In the presence of disseminated disease, surgical management was not indicated, and our patient was referred to the oncology team for ongoing management.\nIn response to radiological evidence of disease progression, first-line therapy with interferon was commenced in accordance with the dosing recommendations published in an earlier case report []. A CT scan performed after three months therapy demonstrated stable disease; however, as our patient was experiencing significant interferon-related side effects, the treatment was discontinued. After a six-month break from therapy, there was evidence of disease progression within the spleen seen on an updated CT scan, and the decision was taken to explore treatment with thalidomide.\nStarting initially at 100 mg per day, the dose of the drug was increased at weekly intervals up to 400 mg.

His medical history included coronary artery disease status post-coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention, and a history of pneumonia. Preoperative cystoscopy revealed enlarged median and lateral lobes, as well as severe trabeculations of the bladder with a TRUS measuring a 41 cc prostate. HoLEP was carried out utilizing a two-incision technique. Upon completion of morcellation, it was noted that the patient's abdomen was distended, but his peak airway pressures were normal, the abdomen was soft, and the catheter drainage was noted to be clear. In addition, there was no suspicion for a significant mismatch between irrigation used and fluid output collected in the drainage system.\nGiven the previous similar presentation in Case 1 with no suspicion of bladder injury, we suspected that the patient had extraperitoneal extravasation of the saline irrigation through a capsular perforation as occurred in Case 1. The decision was made for the patient to be awakened, extubated, and transferred to the recovery room where he was further monitored. A stat noncontrast abdominal CT scan was performed that revealed a moderate amount of free fluid in the pelvis and upper abdomen; the fluid in the pelvis and lower abdomen was distributed in the extraperitoneal region with no evidence of hematoma (). The patient remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the floor with continuous bladder irrigation. The patient was given a 40 mg dose of Lasix \u223c8 hours after the operation was completed. Overnight, there were no acute events. On POD 1, the patient's abdomen was soft and significantly less distended. The Foley catheter drained 3950 cc of urine overnight without evidence of hematuria.
