An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Laboratory investigations were within normal limits except for a low TSH and elevated free T3 and T4. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a large echogenic mobile mass with central constriction attached to the interventricular septum (IVS), occupying the entire right atrium and right ventricle (RV) and obstructing the flow of the tricuspid valve. There were two other masses of the same echogenicity: one was occupying the left ventricle (LV) and the other was in the left atrium attached to the interatrial septum at the site of fossa ovalis (, Videos ). The left ventricular dimensions and function were normal. Cardiac magnetic resonance showed similar findings with no septal invasion and tissue characterization suggestive of multiple myxomas (). Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed the same findings () in addition to an enlarged thyroid nodule and a left adrenal cyst that measures 65 \u00d7 57 mm (). Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland revealed a markedly enlarged right lobe of the thyroid with normal vascularity. Serum aldosterone, dexamethasone suppression test, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and 24-hour urine metanephrines were within normal limits.\nThe patient underwent surgery where all three masses were excised. However, the tricuspid valve was inseparable from the RV mass; hence, it was replaced with a tissue prosthesis. The masses were grossly reddish grey in color, fleshy, and gelatinous in consistency ().

Chest radiograph showed a small amount of right side pneumothorax (). Her vital signs were stable, and no respiratory distress was noted. Five months before this event, she visited our outpatient clinic for bilateral heel pain; ankylosing spondylitis was suspected at that time, but examinations showed no sacroiliitis or other evidence of the disease, and she received symptomatic treatment only. For the pneumothorax, the patient was discharged from the emergency department after conservative oxygen therapy. However, the symptoms did not resolve. Chest computed tomography performed 5 days after symptom onset showed persistent right side pneumothorax. In addition, consolidations and reticular opacities involving the pleural and subpleural regions indicating fibrosis at bilateral upper and middle lung zones were noted ( and ). She was admitted to our hospital for surgical intervention. Eleven days after symptom onset, she received video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). During the surgery, multiple blebs and consolidated areas in right upper, middle and lower lobes were noted. The lesions were wedge-biopsied, and mechanical pleurodesis was performed. The patient recovered well after the surgery.\nThree lung wedge biopsies were received for examination. No obvious blebs were seen on the pleura surface, but the pleura appeared thickened, and the parenchyma immediately below the pleura was consolidated. Microscopically, small blebs and foci of intrapleural hemorrhage were seen in all three wedges. Fibrosis of the visceral pleura was noted in the specimens from all three lobes, more significant in the upper lobe ().

Her blood tests revealed raised inflammatory markers and a raised bilirubin of 87 \u00b5mol/L (reference range < 20 \u00b5mol/L). She was admitted under the gastroenterologists and treated for ascending cholangitis with intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis without signs of cholecystitis.\nOn day 1 of her admission, she underwent an ERCP. Her common bile duct (CBD) was cannulated with a guidewire and her CBD was swept via balloon with multiple stones extracted. A sphincterotomy was performed and a CBD stent was placed in an acceptable position and bile flowed freely through the stent. The ERCP recovery was uneventful and after convalescence with antibiotics, the patient was referred to the general surgeons. One week after ERCP, she proceeded to have a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Surgery was uneventful and upon discharge she was booked to have a repeat ERCP and removal of CBD stents under the gastroenterology team. Unfortunately due to the coronavirus pandemic, her appointment was postponed by several months.\nAfter 5 months, the patient was admitted for elective ERCP with stent removal. During the procedure, her CBD stent was removed, a guidewire was again passed in to the biliary tree and a balloon sweep was undertaken, which removed further CBD stones. Post-procedure in the recovery department, the patient complained of right shoulder tip pain and worsening RUQ pain. This settled with analgesia and she was discharged home from the endoscopy suite.

Upon fundus examination an inferior macular involving chronic retinal detachment was observed (Fig. a). The patient was scheduled for a left eye vitrectomy and had an uneventful surgery on the 21st of September 2012. On the 1st post operative day his visual acuity was noted to be counting fingers with a reattached retina. At the next visit 1-week post surgery, he complained of pain in the left eye and vision remained limited to counting fingers but improved marginally to 6/60 with pinhole. At a subsequent visit he complained of reduced vision and foreign body sensation. His vision was reduced to hand motion, and he developed hyperemia and keratic precipitates. Posterior segment examination revealed opaque silicone oil. A faint retinal view could be seen. At his next visit few days later, there was severe conjunctival hyperemia, increasing number of anterior chamber cells and hypopyon. Due to this presentation and a heightened index of suspicion for SORE, the patient was scheduled for immediate silicone oil removal. On the 5th of October 2011, the silicone oil was removed. The procedure involved extraction of the silicone oil, multiple irrigation of the vitreous cavity with vancomycin and ceftazidime (in a concentration of 1 mg/0.1 ml and 2 mg/0.1 ml respectively) into a fluid filled eye. After this irrigation of the vitreal cavity, multiple air fluid exchange was performed. Then, 0.1 ml each of vancomycin, ceftazidime and dexamethasone was injected into the vitreous cavity.

    "original_text": "A 20-year-old male patient presented with right-sided genu valgum deformity and 2 cm true shortening without DNVD. The patient had a history of trauma over the right knee 5 years ago which was managed conservatively with a splint. The patient noticed right knee deformity at the age of 16 years which progressed gradually until the age of 19 years. The deformity is non-progressive since then. The patient complained of occasional pain over knee. On examination, no tenderness over knee could be elicited and patellar tracking was normal. There was no ligamentous laxity around knee. His medical history and family history were unremarkable. The patient wanted correction of deformity and consented for surgery for same.\nSpecific pre-operative radiological investigations performed were standing bilateral lower limb scanogram for exact measurement of deformity (essential for bony deformities []) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate both compartments of knee. () shows pre-operative scanogram. On scanogram, angles were calculated on computer software to avoid manual error and to take account of magnification on the film. Lateral distal femoral angle was 67\u00b0 with knee joint line obliquity of 7\u00b0 varus which is abnormal. Joint line obliquity on opposite side was 3\u00b0 varus. When adjusted for joint line obliquity, genu valgum deformity turned out to be 16\u00b0 at the level of distal femur.

On imaging, the liver tumor involved all three hepatic veins, pressed on the porta hepatis, splayed out the right portal vein, and compressed the right portal vein. He had evidence of portal hypertension with an enlarged spleen and varices in the splenic hilum, collateral vessels within the abdominal walls, and a recanalized umbilical vein.

Five years prior to this admission, she had been admitted to our hospital because of hemoptysis of 150 mL/day for two consecutive days. At that time, hemoptysis spontaneously stopped. We had not examined her since the previous discharge. On this admission, her respiratory rate and pulse oximetry on room air were 21 breaths/min and 90%, respectively. Seven hours after the admission, her respiratory condition suddenly deteriorated. Oxygen supply of 10 L/min from a mask with reservoir bag was insufficient to maintain her respiratory condition. She was immediately intubated. Plain chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed bronchiectasis of the right middle lobe and both lower lobes (). Compared with 5 years before (), bronchiectasis was deteriorated slightly in the right middle and both lower lobes. Bronchoscopy identified hemoptysis from the right lower lobes. No malignant tumor was detected by these examinations. Thus, we suspected the bronchiectasis as the cause of the hemoptysis. Subsequent bronchial arterial angiography unexpectedly found two unruptured mediastinal BAAs arising from the right bronchial artery, as well as a slight hemorrhage from the peripheral arteries of these BAAs (). We were concerned about rapidly increasing pressure to the BAAs and rupturing them if we were to embolize only the peripheral arteries. Thus, we had to embolize both the mediastinal BAAs and peripheral arteries at one stage. We suspended the bronchial artery embolization (BAE) because of a lack of preparation for BAE of the unexpected BAAs. Thereafter, an enhanced CT scan revealed that these aneurysms were enlarged () compared with those seen in the past CT ().

The above symptoms started abruptly with disturbances in sleep. She would sleep for 2\u20133 hours with breaks at night. She would become irritable on trivial issues. She would get aggressive and would even attack her family members without any provocation. She stopped talking to people but rarely would talk to the family members only. On being questioned, she would either remain mum or would answer in few words which would not make much sense to others. She would often use abusive language without any reason. She would not participate in her routine chores and need assistance even for her personal care. On several occasions, she was found talking to self, occasionally laughing without any reason, and crying to self. She would hardly ask for food and need to be fed under supervision.\nThere was no precipitating factor. There was no history suggestive of any substance abuse, anxiety, panic, obsession, compulsion, phobia, depression, unconsciousness, seizures, or any trauma.\nHer premorbid functioning revealed no abnormality. In the past, there was no history suggestive of any psychiatric illness, seizures, and head injury. In her family history too, nothing significant could be detected. She was educated up to the 12th standard and was an average student. Her menstrual cycles were regular.\nOn general examination, her pulse rate and blood pressure were within the normal limits, and nothing abnormal was detected in other parameters.

An abdominal CT scan showed a 4.5 \u00d7 4.1 cm periampullary mass arising from the pancreas without evidence of metastatic disease. Interestingly, the CT scan also showed the colon to be in a dorsal position in relation to the SMA (). Laboratory analysis revealed normal liver function tests and serum CEA level but an elevated CA 19-9 level. At operative exploration, the entire transverse colon was found to be retroperitoneal and lies dorsal to the SMA and SMV. The duodenum coursed anterior rather than posterior to the mesenteric vessels. The SMA lies further to the right than normal and the SMV\u2013portal vein confluence lies further to the left than usual. Inspection of the duodenum and head of the pancreas revealed a firm mass in the head of the pancreas. A classic pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. The anterior placement of the duodenum made division of the jejunum beyond the ligament of Treitz relatively easy. The tumor dissected nicely away from the SMA with no uncinate process of the pancreas present. Our standard procedure is to bring the jejunal limb for reconstruction up in a retrocolic position, through a defect made in the transverse mesocolon to the right of the middle colic vessels. This limb is used to create the pancreaticojejunostomy, hepaticojejunostomy, and gastrojejunostomy. Due to the retroperitoneal position of the transverse colon, we brought the jejunal limb up in an antecolic position. Pathology revealed a moderately differentiated PDA with all surgical margins being free of tumor and 1 out of 11 specimen lymph nodes was positive for metastatic disease. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged to home on postoperative day 5. The patient eventually developed recurrent disease and died 34 months postresection.",

Her chest discomfort began the day prior to presentation, but she initially attributed it to indigestion and thus waited to seek medical attention. Her chest pain persisted however, which prompted her to seek evaluation in the emergency department. Upon arrival, she was given aspirin with resolution of her symptoms. Laboratory analysis revealed an elevated troponin I level of 0.319 and initial creatine kinase (CK) of 12.7. Brain natriuretic peptide level on presentation was not checked. Electrocardiogram (ECG) was notable for diffuse T-wave inversions demonstrating inferior, as well as anterolateral ischemia, and a prolonged QTc of 503 ms (). Echocardiogram demonstrated moderate left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction of 35%-40%) with mid to distal anteroseptal, anterolateral, and apical akinesis (). The patient was taken to the catheterization suite and underwent emergent left heart catheterization. Angiography revealed 90% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery (RCA) which was believed to be the culprit lesion. There were no significant obstructive lesions noted in the left anterior descending or left circumflex arteries. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with successful stent placement to the RCA (). She was then started on appropriate guideline-directed medical therapy and observed in the intensive care unit where her chest pain resolved. Repeat laboratory analysis revealed that CK had decreased to 6.4. ECG obtained following PCI revealed interval improvement of the inferior T-wave inversions, with sustained T-wave abnormalities in the anterolateral leads (). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is not available at our facility and was not performed.

The patient had undergone left partial nephrectomy in 2012 for a left lower nonfunctioning moiety with gross ureterohydronephrosis in a duplex system. The follow-up ultrasound of whole abdomen showed a large left renal cyst. In 2015, she had undergone endoscopy with excision of transverse vaginal septum for hematocolpos.\nIn August 2016, the patient presented with complaints of abdominal pain. The computed tomography urography revealed an enlarged left kidney with a large 70 mm cystic area with splaying of the upper and middle calyces. Incidentally, heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue density lesion was seen in relation to the tail of the pancreas abutting the spleen and the left kidney with the cyst []. A tentative diagnosis of a residual urine collection at the left nephrectomy site and an incidental tumor of the tail of the pancreas was discovered. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was done from the tail of the pancreas and the renal cyst. The cytological examination of the renal cyst aspirate showed only few inflammatory cells and no malignant cells. The pancreatic FNAC showed smears composed of a monotonous population of neoplastic cells. The cells were arranged in loose groups, singly dispersed, and around fibrovascular hyalinized stalks [ and ]. The cells showed minimal anisonucleosis, with delicate cytoplasm, round to oval, regular nuclei with finely granular chromatin. Pinkish myxoid material was seen between the cell clusters and in the background [ and ]. No mitotic figures or necrosis was identified. The diagnosis was suggestive of SPN of the pancreas. In December 2016, she underwent distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and recovered uneventfully.

On the seventh day of admission, she underwent diagnostic colonoscopy which showed diverticulosis with local infection, two sessile polyps in the transverse and sigmoid colon (SC), and a large malignant appearing mass of the proximal ascending colon ()). Though she had a previous CT of the abdomen showing SC diverticulitis, the ascending colon mass could not be seen since it was done as a non-contrast CT. Because of a possible colon malignancy, a CT with contrast of chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed for staging in which a focal density measuring 4 cm x 2.4 x 3.9 cm was found within the proximal ascending colon ()). The ascending colon mass was limited to the colon without lymph node or distant metastasis. Tumor markers (CA and CEA) were not elevated. Histopathology was consistent with tubular adenoma polyps and tubulo-villous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia in the ascending colon mass. Diagnostic features of invasive cancer were absent; however, the reliability of biopsy was limited because of the large size of the mass and focal collection of biopsy specimens. Therefore, absence of malignancy could not be completely ruled out and a right robotic hemicolectomy was planned. Additional indication for surgical resection in this patient was the likelihood of bowel obstruction in the near-future due to the large size of the mass. Elective surgery was scheduled, and the patient was discharged home. Before elective hemicolectomy, the patient initiated a bowel preparation with polyethylene glycol.

Her surgical history was significant for a mitral valve replacement and bilateral tubal ligation.\nThe initial workup of her postmenopausal bleeding included a pelvic ultrasound and endometrial biopsy. The ultrasound revealed a heterogeneous and enlarged uterus with an endometrial stripe of 4.7 mm. The myometrium did not appear hypervascular. No free fluid was noted in the pelvis (). The right ovary was difficult to visualize, however, two small simple-appearing cysts were visualized on her left ovary. The endometrial biopsy showed predominantly blood and scant inactive endometrium with extensive glandular and stromal breakdown. Once pathology was confirmed to be benign, the patient was started on medroxyprogesterone to decrease bleeding in preparation for her initial procedure.\nThe patient underwent an uncomplicated hysteroscopy, dilation and curettage, and endometrial ablation. No cervical stenosis was noted. Evaluation of the endometrial cavity revealed a normal cavity without polyps or other cavity-distorting pathology, and the endometrial lining appeared thin. A hysteroscopy was performed after the ablation which noted a small area at the uterine fundus to be incompletely ablated.\nThe patient was contacted on postoperative day one and reported she was feeling well with minimal vaginal bleeding. She was instructed to discontinue the medroxyprogesterone and restart her Coumadin. She presented for a routine postoperative visit on day seven and continued to endorse minimal vaginal bleeding.

    "original_text": "A 42-year-old Chinese man presented to the outpatient clinic of otorhinolaryngology at Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, in September 2018, complaining of right ear discharge accompanied by discomfort for 3 years. The patient had a history of seawater contact in August 2015, including underwater diving near the coast of the Yellow Sea near Qingdao City, Shandong Province. After a couple of days, the patient noticed a small volume of clear drainage from both ears, accompanied by mild discomfort and ear pruritus. As the condition progressed, drainage from the left ear gradually vanished within half a month, whereas the drainage from the right side increased and became a thick, purulent exudate containing debris, eventually turning a dark brown or chocolate color. As the ear canal became almost entirely obstructed by the thick excretion, the patient experienced mild hearing loss, coupled with intermittent tinnitus, and experienced a sensation of ear fullness. Without the use of any medications, he removed debris from the right ear using cotton swabs, resulting in a return to normal hearing and the relief of symptoms. Within a few days, new thick drainage would obstruct the ear canal, and the symptoms would reappear. The patient sought health care twice at local hospitals in Xi\u2019an City from Shaanxi Province; however, the underlying illness remained unidentified and did not improve.

The brain MRI, performed in another hospital, revealed a suprasellar/parasellar tumor with an enhancing solid portion with associated multiple cystic structures. The lesion was treated with surgical debulking and subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Society of Paediatric Oncology low-grade glioma 2004 protocol). The final diagnosis of pilomyxoid astrocytoma of the hypothalamic-chiasmatic region was made histopathologically. After about 2 years, the patient presented headache and paresthesia in the right upper limb. The brain MRI revealed some new small areas of T2-hyperintensities in the left perirolandic region suspected for ischemic vascular lesions. The diagnosis of MMS was done basing on the arterial MRI angiography which detected the narrowing of the left ICA and the occlusion of the ipsilateral MCA [Figure \u2013].\nAfter about 3 months from the onset of symptoms, the patient, admitted at another institution, underwent an indirect surgical revascularization with burr holes technique in the left frontal, parietal, and temporal bones.\nAt the follow-up controls performed every 6 months in our hospital, the neurologic symptoms persisted and the patient showed a rapid impairment of cognitive functions, showing a loss of 10 points at the full-scale intelligence quotient (wechsler intelligence scale for children V). MRI brain perfusion confirmed the hypoperfusion of the left MCA territory with minimal improvement only in the left temporal lobe. Therefore, a new indirect revascularization was planned to guarantee an adequate perfusion. Before the surgery, it was necessary to determine which burr holes developed angiogenesis and which was the relationship between the successful burr holes and the brain areas that remained hypoperfused.

On examination, his abdomen was slightly tender and bowel sounds were present. Initially, focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) showed mild intraperitoneal fluid in his pelvis. A subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of his abdomen revealed mild pelvic hemoperitoneum, but there was no definite solid or hollow visceral injury. So, he was admitted to the general ward for serial abdominal observation. On admission to the surgical ward, he was stable with a heart rate (HR) of 86 beats per minute (bpm) and blood pressure (BP) of 100/70 mmHg. His hemoglobin (Hb) was 9.6 gm/dl. We kept him nil per mouth and a nasogastric tube was inserted. The intake and output chart was regularly calculated. Serial Hb monitoring showed a continuous fall in his Hb level during the following days. He continued to have altered rectal bleeding. On day 3 his Hb dropped to 6.1 gm/dl, despite having received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). He started to develop a mild fever with a temperature of 37.8 \u00b0C, tachycardia with a HR of 140 bpm, and the BP dropping to 70/40 mmHg. He was resuscitated and stabilized with intravenously administered crystalloid fluids and 2 units of PRBC. He did not require any inotropes or vasopressors. Due to this clinical deterioration, he was urgently taken to the operating room for further diagnostic and therapeutic management. The nasogastric tube revealed bile without hematemesis.

On further questioning, she reported that she had been diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) on the basis of positive sputum testing eight months prior to the time. The Gene Xpert test on her sputum had detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, which was sensitive to rifampicin. She had subsequently been started on antituberculosis (TB) chemotherapy, which included rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. However, she had taken the treatment for only three months reportedly due to intolerance of the chemotherapy.\nRheumatological examination at that visit revealed a clinical picture suggestive of RA. She had seven swollen joints all of which were metacarpophalangeal joints and seven tender joints including the wrists, knees, and metacarpophalangeal joints. Her patient global assessment was seven, and physician global assessment was four. This indicated high disease activity with a calculated clinical disease activity index (CDAI) of 25. Her chest radiograph showed features suggestive of active tuberculosis in the right upper lobe. Periarticular osteoporosis suggestive of an early inflammatory arthritis was identified on plain radiographs of hands and feet.

The chest pain was described as heavy with radiation to her right upper extremity and was associated with dyspnea. No other symptoms were associated with the chest pain. She had no history of previous cardiac disease. She was a smoker and her past medical history was significant for hyperlipidemia.\nHer vital signs were unremarkable, with heart rate of 84 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 124/84 mmHg, and temperature of 36.7\u00b0 Celsius. Her physical examination was also unremarkable. Initial ECG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm. Chest radiograph showed hyperexpanded lungs with chronic obstructive changes but revealed no acute process. FOCUS performed by a general EP without fellowship training or special interest in ultrasound revealed severely reduced left ventricular systolic function with mid to apical hypokinesis and preservation of basal segments (). The apical 4-chamber and parasternal long axis FOCUS findings can be observed in and , respectively.\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy was strongly suspected based on these findings and the patient\u2019s presentation. She was treated with aspirin and typical measures for acute coronary syndrome and admitted to the cardiology service. Her troponin returned at 595 ng/L and a subsequent ECG showed lateral T-wave inversions. There were no significant changes in vital signs from time of presentation. She underwent a comprehensive echocardiogram that confirmed the FOCUS findings. Because her troponins continued to rise, she underwent a cardiac catheterization the following day, which revealed clean coronary arteries and supported the diagnosis of TCM.

He denied any itch or pain over the affected area or any visual changes. He had no fever, recent trauma, or symptoms of rhinosinusitis. There was no previously documented allergy.

She had chronic atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with home oxygen, osteoarthritis, and anxiety disorder as her comorbid conditions. On examination, she did have chronic dyspnea and was on home oxygen. She did not have any cyanosis, palpitations, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea.\nShe was initially evaluated with a nuclear stress test that did not show any reversible ischemia but dilation of the right ventricle (RV); ejection fraction was identified to be 54%.

The patient\u2019s personal and medical history was non-contributory. On extraoral examination, a well-defined swelling of size 3\u00d73 cm was noted on the right side of the mandible extending from the angle of the mouth to 3 cm in front of the tragus of the ear anteroposteriorly. No other pathologic finding was noticed during the physical examination.\nOn intraoral examination, a polypoid exophytic lesion with an ulcerated growth of size 4\u00d75 cm was noted in the right mandibular premolar-molar region (). The lesion was asymptomatic, polypoid in nature with firmness in consistency. The colour of the lesion was normal with inflammed borders. The lesion extended from the mesial side of 44 to the distal side of 47. The history revealed recent extraction of tooth 46 followed by swelling during the previous month. Provisional diagnosis was given as pyogenic granuloma.\nExcisional biopsy was done and histopathological examination showed round to polygonal cells arranged around the alveolar spaces separated by fibrous septae () with areas of ossification. Few cells showed pleomorphism with hyperchromatic nuclei.\nThe tumoral configuration was compatible with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, but this morphology is not commonly seen in tumors of oral cavity, including salivary gland tumors, which are known for their diverse morphological and histological features. For this reason, it was thought that the tumor was primarily metastatic. This high-grade adenocarcinoma was thought to be organized from the lung, thyroid, or gastro-intestinal system.\nThe tissues were sent for immunohistochemistry (IHC) for confirmatory diagnosis.
