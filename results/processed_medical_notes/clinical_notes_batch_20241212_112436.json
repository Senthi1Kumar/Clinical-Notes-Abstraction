His past medical history was significant for diabetes insipidus 10 years ago after recurrent complaints of polyuria and polydipsia. At 26 years of age, he started complaining of non-productive cough and exertional dyspnea. A chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan of his chest done at another institution showed the presence of bilateral pulmonary cystic lesions involving the upper lobes. He was misdiagnosed to have pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and was started on high-dose orally administered prednisone therapy 2 years later, then received daily budesonide/formoterol without clinical improvement. Four years later, a high resolution multi-detector CT scan of his chest showed massive honeycombing cystic changes of both lung fields with intermingled fibrosis in between. Findings were suggestive of histiocytosis X. A transbronchial biopsy of the lung lesions confirmed the diagnosis of adult pulmonary LCH (Fig. ).\nOn admission, physical examination revealed an ill-appearing man but he was not in acute distress. He was conscious and oriented. His vital signs were within normal limits except for tachycardia of 112 beats per minute. There were no palpable cervical or inguinal lymph nodes. Cardiac auscultation was remarkable for a rapid heart rate with regular S1 and S2 without murmur. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral scattered wheezes best heard at the upper lung fields. His abdomen was soft and non-tender. Macroscopic examination of his anal canal revealed a cutaneous lesion infiltrating the anal sphincter with circumferential perianal lesions and eroded ulcerative plaques over the anal orifice (Fig. ).\nHe was admitted for further evaluation and management. A laboratory workup revealed a normal white cell count 7200",

    "original_text": "Our patient was a 41-year-old Japanese man who had had occasional discomfort in the right knee since elementary school. He had no pain at rest, but he experienced occasional pain when moving the knee. The pain had made it difficult for him to sit on his heels (Japanese seiza position) for the past year. Although he had undergone radiography and MRI examinations at several hospitals since childhood, no issues were reported; subsequently, he consulted our hospital.\nAt the time of his consultation, physical examination showed mild swelling and a loss of range of motion. The active range of motion of the knee was 30 degrees of extension and 120 degrees of flexion, improving to 10 degrees of extension when relaxed in a recumbent position. He had no instability of the knee. He had an intense fear of a sensation that something was caught in his knee joint. Blood test results were unremarkable. There was no tenderness at the femorotibial (FT) joint level. However, he complained of discomfort proximally, near the patellofemoral (PF) joint to the medial pouch. Careful palpation revealed an elastic soft tissue mass measuring about 3 cm. When his lower leg was hanging down while he was in a seated position, the blood vessels centered on this area became engorged.\nX-rays showed no obvious findings. MRI showed a mass measuring about 40 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 15 mm (Fig. a, b, ovals). The mass was homogeneous with a low intensity on T1-weighted sequences and high intensity on T2-weighted sequences adjacent to the medial femoral condyle. The shape of the medial femoral condyle presented with a concavity in axial images, with irregular margins from the PF to the medial femoral condyle. There were no abnormal signals in the intraosseous tissue. Suspecting a hemangioma, we performed MRA of the patient\u2019s leg. The results showed a hyperintense region on the medial side of the knee joint",

Surgical decompression by laminectomy and fusion by a posterior approach was planned under neurological monitoring guidance.\nThe patient was positioned prone with appropriate padding of all bony prominences. The Mean arterial pressure was maintained above 90 mm Hg throughout the procedure. A posterior midline approach was used with subperiosteal dissection of the affected region. Pedicle screws were placed at bilateral C2 and T1 levels, and lateral mass screw fixation was done at bilateral C3, C4, and C5 levels.

At 6 months, radiography showed thickening of the bone cortex in the back one-third of the right tibia and in the back of the distal part of the left tibia, so that he was again instructed to stop training (Fig. ). However, he discontinued coming to the outpatient clinic on his own after 6 months.\nHe was then seen in the emergency department, having sustained an injury to the right lower leg while running a middle-distance race, 1 year after the initial examination.

Regarding his past social history, the patient was married, lived with his family and was a former tobacco smoker (20 pack years). He denied alcohol or illicit drug use and had no known allergies. His physical exam showed a frail, cachectic male with a firm, distended, mildly tender abdomen with decreased bowel sounds. Additionally, there was a palpable mass in his left lower quadrant. He had clear breath sounds bilaterally with no rubs, murmurs or gallops auscultated on cardiac exam.\nNotable laboratory workup included a complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 3.8 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L, hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, and a platelet count of 312 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L. A comprehensive metabolic panel showed a normal creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 21 mg/dL and electrolytes within normal limits. Given the patients symptoms a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen with intravenous contrast was done and showed an apple core mass of the mid-transverse colon measuring approximately 30 \u00d7 44 mm. There was also marked dilation of the colon proximal to this, consistent with large bowel obstruction ().\nAfter obtaining the CT scan, the patient was admitted to the hospital ward for further management. The general surgery and gastroenterology services were consulted for recommendations. Initially an endoscopic placement of a palliative colonic stent was attempted but given the size of the lesion this was not amenable.

    "original_text": "A 22-year-old woman presented with intense pain in the shoulders that began 2 weeks after injury during a CrossFit competition, especially on the right side, without edema or reduced range of motion. She started the CrossFit practice routine 2 months before the injury. The patient trained CrossFit three times a week without any other sport activity on the remaining week days. Olympic weightlifting (overhead movement) was described as the last activity before the acute pain started. The initial overhead load was 55 pounds and was part of a \u201cnovice\u201d training routine with reported adequate technique. One week prior to the CrossFit competition the patient was oriented to increase the Olympic weightlifting load to 75 pounds as a requirement for competition. Repetitions were set to her own limitation. After the injury, she stopped her exercises and applied ice to the shoulders and upper arms. During the following days, she experienced continuous pain and sought medical attention. Physical examination did not show any reduction of passive and active arcs of movements.

The level of serum AFP was elevated (9457 ng/ml) but the levels of CEA and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) were within the normal range. Serum was positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), but negative for HBeAg.

The dose was increased due to the underlying chronic depression. The patient noticed the presence of oral lesions a few weeks after the consumption of DH (120 mg). A few months later the patient observed peeling of the buccal epithelium with areas of red erosion. The patient sought medical help for the painful nature of ulcerative lesions.

Surgical pathology showed the tumor to be CD56, synaptophysin, and pancytokeratin positive by immunohistochemistry, with involvement of a single right inguinal lymph node. Due to close surgical margins and inguinal nodal involvement, the patient received adjuvant intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to the right thigh and right pelvic and inguinal nodal region to a dose of 50 Gy delivered in 25 fractions (), as well as consolidative carboplatin and etoposide post-operatively. The patient then developed a radiation in-field recurrence involving the right external iliac and inguinal nodal region in 2015. Salvage right pelvic nodal dissection was performed where 15 nodes were removed with four harboring metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma.\nShortly after locoregional recurrence in the right pelvic nodal region, the patient developed metastatic disease involving bilateral pelvic nodes and the retroperitoneum on PET-scan (). Biopsy of the SUV-avid retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy confirmed metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. The patient was treated initially with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide and due to progressive disease was transitioned to single-agent pembrolizumab (200 mg IV every 3 weeks). After 5 months of therapy (7 cycles of pembrolizumab) the patient had a complete metabolic response with only sub-centimeter lymph nodes visible on CT. After 10 months of pembrolizumab (15 cycles), the patient had an isolated left inguinal and external iliac nodal progression (). For this reason, the patient was treated to the involved left inguinal and left external iliac nodes with IMRT to a dose of 45 Gy delivered in 25 fractions with concurrent pembrolizumab (), without any acute radiation side effects. Thereafter, the patient had complete imaging response of the left pelvic nodes as well as all other sites of metastatic disease outside of the radiation field at 3 months post-radiation by PET-response criteria in",

On review of systems, the patient also complained of abdominal bloating. His medical history was only significant for hypertension, although he did not take any medications. The patient did not report having allergies, and he denied the use of tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. His vital signs were as follows: temperature 36.9\u00b0 Celsius, blood pressure 165/109 millimeters of mercury, pulse 88 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute.\nThe patient appeared to have difficulty opening his mouth and exhibited dysphonia as a result. He had no reproducible pain on exam, but was uncomfortable when we attempted to open his mouth by force. While the oral exam was limited secondary to poor mouth opening, no caries or abscesses were appreciated. No lymph nodes were palpable and the remainder of the ear, nose, and throat exam was unremarkable. The patient\u2019s abdomen was rigid and mildly distended, but non-tender. On examination, the medial aspect of the right forearm revealed a healing laceration, approximately 5 \u00d7 2 centimeters. When questioned about the wound, the patient stated he had received it at work two weeks prior when he fell off a tractor and into muddy water. He stated he had been seen by a doctor in Mexico for the wound and was given a topical medication, which he had been applying.

The dilated perforating vessels in the basal ganglia and hypothalamus were supposed to be caused by hypoperfusion due to MMD. One distinctive large collateral vessel was present between the reticular collaterals of the distal right-sided ICA and the ACA territory bearing a small aneurysm (Fig. ). Given the primary blood distribution, this 2 mm-sized wide neck aneurysm was suspected as bleeding source.

Handgrip showed Grade 3 plus motor power, whereas thumb muscles showed Grade 5.

A 24-hour electrocardiogram (ECG) recording showed sinus rhythm with a maximum heart rate of 97 and a minimum of 39. There were no significant cardiac arrhythmias that might have contributed to his episodes of collapse. The collapses were therefore labeled as secondary to epilepsy, which itself attributed to a side effect of baclofen that was therefore stopped, after which he apparently suffered no further episodes of collapse. This patient did not have an ECG recording during any of the collapses; electroencephalogram recording was not performed at any time. In hindsight, the clinical reasoning that led to a provisional diagnosis of epilepsy in this case was not a necessarily sound clinical reasoning.\nSubsequently, this patient developed mainly abdominal muscle spasms, which sometimes interfered with breathing. His case was reviewed, and the consensus was that collapse during manual evacuation of the bowel was related to autonomic dysreflexia and not due to epilepsy. As the patient requested, baclofen treatment was restarted initially at a dose of 5 mg at night and then increased gradually to 10 mg twice a day. This greatly alleviated his abdominal muscle",

She booked for antenatal care in the index pregnancy at a Catholic Mission Hospital in Cross River State Nigeria at a gestational age of 28+2 weeks. Prior to booking however, the pregnancy had been complicated by intermittent vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain and anemia for which she received care in several private hospitals from the 10th week of gestation to about the 24th week of gestation when the bleeding ceased spontaneously. Ultrasound scans performed in the course of her evaluation for the bleeding revealed different findings from the absence of intra-uterine gestational sac to single intrauterine gestation of compatible gestational age.

He underwent total thyroidectomy with central compartment neck dissection followed by radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy. His tumor was pTNM (pathologic primary tumor, regional node, and distant metastasis) pT2N1bM0-stage I. Six months later, he had an early local recurrence in the left neck, for which he underwent a left neck dissection. After about a year, he had a positron emission tomography (PET) scan that showed activity in the right neck, and he underwent a right neck dissection. Then, he was followed up with surveillance scans. Three years later, a PET scan showed uptake suggestive of recurrence along the left thyroid bed as well as activity along the right paratracheal region. Fine-needle aspiration of the left thyroid bed as well as a right paratracheal node came back positive for recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma. At that time, he was symptomatic with more fatigue and weight loss. He then underwent revision of left paratracheal and central neck dissection with right paratracheal and mediastinal lymph node dissection along with shave biopsy of the right neck lesion. Histopathology of one of the right paratracheal lymph nodes showed metastatic poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma composed of papillary tall cell phenotype involving one lymph node. In addition, the left thyroid bed and a second right paratracheal lymph node demonstrated squamous cell carcinoma (Figures and ). The poorly differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma component was positive for TTF-1, thyroglobulin, and PAX8 while the squamous cell carcinoma was positive for p63, PAX8 (focally), and TTF-1 (very focally positive) and negative for thyroglobulin (Figures and ).

He was a known case of stage IIb and with a history of neoadjuant chemoradiotherapy. During the thoracoscopic esophageal resection, the posterior membranous wall of the trachea was injured 1 cm above the carina. A cancer surgeon repaired the laceration primarily with a single interrupted suture with no flap reinforcement. He did not convert to thoracotomy. The patient suffered a right lung collapse and a severe air leak from TT on the fifth post-operative day. In consultation with a thoracic surgeon, video bronchoscopy was performed. The patient sustained tracheal injury in the range of 5 \u00d7 5 ml 1 cm above the carina, showing the failure of primary repair. Owing to the lung collapse and severe air leak, he was a definite candidate for reoperation.\nUnder general anesthesia with double-lumen endotracheal intubation, operative repair was done with a right postero-lateral thoracotomy through the fifth intercostal space. At first, the intercostal flap was prepared, whereupon the gastric flap was retracted to expose tracheal laceration. Tracheopleural fistula was seen on the posterior wall of trachea 1 cm above the carina (Fig. ). Because of the severe inflammation, primary repair was not possible. Therefore, we had to repair the tear with flaps. First, the tear was covered with a rotated pericardial flap and was sutured into the laceration edge with interrupted Vicryl (4.0) (Fig. ). Then the pericardial flap was reinforced with the intercostal muscle flap (). Care was taken not to puncture the endotracheal tube. Finally, the gastric flap was reverted and sutured to surrounding tissue.

During the recovery a CT with contrast medium was performed and a thickening of the wall of the terminal ileum/ascending colon compatible with inflammatory or lymphoproliferative disease was found (Figures and ). The treatment was only medical with fasting, infusions, antibiotics, and mesalamine (800 mg t.i.d.). One month later, after therapy with mesalamine, another colonoscopy was performed and confirmed the persistence of the stenosis. The patient still suffered severe abdominal pain and vomit. She was admitted to our department, an urgent laparotomy and a right hemicolectomy were performed.

Intraoral examination revealed a palpable mass located in the posterior lateral region of the left maxilla (Fig. a). The overlying mucosa was intact and normal in color. The firm mass was not movable. Laboratory data were within the normal limits. Computed tomography (CT) scan of her head and neck showed a clear circumscribed solid mass measuring 28 \u00d7 23 mm in size between the lateral aspect of the posterior maxilla and the anterior region of the masseter muscle with no evidence of maxillary bone involvement (Fig. b). There was no lymphadenopathy in the cervical region. Magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed homogeneously enhanced signal intensity on T1-weighted images after gadolinium administration (Fig. a) and high signal intensity on Short T1 Inversion Recovery images (Fig. b). Incisional biopsy demonstrated benign lymphoid tissue. CT examination was conducted in the chest and abdominal region taking into consideration Castleman\u2019s disease as a differential diagnosis. However, systemic lymphadenopathy was not recognized. The submucosal mass was completely excised under general anesthesia. In the course of the surgical resection, the mass was observed to be adjacent to the buccal fat pad.\nGross examination showed a solid mass measuring 38 \u00d7 23 \u00d7 17 mm in size, which was encapsulated with fibrous tissue (Fig. ).

    "original_text": "A 6-year-old Asian girl was admitted to the Second Hospital of Jilin University with crush injury on the palmar aspect of the right hand and wrist (Fig. ). Emergency physical examination revealed stable vital signs, significantly swollen right hand with soft tissue defect, severely damaged thenar muscles, lightly crushed flexor tendons, crushed median nerve, and ulnar artery thrombosis (Fig. A). After debridement, the patient was noted to have tendon rupture of the flexor carpi radialis and the middle finger's flexor digitorum superficialis. There was a 5-cm defect of the ulnar artery and a 2-cm defect of the median nerve (Fig. B). The injury was associated with the rupture of the palmar side of the joint capsule. After radical debridement, an end-to-end repair of the median nerve was performed using an 8\u20130 polyamide suture. Then, muscles were readapted, and tendons were sutured. The size of the soft tissue defect in the proximal palm and wrist was 8 \u00d7 5 cm. The defect was closed with an ipsilateral ALT flap measuring 9 cm in length by 6 cm in width. The fascia lata was harvested with the flap to reconstruct the carpal joint capsule. Six-centimeter of the lateral femoral circumflex artery (LCA) was harvested along with the ALT flap to bridge the ulnar artery (Fig. ). Routine management of the patient was performed.\nThe initial postoperative period was uneventful. On the first day after the operation, the patient was noted to have slight swelling of the right lower limb and redness of the thigh wound edges. The patient did not complain of pain or numbness, and the dorsalis pedis artery pulse was palpable. However, 40 hours after the operation, the patient complained of pain in the donor site and severe edema of the entire thigh. The patient was noted to have weakness of quadriceps muscles and necrosis and blistering of the thigh wound margins. Meanwhile, the",
