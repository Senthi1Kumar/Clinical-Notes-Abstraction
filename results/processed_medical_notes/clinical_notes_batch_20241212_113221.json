Our patient was irritable, without clinical sings of meningitis. The rest of his physical examination, including an inspection of his ears, nose, and throat, was normal. His vital signs were normal. An ultrasound evaluation demonstrated bilateral enlarged cervical lymph nodes, not noted on palpation during the physical examination. Because lymphadenopathy of a bacterial origin was suspected, treatment was started with an intravenous course of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and diclofenac. A blood test revealed an anti-streptolysin O titer of 7590 U/ml, suggestive of a prior streptococcal infection. Despite this treatment, his fever persisted. Owing to the combination of fever, edema of hands and feet, mild conjunctivitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, and irritable behavior, Kawasaki disease was considered and he was referred to our university hospital for further evaluation 3 days after presentation.\nOn cardiac ultrasound evaluation, no involvement of his coronary arteries was observed.

He was referred to the National Hospital Organization Mito Medical Center in 2006 for treatment. He did not complain of fever, weight loss, or night sweating. On admission, physical examination revealed no remarkable features; the liver, spleen, and superficial nodes were not palpable. His laboratory data showed no abnormalities except a 10-year history of abnormal glucose tolerance treated by his primary physician. No elevated tumor markers or autoimmune antibodies were observed. A barium esophagogram, CT, and upper GI endoscope showed an esophageal submucosal polypoid lesion at the cervical esophagus (). Its location close to the esophageal orifice and large size (4 \u00d7 2 cm) made an endoscopic resection technically difficult, and the patient was enrolled in the Department of Surgery. As the tumor was endoscopically diagnosed as benign leiomyoma or lipoma, we decided to perform a tumor resection because of the patient's complaints of dysphagia and because the cervical esophagus is relatively approachable compared with the thoracic esophagus, even without pathological diagnosis. The tumor was removed through a cervical esophagotomy under a cervical collar incision.\nThe tumor macroscopically showed a submucosal polypoid appearance (). Resected tissue was fixed in 20% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and routinely stained with hematoxylin and eosin, followed by immunohistochemical analyses with monoclonal antibodies, as summarized in (supplement).

The distal neurovascular status of the right lower limb was within normal limits.\nAnteroposterior (AP) and lateral view radiographs of the hip and proximal thigh were done (Figure ), which revealed a large, well-defined, expansile lytic lesion in the metaphysis of the proximal femur extending up to the subtrochanteric region of the femur. Both the cortices in the metaphyseal region were thinned out, with a breach in the lateral cortex. The neck shaft angle was reduced to 84 degrees, resulting in a severe coxa vara deformity, along with anterolateral bowing of the proximal femur resembling the \"shepherd's crook deformity\" of FD [].\nConsidering his current problems, it was decided to do extensive curettage, bone grafting, and corrective osteotomy with internal fixation. Informed patient consent was obtained. Surgery was performed on a fracture table through a lateral incision and a plane was dissected between gluteus medius and tensor fascia lata muscle.

She was referred to the Department of Psychiatry at the Toho University Omori Medical Center, Tokyo, to receive care for a severe postpartum depressed mood and intense suicidal ideations. The participants provided written informed consent prior to enrollment in this case report.\nShe had no previously documented psychiatric history and no documented family history of psychiatric or perinatal illness. She had been brought up in an urban environment since childhood. She had a good relationship with her parents and did not experience any abuse or maltreatment. Her character was honest, diligent, and orderly, and she had an especially strong sense of responsibility. After graduating from university, she worked as an assistant curator in a museum. At the age of 34 years, she met and married her husband, who was an engineer. They were not eager for her to become pregnant. Although she and her husband moved to the countryside because of his work, she decided to continue her job because, despite a 3-hour commute, she found her work to be very fulfilling.\nAt the age of 36 years, she became pregnant.

Delivery was by emergency caesarean section with maternal general anaesthetic for fetal distress and cord prolapse. Apgar scores were 4, 5, 5, and 8 at one, five, ten and fifteen minutes respectively. He required mask ventilation at birth for primary apnoea and was intubated at seven minutes of postnatal age for persistent apnoea. At 30 min of life he was extubated to CPAP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 was weaned from 100 to 44%. On these settings he had a tachypnoea of 90 breaths per minute with mildly increased respiratory effort and a pre-ductal oxygen saturation of \u226597%. A capillary blood gas excluded respiratory or metabolic acidosis. Empiric antibiotics benzylpenicillin and gentamicin were commenced to cover the risk of sepsis due to the prolonged rupture of membranes. Chest x-rays at 2 and 4 h of life showed crescent shaped homogeneous opacities in both upper lung fields (Fig. ). The Neonatal and Paediatric Emergency Transport Service (NETS) was consulted. Initial paediatric radiological advice via telemedicine was that this appearance could represent bilateral pleural effusions. Accordingly the PEEP was increased to 8cmH2O; lateral decubitus x-ray (not shown) was uninformative. Due to the uncertainty regarding the cause of the respiratory distress the baby was transferred to the local neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) by NETS at 10 h of postnatal life.\nA progress CXR at just under 13 h of age was still inconclusive. However a lateral decubitus film performed concurrently demonstrated air anterior to the mediastinum, consistent with a diagnosis of pneumomediastinum (Fig. ); all respiratory support was therefore ceased.

Marked hypersensitivity and allodynia were present at the level of the left fingers, wrist and hand.

There was no redness but swelling and sweating at the level of the fingers of the left hand. The pain was so intense that it interfered with her regular attendance at school, generating social withdrawal phenomena, which are unfortunately very frequent in patients with chronic pain.\nPain began three months before the consultation, after an accidental fall with trauma to the left wrist.

The process of delivery was complicated by shoulder dystocia. Shortly after birth, the newborn developed progressively severe respiratory distress, requiring O2 application via head box. He received intravenous fluid and antibiotics. He was subsequently transferred to our hospital where he continued to require O2 therapy. His initial physical examination revealed tachypnea, nasal flaring, chest indrawing, asynchronized chest and abdomen motion and the absence of Moro reflex and absence of any spontaneous movement in the right hand. His right arm remained in adduction and internal rotation position. The grasp reflex was intact. Apart from respiratory distress no other abnormality was detected clinically. In the chest roentgenogram the lung field was normal, no sign of clavicle and homeruns fracture, but the right hemidiaphragm was highly elevated ().\nAccording to the history of shoulder dystocia and the findings on physical examination and chest X-ray diagnosis of brachial plexus (Erb) palsy accompanied with diaphragmatic paralysis was made and the neonate transferred to NICU. He was placed on his right side of the body and continued to require increasing concentrations of oxygen. Endotracheal intubation and ventilatory support (Bear cub infant ventilator, Bear Medical System) at 24 h of age was required because of respiratory failure, which was characterized by pH of 7.15 and PCO2 of 68 mmHg on arterial blood gas analysis.\nConventional ventilatory support to maintain oxygenation continued and weaned from ventilator after 6 days, but he started to have increasing respiratory distress and inefficient chest excursions. So he was re-intubated and ventilated for another 5 days because of extubation failure. Chest X-ray was the same as previous one and the inflammatory markers for sepsis like CRP and ESR were normal.",

During a work-up for evaluating the cause of her abdominal pain, a 2.7-cm pulmonary nodule was incidentally discovered in an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. Subsequently, a chest CT scan revealed that the nodule was located in the basal segment of the left lower lobe. The nodule had a well-defined lobule, whereas no other definite nodules or active lesions were found in the lungs (). For further evaluation, the patient was referred to Asan Medical Center. At the time of admission, the patient's vital signs were stable and her physical examination was unremarkable. The results of all laboratory tests were within normal limits.\nA lung needle biopsy was performed, the results of which indicated a few atypical cells that were positive for p63 and cytokeratin in a necrotic background. We believed that the characteristics of the nodule indicated squamous cell carcinoma. In 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, the nodule showed a maximum standardized uptake value of 1.6 in the basal segment of the left lower lobe that indicated low metabolic activity. No other significant hypermetabolic lesions were found.\nThe follow-up chest CT performed after 1 month indicated that the mass had enlarged to 3.3\u00d73.0 cm. No definite evidence of lymphadenopathy was seen in the hilar mediastinum. Because distant metastasis was not evident in brain magnetic resonance imaging or a bone scan, we performed video-assisted left lower lobectomy in addition to mediastinal lymph node dissection.\nOn gross examination, an ill-defined firm mass measuring 3.2\u00d72.5\u00d72 cm was observed.

The mass was hard, non-tender, with fine needle aspiration demonstrating a cT2N0 atypical squamous lesion of the submandibular gland. The patient underwent radical excision with modified radical neck dissection and partial parotidectomy. The resulting pathology was consistent with moderately to poorly differentiated SCC with focal perineural invasion (pT3N2bM0). The patient underwent post-operative chemoradiation but presented within 1 year with local regional recurrence. He again underwent chemoradiation with radical excision of facial cancer with radical parotidectomy, left radical neck dissection and facial reconstruction ( and ).\nThe patient\u2019s post-operative course was complicated by dysphagia requiring gastrostomy tube placement. Surveillance imaging of the chest showed extensive mediastinal, hilar and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy with new pulmonary nodules and a large mediastinal mass encasing the trachea and ascending aorta consistent with distant metastatic disease.

A CT angiogram of the chest was obtained due to concerns for pulmonary embolism and showed spiculated nodules in bilateral lower lobes; right nodule measured 1.1 cm x 0.9 cm while the left measured 1.5 cm x 1.2 cm. Also noted was right hilar lymphadenopathy with the largest lymph node measuring 2.9 cm x 2.1 cm; no mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy was noted. Emphysematous changes of the lungs were also seen. A biopsy of the left lung nodule and a right lymph node fine needle aspiration (FNA) were performed. Pathology results revealed the left lung nodule to be poorly to moderately differentiated nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Cytology studies on the right lymph node sample showed highly atypical large lymphocytes with 95% monoclonal B-cells on flow cytometry, concerning for large B-cell lymphoma. After stabilization from respiratory standpoint, the patient was discharged home on supplemental oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at three liters/minute (L/min). His case was discussed in a multi-disciplinary tumor board. Cardio-thoracic surgery team felt he was not a candidate for lobectomy and would need radiation therapy; a referral to radiation oncology was made. A lymph node excision biopsy was planned to establish a definite diagnosis of lymphoma.\nApproximately eight weeks following his initial admission, the patient presented with worsening dyspnea with productive cough. He was hemodynamically stable with no increase in supplemental oxygen requirements; however, he was noted to have facial swelling, jugular venous distention, diffuse wheezing with bilateral basal crackles and bilateral pitting pedal edema.

    "original_text": "A 67-year-old Caucasian woman presented to her primary care physician with a 1-year history of epigastric abdominal pain, occasional nausea, and emesis, and an unintentional 10 pound weight loss. An abdominal CT scan showed a 4.5 \u00d7 4.1 cm periampullary mass arising from the pancreas without evidence of metastatic disease. Interestingly, the CT scan also showed the colon to be in a dorsal position in relation to the SMA (). Laboratory analysis revealed normal liver function tests and serum CEA level but an elevated CA 19-9 level. At operative exploration, the entire transverse colon was found to be retroperitoneal and lies dorsal to the SMA and SMV. The duodenum coursed anterior rather than posterior to the mesenteric vessels. The SMA lies further to the right than normal and the SMV\u2013portal vein confluence lies further to the left than usual. Inspection of the duodenum and head of the pancreas revealed a firm mass in the head of the pancreas. A classic pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. The anterior placement of the duodenum made division of the jejunum beyond the ligament of Treitz relatively easy. The tumor dissected nicely away from the SMA with no uncinate process of the pancreas present. Our standard procedure is to bring the jejunal limb for reconstruction up in a retrocolic position, through a defect made in the transverse mesocolon to the right of the middle colic vessels. This limb is used to create the pancreaticojejunostomy, hepaticojejunostomy, and gastrojejunostomy. Due to the retroperitoneal position of the transverse colon, we brought the jejunal limb up in an antecolic position.

    "cleaned_text": "a 67-year-old caucasian woman presented to her primary care physician with a 1-year history of epigastric abdominal pain, occasional nausea, and emesis, and an unintentional 10 pound weight loss. an abdominal ct scan showed a 4.5 \u00d7 4.1 cm periampullary mass arising from the pancreas without evidence of metastatic disease. interestingly, the ct scan also showed the colon to be in a dorsal position in relation to the sma (). laboratory analysis revealed normal liver function tests and serum cea level but an elevated ca 19-9 level. at operative exploration, the entire transverse colon was found to be retroperitoneal and lies dorsal to the sma and smv. the duodenum coursed anterior rather than posterior to the mesenteric vessels. the sma lies further to the right than normal and the smv\u2013portal vein confluence lies further to the left than usual. inspection of the duodenum and head of the pancreas revealed a firm mass in the head of the pancreas. a classic pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. the anterior placement of the duodenum made division of the jejunum beyond the ligament of treitz relatively easy. the tumor dissected nicely away from the sma with no uncinate process of the pancreas present. our standard procedure is to bring the jejunal limb for reconstruction up in a retrocolic position, through a defect made in the transverse mesocolon to the right of the middle colic vessels. this limb is used to create the pancreaticojejunostomy, hepaticojejunostomy, and gastrojejunostomy. due to the retroperitoneal position of the transverse colon, we brought the jejunal limb up in an antecolic position. pathology revealed a moderately differentiated pda with all surgical margins being free of tumor and 1 out of 11 specimen lymph nodes was positive for metastatic disease. the patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged to home on postoperative day 5. the patient eventually developed recurrent disease and died 34 months postresection.",

According to the description of the accident, the young man was hurled from his motorcycle and hit an immobile obstacle, impacting on it with his anterior abdominal wall. He had no apparent external injuries. When he arrived at the hospital he was haemodynamically stable with a blood pressure reading of 120/80 mmHg, a heart rate of 88 pulses/minute and a Glasgow Coma Scale(GCS) score of 15. The patient experienced pain and tenderness on palpation of his right upper abdominal quadrant; the rest of his abdomen was soft and nontender to palpation.\nThe patient underwent laboratory and radiological examination consisting of x-rays of his head, cervical spine, lumbar spine, chest and abdomen.

No history of prior surgery, trauma, or any other comorbidity existed. He had no alcohol abuse habit or familial history of pancreatic disease. The initial computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a large cystic lesion in the upper abdomen and the origin of the lesion could not be identified.\nAt physical examination, an immovable abdominal mass was detected in the upper quadrant was found and the tenderness and rebound-tenderness of the whole abdomen were obvious. Initial laboratory findings revealed mild leukocytosis (10.7 \u00d7 109/L), elevated neutrophil granulocytes (89% of the leukocytes) and elevated C reactive protein (CRP) (373.2 mg/L). The measured tumor markers were within the normal range. These results decreased the likelihood of a diagnosis of malignancy. His other laboratory investigations were within the normal reference ranges. Subsequently, he was admitted to the general surgery department. During his hospitalization, a CT scan and ultrasound (US) were performed again to assess the properties of abdominal lesions. The US showed that a large cystic lesion occupied the abdomen (Fig. ). The review result of the CT scan showed a large cystic lesion of the abdominal cavity, which was considered a lymphatic cyst combined with purulent inflammation (Fig. A). Under the direction of the B-ultrasonic scan, we obtained 20 mL liquid from the cystic lesion through fine needle aspiration. Cell morphological examination showed a large number of lymphocytes and fewer monocytes in the cystic fluid. Then we gathered the cast-off cells, and identified the cells by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining.

He has been under cytotoxic therapy. Since then up to the admission time, azathioprine, cyclosporin, and splenectomy were done in the course of disease. Since then, he has been stable and no problem has been reported so far. His current illness started about 5 months ago when he complained of left lower extremity paresis. No complaints of diplopia, blurred vision, headache, vertigo and sphincter functions were reported.\nHabit history and family history were negative. His systemic examination was unremarkable except of abdominal striae secondary to steroid consumption and surgical scar of splenectomy. In neurologic examination, his strength was graded 4/5 both proximally and distally in the left lower extremity. Furthermore, there was hyperreflexia of both legs with bilateral Babinski sign. The remainder neurologic examination was normal.\nSpinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed T9 to L1 levels ill-defined intramedullary mass lesion. Cervical MRI was normal (). Unfortunately, brain MRI had not been performed.\nBased on these results, he went on surgery with astrocytoma and ependymal impression 1 month before referral to our clinic. During surgery, the neurosurgeon suspected misdiagnosis of disease according to appearance of lesion and took biopsy and did not resect the lesion. The specimen was evaluated which revealed glial tissue with reactive astrocytes and scattered parenchymal lymphocytes and macrophages as well as prominent perivascular cuffs of lymphocytes.

A physical examination indicated the result of the straight leg raising test was positive and also muscle atrophy. The muscle power of the right lower limb had decreased to grade 3. There was no sensory impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intraspinal extradural tumor over T10 to L3 (Fig. ). It appeared to be a spinal extradural arachnoid cyst (SEAC). To confirm whether the fistula existed between the subarachnoid space and arachnoid cyst, and to localize the position of the fistula, we performed a real-time technique. First, we injected contrast medium into the cyst under fluoroscopy. After 1 h the follow-up computed tomography (CT) was administered, and it revealed there was no contrast-infiltration into the subarachnoid space (Fig. ). We then extracted about 20 mL of fluid from the cyst. The follow-up magnetic resonance imaging on the same day indicated the cyst did not become smaller (Fig. ). A \u201cone-way valve\u201d fistula was suspected such that cerebral spinal fluid could pass into the cystic space from the subarachnoid space but could not flow in the opposite manner. Therefore we designed a procedure to localize the fistula. We penetrated two needles into the cyst and subarachnoid space separately in the L3/L4 level under digital subtraction angiography (Fig. ). Pending the fluid drained through those two needles, we injected 10 mL of contrast medium slowly into the subarachnoid space and a little contrast medium infiltrated into the cystic space horizontally at the T12/L1 level. We then administered high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) immediately to confirm the position in the axial plane. The HRCT revealed a funnel-shaped enhancement between the lower edges of the T12 body and the left nerve",

Additionally, enlarged, hard lymph nodes were palpable in the right axilla, with 3 cm in diameter. Stigmas of its underlying pathology were also present, such as fusion of the fingers (pseudosyndactyly), extensive scarring and milia on trauma prone areas.\nA lesion biopsy and additional imaging studies were performed. Skin biopsy revealed an invasive SCC (). Hand and forearm magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneous soft tissue mass invading the muscular plane, without apparent bone invasion. A thoraco-abdominopelvic computerized tomography showed the absence of systemic metastasis. Axillary ultrasound showed a 32 mm long lymph node conglomerate with suspect ultrasonographic features.

At 4 years of age, the patient first presented episodes of seizures and abnormal neurological findings and was diagnosed with HHH syndrome. The patient had developmental disability, manifested by expressive language and attention problems determined upon neuropsychiatric evaluation, and significant myopia. The patient was prescribed a diet consisting of protein restriction to 1.5 g/kg/d during childhood. The patient's weight was at the 25th percentile with height less than the 3rd percentile.\nThe patient's first pregnancy occurred at 18 years old. She had episodes of nausea and dizziness. She was maintained on a low-protein diet in the first trimester, but mild hyperammonemia was detected during the 11th and 12th week of pregnancy; as a result, protein intake was further restricted to 40 g/d. It was unclear if the patient was compliant or not. At 22 weeks gestation, the patient developed seizures, and was initiated with carbamazapine. Brain imaging showed multiple small calcifications of unreported cause, with normal cerebral angiography. The child was born at full term, via Cesarean-section. The baby girl had intrauterine growth restriction (weight <3rd percentile). Although the baby girl remained small, follow-up recorded a normal development at her 2 years of age.\nVery little is described for the course of her second and third pregnancy. The second child was born via Caesarian section. A moderately elevated ornithine concentration (302 \u03bcM/L) was measured in the cord blood, but the levels decreased to normal in the newborn's blood 24 hours after birth.

The diagnosis of Chagas disease was defined by the positive result of two serological tests [indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)]. To exclude the possibility of an ischemic heart disease, the patient underwent cardiac catheterization, followed by angiography. The studied patient was in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%. An evaluation of patient exercise capacity by a cardiopulmonary exercise test was initially attempted; however, the patient could not tolerate the testing because of excessive fatigue in the first minute of the exam. Instead, a six-minute walking test in a 30-m corridor was performed to evaluate the patient's exercise capacity. For this test, previously standardized instructions were followed. In addition, the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire was administered ().\nAfter the initial assessment, the physiotherapy team chose the NMEE protocol for rehabilitation because of the patient's significant functional impairment and his inability to undergo conventional exercise training ().

    "original_text": "A 47-year-old male patient with neck mass for 3 years, progressive dysphagia lasting over 6 months and difficulty breathing after exercise for more than 1 month was referred to our department. Ultrasound examination detected a tumor (7 cm \u00d7 6 cm \u00d7 3 cm) located behind the right thyroid lobe. Preoperative biopsy indicated a spindle cell tumor. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed that the tumor was located between the cervical esophagus and trachea, and compressed these structures (Fig. ).\nTracheal intubation and general anesthesia were performed. A U-shaped skin flap was elevated to the level of hyoid bone and the right carotid sheath was exposed and pulled outward. The tumor (7 cm \u00d7 6 cm \u00d7 3 cm) originated from the right recurrent laryngeal nerve and invaded the esophageal mucosa (Fig. A, B). The tumor, partial right recurrent laryngeal nerve, partial cervical and upper thoracic esophagus were resected. Rapid intraoperative pathological examination indicated a spindle cell tumor. Meanwhile, the tumor-free margins were confirmed by intraoperative frozen section pathology analysis.

Physical examination showed an ulcerative lesion measuring 14 \u00d7 10 mm with induration was recognized on the right lateral edge of the posterior tongue at the first visit (Figure ). The submandibular LNs of 8 mm diameter were palpable, mobile, and not tender. The results of cytology of the lesion in the oral cavity showed Class IV.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed the primary tumor extended into the right tongue region, inward with thickness of 10 mm or more, and LNs enlarged at the right superior internal jugular region (Figure ). Correspondingly, positron emission tomography (PET)-CT showed abnormal accumulation of FDG in the right lateral edge of the tongue (SUVmax = 6.98) and LNs at the right superior internal jugular region (SUVmax = 3.27), and no abnormal accumulation of FDG in other organs (Figure ).

    "original_text": "A 71 year-old male presented for an urgent biopsy of a lesion of Corpus Callosum on a background of clinically diagnosed intra-operative anaphylaxis for the same procedure 4 days prior, which was abandoned. Symptoms of the initial presentation, which brought the patient under the care of the Neurosurgical team, included impaired ability to self-care and mild cognitive dysfunction. Surgical and Medical teams deemed the histo-pathological diagnosis essential due to the need for tailored subsequent medical management including potential urgent administration of chemotherapy and radiation.\nThe specialised allergy testing was not feasible due to the brief 4 day timeline proposed between the two procedures. Decision was made to proceed with surgery due to the urgent need for the identification of the nature of the lesion.\nBoth patient and the prior care episode were evaluated. Patient had a background of treated hypertension, with no other underlying illnesses. Prior to this, he had undergone uneventful surgical procedures and anaesthesia.\nHistory, records of the procedure, and tests for mast cell mediators, were reviewed by the attending anaesthetist. During the first care episode patient was given a single dose of midazolam, followed by remifentanil and propofol total intravenous anaesthesia, rocuronium and cephazolin in quick succession. The laryngoscopic view was a Grade 3 Cormack and Lehane, with direct laryngoscopy utilising a Macintosh 4 Blade. CMAC\u00ae Blade 4 Videolaryngoscope demonstrated an equivalent Grade 3 Cormack and Lehane view. Following successful airway management, patient developed intractable hypotension, concomitant bronchospasm and was diagnosed with clinical anaphylactic episode.

    "original_text": "A 41-year-old-female had complained of headache and loss of olfactory function and underwent consultation at the Department of Otolaryngology of a general hospital. Endoscopic examination revealed a large mass involving the olfactory cleft of the left nasal cavity. Microscopic examination of a biopsy specimen indicated a diagnosis of neurogenic tumor. She was then referred to Kyoto University Hospital for further examination and treatment.\nNasal endoscopy demonstrated a soft, whitish mass occupying the olfactory cleft and extending laterally to the middle meatus, with destruction of the middle turbinate in the left nostril. Computed tomography (CT) displayed a lesion at the olfactory cleft that extended superiorly to the olfactory groove, with a bone defect in the skull base (). The cribriform plate was elevated upward indicating that the tumor originated from the extracranial compartment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a mass showing cystic changes (Figures \u2013), with solid portions demonstrating strong postgadolinium contrast enhancement. Our initial diagnosis based on radiographic findings was esthesioneuroblastoma. Partial resection of the tumor in the olfactory cleft was then performed using the endoscopic endonasal approach under local anesthesia, which suggested a histopathologic diagnosis of schwannoma. Based on this result, we planned subtotal resection of the tumor via an endoscopic endonasal approach.\nUnder general anesthesia, the uncinate process in the left nostril was removed to expose the tumor in the middle meatus (). The tumor was attached but had not invaded the internal orbital wall. The anterior part of the middle turbinate was separated from the agger nasi and reserved into the choana as a pedicle flap. Resection of the agger nasi using a drill resulted in exposure of the entire anterior surface of the tumor.

    "cleaned_text": "a 41-year-old-female had complained of headache and loss of olfactory function and underwent consultation at the department of otolaryngology of a general hospital. endoscopic examination revealed a large mass involving the olfactory cleft of the left nasal cavity. microscopic examination of a biopsy specimen indicated a diagnosis of neurogenic tumor. she was then referred to kyoto university hospital for further examination and treatment.\nnasal endoscopy demonstrated a soft, whitish mass occupying the olfactory cleft and extending laterally to the middle meatus, with destruction of the middle turbinate in the left nostril. computed tomography (ct) displayed a lesion at the olfactory cleft that extended superiorly to the olfactory groove, with a bone defect in the skull base (). the cribriform plate was elevated upward indicating that the tumor originated from the extracranial compartment. magnetic resonance imaging (mri) revealed a mass showing cystic changes (figures \u2013), with solid portions demonstrating strong postgadolinium contrast enhancement. our initial diagnosis based on radiographic findings was esthesioneuroblastoma. partial resection of the tumor in the olfactory cleft was then performed using the endoscopic endonasal approach under local anesthesia, which suggested a histopathologic diagnosis of schwannoma. based on this result, we planned subtotal resection of the tumor via an endoscopic endonasal approach.\nunder general anesthesia, the uncinate process in the left nostril was removed to expose the tumor in the middle meatus (). the tumor was attached but had not invaded the internal orbital wall. the anterior part of the middle turbinate was separated from the agger nasi and reserved into the choana as a pedicle flap. resection of the agger nasi using a drill resulted in exposure of the entire anterior surface of the tumor. a tumor capsule was dissected from the nasal septum and then from the crista galli using a suction elevator and a 45-degree angled endoscope for visualization. during this procedure, the olfactory nerves were identified",
