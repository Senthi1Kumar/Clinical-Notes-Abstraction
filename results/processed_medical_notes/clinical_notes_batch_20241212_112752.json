A brain CT scan and further MRI showed three tumors surrounded by cerebral edema. A left kidney tumor and two lung nodules were identified by CT scan and, finally, clinical examination found some hypervascularized lesions of his scalp. The cutaneous tumors were surgically removed and the pathological report identified metastases of a type 2 papillary renal tumor. This patient was classified in the favorable risk group according to the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) []. Brain metastases were all treated by stereotaxic radiation. Pazopanib another TKI directed to VEGFr was initiated at 800 mg/day. This treatment induced a partial response in lung metastases and in the primary renal tumor; the three brain metastases were also reduced. The disease remained stable for 2.5 years under pazopanib, except in his brain. In fact, two new brain metastases appeared 12 months later and three others after 24 months. Stereotaxic radiation was performed on each new brain tumor and pazopanib at 800 mg per day was resumed. Some neurological symptoms appeared with several transient episodes of aphasia together with some degree of mental confusion, 4 months after the last radiation treatment. Pazopanib treatment was completed and brain MRI indicated a radionecrosis with surrounding cerebral edema in one of the recently irradiated brain metastases. Two months after pazopanib completion, a CT scan showed significant progression in all other metastatic sites including previously irradiated brain metastases. Cabozantinib was started after our patient gave consent. Neurological symptoms rapidly resolved and a brain MRI at 2.5 months evidenced tumor regression of the different brain metastases (Fig. ). Cabozantinib was ongoing for 6 months but had to be reduced to 40 mg/day due to grade 3 diarrhea. Sequencing was performed on",

    "original_text": "The patient was an 81-year-old man with asymptomatic macroscopic hematuria. His performance status was grade 1, and he had no occupational exposure to chemical agents. He had stage 3 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease caused by smoking over 40 years and a history of aortic aneurysm repair. He was diagnosed as having bladder cancer by cystoscopic examination and was referred. Computed tomography (CT) showed thickening and irregularity of the whole bladder, with left external iliac lymph node metastasis (fig. ). The clinical stage was diagnosed as T3N1M0 based on the UICC classification. To make a pathological diagnosis and reduce the mass of the tumor, transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) was performed, and the tumor, including the deep muscle layer, was resected. The inside of the bladder, from the triangular area to the posterior wall, was filled with a tumor, approximately 4.0 \u00d7 4.5 cm, that bled easily. On microscopic examination, the tumor was composed predominantly of undifferentiated malignant cells, with sheets and nests arranged in a syncytial pattern, as well as an urothelial carcinoma lesion. The tumor was also accompanied by a prominent lymphoid reaction consisting of mature lymphoidocytes and plasma cells, which invaded into the muscle layer. On immunohistochemical studies, undifferentiated tumor cells were positively stained by epithelial markers (cytokeratin AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, and cytokeratin 7). The infiltrating lymphocytes were stained by CD3 and CD20 (fig. ). The pathological diagnosis was focal-type LELC containing a component of urothelial carcinoma G3>G2, infiltrative-type. Urine cytology was found to be positive 1 month after TURBT treatment.

After noticing the bump approximately 2 months prior, she saw an ophthalmologist who referred her for specialty care. The patient denied a history of pain or discharge, but did complain of a subjective decrease in visual acuity of the left eye. The patient was previously healthy, with unremarkable general medical and ocular histories. She denied a history of trauma or foreign body. Over the past 2 months, the patient noticed the lesion changing shape and color, describing the lesion as initially elevated and white, but progressively becoming flatter and yellow, with increased vascularity.\nOn examination, visual acuities were 20/20 and 20/40. A probable explanation for the decrease in visual acuity of the left eye is that the lesion caused a disruption in proper tear film distribution, resulting in blurred vision. Unfortunately, refraction was not performed at this time, but was performed postoperatively. Slit-lamp examination of the right eye was within normal limits. Examination of the left eye revealed a 7 \u00d7 5.3 mm oval yellow elevated conjunctival lesion, inferior to the cornea and extending up to the limbus. The left cornea was clear.\nThe patient was started on a steroid taper (prednisolone 1% drops four times per day for 1 week, and then three times per day for 1 week) and instructed to follow up in 2 weeks. At the follow-up, no improvement of the lesion was noted, and the patient was still complaining of decreased visual acuity. Examination of the left eye again revealed an oval yellow elevated conjunctival lesion, measuring 5.8 \u00d7 5.8 mm, focused at the inferior limbus at 5: 30 o'clock (fig. ). The overlying conjunctiva was noted to be injected with dilated vessels. The mass was nontender and nonmobile.

She was therefore administered first-line therapy composed of 1500 mg of amoxicillin, 800 mg of clarithromycin and 60 mg of lansoprazole for 7 days to eradicate H. pylori in December 2014. A urea breath test was performed to assess the effect of the eradication and revealed a positive result for H. pylori infection. Seven months after the first-line therapy, the patient was prescribed second-line therapy composed of 1500 mg of amoxicillin, 500 mg of metronidazole and 40 mg of vonoprazan for 7 days to eradicate H. pylori in July 2015. A day after completing second-line therapy, she complained of abdominal pain and hematochezia. Blood tests showed increases in neutrophil (6090/\u00b5L) and C-reactive protein (1.38 \u00b5g/mL) levels, whereas the hemoglobin level was within the normal limits. Colonoscopy revealed a hemorrhage and edematous mucosa with no transparent vascular pattern in the transverse colon (Fig. ). Histological findings of the biopsy specimens obtained from the transverse colon showed severe infiltrations of neutrophil and lymphocytes and a hemorrhage in the lamina propria (Fig. ). A bacterial culture detected Klebsiella oxytoca (K. oxytoca), but not Clostridium difficile or other pathogenic bacteria. A drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) showed positive reactions for both amoxicillin and metronidazole. According to these findings, the patient was diagnosed with AAHC.\nBowel rest for 6 days under the oral administration of 5 mg of prednisolone relieved her abdominal pain and hematochezia.

Physical examination revealed a large tumor (approximately 10\u00d710 cm) in her right breast, and the tumor had an exogenous growth with an ulcer in the center measuring 5\u00d75 cm and covered by a white and yellow exudate (). Enlarged lymph nodes were seen in the right axillary region.

Right supraclavicular lymph nodes displayed unclear boundary and unclear structure. The tumor did not invade the left breast and left axillary region. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed two nodules in the upper lobe of the right lung; a large breast tumor with thickened skin; multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the right axillary region; and abnormal bone density on the left third posterior rib, thoracic 2,3 vertebral body (T2, T3), suggesting lung and bone metastasis (). Bone emission computed tomography (ECT) scan showed radioactive concentration on the left second and third posterior rib, thoracic 2\u20134 vertebral body, right inferior scapular angle, left ischium, and bilateral sacroiliac joints. Bone metastasis was suspected. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was elevated (13.67 \u00b5g/mL, normal range: 0\u20135 \u00b5g/mL) and other tumor markers were within the normal range. No obvious abnormalities were detected in abdominal ultrasound, cardiac ultrasound, brain magnetic resonance imaging, blood routine examination, and hepatic and renal function tests. Mammography was not performed because of size of the tumor and the exuding ulcer in the center. Core needle biopsy was carried out, which showed invasive ductal carcinoma",

At that time, a thoracotomy in the eighth intercostal space was performed for direct closure of the diaphragm. Pooling of right pleural effusion was treated with drainage up to postoperative day (POD) 9. The patient recovered and was discharged on POD 14. In November 2012, he presented with a right DH and strangulation of the ileus of the small intestine. He underwent laparotomy at the same previous hospital, found the defect which was separated from the previously sutured area of the diaphragm, and repaired it.\nIn May 2017, the patient presented to the local hospital with abdominal pain and vomiting and was diagnosed with an intestinal obstruction; an ileus tube was inserted and the patient was referred to our hospital for treatment. Upon admission, the physical examination was unremarkable, and laboratory findings, including complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and biochemical tests, were all within normal limits. Chest and abdominal radiographs revealed colon gas in the right intrathoracic space (Fig. a, b). On contrast imaging, the ileus tube in the transverse colon was observed to be incarcerated in the right intrathoracic space (Fig. c), a finding which was confirmed on computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen (Fig. d). The patient was diagnosed with a DH and underwent laparoscopic hernia repair.\nThe surgical repair was performed with the patient in the left half-lateral decubitus position. Four laparoscopic ports were placed in the abdomen as follows: a 12-mm port at the umbilicus for the scope, two 12-mm ports at the right lateral lesion as working ports, and a 5-mm port at the middle of the upper abdomen used as an assistant. Under laparoscopic view, the transverse colon and small intestine anastomosis were found to be adherent to the right hemidiaphragm (Fig. a), and we proceeded with careful separation",

The CT also revealed severe aortic arch angulation and no landing zone from the arch vessels to KD. The patient was not eligible for TEVAR, and in situ reconstruction of the ALSCA via right thoracotomy appeared challenging. Thus, we planned hybrid repair, left carotid artery (LCA) to the left subclavian artery (LSCA) bypass, and embolization of the LSCA prior to replacement of the descending aorta via right thoracotomy to prevent tremendous backflow from the ALSCA on the same day.\nFirst, the LCA to LSCA bypass was performed using a 7-mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft. Next, a 16-mm Amplatzer vascular plug II (Abbott Medical Japan Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was placed from the LSCA just distal to KD and proximal to the left vertebral artery. Following LSCA embolization, the patient was shifted to the left lateral recumbent position.\nRight lateral thoracotomy was performed through the fourth intercostal space, and the fifth rib was divided posteriorly. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established using an aortic cannulation on the descending aorta and bicaval drainage. Traction sutures were placed on the pericardium to obtain a good working space to insert the left ventricular (LV) vent tube via the right pulmonary vein and anterograde and retrograde cardioplegia cannula. During cooling, the left phrenic and vagus nerves were preserved, and the intercostal arteries were clipped from the outside to prevent steal phenomenon before the aneurysm was opened.

Physical examination showed tenderness on palpation over the upper pole of the patella and absence of active movement of the knee accompanied by swelling and joint effusion. A plain radiograph showed an avulsed fragment of the superior pole of the patella (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a superior pole patellar avulsion fracture and dysfunction of the knee extensor mechanism (Fig. ).

In her past medical history, she had been diagnosed with infiltrating ductal breast cancer 1 year before. She subsequently underwent a breast conserving mastectomy and was treated by a sentinel lymph node biopsy with radiation on the entire breast and adjuvant chemotherapy with tamoxifen daily (20 mg) for 11 months. At the time of admission, neurologic examination revealed signs of a mild left sided hemiparesis (grade 4) and mild sensory loss. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) showed a small acute intracerebral hemorrhage at the right parietal cortex (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated dural AVF at the mid-portion of the SSS with an occluded posterior segment of the SSS in addition to a prominent and tortuous venous enhancement along the centrum semiovale ().

She received an offer from a brain dead, 9-month-old female donor with a terminal creatinine of 0.2 mg% and donor weight of 10 kilograms. The recipient-to-donor weight ratio was roughly six-to-one. After performing the standard multi-organ procurement, it was noted that the donor left renal vein was essentially dismembered from the inferior vena cava (IVC). This prohibited performing the standard en-bloc technique to transplant the kidneys. Normally, the suprarenal IVC is sutured closed, and the infrarenal IVC is spatulated at the iliac bifurcation for anastomosis to the recipient iliac vein. The pediatric kidneys were divided on the back table similar to an adult kidney procedure. The left renal vein was separated completely. The aorta was split down the middle and Carrel patches were made around the renal arteries. The right renal vein was elongated using the donor IVC in the standard fashion, and a venotomy was made on the side of the IVC for the anastomosis. The transplant then proceeded normally by exposing the right iliac vessels. Adequate exposure was achieved. The internal iliac veins were ligated and divided to elevate the external iliac vein and allow for a tension-free anastomosis. The external iliac artery was dissected to its full length, from the takeoff of the internal iliac artery to the inguinal ligament. The two kidneys were transplanted by stacking them on the same side. The left kidney was placed higher to allow the longer vein to cross over the iliac artery. The arterial anastomosis was performed using Carrel patch to the external iliac artery. The iliac veins were reconstructed in the usual fashion to the external iliac veins.

According to the patient, the swelling began in the upper back jaw region and gradually swelling became diffuse involving all the gums [Figure -] with bleeding on brushing and pain in all teeth on mastication.\nThe patient gave a significant medical history and informed consent was taken from him. He was diagnosed with obstructive uropathy and Stage 4 CKD 5 years ago. As reported by the patient, initially, he suffered from renal stone that was removed surgically. Subsequently, he developed recurrent renal stone of 5 mm diameter in the left kidney and urinary bladder. Following this, he suffered from renal fibrosis and hypotrophy and developed secondary hypertension for which he was taking antihypertensive medication (nifedipine) since 4 years.\nThe oral hygiene status was poor with abundant plaque and subgingival calculus. Intraoral examination revealed generalized Grade III gingival enlargement involving the interdental papillae and the marginal and attached gingiva, reddish pink in color, rounded, and bulbous contour, smooth surface texture covering most of the clinical crowns of teeth.

The patient had medical consultation and was prescribed topical medication and vitamin supplements with no relief. Her medical and family history was not significant. The patient showed no signs of skin and other mucosal involvement. Intraoral examination revealed a large shallow irregular ulcer, about 4 cm x 4 cm in diameter on the left buccal mucosa. The ulcer was round in shape with irregular margins and an erythematous halo. The base of the ulcer was covered with yellowish white pseudomembrane interspersed with erythematous area. Multiple irregular shallow ulcers were observed in the right buccal mucosa, lower labial mucosa, ventral surface, and the right and left lateral border of the tongue. Multiple pin-point isolated ulcers were evident in the soft palate (Figures -).\nThe ulcers were tender, with a yellowish white pseudomembrane on the floor that peeled off leaving an erythematous area that bled on palpation. Correlating the history of bullae and the clinical features of multiple chronic oral ulcers, the fragility of the oral mucosa (Nikolsky\u2019s sign), the provisional diagnosis of oral PV was made.

The patient was otherwise without other complaints at the time of presentation, denying nausea, vomiting, change in bowel habits, jaundice, decreased appetite and early satiety. The patient underwent a diagnostic colonoscopy which demonstrated a friable ulcerated circumferential mass in the mid-transverse colon, causing 50% occlusion of the lumen; biopsy of the mass demonstrated colonic adenocarcinoma that was KRAS wild-type. The patient underwent full staging with CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which confirmed the mass in the mid-transverse colon, as well as multiple large hypodense hepatic lesions located in segments 2, 4A, 5, 6, 7 (Figure ). This workup was performed at the outside facility, including the performance of CT-guided liver biopsy which confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma. Liver function tests and coagulation parameters were all normal at the time of presentation.\nThe patient was referred to medical oncology and began chemotherapy with fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and leucovorin (FOLFOX) with cetuximab. The patient underwent seven cycles of chemotherapy over three months and was subsequently referred to our institution for evaluation.\nUpon review of restaging CT and PET/CT scans obtained during and after chemotherapy, the patient was noted to have decrease in size of both the primary colonic lesion as well as the liver metastases, without evidence of new foci of metastatic disease (Figure ).

On detailed history, the patient reported that he had an attack of choking and coughing, while he was eating chicken during dinner one day before the onset of symptoms.\nOn examination, there was a low-grade fever and tenderness in the left side of the neck, and the pain was exaggerated by swallowing attempts. A telescopic laryngeal examination was performed. Frothy saliva was detected accumulating in the left pyriform fossa. After giving the patient some few sips of water, the examination was repeated. A white linear chicken bone was seen impacted at the left pyriform fossa with a relatively free broad base pointing anteriorly, and the other tapering end was impacted in the posterior wall of the pyriform fossa (). To rule out development of a retropharyngeal abscess, anteroposterior and lateral X-ray views of the neck were performed for the patient. Apart from the chicken bone that was poorly visualized in the lateral X-ray view of the neck, there was no evidence of retropharyngeal abscess formation.\nThe bone was removed in an office-based setting under guidance of video laryngeal rigid telescopic examination. In this procedure, a video laryngeal examination was carried out using a 70-degree rigid telescope, 3CCD camera, LCD monitor, and a light source. The patient was seated in the upright position with his head supported from the back. Using a cotton swab soaked with Xylocaine 10% and held by a Magill's forceps, the patient's oro- and hypopharynx were adequately anesthetized.

Four days before the onset of her discomfort, she had started antibiotherapy for a dentine infection following a tooth extraction. Subsequently, the patient had difficulty moving her mouth and her speech was slurred, but this was initially attributed to the dental procedure and infection. Within 1 to 2 days, there was loss of strength and numbness in her fingertips and in her feet, and she had some difficulty walking. The patient was hospitalized and a neurological examination revealed bilateral eyelid weakness and an inability to raise her eyebrows, retract her oral commissures, or show her teeth. Muscular strength in the fingers of both hands in flexion and the toes in plantar and dorsiflexion was graded as 4/5. Deep tendon reflexes of both the upper and lower extremities could not be elicited. Bilateral plantar reflexes of the skin were absent. A sensory system examination revealed a glove-and-stocking-type sensory deficit, and a markedly decreased sense of position and vibration in the distal extremities. The results of routine tests of biochemical and hematological values; thyroid function; vitamin B12 and folic acid values; urinary porphobilinogen; Bence Jones protein; urine and serum immunofixation electrophoresis; immunoglobulins A, G, and M; tumor markers; and serology were within normal limits. CSF oligoclonal band analysis yielded negative results. Electrophysiological studies revealed acute sensory and motor involvement, preservation of the sural nerve, and signs consistent with demyelinating polyneuropathy.\nBased on the clinical and electrophysiological findings, a diagnosis of GBS was made, and intravenous immune globulin treatment was initiated at a daily dose of 0.4 g/kg for 5 days.

These findings were accompanied by severe dizziness and an extremely low value of systemic blood pressure measured on both arms. Doppler ultrasound (DUS) examination followed by computed tomography angiography (angio-CT; Mar 2014) revealed thickening of the descending aorta wall, near-to-occlusion stenosis of both common carotid arteries (CCA), severe stenosis of the right subclavian artery (RSA) and occlusion of the left subclavian artery (LSA) as well as the right axillary artery.

Biochemical or immunoserum analysis revealed modest inflammation, hypoalbuminemia, slight liver dysfunction, and evidence of past EBV infection (Additional file : Table S1). Although esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed normal findings, colonoscopy revealed a few small ulcers in the terminal ileum (Additional file : Fig. 1).

From the recent medical history he mentioned a restorative dental procedure two months ago and a right shoulder tendonitis three weeks ago for which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents per os were administered.\nOn admission the patient was febrile up to 38.5\u00b0C and oligoanuric.

These findings were consistent with a renal abscess. Empiric therapy included meropenem 500 mg thrice daily iv (reduced dose on account of acute renal failure). Moreover, four blood and two urine cultures obtained after admission yielded methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).

We established that his symptom was caused by DPN in his leg, characterised by an elephant-like pigmented cutaneous tumour.\nWe planned serial excision with the resection area being from the buttock to the posterior thigh. Before the procedure, interventional radiologists performed TAE with Serescue\u2122 to the feeding vessels originated from the superior and inferior gluteal arteries and the deep femoral artery of the affected side.

Symptoms had been present for 4 weeks and had not improved after a course of antibiotics prescribed by her family physician. On physical examination, a palpable painless mass was noticed in her right abdomen, with enlarged inguinal lymph nodes as well as a palpable lump in the right breast with ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. Abdominal ultrasound (US) examination revealed a multiloculated cystic mass with solid areas measuring 35 \u00d7 30 cm in her pelvis. The US examination also showed an enlarged spleen with enlarged para-aortal lymph nodes. Subsequently, a thoracic, abdominal and pelvic multi-slice computed tomography scan (MSCT) was performed and showed a well circumscribed, solid nodule, 4 cm in diameter, in the upper outer quadrant of right breast with enlarged ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes, along with generalized abdominal lymphadenopathy, an enlarged spleen with diffuse multiple nodal masses and a complex right pelvic tumor mass with amorphous calcification similar to tooth formation. Based on the MSCT scan, a tentative diagnosis of an immature teratoma was made. The patient proceeded to surgery for a unilateral right salpingo-oophorectomy, lymphadenectomy, splenectomy, omentectomy and right breast lumpectomy. Intraoperative peritoneal washing revealed a poorly differentiated malignant tumor on cytology.\nOn macroscopic examination, the right ovary was replaced by a cystic mass with a glistening surface, measuring 17 cm in diameter (Fig. ).

She was brought into the ER from her primary care doctor\u2019s office for complaints of pelvic and leg swelling, which she attributed to poor diet. She expressed great concern over her problems being persistently ignored at all ERs she had been to.\nMs. M was found hiding in the closet of a primary care doctor\u2019s office early in the morning before it was open for business.

At the time of diagnosis, she was pregnant and was experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms of abdominal bloating, dyspepsia, heartburn, and nausea. These symptoms persisted postpartum, and the patient underwent an upper endoscopy with biopsy, which was consistent with the presence of amyloid material; however, the type could not be determined. Thereafter, the patient continued to live a fairly normal life and did not seek any further medical attention until her daughter who when turned 16 started experiencing similar symptoms and underwent an upper endoscopy with biopsy results consistent with the presence of amyloid. At that time, the family sought medical attention at our institute. The proband reported that, in spite of an overall normal life, she had continued to experience dyspeptic symptoms that worsened with stress. She also reported around 12\u201315 episodes of hematemesis since her initial diagnosis. Additional symptoms on close questioning included easy bruisability, periorbital purpura, and ecchymosis associated with activities such as retching and vomiting. An upper endoscopy was performed at the Mayo Clinic. No morphological abnormality was seen on the endoscopy; however, Congo red stain demonstrated the presence of amyloid material in the gastroesophageal junction, stomach, and duodenum. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis were normal. Proteomic assessment with laser capture mass spectrometry (LCMS) evaluation of the congophilic material detected an amino acid sequence abnormality in the lysozyme protein (I56T). Peripheral blood genotyping confirmed I56T mutation (DNA change c.221T > C) in exon 2 of the lysozyme gene, which replacing isoleucine with threonine at position 56.

She had not been taught kana reading at school during the intervention and follow-up period of the study. She did not have any major visual or hearing impairment. An intellectual functioning assessment was conducted by a clinical psychologist using the Tanaka\u2013Binet Intelligence Test-V., The participant's intellectual functioning was classified as severe (IQ = 37).\nThis study was carried out in accordance with the ethical standards established in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Furthermore, informed written consent was obtained from the participant's parent. The protocol was approved by the Oita University Faculty of Education Research Ethics Committee (28-007).\nTo assess letter knowledge, the participant was presented with a card with a kana letter on it and then asked to read each letter aloud (46 letters). As letters and their sounds are strictly linked in Japanese, the ability measured is similar to the name of the letter and knowledge of its sound in English. The number of letters correctly read was calculated as the outcome. The participant was only able to read 6 of the 46 letters before the intervention. We evaluated her performance before the intervention (assessment 1), after phase 1 of the intervention (assessment 2), after phase 2 of the intervention (assessment 3), and during a follow-up period (assessment 4) (Figure ).\nThe assessments and weekly interventions were conducted from June to December 2016. The flow of this study is presented in Figure . Each session, which lasted approximately 20 min, included modules that were developed in the previous report. The intervention was divided into two phases so as to examine the appropriateness of the procedure for the participant.

He was not vaccinated against influenza. Clinical conditions had been worsening for a few days, so that the patient was admitted to a local hospital for respiratory distress after 19 days from initial symptoms. At Emergency Department (ED) admission, he was hypoxic, with clinical and radiological signs of ARDS and he was immediately transferred to the ICU. After 6 days our ECMO center was contacted; patient was then evaluated on-site by the mobile ECMO-team and ECMO treatment was started in the peripheral hospital. The patient was transferred to Careggi Hospital in Florence.\nDiagnostic imaging showed an improvement of consolidation areas of upper pulmonary lobes and an increase of interstitial lung disease without pleural effusion. Echocardiography showed mild pulmonary hypertension. PCR assays made on pharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage were positive for viral genomes of H3N2 virus (105 copies/mL). Bronchoalveolar lavage resulted negative for bacterial aetiology. Oseltamivir (10 mg twice) was initiated. From day 8 onwards, lung functions and imaging improved and ECMO weaning was started until ECMO-off (zero gas flow) for 12 hours. On day 11, ECMO system was removed.\nAfter ECMO removal, the patient remained on supportive mechanical ventilation and he was cooperative and able to perform respiratory physiotherapy. As consequence of pulmonary inflammation, patient developed progressive pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension. Moreover, PCR for CMV was found positive (11014 copies), and therapy with ganciclovir was started. Five days after ECMO removal, the patient showed a septic exacerbation with fever up to 39\u00b0C, increased laboratory markers of infection, and worsened gas exchange which needed an increase in ventilator support. The following day, the patient's respiratory and, consequently, hemodynamic status deteriorated despite increasing ventilator setting. A high dosage of inotropes was required.
