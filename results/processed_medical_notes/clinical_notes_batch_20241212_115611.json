Once again, the staff members involved in the situation discussed the clinical case in a multiprofessional setting and weighed out every possible option. The team suspected that patient 2 suffered from an acute exacerbation of a disorder that persisted for a longer period of time or a psychotic relapse. In this case, the team decided that patient 2\u2014due to his previous aversive experiences\u2014would have extraordinarily suffered from compulsory treatment, which may exacerbate previous traumatic experiences. Also, he calmed down a bit when given a space to withdraw and did not immediately endanger himself or others; however, he remained tense for several days and threw objects whenever members of staff tried to engage him in a conversation or offered oral medication. When left alone, he did not appear aggressive or present improper handling, showed a regular food intake, and welcomed the possibility to smoke. Somewhat later, he was seeking a medical consultation and expressed the need for a low-dosage medication.

Upon presenting to our institution, she reported that her pain was severe and had been gradually worsening over time with increasing intensity five weeks prior to presentation. The patient described the pain as constant and dull, localized to the pelvis and radiating to the lower back. Her pain was initially controlled with ibuprofen; more recently, she had required opioid medications for adequate pain control. Prior to receiving care at LAC+USC, the patient was initially evaluated for pelvic pain five months following her cesarean delivery in an emergency department. No imaging was performed at that time, and the provided diagnoses were uterine fibroids and incisional scarring. The patient then presented to other urgent care settings for worsening pain. At her first urgent care visit, she was treated empirically for endometritis without improvement in her symptoms. At another urgent care visit, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed and revealed an enlarged uterus with multiple fibroids and an enlarged cavity with suspicion of hematometra. She then presented to an outside outpatient clinic for follow-up and a stenotic cervical os was visualized on exam; she was subsequently referred to our institution.\nThe cesarean delivery operative report was obtained and revealed that the cesarean delivery was performed for persistent category two fetal heart rate tracing in the setting of one prior cesarean delivery.

Since 32 years of age, he had been treated for hyperlipidemia with 20 mg of atorvastatin (cholesterol-lower agent). He had no history of alcohol abuse or smoking. Because of the gradual progression of renal failure, he was started on corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone at 30 mg/day) for the first time at 34 years of age.\nThe time course of the corticosteroid therapy is shown in Fig. . Two months after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy, he underwent tonsillectomy followed by corticosteroid pulsed treatment (500 mg of methylprednisolone for 6 days) for purpura nephritis. The prednisolone dose was gradually decreased, declining to 10 mg/day at 6 months after its initiation. He was not on any diet or exercise program during the corticosteroid therapy, even though he was overweight.\nEight months after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy, he complained of left hip pain with no antecedent triggering activity.

    "original_text": "A 55-year-old woman presented with dull aching pain on the right side of her abdomen. Abdominal examination revealed an ill-defined lump in the right lumbar area extending to the hypogastrium and iliac fossa. Ultrasound revealed a right-sided renal mass with an empty left renal fossa with an ectopic kidney at the L4 level. Dedicated triphasic CECT of the abdomen was performed for preoperative surgical planning. The CT revealed crossed fused renal ectopia on the right side (). The right renal moiety was lying opposite the L1-L4 vertebrae. The left moiety was seen lying horizontally opposite the L4-L5 vertebrae with its pelvis lying anteriorly and forming an L-shaped crossed fused ectopia. A 15-cm lobulated, minimally enhancing mass lesion was noticed to arise from the anteromedial aspect of the orthotopic kidney in the lower and interpolar region.

She had no significant medical history except for diabetes mellitus, and no abnormality on screening chest X-ray had ever been detected. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed fluid collection in a large emphysematous lesion. At first, pulmonary sequestration of the right lower lobe was suspected, but it was eventually diagnosed as pulmonary bullous emphysema because there was no aberrant artery from the aorta on enhanced computed tomography. The patient was treated with antibiotics for infected bullous emphysema. There was no clear communication between the bronchus and the bulla on bronchoscopy, but the presence of infection suggested the possibility of a communication. After the infection was cured, the localized emphysema had not decreased in size, and she continued to have repeated infection in the bulla. Therefore, it was decided that surgery to completely remove the bullous emphysematous lesion was needed. The large bullous lesion was located by CT scan from segment 9 to segment 10 in the right lower lobe, and it extended longitudinally to the border between segments 6 and 10 (Figure \n).\nVideo-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was performed, and the bullous lesion was seen both by the scope and directly by the naked eye. However, the border of the bullous lesion was not clear in the deflated lung. ICG (0.5 mg/kg) was injected into a right arm vein, and the lung was observed using the PDE imaging system through the 8-cm thoracotomy site. About 8 seconds after injection, ICG entered the lung, and the bullous lesion was detected as a defect of fluorescence contrasting with the normal lung fluorescence. The contrast remained for 30 seconds, and the ICG reached the bullous area, which was visualized as white (Figure \n). While the contrast was present, the border between normal lung and the bullous lesion was marked by electric cautery. During the marking, a scope from a 10-mm port assisted",

This child was referred to a cardiologist at our institute. The patient had a normal growth in height and weight and was not known to have any cyanotic, recurrent respiratory infection or heart failure symptoms. In addition, there was no past medical history of cardiac surgery, endocarditis, trauma, or cardiomyopathy. The echocardiography confirmed an abnormal shunt between the left ventricle and right atrium located in the very superior part of the ventricular septum close to the septal tricuspid valve and anterior mitral valve, with a diameter of 2 mm. Electrocardiography and Holter monitoring had been performed to demonstrate that there was no arrhythmia before the procedure. In addition, dilation of the right atrium (40 mm) was identified, which was not a common clinical manifestation of typical ventricular septal defect (Fig. A and B). Therefore, a rare congenital LV-RA shunt type I was suspected. In consideration of the small size of the LV-RA shunt and some previous case reports indicating that transcatheter closure would be an alternative to surgery, an invasive procedure was scheduled. During the procedure, angiography demonstrated that the right atrium first appeared with contrast medium, which then flowed into the right ventricle and pulmonary circulation (Fig. A). As a long ductus from the left ventricle to the right atrium was suspected, the ADO II was chosen for this case. The ADO II device is a type of self-expanding nitinol mesh device for the occlusion of patent ductus arteriosus. Its most special feature is that the ADO II device presents a great flexibility, which can result in little harm to valves and has been applied to some superior location ventricular septal defect closures in consideration of the interaction with aortic valves.

On presentation to the department, both his lower limbs were observed to be almost paralyzed, with a motor grade of 2 or lower in both limbs. This paralysis showed a gradual aggravation. The patient had a history of renal cell carcinoma diagnosed 7 years prior, and achieved remission without any recurrence after total nephrectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. He was also diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma 5 years ago, and yet again achieved remission after surgical treatment. The patient signed an informed consent statement, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Yeungnam University Medical Center.\nThe plain radiograph revealed the collapse of the T12 vertebral body. CT showed an acute burst fracture at the T12 vertebral body with an osteolytic mass-like lesion within the vertebral body and pedicle, causing severe encroachment of the spinal canal (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a bulging posterior cortex, with an acute fracture of the vertebral body and severe compression of the spinal cord (Fig. ). Considering his medical history and the MRI findings, a pathologic fracture with a tumorous condition was suspected. Therefore, the evaluation of the malignant potential and metastasis in the remote area was necessary. Hence, 18FDG PET/CT was performed, and 18FDG uptake at the T12 level was measured. A maximum standardized uptake value (maxSUV) of 1.7 was noted, with a central FDG defect on the vertebral body (Fig. ); this was interpreted as a benign fracture by a senior radiologist. Additionally, there was no positive uptake in the other body parts on PET/CT. Although there was a discrepancy between the interpretation of the spine fracture lesion on MRI and PET/CT, the patient required emergent surgical treatment owing to acute paraplegia caused by spinal cord compression, and we thus planned an initial surgery for the main purpose of cord",

She experienced progression of pain, sensory changes, and lopsided motor weakness to the left side of the body. At the initial physical examination, a motor grade of both upper extremities was determined as grade 4 and no weakness was found in lower extremities. She was generally mildly hypertonic, although there was no Babinski sign or clonus. She complained of mild radiating pain in both hands, which was not one-sided with inexplicit dermatome. The patient underwent brain and whole spine MRI, which revealed a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the central posterior aspect of the spinal cord at the C1-6 level (). Brain MRI showed no specific findings. She was suspected of a tumorous condition, particularly ependymoma. Following this, she was admitted to our hospital for further evaluation of neurologic change. On the second hospital day, her motor function in both upper extremities suddenly deteriorated from grade 4 to 3. Cervical MRI was performed again, which revealed further extension of the hyperintense lesion on T2 weighted image and more intramedullary enhancing lesion on the T1 weighted image than that on the initial MRI image (). We hypothesized that the origin of neurologic deterioration was spinal cord compression by tumor bleeding. We immediately started intravenous steroid therapy and carried out total laminectomy C2-6 for decompression with surgical biopsy.\nWe performed C2-6 laminectomy and after opening the dura, the spinal cord was edematous but otherwise normal (). In the operation field, there was no tumor like lesion, discoloration or hypervascularization. We obtained frozen biopsy from a site near the lesion which was obtained consistent with astrocystic cell proliferation. Due to the gross normal finding and no tumorous frozen biopsy, we stopped the removal procedure of the mass lesion to prevent another potential spinal injury.

The patient had a history of hitting an electric pole with his right thigh with abduction force during collision. The patient complained of severe pain during movement of his right hip joint. His vital signs were stable. There were no neurovascular deficits in the injured limb. An anteroposterior radiograph revealed an inferior, obturator-type dislocation of the right hip joint (). Computed tomography (CT) scan was performed before any manipulation to evaluate any associated injury. There was no additional damage to the femoral head, acetabulum or trochanteric area (). After appropriate consultations, manipulation under anesthesia was taken.\nGeneral anesthesia was administered with patient in supine position. The dislocation was reduced as per the recommended techniques. We applied continuous traction in line with femur with gentle flexion and lateral push was given on the inner thigh with the pelvis stabilized by an assistant. However, this was unsuccessful.

Due to clear resection margins and absence of any metastatic deposits in imaging, she was not given any adjuvant therapy. She was followed up for 5 years, and she was otherwise well and asymptomatic without any evidence of local recurrence.\nAfter a period of 5 years, she developed an acute onset generalized severe abdominal pain and collapsed. She did not have any external bleeding manifestations such as haematemesis or melaena. There was no history of abdominal trauma. She was immediately admitted to the emergency department, and she was found to be in class III haemorrhagic shock with a pulse rate of 125 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. Her abdomen was distended and diffusely tender. She was immediately resuscitated with intravenous crystalloid boluses and blood transfusion. Her serum beta-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (beta-HCG) was negative, excluding a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Her full blood count revealed a haemoglobin level of 5 g/dl, and a massive transfusion protocol was initiated. Her other basic investigations and clotting profile were within normal limits. Despite resuscitation, her vital parameters did not improve and her abdominal girth was gradually increasing. The abdominal ultrasound scan revealed moderate amount of free fluid with a mass around the proximal part of the pancreas. There was no evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm, and other solid organs were normal. Hence, a decision was taken to proceed with an emergency exploratory laparotomy. A computed tomography was not done as the patient was haemodynamically unstable.\nA midline laparotomy was performed.

He underwent living donor LT due to recurrent variceal bleeding with a left lobe graft from his daughter on August, 2014. During operation, fibrotic change of the peritoneum was not observed. His maintenance immunosuppressive agents were FK, MPA, and prednisone. His early posttransplant course was complicated by portal vein stenosis and a large amount of ascites that was treated with angiographic portal vein balloon dilatation and percutaneous drainage of the ascites. Klebsiella pneumoniae was cultured on the drained ascites and he was treated with ertapenem for 2 weeks. He was discharged 4 weeks after transplant without any complications. Three months after transplant, he was readmitted with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain without rebound tenderness. His upper gastrointestinal series revealed a distended stomach and jejunum with delayed passage. Abdominal CT revealed diffuse thickening of the visceral peritoneum of the small bowel loop with suspicious adhesions and decreased mural enhancement of the terminal ileum (). Tamoxifen 20 mg was administered twice a day and FK was replaced with mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus, target trough level: 5\u201310 ng/mL). Prednisolone was restarted at 4 mg twice a day. Two weeks after medical treatment, he complained of aggravated abdominal pain and a subjective fever. Follow-up CT revealed terminal ileum perforation, which was suspected due to decreased mural perfusion on the prior CT. He was taken back to the operating room and received a terminal ileum resection and anastomosis. Dissection of the fibrotic membrane and adhesiolysis were also performed ().

She was unable to recall her last menstrual period but reported taking abortion pills 2 weeks ago.

She was provisionally diagnosed with a missed miscarriage and underwent a second scan for confirmation. The repeat scan by a different operator was concordant with the initial scan (). The patient was counselled on the diagnosis accordingly and consented to a surgical evacuation of the uterus. Laboratory investigations revealed a serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (bhCG) level of 45,195 IU/L and hemoglobin level of 6.5 g/dL, prompting initiation of a packed cell transfusion.

A CT scan of the chest was remarkable for massive dilatation of the proximal PA () but did not reveal evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. Our subsequent differential diagnosis included progressive pulmonic stenosis with right ventricular failure, progressive pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular failure, LMCA compression from massive PA dilatation, and left mainstem bronchus compression from PA dilatation. These potential diagnoses were evaluated through a series of diagnostic tests. First, a cardiac MRI revealed a bicuspid pulmonic valve with a peak gradient estimated at 18 mmHg and an impaired right ventricular ejection fraction (27%). Subsequently, a right heart catheterization revealed pulmonary arterial pressure of 93/38 (52), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18 mmHg, right atrial pressure of 18, Qp:Qs = 1:1, and a gradient across the pulmonic valve of 15 mmHg without significant regurgitation. Next, as attention shifted to the potential mechanical complications caused by this massive PA dilatation, pulmonary function testing was performed but did not show obstructive lung disease as would be expected if left main bronchus narrowing contributed significantly to his symptoms. Last, to evaluate the LMCA, a CT angiogram of the coronary arteries was performed (). The CT angiogram showed effacement of the LMCA, but no compression or flow limitation. The most significant finding from these diagnostic tests was severe pulmonary hypertension with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and without either a significant gradient across the pulmonic valve or physiologic evidence of significant mechanical compression of the surrounding structures. Therefore, we started the patient on bosentan (an endothelin receptor blocker) as his clot burden is distal and not amenable to thromboendarterectomy.

She had a medical history of right knee arthroscopy in 2001 due to a cruciate ligament injury. Complete blood count, electrolyte panel, coagulation screening, electrocardiography, and plain radiographic findings were all within normal limits. A physical examination revealed moderate tenderness and swelling in the left thigh and knee area. We could not check motor grade of the left knee due to severe pain. Open reduction and internal fixation with a tension band wiring was performed under spinal anesthesia three days after admission to the emergency room. A pneumatic tourniquet was inflated to 370 mmHg at the onset of the procedure and was deflated 80 minutes after surgery. Her leg was elevated to 30 degrees immediately after surgery, and an ice bag was applied to the operation site. Immediate full weight bearing and range of motion were allowed. There were no signs of infection. The patient was discharged with a crutch four days after the operation.\nThe patient returned the following week for consultation. She had marked pain in the left knee area, difficulty in extending the knee, and weakness of the quadriceps muscle. She was referred to a rehabilitation physician and a neurologist for electromyography-nerve conduction velocity (EMG-NCV) testing, but she refused the test.\nEight weeks after being discharged, she was readmitted because of persistent pain and neurologic symptoms. At that time, manual muscle testing of the left lower limb showed grade IV hip abduction, grade V adduction, grade III hip flexion, grade II knee extension, grade V ankle dorsiflexion, and grade V plantar flexion.

Patient reports a three-month history of abnormal bowel movements and a 3-week history of an enlarging, palpable abdominal mass. A CT scan obtained at the OSH revealed a 14 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 20 cm abdominopelvic mass causing ureteral obstruction and bilateral hydronephrosis, with no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (). Physical examination revealed the patient had an undescended left testicle, palpable in the left inguinal canal. Serum tumor markers for testicular cancer were obtained and beta HCG was found to be 10 mIU/ml (upper limit of normal), AFP was within normal limits, and LDH was elevated at >6x the upper limit of normal. The patient underwent a percutaneous biopsy of the mass by interventional radiology, and he subsequently underwent cystoscopy with bilateral ureteral stent placement and radical left inguinal orchiectomy. The percutaneous biopsy returned positive for metastatic seminoma (). The left radical orchiectomy specimen contained no tumor (). Ultrasound of the right testis revealed no lesions (). CT of the chest was negative for metastatic disease. The patient underwent 4 cycles of BEP. Two cycles were given without bleomycin, the first due to PFT abnormalities and the last due to rash development with bleomycin during the 3rd cycle.

He had no history of congenital venous disease. He had recent shortness of breath with exertion. His New York Heart Association status was class II. Echocardiogram results showed severe MR due to P3 prolapse, moderate TR, and pulmonary hypertension. The left ventricular function was normal with ejection fraction at 61 % and coronary angiogram findings revealed no significant coronary artery stenosis. Renal function was normal with creatinine at 0.69 mg/dl and preoperative hematocrit at 41 %. A preoperative nutritional assessment showed a normal serum albumin level.\nThe patient underwent a mitral valve repair with P3 resection and suture, followed by ring anuloplasty and tricuspid anuloplasty procedures using a prosthetic ring via a right mini-thoracotomy. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established with antegrade arterial flow through the right subclavian artery, and bicaval venous drainage through the superior vena cava and right femoral vein. We checked the position of venous cannula by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Also, we confirmed the position under direct vision when performing tricuspid annuloplasty. Cardiac arrest time was 219 min and cardiopulmonary bypass time until declamping aorta was 262 min. During main procedure, cardiopulmonary bypass flow, mean arterial pressure, and central venous pressure (less than 5 mmHg) were stable within normal range. The value of hematocrit during cardiopulmonary bypass was between 22 and 25 %, and base excess was around \u22125.0 mEq/L. Blood transfusion was also performed. We observed no sign of poor venous drainage from his lower body, such as severe edema of lower extremity and ascites. While weaning from the bypass, the patient became hemodynamically unstable and the weaning became difficult.

Her shoulder problem had started 3 months earlier, and there was no history of trauma or fracture. At first the pain was intermittent and bearable, but then gradually increased. On examination, there were no positive signs except for localized pain. A radiologic examination on 3 April 2017 found no destruction of the shoulder (Fig. ). Pain at the shoulder joint became gradually aggravated, together with the appearance of shoulder joint dysfunction. Two months later, physical examination revealed mild swelling of the shoulder, and markedly restricted shoulder and elbow motion. Mild distal nerve function defects appeared gradually. Radiography on 3 June 2017 showed that the head of the humerus had disappeared within the past 2 months (Fig. ), which was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (Fig. a, b).\nThe patient is a healthy, active individual with no history of weight loss, anorexia, or fever during this period. General and systemic examination findings were within normal limits. Routine laboratory investigations were also normal, including levels of serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. An open biopsy of the lesion revealed that the bony tissue had been replaced by fibrous connective tissue, and small areas of bony trabeculae with occasional osteoclasts were visible (Fig. ). There was no evidence of malignancy or tuberculosis. Because of the lack of any clinical findings or supporting data for other causes, the features were confirmatory of GSD.

Computed tomography revealed a right ASDH of 1.5 cm in diameter and a 15-ml oval subcortical hematoma in the right occipital lobe associated with slight perifocal edema. The midline was slightly shifted to the left (fig. ). We planned our strategy of emergent removal of ASDH after diagnosis of the hemorrhagic source.

The main feeding arteries were the right middle meningeal artery, parietal branch of the superficial temporal artery and meningeal branch of the right occipital artery (fig. ). Shunt flow was not markedly high and drained into the superior sagittal sinus and vein of Galen via cortical veins on the occipital lobe associated with venous pouches and cortical reflux. The lesion was classified as type IV on the Cognard classification. ASDH removal was planned after obliteration of the hemorrhagic source of dural AVF by endovascular treatment because the consciousness level was not aggravated under hyperosmotic fluid administration, and endovascular embolization could be performed immediately after DSA. Transarterial embolization was performed via the right middle meningeal artery. Venous pouches were suspected ruptured points and were occluded with diluted n-butyl cyanoacrylate. Shunt flow disappeared after embolization. Craniotomy was subsequently performed and the subdural hematoma was evacuated with external decompression within 1 h after transarterial embolization. No hemorrhagic point was observed on the surface of the cortex. The shunting point on the surface of the dura mater was also removed. His consciousness level improved after surgery.

His course is best described as relapsing and remitting in nature. He had left upper and lower limb spastic weakness, double vision, jerky eye pursuit, and some cognitive deficits mainly in attention. Depression and anxiety screening was negative, although patient reported frustration with his \u201cslowed thinking.\u201d Patient's MRI showed significant white matter involvement including left prefrontal and parietal white matter, areas that are relevant to attention (). On cognitive assessment using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MoCA) original English version [] patient scored 23 out of 30 missing one point on letter fluency, 4 points on delayed recall though he was helped with cueing, one point on copying the cube, and one point on sentence repetition. His categorical fluency was 12 animals in one minute while letter fluency was 7 words starting with letter \u201cF\u201d in one minute.\nBased on case reports of benefit of Cholinesterase inhibitors in MS patients [] we offered a trial of Rivastigmine patch which was ineffective. Patient inquired about TMS as an enhancer of brain function. We speculated that enhancing left prefrontal cortical activation may enhance attention. We offered a trial of five daily sessions of high-frequency rTMS applied to left dorsolateral prefrontal location. Although patient reported subjective improvement in \u201cthinking,\u201d there was no significant effect of this intervention on cognitive function except for reduction in the time needed to complete Trail A from 122 to 60 seconds. Patient spontaneously reported walking faster and with less effort. This was in keeping with the finding of faster completion of Trail A, which is largely a speed of processing task.

She initially presented with a history of previous endoscopic sinus surgery in Russia more than 20 years ago followed by nasal polyposis treated with ambulatory cauterization. She was also noted to have a history of nonmelanotic skin cancers of the nose treated with radiation in Russia.\nPhysical exam findings included a fleshy intranasal lesion that, in the setting of previous nasal skin cancer treated with radiation, raised a concern for possible secondary carcinoma. Computed tomography showed complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus, obstruction of the right ostiomeatal complex, and soft tissue density in the right nasal passage ().\nInitial biopsy revealed a nasal mass that originated in the right inferior meatus. Pathology showed multiple polypoid fragments lined by a respiratory type epithelium with underlying edematous stroma with mild chronic inflammation. There was invagination of the surface epithelium into the underlying stroma resulting in nested aggregates of bland glandular and mucinous cells and focally benign squamous epithelium (). These features were found to be consistent with a benign inverted papilloma.\nThe patient presented with continued nasal obstruction and was evaluated for definitive treatment. Given her diagnosis of inverted papilloma and chronic rhinosinusitis, complete excision and revision endoscopic sinus surgery was recommended. During endoscopic sinus surgery, an exophytic mass with abnormal maxillary mucosa was seen emanating from the left inferior meatus that was thought to originate from the right maxillary sinus, given that it was protruding through a bony dehiscence into the inferior meatus and nasal cavity.

The patient initially decided to forego treatment; however, imaging 9 months later showed numerous subcutaneous and pulmonary metastases. The patient began treatment with BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in April of 2012. Subsequent serial PET/CT scans two months later indicated mixed response to therapy, with resolution of pulmonary and numerous subcutaneous nodules with the development of multiple new nodal and subcutaneous lesions. Throughout the following two years of vemurafenib therapy, this pattern of new and resolving nodal and subcutaneous metastases continued. Due to an overall decrease in disease burden and patient preference, treatment was continued. In September of 2014, vemurafenib was discontinued due to CT and MRI indicating significant metastases in the brain and bones. The patient completed a course of radiotherapy to L4 and L5 lesions as well as radiosurgical and radiotherapy treatment for the brain metastasis with good response. He was then started on ipilimumab for systemic therapy. After 4 cycles, CT and MRI demonstrated stable disease. Immunotherapy was held due to a period of colitis, but on resolution, a maintenance dose of ipilimumab was given. However, due to significant cutaneous metastasis, ipilimumab was discontinued in late May of 2015, and the decision was made to proceed with wide excision of the subcutaneous masses and hold systemic therapy with reimaging in 6 weeks.

    "original_text": "This is the case of a 50-year-old female, with a family history of pancreatic cancer, who was found to have a chest lesion on chest X-ray carried out in 2006 because of intermittent cough since 2000. A subsequent CT scan of the thorax confirmed a 13-mm nodule on the upper right lobe of the lung, which did not seem suspicious for malignancy. Following a FDG-PET, which did not pick up on the nodule (SUV max 1.25), observation of the lesion was decided with yearly scans. Up until 5 years later, the lesion seemed to have remained unchanged. However, the imaging follow-up of December 2010 showed a new lesion in the right breast. In January 2011, she underwent right breast quadrantectomy for a lump histologically perceived as an infiltrating triple negative lobular carcinoma, with a negative sentinel node. This result was confirmed from a second pathologist later on. Surgery was followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, completed in July 2011. In August 2012, a left breast nodule was detected on mammogram and confirmed on MRI. Biopsy of the lesion resulted in a triple negative invasive ductal carcinoma. A PET/CT with FDG was carried out which surprisingly showed a high uptake only on the old pulmonary nodule, which had increased in the meantime, becoming 3 cm in diameter (SUV max 5.9). Biopsy of the lesion was suspicious for a carcinoid. In June 2012, the patient underwent a right lobectomy and right hilomediastinic lymph node dissection. Histology reported a neuroendocrine neoplasm with Ki67 of 18%. Clinically, the patient showed PD from the left breast with subcutaneous nodules formation. It was decided to proceed to a bilateral mastectomy with subcutaneous nodules removal in July 2012. The histological result showed a neuroendocrine tumour, Ki67 of 12% and negative left sentinel node.

On examination, there were no positive signs except for localized pain. A radiologic examination on 3 April 2017 found no destruction of the shoulder (Fig. ). Pain at the shoulder joint became gradually aggravated, together with the appearance of shoulder joint dysfunction.

At that time, the mass was diagnosed as a benign lesion after incisional biopsy. She became pregnant and about 1 year after child delivery, the left breast mass grew significantly larger. On clinical suspicion of malignancy with global infiltration of the left breast, she was referred to our center. Mammography showed an asymmetric increased density in the left breast. Multiple-site core needle biopsy was performed, but it led to no definite pathological diagnosis. Consequently, the patient was scheduled for open biopsy. Under general anesthesia, the mass was entered via an incision on the most prominent site. After the removal of a 2\u00d72 cm tissue biopsy, a cavity was opened beneath the excised tissue which was full of blood clot. Following the removal of the clot, active bleeding occurred. Bleeding was diffuse and uncontrollable, such that within a few minutes, the patient lost about 1500 cm of blood. Effective packing was performed. The next day, after the patient had stabilized, she was retransferred to the operating room for the removal of the pack. However, due to severe bleeding after the removal of the pack, packing was reapplied. Chest computed tomography scan revealed a large, well-enhanced mass in the left breast without invasion to the skin or pectoralis muscles and also enlarged left axillary lymph nodes ().\nAccording to the final pathology report, histological sections of the mass demonstrated a vascular tumor with interconnecting blood channels lined by atypical, pleomorphic endothelial cells. Mitotic figures and areas of necrosis were also seen (). The tumor cells were immunoreactive for CD31, CD34, and vimentin but not for cytokeratin.

This was treated with supportive measures and her general health improved. Then she developed severe fear, anxiety, irritability, and sleeplessness for which she was suspected as having reactive depression secondary to family stressors. While on treatment she came to NIMHANS with weakness of right sided limbs with inability to speak. Examination revealed thin built patient who was pale. Her blood pressure was 70/46 mm of Hg. She had right hemiplegia with global aphasia. Her fundus showed mild temporal pallor and she had pigmentation over both legs and sparse hair. There was history of mild intermittent fever on questioning, which improved with symptomatic measures. There was history of another episode of transient left sided weakness in the past which improved on its own and was ignored. Patient underwent investigation for vasculitis including skin biopsy. Her skin biopsy specimen showed oedema of Capillary dermis with scattered lymphocytes and histocytes that are also seen in the deeper dermis surrounding hair follicles and small venules. Pigment incontinence with melanin pigment laden macrophages seen just beneath the epidermis which is flattened with vacuolation of basal keratinocytes suggestive of vasculitis. Her Anti-Phospholipid antibody both IgG and IgM were positive. MRI done outside showed diffuse atrophy with slight increase in the mineralization of the basal ganglia. CT scan showed diffuse atrophy with old calcified granulomas []. CSF showed antimicrobial antibody positive which corroborates with the CT finding of calcified granulomas, with 1 cell/mm3, Chloride\u2013 122 mEq/L, Glucose 35 mg/dl and Protein 155 mg/dl. Two months after diagnosis and initiation of treatment patient conceived again inspite of advice to the contrary.

Her psoriatic arthritis was in remission on methotrexate 15 mg once weekly, folic acid 15 mg once weekly and paracetamol as required. She had recently returned from a holiday in Spain and was treated for a chest infection with a course of amoxicillin. Clinically she was icteric but examination was otherwise normal. Blood tests revealed a bilirubin of 65 \u03bcmol/L, ALP 501 IU/L and ALT 628 IU/L. These had been normal one month previously.\nThe differential diagnosis for this patient\u2019s presentation was considered to be either drug related (secondary to antibiotics or methotrexate) or a viral infection. The methotrexate was withheld and she underwent a full liver screen. An abdominal ultrasound showed fatty liver infiltrates but no other significant pathology. She was found to be positive for hepatitis E virus (HEV) IgG and IgM antibodies. The LFTs normalized within 4 weeks after which she was recommenced on methotrexate and have subsequently remained normal.\nHEV is a ubiquitous single stranded RNA non-enveloped virus with four main genotypes. HEV1 and 2 are usually transmitted via contaminated water in developing countries whilst HEV3 and 4 are zoonotic, commonly infecting wild and domesticated pigs amongst other mammals []. The virus is well known for its severity in pregnant women, where mortality rates can approach 15\u201320% in contrast to healthy individuals where the infection is usually asymptomatic [, ].\nIn patients with compromised immune systems, such as patients on chemotherapy or transplant maintenance medication, chronic HEV infection, where HEV RNA persists for >3 months, is well documented []. Although frequently self-limiting these infections can rarely lead to liver cirrhosis [].\nPatients with inflammatory arthritis receive similar immunosuppression from DMARD therapy and therefore are at increased risk of chronic HEV infection []. Similar to healthy individuals HEV infected RA patients are frequently asymptomatic however common complaints include jaundice, right upper quadrant abdominal",
