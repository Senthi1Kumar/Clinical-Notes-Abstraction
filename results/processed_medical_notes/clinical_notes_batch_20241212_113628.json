The arterial line was inserted in the right axillary artery, the vent was placed in the right upper pulmonary vein, and two-stage venous line was inserted through the right auricula. The intact aortic valve was resuspended. Extracorporeal circulation was suspended after induction of moderate hypothermia (25\u00b0C) and the aortic cross-clamp from the ascending aorta was removed. The false lumen was then glued and an open distal anastomosis to a prosthetic graft was constructed. Then, extracorporeal circulation was resumed, systemic circulation was deaired and the patient was warmed.\nEarly on the first postoperative day, CT of the aorta was requested because of marked elevation of lactate-dehydrogenase (129 \u03bckat/l) and signs of acute renal insufficiency (creatinine 292 \u03bcmol/l). CT showed good postoperative result in the ascending aorta, but large amount of air in the branches of the superior mesenteric artery up to the arcades was found (Figure ). There was absolutely no air in the portal-venous system including the liver. The bowel loops were not distended, and there were no signs of bowel paralysis.\nAt midnight on the first postoperative day, a biphasic CT scan of the abdomen was requested due to elevated intra-abdominal pressure (18 mmHg). The CT showed distribution of the intra-arterial gas more into the periphery and into the wall of the bowel loops that still did not display signs of ileus (Figure ).

Nasopharyngeal endoscopy and biopsy already had been performed in another hospital, showing nonkeratinizing undifferentiated NPC. This histopathologic diagnosis was confirmed in our center. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the nasopharynx and neck revealed the tumor was confined to the nasopharynx and the bilateral locoregional cervical lymph nodes enlarged with its greatest dimension of 2 cm. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound of abdomen, and whole-body bone scan ruled out distant metastases. So clinical staging was determined to be T1N2M0, IIIA according to American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM Staging System for NPC (7th ed, 2010).\nThe patient was treated with definitive IMRT to 7050 cGy for primary tumor and 6600 cGy for infiltrated regional lymph nodes.

Due to concerns for Acute Coronary Syndrome, patient was given 324 mg aspirin. EMS was called to transport the patient to an Emergency Department (ED) for further evaluation with a STEMI alert activated. Upon further assessment in the ED, patient was chest pain free. He denied worsening of pain with inspiration and movement. On examination, the patient was comfortable without being dyspneic at rest. Labile blood pressures with tachycardia were noted on telemetry. He was taken up to cardiac catheterization lab and was started on therapeutic IV Heparin. On further examination, obtaining a thorough history, and review of systems, he was chest pain free and his symptoms were not consistent with acute coronary syndrome. Bedside echocardiogram demonstrated a large pericardial effusion. STAT Transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed a large pericardial effusion with pre-tamponade physiology (end-diastolic right atrial collapse). Meanwhile, patient was becoming increasingly dyspneic. CTA chest and abdomen showed no extravasation of contrast and no evidence of dissection. Cardiothoracic surgery physician performed an emergent pericardial window, which drained 350\u2013400 ml of yellow murky pericardial fluid.

There was no indication of cervical lymphadenopathy.\nA panoramic radiographic examination showed resorption of the right mandibular condyle to the ramus (Fig. ). Computed tomography (CT) showed destruction of the right mandibular condyle and a large mass lesion with enhanced margin in the masticator space; a cystic lesion was present inside the tumor mass. Three-dimensional CT was useful to understand the bone resorption findings of the mandibular condyle. There was no finding of metastatic cervical lymph node (Fig. ). T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed an enhanced mass lesion in the right masticator space. Because some portions of the mass lesion showed high intensity in T2-weighted images, cystic lesions were suspected to exhibit changes of blood flow or retention of high-protein liquid. Tumor development was not observed in the articular disk of the temporomandibular joint (Fig. ). FDG-PET revealed abnormal FDG uptake in the right submandibular condyle and masticator space.\nA malignant tumor was suspected after analysis by various modalities.

Hand compression of the wound and aggressive fluid therapy were performed simultaneously. With only a slight hemodynamic improvement, an emergency laparotomy in the emergency room (ER) was immediately initiated.\nLaparotomy was conducted through an abdominal midline incision, and there was massive hematoma in the abdominal cavity. The stab wound was identified on the surface of the left liver, where the bleeding was profuse and continuous (Fig. a). The skin incision was extended into an inverted L-shape to adequately expose the whole liver. Since clamping of the hepatoduodenal ligament using the Pringle\u2019s maneuver did not reduce bleeding, a deep liver laceration involving a hepatic vein or IVC injury was suspected. Neither hand compression nor gauze packing controlled the bleeding, and therefore, a left hepatectomy was performed to adequately expose the injured vessels. The left hepatic vein was ligated and divided, the left hepatic hilar plate was divided using a stapler, and the left hepatectomy was completed. However, the laceration of the liver parenchyma reached deeper into the resection surface, and persistent bleeding continued from the laceration (Fig. b). Suturing of the lacerated liver parenchyma was attempted. However, bleeding was still unable to be controlled (Fig. c). Fortunately, temporal hemostasis was achieved by gauze packing probably because hemostasis from the injured peripheral left hepatic vein was obtained and gauze compression close to the bleeding point was effective.

Later his father had recurrent superficial vein thrombosis and was diagnosed to have FVL mutation (by real-time polymerase chain reaction). The child was subsequently screened and found to be heterozygous for FVL (by real-time polymerase chain reaction). But the boy did not have any history suggestive of thrombotic episodes. When a Fontan procedure was planned, haematologist opinion was obtained and he was screened for other prothrombotic conditions with protein C, protein S, prothrombin mutation, antithrombin III, anticardiolipin, and lupus anticoagulant studies. He was negative for all these tests. Diagnostic cardiac catheterization was done and the hemodynamics were found suitable for Fontan. The mean pulmonary artery pressure was 10 mm Hg. One collateral was embolized with a coil. Heparin was used in the routine dose (2500 units) during catheterization and there were no complications after the procedure. Subsequently he underwent extracardiac Fontan surgery using 18 mm PTFE graft without fenestration. The following strategies were followed to prevent thrombosis during the Fontan procedure. (1) Heparin infusion was started preoperatively and continued postoperatively for 2 days so as to maintain an APTT of 1.5-2 times the control. (2) Central venous catheter was removed early. (3) Warfarin was added on the first postoperative day. (4) He was ambulated early to prevent venous thrombosis. (5) Heparin infusion was changed to subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg q12h and continued for 7 days postoperatively till his INR was consistently above 2.0.

She had multiple back operations including an L3-L5 laminectomy performed two months at another institution prior to presentation without resolution of symptoms. On examination, her lower extremities were intact except for bilateral 3/5 strength in her anterior tibialis and extensor hallucis longus. An initial computed tomography (CT) scan (Figure ) revealed a two-column burst fracture at L4 with 9mm retropulsed fracture fragments that resulted in severe, nearly complete, spinal canal stenosis. Two-column fracture also involved the L5 level with extension into the left L5 pedicle. There was associated significant bony resorption at L4 and L5. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine with and without contrast (Figure ) was obtained to further assess the ligamentous structures, spinal canal, and nerve roots. MRI was also obtained to evaluate for possible associated neoplastic or infectious etiologies. A multi-disciplinary approach to care, including vascular surgery, neuroradiology, and neurosurgery recommended a corpectomy with subsequent posterior stabilization. The corpectomy was performed through an anterior approach with a staged posterior L2-pelvis instrumentation five days later.\nA standard abdominal aortic exposure was performed by the vascular surgery team. Once the aorta, inferior vena cava, lumbar arteries, and veins were exposed; most of these small branches were ligated in continuity; which allowed for further easier exposure of the spine by carefully retracting both the aorta and inferior vena cava laterally in opposite directions. Through a small window between the aorta and the inferior vena cava, we were able to expose the anterior spine, which was significantly scarred and inflamed. We then proceeded with the identification of the L3-L4 disk space",

A minimal access 6 cm skin incision was made, and the chest entered via a limited upper sternotomy extending to the right 3rd intercostal space. Cannnulation was performed via the ascending aorta and right atrium (Figure ). Following transverse aortotomy, the aortic valve was inspected revealing a round mass at the very edge of the left coronary cusp. The lesion was excised, sparing the AV, and the valve tested confirming perfect competence prior to closure. Total cross clamp time was 16 minutes with an uneventful wean from bypass. Prior to decannulation, intra-operative TOE confirmed normal valve competence and good overall myocardial function. Total operative time was 52 minutes. The excised lesion measured 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 3 mm (Figure ).

She did not report of new neurological disability after trauma: no new motor dysfunction, no long tract signs, neither bladder nor bowel dysfunction. There was no history of malignancy in her family. MRI studies revealed a solid mass of 16x14x12 cm in the inferior posterior mediastinum on the left side with infiltration of Th9 and Th10 vertebral body and spinal canal infiltration with myelon compression (Figure 1 , Figure 2 ). Staging procedure including total spine MRI, abdominal and chest computed tomography (CT), cranial CT, and PET CT did not show distant metastasis. The interdisciplinary tumor board decided to perform a transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy first. The histopathological examination could not define a clear diagnosis. Therefore an open biopsy was performed. This result was not clear, too. At last, pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma or liposarcoma with rhabdomyogenic dedifferentiation were discussed.

On initial presentation, the patient had an antalgic gait, which he attributed to his history of dopa-responsive dystonia. His mood was depressed and his affect was restricted. He had disorganized thought process and was slow to recall. He endorsed auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions, depressive symptoms, frequent night awakenings, and persecutory nightmares. Per the ambulance report, the patient was wandering the streets in a confused state, so bystanders called 911. The patient stated that he had been homeless for the past 3 weeks. During this 3-week period, he admitted to not being complaint with his medications. Urine toxicology screen was negative.\nPer medical records, he was diagnosed with dopa-responsive dystonia at age 11 after a 2.5-year history of progressive abnormal gait. He was initially misdiagnosed with tight heel cords at age 10 and treated with serial casting that resulted in good improvement on the right but marginal improvement on the left. His toe walking became more pronounced overtime accompanied by worsening left calf pain and stiffness, increasingly frequent falls, and new onset of intermittent torticollis. These symptoms worsened over the course of the day. He was eventually taken to an urban teaching hospital, where he was diagnosed with dopa-responsive dystonia based on clinical presentation and marked improvement on a levodopa trial. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine was unremarkable at the time.\nAt age 15, he was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. His psychiatric history is also significant for multiple psychiatric hospitalizations, history of previous suicide attempts with medication overdose, and history of trauma.

After a medical appointment at the ophthalmologic clinic at a regional hospital, a decision to remove the lesion was taken and an operation was carried out in August 2011. The pathology report showed a 13\u00d711\u00d77 mm malignant melanoma located in the conjunctiva with a minimal resection\u2019s margin. The patient was re-operated one month later and the pathology report revealed a remnant of the melanoma with still a minimal resection\u2019s margin. Therefore, the patient received cryotherapy. Four months after the first surgical procedure five new tumor lesions were detected in the same eye. Treatment with mitomycin eye drops was initiated, however enucleation of the right eye had to be carried out two months later to obtain local control. One month post enucleation, a CT scan of the chest and abdomen showed no metastases. However, yet two months later, positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-D-glucose integrated with computed tomography (18 F-FDG PET/CT also referred as PET/CT scan) revealed an orbital, a parotid gland and a suspected lung metastasis. Treatment with temozolomide was started and carried on for five months until progressive disease in all locations including the lung was noted in a new PET/CT scan. Shortly thereafter, the patient was included in a trial and received immunostimulatory gene therapy with the investigational drug AdCD40L in combination with low dose cyclophosphamide. Specifically, the patient received four weekly ultrasound-guided intratumoral injections in the parotid gland.

She had no history of nausea, vomiting, weight loss, or anorexia. There was no significant medical, surgical, and family history. On per abdomen a 26 weeks lump was palpable []. Ultrasonography was done, and it showed a markedly enlarged uterus containing a 16 cm \u00d7 17 cm subserosal fibroid and 3 cm \u00d7 4 cm intramural fibroid. Bilateral ovaries were not visualized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggestive of subserosal fundal myoma of 11.2 cm \u00d7 9.6 cm \u00d7 14.2 cm, 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm intramural fibroid in the lateral wall of the uterus and a small submucosal fibroid of dimension 1.1 cm \u00d7 0.9 cm \u00d7 0.8 cm. Endometrium showed an 8-mm thickness. Bilateral ovaries appear normal with multiple small follicles. After discussion with the patient, the laparoscopic route of myomectomy was chosen. A veress needle was introduced supraumbilicaly and pneumoperitoneum was created. The abdominal pressure was raised to 12mm HG. For telescope, Ten-millimeter port was created and under vision two 5mm accessory port was created on the right and left quadrant. The intraoperative finding was suggestive of a giant myoma arising from the uterine fundus and occupying the entire abdomen []. It was a big challenge to manipulate such a giant myoma. Twenty units of vasopressin was diluted in 200 ml saline and was injected into the myometrium until the blanching was achieved.

The patient had undergone successful endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and a right common iliac artery (CIA) aneurysm 6 years ago, and had been lost to follow-up since 3 months after the procedure.\nIn computed tomographic angiography (CTA) before the EVAR procedure, the patient had an aortic aneurysm; the maximal diameters of the infrarenal AAA and the right CIA aneurysm were 50 mm and 36 mm, respectively. Even though the aorta was tortuous with a proximal angle of 75\u00b0, the proximal aortic diameter of 26 mm and proximal neck length of 33 mm seemed anatomically suitable for an EVAR procedure (). At that time, EVAR using the SEAL stent graft (S&G Biotech, Seongnam, Korea) was performed under general anesthesia. A bifurcated proximal graft measuring 30 mm in diameter was used as the main body; on the right side, the right internal iliac artery was covered with a limb extension using a 12-mm stent graft, and on the left side, a 20-mm bell bottom-shaped endograft was placed before the iliac bifurcation. After the surgery, no endoleak was observed on the CTA images either immediately or 2 months postoperatively. The patient did not visit the hospital again until 6 years later, when she presented with a palpable abdominal mass.\nIn the initial CTA images obtained during the more recent admission, type Ia and Ib endoleaks were observed, and a type III endoleak was also suspected (). The maximal diameters of the aneurysms were 61 mm for the AAA; 41 mm for the right CIA; and 35 mm for the left CIA.

Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) that was performed at the local clinic revealed jejunojejunal intussusception owing to a solitary polyp (). She had no specific past medical, surgical, or familial history. Her vital signs were stable. On examination, the abdomen was mildly distended, but rigidity and rebound tenderness were not clearly elicited. All laboratory findings were within the normal range. There was no evidence of definite bowel obstruction in the plain abdominal X-ray taken in our emergency department. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) was performed to evaluate the current status of intussusception. There was still long segmental small bowel intussusception with a target sign at the left periumbilical area (). We decided to perform an emergent operation.\nWe used a 12 mm supraumbilical port for the camera. 5 mm ports were placed in the right mid- and lower quadrants of the abdomen (). A jejunojejunal intussusception was found to be approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. The intussusceptional segment was approximately 50 cm in length. The involved bowel was dilated, but there was no evidence of bowel ischemia or perforation. Laparoscopic intracorporeal reduction with blunt graspers was performed cautiously. We palpated the remaining small bowels to the terminal ileum using laparoscopic instruments, showing no other masses or abnormalities. Afterwards, a 5 cm extension of the vertical incision was made along the supraumbilical port site, through which the small bowel was exteriorized. The large solitary luminal protruding polyp was located in the jejunum (). Approximately 10 cm of jejunum including the polyp was resected.

After a week of hospitalization, oxygen saturation still could not be maintained with mechanical ventilation.

He had no past medical history and was not on any medications. His physical examination preoperatively was normal. Surgery was scheduled for the late afternoon. He was fasted for 6h for solids and 2h for clear fluids. The World Health Organization surgical checklist for safety in the operating room [] was complied with intraoperatively, which included the prohibition of jewellery and other constrictive clothing items worn during surgery. After establishing intravenous access with a 22-guage cannula in a vein in the cubital fossa of his left arm, anaesthesia was induced with propofol (140mg) and fentanyl (50ug). A size 3 classic laryngeal mask was inserted for airway management, and spontaneous ventilation was maintained with 1 minimum alveolar concentration sevoflurane in a 50% oxygen to air mixture. Five millilitres of a local anaesthesia solution (lignocaine 2% with 1:200,000 adrenalin) was injected into the surgical area for local anaesthesia and postoperative analgesia. During surgery both of his arms were positioned by his side in a neutral position, supported by foam padding on the operating table to minimise pressure. The abdominal lesion was removed uneventfully and the procedure took 22min. Continuous electrocardiography, pulse saturation monitoring, and intermittent blood pressure measurements every 3min were normal. After uneventful emergence from anaesthesia, the laryngeal mask was removed, and he was transferred to the postoperative recovery unit for a 30-min observation period.

The pleural biopsy performed revealed dense fibrous tissue with invasive adenocarcinoma with mucin production and associated psammomatous calcifications. The patient was initially treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab with good response, and she continued on maintenance bevacizumab for four years after diagnosis. Subsequently treatment was switched to pemetrexed but had to be stopped due to secondary fatigue and failure to thrive.

Using this sample with 35 % viable tumor tissue, the patient was found to be both EGFR wild-type and ALK-negative by FISH.\nChest computed tomography (CT) scan showed that the patient had marginal progression of her right pleural rind along with slow progressive growth of right chest wall nodule. She also received palliative radiation to her right chest nodule at this time.

Chest CT examination revealed a pulmonary space-occupying lesion in the left upper lobe of the lung (Fig. ). Following fine needle biopsy, pathology confirmed the patient had lung adenocarcinoma and EGFR (Fig. ), ALK and ROS1 were negative (Fig. ). Due to the advanced age of the patient (78) together with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, EGFR-TKIs was recommended as the treatment of choice. From 23 October 2015, the patient commenced gefitinib 250 mg orally once a day until the disease progressed in July 2016 when CT scan of the chest indicated metastasis in the lung. The gefitinib, everolimus combined therapy was subsequently recommended because of disease progression. However, after a few months of combined treatment, everolimus had to be withdrawn because the patient experienced severe breathlessness, cough and mouth ulcers. At that time, the patient had been taking gefitinib for 16 months until drug resistance developed on 16 February 2017 (Fig. (a)).\nThe patient had second gene mutation testing at this time which indicated EGFR T790M mutation.

According to their medical history, the patient suffered from hypertension and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The patient was discharged free of symptoms two weeks prior to presentation in our department. Following admission to our emergency room, an immediate CT-scan and a blood test were performed, as the patient showed signs of an initiating peritonitis.The CT scan showed an isolated re-dissection in the proximal part of the SMA with embolization of a distal branch causing an almost complete decline of right hand side intestinal perfusion. Aggravating, the right hepatic artery originated from the proximal part of the SMA as an anatomical variant. The origin was located directly in the region of the dissection entry. Figure shows the major findings of the CT scan on admission. As endovascular therapy had a high risk of post interventional liver failure, the decision for open surgery was taken at an interdisciplinary level. Blood test results showed a normal serum lactate level, while C-reactive protein (CRP) and leukocytes (WBC) were raised. Thus, the patient had to be transferred urgently to the operating theatre.We resected the dissection membrane from the origin of the SMA and a selective embolectomy of the arcade arteries was performed.

The first lesion located in the greater curvature of the antrum was detected at the patient's first endoscopy in July 2010. It was classified as type IIa + IIc with dimensions of 1.5 \u00d7 1.0 cm. It had a nodular surface with a central depression and redness (Fig. ). The patient was diagnosed with H pylori infection based on a rapid urea enzyme test and eradication therapy was performed (esomeprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and bismuth quadruple therapy). Two synchronous early gastric lesions were also detected during the first endoscopy. One of these lesions was located on the lesser curvature of the antrum. It was classified as type IIa + IIc with dimensions of 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 cm. It also had a nodular surface with a central depression and redness (Fig. ). The other lesion was located at the lesser curvature of lower gastric corpus. It was classified as type IIb with dimensions of 2.0 \u00d7 1.0 cm. It had a nodular appearance and a faded mucosa (Fig. ). Over the next 7 years, she underwent endoscopy 4 times (August 2011, November 2012, March 2014, and July 2016). The 3 lesions did not show invasive features under white light endoscopy and the pathological diagnosis of endoscopic biopsies was LGD with moderate-to-severe atrophy and intestinal metaplasia (Figs. \u2013).\nIn August 2017, at her sixth endoscopy, 2 new small emerging lesions were observed. Both lesions had a central depression, surface redness, or a nodular surface under white light endoscopy, which are risk factors for EGC. ME-NBI revealed irregular microvascular and microsurface patterns with a demarcation line and confirmed the presence of the 3 lesions previously detected. The lesions were highly suspected of being EGCs according to the VS classification system reported by Yao et",

An abnormal Q wave was noted during a school checkup, but the patient did not receive medical attention. She had severe fatigue and dyspnoea at the time of admission. Gallop rhythm was heard and coolness of extremities was prominent. She also had hyperkeratosis and a bullous skin lesion of unknown cause which appeared soon after birth (). Echocardiography revealed a dilated left ventricle and ejection fraction was <20% with Teichholz method (). Chest X-ray showed massive cardiomegaly and congestion. We diagnosed her with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. We administered diuretics, dobutamine, milrinone, and human atrial natriuretic peptide, yet her heart function worsened soon after admission. She required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support on Day 25 but did not recover thereafter. We decided to implant EXCOR\u00ae as a bridge-to-transplant therapy. We did not consider the skin lesions as a contraindication because they were located on the extremities. After implantation of EXCOR\u00ae, genetic testing detected a homozygous loss-of-function mutation of calpastatin (CAST). Both parents were found to be heterozygous for the mutation, and because other examinations, including skin biopsy and mitochondrial enzyme activity, did not reveal any abnormality, this was thought to be the cause of her skin lesions. Skin condition around the return flow cannula (RFC) worsened gradually, and granulomatous tissue formation occurred (). She occasionally experienced fever, which we treated as sepsis although a positive blood culture was never observed. At nearly 2 years after admission, she started to experience intermittent fever which required antibiotics. There was no vegetation on transthoracic echocardiography, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) performed on Day 729 showed fluid retention along the RFC (). We continued debridement and antibiotic administration when required. On Day 767, she had another episode of high fever, with a positive blood culture of methicillin",

During the ultrasound scan at 22 weeks, megacystis has been noticed in the fetal pelvis with bilateral pelvicalyceal dilatation. At 24 weeks gestation, fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed which revealed a large cystic mass with a maximum diameter of 8 cm and moderate bilateral hydronephrosis. Because of lower urinary tract obstruction, fetal vesico-amniotic shunt (VAS) was implanted at 31 weeks. At birth, there was abdomen distension and absence of intestinal sounds.

Histopathological examination demonstrated osteosarcoma, and preoperative chemotherapy was immediately performed according the chemotherapy protocol of our department for osteosarcoma. On September 25, wide resection was performed, and the affected limb was reconstructed using a tumor prosthesis (Howmedica Modular Reconstruction System: HMRS). Subsequently, postoperative chemotherapy was performed for about 6 months. On May 2007, about 11 years after the operation, she noticed pain in the left thigh during walking. Due to gradual aggravation of the pain, she visited our department on September 6, 2007. X-ray examination revealed fracture at the base of the stem of the femoral component (Fig. ). We planned revision using a tumor prosthesis, and obtained a custom-made femoral component stem (diameter, 12 mm; length, 15 cm). Until the completion of the stem, a knee-ankle-foot orthosis was employed, and crutches were used for walking. The preoperative score of the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society was 60%. On November 7, 2007, revision surgery was performed. The wound was exposed using the previous skin incision. Bone formation at the stem base was good. Rectangular fenestration along the stem in the bone was performed in the proximal femur using a chisel, and the stem in the bone was removed. A new stem was inserted, and adequate grafting with Neobone and autogenous bone was performed around the stem. Only the bearing bush and femoral component were replaced with new ones, and the operation was completed (Fig. ). Two weeks after the operation, passive range-of-motion training was initiated. Until 6 weeks after surgery, no weight bearing was performed. Seven weeks after the operation, walking training was initiated using a knee orthosis with gradual weight bearing.

Clinical examination showed that her body temperature was 36.7 \u00b0C, blood pressure was 102/65 mmHg, pulse rate was 100 bpm, and oxygen saturation was 100%. Blood tests showed mild leucocytosis (16.61 \u00d7 109/L), normal platelet count, normal coagulation test, and haemoglobin of 102 g/L. Vaginal examination showed the cervix was tightly closed; no vaginal bleeding or fluid was found.

The arterial line was inserted in the right axillary artery, the vent was placed in the right upper pulmonary vein, and two-stage venous line was inserted through the right auricula. The intact aortic valve was resuspended. Extracorporeal circulation was suspended after induction of moderate hypothermia (25\u00b0C) and the aortic cross-clamp from the ascending aorta was removed. The false lumen was then glued and an open distal anastomosis to a prosthetic graft was constructed.

    "original_text": "A two-year-old boy with a left mirror foot was referred to our orthopaedic department. He was born full-term by natural delivery and was the firstborn of the couple. There was no family history of similar skeletal abnormalities and there was no history of drug or radiation exposure during gestation. The clinical and radiological assessment did not reveal any other skeletal abnormalities. The child had eight toes of a central ray pattern with a medial toe syndactyly (Figures , ) with fully developed metatarsal, proximal, middle, and distal phalanges, except for the fourth toe from the medial side which appeared to be missing a middle phalanx and had a dysplastic metatarsal. This digit was similar to a great toe (Figure ).\nSurgery was performed under general anaesthesia, and a tourniquet was applied. There was a medial toe syndactyly and the fourth toe from the medial side was abnormal; therefore, we decided to remove the second, third, and fourth toe from the medial side. Simultaneous dorsal and plantar V-shaped incisions were made in the centre of the foot, and the extra skin and three central rays were removed. The extra tendons and digital nerves were resected, and the nerve stumps were cauterised by diathermy in order to prevent a neuroma. The middle cuneiform was not removed to avoid tarsal instability. There were no tarsal bone duplications, and therefore no tarsal bones were removed. The removal of the second toe from the medial side meant an inevitable disruption of the Lisfranc ligament. Therefore, the remaining adjacent metatarsals were approximated using a percutaneous K-wire, inserted through the first metatarsal. Furthermore for the restoration of stability, the intermetatarsal ligaments were sutured.

He had experienced nausea and decreased bowel movements for a week, which were not alleviated by stool softeners or enemas. There was no history of diarrhea, fever, chills, weight changes, night sweats, hematochezia, or melena. A colonoscopy 4 years prior had only revealed a small benign polyp. The patient otherwise had no significant past medical history and was not taking any medications. No history of abdominal surgeries or significant family history of cancer was elicited. He denied the use of alcohol or smoking, but admitted to using smokeless tobacco. Vital signs and physical exam were essentially unremarkable. The abdomen was not visibly distended and normal bowel sounds were present. No hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy was appreciated. Laboratory results showed normal complete blood count, coagulation parameters, electrolytes, liver function tests, pancreatic enzymes, and kidney function. Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were within normal limits. An abdominal computed tomography scan (CT scan) was concerning for a neoplasm causing small bowel obstruction, showing mid to distal small bowel dilatation with abnormal wall thickening and significant retained debris. The patient underwent a laparotomy and resection of a distal segment of ileum was performed.\nOn gross examination, a 39 cm portion of distal ileum was received and the central portion contained an 8 cm length saccular dilatation that had a hemorrhagic and nodular mucosa (Fig. and ). The bowel wall measured up to 0.9 cm in thickness and demonstrated underlying, ill-defined pale yellow tissue extending into the mesentery.

A total dose of 50.4 Gy of radiation therapy was delivered and systemic chemotherapy consisting of low-dose cisplatin and 5FU was concurrently performed. Eight months after the initial treatment, right supraclavicular lymph node enlargement was seen on follow-up computed tomography (CT). Although 20 Gy of additional irradiation were given to the right supraclavicular fossa, the metastatic lymph node enlarged and invaded the surrounding soft tissue. Left common carotid artery was confirmed to be intact on contrast enhanced CT.\nInspection of the neck confirmed the presence of a large mass in the right supraclavicular region with carotid sheath invasion. Necrotic skin caused by the irradiation was also observed within the tumor. As a result, direct pulsation of the common carotid artery was visualized in the cutaneous pocket on gross examination (Fig. ).\nIt was determined that the patient\u2019s condition was critical, and the decision was made to proceed with a percutaneous interventional approach (Fig. ). It was decided that a covered nitinol stent graft could be placed to prevent rupture of the right carotid artery.\nAfter obtaining written, informed consent from the patient, an 8-French (8-Fr) angiographic sheath was placed via the right femoral artery. Radiopaque markers were placed on the right neck surface as markers of the appropriate position planned for placing the stent by adhesive tape before the procedure. A 4-Fr headhunter catheter was then inserted into the right common carotid artery, and angiographic examination was performed.\nAn angiogram showed a pathologic condition located at the midpoint between the origin of the right common carotid artery and the carotid bifurcation.

Serum creatinine level was within normal range at that time and therefore the anti-GBM antibody was not tested. The first renal biopsy revealed mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with fibro-cellular crescents in one out of 18 glomeruli, excluding one global sclerotic glomerulus (Fig. ), and deposition of IgA and C3 in mesangial areas by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. ). Weak but significant IgG deposition was also observed in glomeruli in the distribution somewhat different from IgA or C3 (Fig. ). The electron-dense deposits were observed in mesangial areas by electron microscopy. Therefore, the diagnosis was IgA nephropathy. Antihypertensive therapy was initiated, mainly with an RAS inhibitor. Eight months later, the patient\u2019s serum creatinine suddenly rose to 4.53 mg/dL (it was 1.04 mg/dL from the routine blood test 1 month before). Urinalysis showed 100 red blood cells per high power field and urinary protein excretion of 12.3 g/gCr (Fig. ). The serological tests that were performed to differentiate the cause of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis revealed the presence of anti-GBM antibody at the titer of 116 IU/mL and the absence of anti-nuclear antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody.
