The patient's medical history is significant for a dual pancreas and kidney transplant 16 years before this emergency department presentation. He received these transplants due to end-stage renal disease caused by type 1 diabetes mellitus. His graft function has been stable since transplant and he no longer requires insulin. He does, however, have retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy complications associated with his Type 1 diabetes diagnosis. The patient has had a colonoscopy for unintended weight loss performed a year before this emergency department visit that revealed no visual abnormalities. Upon physical examination, his vital signs were found to be stable and there were no signs of infection. He did have suprapubic tenderness.\nThe serum creatinine was 114 \u03bcmol/L with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 60 when this patient presented to the emergency department. No abnormalities were noted in the rest of the patient's blood work. The patient proceeded to undergo flexible cystoscopy to identify the source of the hematuria. A lesion that was highly suspicious for urothelial carcinoma was identified at the ureteral orifice (). It did appear that the lesion was coming from either the transplant ureter or transplant junction. The rest of the procedure was unremarkable apart from a false passage in the urethra likely from a past catheter insertion. A follow-up CT scan showed no hydronephrosis or urothelial thickening in the transplanted kidney. No mass lesion in the bladder could be identified, however, there was some mild thickening in the dome of the bladder, which was suspected to be inflammatory changes due to pancreatic duct dilatation.\nGiven the findings on cystoscopy, a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was recommended for the patient.

The mass measured 11 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 12 cm displacing the right kidney, and the right lobe of the liver and IVC anteriorly. There was focal invasion of the liver measuring 3.6 \u00d7 6.4 cm at Segment 7. The right adrenal gland was not clearly visible.

The lesion and the excised structures were sent for histopathology that showed a right liver lobe mass attached to it measuring 17 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 7 cm, and the cut section of the mass showed nodular surface with multiple areas of necrosis. Slicing of the liver showed a gray white mass measuring 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3 cm, which is adherent to the mass and the remaining liver parenchyma appear unremarkable. The microscopic examination of the mass revealed a moderately differentiated HCC measuring 5 cm in diameter, confined to the liver, <5 cm from resection margins and no lymph-vascular invasion (Fig. ), and a separate adrenocortical neoplasm measuring 17 cm in diameter, multiple foci of necrosis, no capsular or lymph-vascular invasion and resection margins were not involved by the tumor (Fig. ). Excised lymph nodes included a single right portal vein lymph node, a gallbladder lymph node and seven para aortic lymph nodes. All lymph nodes were negative for metastasis. Gallbladder examination showed no significant pathology. Postoperative assessment of the patient revealed that he recovered gradually and was discharged.",

The implantation was surgically revised in 2002 and 2006. In 2014 she noticed hardening and swelling of her right breast. Because of the death of her husband, she did not seek immediate medical attention. She continued to have swelling and increased pain in the right breast. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in January 2016 showed a large fluid collection surrounding the intact right silicone implant as shown in Figure . The case was managed by surgical drainage of fluid collection and capsulectomy. In February 2016, she underwent bilateral prosthesis explantation and bilateral capsulectomy. The pathology demonstrated a 4-cm moderately differentiated invasive SCC. It extended into the muscle, and in situ tumor was noted to extend to the peripheral margin. There was no perineural or lymphovascular invasion. Pathology of the left breast capsule showed chronic inflammation. Computed tomography (CT) of chest, abdomen and pelvis on February 2016 revealed absence of metastatic disease. The patient underwent re-excision of the remaining chest wall mass in March 2016. Pathology showed well differentiated SCC with negative margins. Chest wall fluid was negative for malignant cells. On slide review, it was noted that there was squamous epithelialization of the implant capsule with benign squamous epithelium on both sides. This indicated that the tumor is likely SCC of the implant capsule rather than primary SCC of the breast. Estrogen and progesterone receptor markers were negative as well. Afterwards, she received external beam radiation. She was treated with radiation while supine with free breathing. Four tangent beams were used to target the right breast with 50 Gray in 25 fractions, followed by a 10 Gray boost to the tumor bed delivered in five fractions. Radiation was delivered using opposed tangents completed in May 2016. No adjuvant chemotherapy was offered due to the rare histology and paucity of data.

He visited a general practitioner each time, and the condition was resolved with analgesic and antibiotics. However, his symptoms got worse and he attended our Oral Surgery Clinic for consultation.\nThe patient is a fit and healthy young man with no relevant medical history and no known history of allergy. Past surgical history revealed that he had underwent bimaxillary orthognathic surgery one and half year earlier in a local hospital. Although the postoperative period was uneventful, the surgical team informed him that there was a dislodged orthodontic appliance in his right cheek that must have occurred during the operation. The team explained to the patient that this accident was realized later on the next day after the surgery when the molar tube from the right maxillary second molar was found missing, and its presence was confirmed high up in the right maxillary-zygomatic buttress area shown in the postoperative X-ray image taken on the next day following the surgery. A series of further postoperative radiographs confirmed its location, lying outside the right maxillary antrum. Due to the pronounced postoperative facial oedema at that time, no attempt was made to remove the appliance. The absence of sign and symptoms during further follow-up sessions confirmed the decision to leave it in-situ with continuous clinical observation.\nOn examination, there was no extraoral swelling noted. The mandible and maxilla seemed firm indicating good healing following previous mandibular saggital split and maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy sites and a stable class I dental occlusion.

The implantation was surgically revised in 2002 and 2006. In 2014 she noticed hardening and swelling of her right breast. Because of the death of her husband, she did not seek immediate medical attention. She continued to have swelling and increased pain in the right breast. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in January 2016 showed a large fluid collection surrounding the intact right silicone implant as shown in Figure . The case was managed by surgical drainage of fluid collection and capsulectomy. In February 2016, she underwent bilateral prosthesis explantation and bilateral capsulectomy. The pathology demonstrated a 4-cm moderately differentiated invasive SCC. It extended into the muscle, and in situ tumor was noted to extend to the peripheral margin. There was no perineural or lymphovascular invasion. Pathology of the left breast capsule showed chronic inflammation. Computed tomography (CT) of chest, abdomen and pelvis on February 2016 revealed absence of metastatic disease. The patient underwent re-excision of the remaining chest wall mass in March 2016. Pathology showed well differentiated SCC with negative margins. Chest wall fluid was negative for malignant cells. On slide review, it was noted that there was squamous epithelialization of the implant capsule with benign squamous epithelium on both sides. This indicated that the tumor is likely SCC of the implant capsule rather than primary SCC of the breast. Estrogen and progesterone receptor markers were negative as well. Afterwards, she received external beam radiation. She was treated with radiation while supine with free breathing. Four tangent beams were used to target the right breast with 50 Gray in 25 fractions, followed by a 10 Gray boost to the tumor bed delivered in five fractions. Radiation was delivered using opposed tangents completed in May 2016. No adjuvant chemotherapy was offered due to the rare histology and paucity of data. She followed up in clinic in June 2016 without complications or clinical recurrence.\nFollow-",

He required a tracheostomy at the time of his cancer diagnosis but was subsequently decannulated after therapy. His past medical was significant for coronary artery disease requiring stenting, hypertension and uncontrolled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. He developed right angle torsion and subluxation of trachea at the site of his tracheostomy site that was not amenable to endoscopic resection. He underwent cervicothoracic tracheal resection involving the cricoid and 3 tracheal rings, with primary anastomosis. On POD#3 he developed an anastomotic leak. He was taken to the operating room with the intent to place a tracheostomy through the dehiscent trachea but the anastomosis was noted to abut the innominate artery. Therefore, the tracheal dehiscence was primarily repaired and covered with sternohyoid muscle advancement and he was left intubated with the cuff past the anastomosis. A repeat bronchoscopy on POD#6 revealed intact anastomotic site but he failed extubation trial due to development of supraglottic edema from prolonged intubation and inability to clear secretions and a tracheostomy was performed. The tracheostomy incision was made vertically and encompassed the airway anastomotic site and a stomaplasty was performed to protect the innominate artery and to support the tracheal anastomosis. He subsequently underwent one endoscopic treatment 4 months after airway resection and was decannulated successfully. The patient continues to do well with mild grade 1 stenosis 5.5 years later.\nThere were two patients who could not be decannulated ().

    "original_text": "A 25-year-old gentleman presented to our clinic with a complaint of recurrent pain and swelling on his right cheek of three-month duration. He visited a general practitioner each time, and the condition was resolved with analgesic and antibiotics. However, his symptoms got worse and he attended our Oral Surgery Clinic for consultation.\nThe patient is a fit and healthy young man with no relevant medical history and no known history of allergy. Past surgical history revealed that he had underwent bimaxillary orthognathic surgery one and half year earlier in a local hospital. Although the postoperative period was uneventful, the surgical team informed him that there was a dislodged orthodontic appliance in his right cheek that must have occurred during the operation. The team explained to the patient that this accident was realized later on the next day after the surgery when the molar tube from the right maxillary second molar was found missing, and its presence was confirmed high up in the right maxillary-zygomatic buttress area shown in the postoperative X-ray image taken on the next day following the surgery.

A diagnosis of echinococcosis was made, based on the radiologic findings of multiple cerebral hydatid cysts and a sizable cyst of the heart (\n). The hydatid cyst of the heart was treated first with a thoracotomy, and after a month, he underwent three consecutive surgical operations for the removal of the six cerebral cysts. The patient was on albendazole treatment throughout his hospitalization, and this led to the shrinkage and finally to the disappearance of two other cerebral cysts.\nDuring the first surgical procedure, two frontal hydatid cysts were completely removed via a right frontal craniotomy and another cyst of the occipital lobe was removed via a separate right occipital craniotomy (\n). The patient initially had an uneventful postoperative recovery but 2 weeks later, while the second operation was being planned, he presented with generalized seizures (with loss of consciousness and urinary incontinence). Emergent cerebral CT scan revealed a marked expansion of the left occipital lobe cyst, cerebral edema, and midline shift (\n).

The patient was emergently operated on and a left occipital craniotomy was performed for the complete removal of the left occipital cyst.

A series of further postoperative radiographs confirmed its location, lying outside the right maxillary antrum. Due to the pronounced postoperative facial oedema at that time, no attempt was made to remove the appliance.

The couple had two children, a boy and a girl, but was desirous of having more. Despite seeking treatment for secondary infertility from different hospitals, she had not been able to achieve another conception since her last childbirth, seven years ago.

Incidentally, his in-take of alcohol had increased progressively in the past few years, alongside a downward slide in his career and earnings.

A fixed stony-hard tumor of about 100 mm in diameter was found on palpation, with slight tenderness on the right side of her abdomen. A full blood examination gave values within the normal limit. Abdominal CT showed a large mass with diffuse calcification of size about 130 \u00d7 110 mm in the right retroperitoneal space between the right kidney and the inferior vena cava, with slight hydronephrosis (). Lymph node swelling, ascites, liver tumor, and lung tumor were not detected by chest and abdominal CT, and the patient had no history of trauma or radiation therapy at the tumor site. However, the patient had undergone bilateral resection of tumors of the adrenal glands on the left side at the age of 46 years old and on the right side at at the age of 50 years old. Pathological findings revealed that both adrenal gland tumors were pheochromocytoma and no adjuvant therapy was administered. This led to a preoperative diagnosis of recurrent pheochromocytoma or retroperitoneal osteosarcoma or leiomyosarcoma. There were no carcinomas or sarcomas in her history or in her family history.\nComplete surgical resection of the primary tumor was performed. The tumor was situated behind the mesenterium of the ascending colon, compressing the right kidney, but no direct invasion of the surrounding organs was observed: there was no lymph node swelling, ascites or peritoneal dissemination, and the tumor was not present in the parenchyma of the liver and the kidney. The surgical margin was determined based on the rough connective tissue surrounding the tumor. Dissection of lymph nodes was not performed.\nGross examination revealed a rounded, bony, and hard tumor of size about 140 \u00d7 110 \u00d7 80 mm and weight 1100 g that was yellowish-white in color (). Histologically, the tumor consisted of a mixture of dense fibrous tissue, woven bone, and atypical cartilage. Some osteoclastic giant cells were observed.

Clinical examination revealed a large lump on the right lobe of the thyroid gland, which was approximately 5 \u00d7 4 cm in size. His previous medical history showed that he was admitted to the hospital in June 2007 due to painless hematuria and was diagnosed with right renal carcinoma. He then underwent radical resection of the right renal carcinoma. Postoperative pathological examination showed a moderately differentiated right ccRCC (stage III), and the patient did not receive further treatment after the operation. The re-examination of kidneys was done every year through ultrasound, which showed no abnormal echo in the right renal fossa. Ultrasound examination in July 2012 in our hospital showed the presence of multiple thyroid nodules, and the size of the largest nodule was about 1.2 \u00d7 0.6 cm, which was present in the right lobe with a clear boundary and homogenous echo. The patient refused the treatment because he was asymptomatic. Color ultrasound examination of thyroid in March 2015 revealed that the size of the largest nodule with clear boundary in the right lobe was about 2.5 \u00d7 1.3 cm, but the echo was heterogeneous, and small patchy fluid sonolucent area was found in the lesion. Color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) showed circular blood flow signals around the nodule and poor blood flow signals inside the nodule (Fig. ).

The diagnosis of ACL tear was confirmed using MRI. The patient underwent arthroscopic anatomic double-bundle reconstruction using hamstring tendons in a surgical procedure that was the same as that described in case 1.\nPostoperative CT revealed that the distance between the TR button and the exit of the tunnel on the lateral femoral cortex was 0 mm for the AM bundle and 0.5 mm for the PL bundle (). She undertook routine rehabilitation. At six months after the operation, she felt a slight lateral knee pain on the TR button of the PL bundle. However, she was able to carry out her routine rehabilitation schedule and return to playing judo. One year after the surgery, she could play judo and participate in competitions, but the lateral pain did not disappear and a slight swelling occurred on the lateral side of the knee. The lateral pain was not dependent on the knee flexion angle. She wanted to remove the TR buttons at the time of the second arthroscopy. TR buttons of both AM and PL bundles were removed; that of the PL bundle was just beneath the ITB. In addition, the adjustable loop in the TR of the PL bundle had partially worn out, and therefore was easily removed. A second arthroscopic evaluation of the graft indicated that the reconstructed ACL had good synovial coverage and rigid tensioning and the graft had been incorporated into the femoral bone tunnel. After removal of the TR button, graft tensioning and incorporation did not change and the lateral knee pain immediately disappeared. Therefore, we considered that the lateral pain was related to irritation between the TR",

Clinical examination revealed upper limb hypertension, with similar blood pressures in both arms (180/100 mm Hg). His past history included repair of coarctation of aorta about 30 years ago. The medical records and operative details from the previous operation were unavailable. The operation had been performed through a left thoracotomy. An MRI scan revealed a 2 cm long narrowing of the aorta just distal to the origin of an aberrant right subclavian artery, which was the last of four branches from the aortic arch (Fig. ). The origins of the arch vessels did not show any sign of narrowing. The aortic root and ascending aorta were 3.5 cm in diameter, and the arch was of normal calibre. The diameter in the region of the stenosis was 1.4 cm with an additional web-like stenotic lesion at the distal end of the stenotic segment. There was evidence of calcification, possibly of an interposition tube graft which had been used at the time of the first operation. The descending thoracic aorta was of normal calibre.\nIn view of his symptomatic status, a re-intervention was considered appropriate. In view of his previous surgery, and especially the fact that the area of re-coarctation appeared to be calcified, it was decided to approach the aorta via a median sternotomy and construct an extra-anatomic ascending to descending thoracic aorta bypass graft. Cardiopulmonary bypass would be necessary to lift the heart out of the way to gain access to the descending thoracic aorta just above the diaphragm. We planned to use an apical suction device to keep the empty beating heart elevated.\nThe sternotomy was completed uneventfully. The pericardial cavity was obliterated with dense adhesions. This was rather surprising since we had anticipated that the previous procedure would have been extra-pericardial. However, further dissection revealed a large hole in the pericardial sac with the left lung directly adherent to the heart. The adhesions were released, some",

    "original_text": "A 32-year-old healthy pregnant woman with more than 30 gestational weeks was admitted to the hospital due to the fetal cardiac mass. The fetal echocardiography showed a heterogeneous lesion of 2.85 cm \u00d7 2.25 cm on the right side of the heart, which compressed the tricuspid annulus by 50% with pericardial effusion []. It was difficult to distinguish the source of fetal cardiac mass either within the heart or in the pericardial cavity by fetal echocardiography. The fetus was at risk when the fetal heart rate decreased to less than 80 bpm and pericardial effusion continued to increase during the hospitalization. The EXIT procedure was performed to resect fetal cardiac tumor if it was located in the pericardial cavity or to ameliorate cardiac compression and bradycardia by pericardial effusion drainage.\nThe cesarean section was performed, and the uterine relaxation was attained with the inhalation of a high dose of sevoflurane (5\u201310%). The fetus was released from the uterus, and the placental circulation was kept intact. The fetal heart was exposed through the median sternotomy. The mass was located within the right atrium and hence could not be quickly removed without cardiopulmonary bypass. Therefore, about 30 ml of pericardial effusion was drained, and the skin was just sutured without closing the sternum to release the space for the cardiac mass. The tricuspid annulus compression was ameliorated as demonstrated by fetal echocardiography []. The fetus delivered weighed 2.2 kg and had a sinus rhythm of 130\u2013150 bpm. The cesarean section was completed with the administration of oxytocin and termination of sevoflurane inhalation after fetal delivery. The pregnant woman recovered uneventfully and was discharged on the 5th day postoperatively.\nThe neonate was intubated with mechanical respiratory support, and his heart function was still impaired by the cardiac mass compression. Dopamine was administered at a rate of 10 \u03bcg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121 to maintain the mean blood pressure ranging from 40 to 50 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa).

On intraoral examination, the swelling could be seen affecting the body and the angle of the mandible on the right side associated with her lower right third molar. Panoramic radiographic examination revealed a unilocular radiolucent lesion extending from the body of the mandible through to the angle and right ascending ramus, causing displacement of the second molar towards the base of the mandible and the third molar towards the ascending ramus (). A CT scan revealed that the lesion caused expansion of the buccal and lingual aspects of the cortical bone with areas of fenestration.

This gallbladder was normally situated in the fossa for the gallbladder. Upon opening, a prominent transverse partial septation in the body was found. This partial septum was located near the infundibulum (Hartmann's pouch) and this divided the gallbladder into a smaller chamber near the opening of the cystic duct and a larger chamber near the fundus (). There was a one centimeter opening between the two chambers allowing communication of fluid. No stones, mucus, or obstructive masses were found in the gallbladder or along its path of drainage into the duodenum. The diameter of the biliary duct system appeared enlarged; the cystic duct measured 12 mm (normal 2-3 mm), the hepatic duct 18 mm (normal 6 mm) and the common bile duct 21 mm (normal 7 mm), in the collapsed state [,]. The common bile duct, near its termination, measured 7 mm with a patent opening into the pancreaticobiliary antrum (). No anatomical explanation for the enlarged ductal system was found. It is possible that the patient passed a gallstone prior to death, causing a constriction at the pancreaticobiliary antrum and subsequent dilation of the biliary tree, but this is only conjecture. The gallbladder wall was of normal thickness and had no evidence of past inflammation in the form of adhesions or other structural changes. The liver appeared grossly normal. The authors hypothesize this septal abnormality was congenital and during life may have caused symptoms of biliary colic due to the septum intermittently obstructing the cystic duct during contraction of the gallbladder; this may have resulted in incomplete emptying of the gallbladder and subsequent enlargement.\nIn addition to the enlarged gallbladder, an aberrant right hepatic artery and an accessory left hepatic artery were found. The left hepatic artery was normally located but there was also an accessory left hepatic artery originating from the left gastric artery.",

He sought medical attention for the skin lesion at that time and was diagnosed with keloid, which was readily accepted as he had past medical history and similar family history. No treatment for the lesion was performed at that time. Since then, the lesion had been stable without any change in shape, color, or size until 1.5 years prior to evaluation, when he suffered a minor trauma to the lesion during a work-related injury that did not break the skin barrier. Following this event, he noticed that the lesion slowly increased in size under the skin without apparent cutaneous changes in appearance. Two months before the clinical encounter, he noticed a new rapidly growing nodule on the surface of the initial mass.

His oncology history began in July 2007 in another cancer center, after the surgical removal of an expansive lesion on his left hand achieving a complete negative margin (R0) resection. Histological findings of the lesion highlighted a monophasic synovial sarcoma. He was administered adjuvant local radiotherapy and was then followed up. In June 2008, a computed tomography (CT) scan detected local recurrence of the disease and appearance of new nodules in the middle and apical right pulmonary lobe; therefore, the patient underwent another surgery of the hand and local excision of the lung tumor, which was confirmed by the previous histological diagnosis. Taking into account the dissemination of the disease, in August 2008, he was treated with systemic chemotherapy including 4 cycles of epirubicin in combination with ifosfamide. After about 1 year, in May 2009, progression of the disease into the right lung was recorded; therefore, the patient underwent another 3 wedge resections (anterior segment of the lower and upper right lobe), which is a diagnostic for metastasis of synovial sarcoma. He was followed up with only clinical and instrumental controls (CT scan and laboratory tests). After several years, in June 2012, a contralateral progression of the pulmonary disease was detected (1 lesion in the lower left lobe) and CT scan showed pathological mediastinal lymph nodes. A wedge resection of the dorsal segment of the lower lobe was performed, histologically compatible with metastases, and 2 hilar and lobar lymph nodes, which had become inflammatory, were removed. According to the patient, he continued to be followed up until December 2015 when he was submitted once again to a wedge resection of the middle lobe for sarcoma metastases. After 10 months, the patient reported intermittent episodes of hemoptysis in the absence of other symptoms; the CT scan showed significant thoracic disease progression associated with pulmonary artery compression.

Although enlarged abdominal lymph nodes did not disappear completely, further extensive therapy was not performed, and active surveillance was followed for these lymph nodes in consideration of his age and renal function since September 2015. He had no history of malignancy other than ureteral cancer, no breast disease, and no family history of carcinoma. A mass just below the nipple of his right breast was acknowledged in February 2016, and he visited our department in March. On primary clinical examination, a hard 3-cm mass with good mobility was palpated just below the right nipple. Breast ultrasonography (US) revealed an irregular, rough, internally inhomogeneous hypoechoic mass measuring 32 \u00d7 35 mm in the center of the right breast right beneath the nipple (Fig. ). A tissue needle biopsy was performed, and histological diagnosis was invasive carcinoma, which showed negative results for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. The mass was 1 cm larger in 1 month. Although the intraductal lesion around the carcinoma was not clear and the tissue similarity to that of the previous ureteral cancer was considered, few findings actively suggested breast metastasis of ureteral cancer, and it was initially diagnosed as a primary breast cancer. The abdominal US showed no liver metastases. Chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed no axillary lymph node enlargement and no distant metastasis, other than the already defined para-aortic lymph nodes enlargement observed in previous CT (Fig. ).

This was confirmed by vaginal ultrasound scanning. The patient was put off uterine artery embolization due to the small risk of ovarian failure and risk of bleeding and infection which could lead to a hysterectomy. Hence, she was advised to consider starting to try and conceive sooner rather than later. Eight weeks later she got pregnant. She had a scan at 7 weeks which confirmed viable intrauterine pregnancy.

Subsequently, the erythema area gradually expanded without exudation and was occasionally itchy. At the same time, mild edema developed in both eyes and the erythema further spread to the head. During this period (> 2 months), the patient went to several local hospitals and received treatment such as external medication, but without any improvement in his symptoms. The erythema further spread to the left side of his face.\nA medical examination was conducted and revealed no abnormalities. Dermatological examination showed clear dark red or purplish red infiltrating patches on the head. They did not completely fade after pressing, with visible exudation and scabs on the surface. The surface of the infiltrating erythema of the left face showed densely distributed vesicles with a little exudation. Mild edema was observed around both eyes, as shown in .\nA head CT scan was performed on May 28th 2019 at the People\u2019s Hospital of Yunyang County. The scan revealed atrophy and a widened bilateral frontal subdural space. Liver, kidney and blood coagulation functions were all normal (). A chest CT performed on June 5th 2019 showed that a few fiber proliferation foci were scattered in the right lung and the patient had a gallstone and also aortic sclerosis. The bilateral pleura were thickened and adhered. Cysts may have been present in the left lobe of the liver and in the right kidney (). Therefore, we made further examinations in the dermatology department of Chongqing Southwest Hospital on July 8, 2019. Samples from the left temporal lobe were obtained and clinically diagnosed.

It is important to avoid hypovolemia in these patients because it can lead to subsequent unexpected complications, such as hypotension and renal failure.

A tumor was suspected based on the chest X-ray and therefore a chest CT scan was done that revealed a large mass with differential diagnosis of primary sternal tumor in origin or anterior mediastinal tumor with invasion to sternum (Figures and ).\nA core needle biopsy was performed with pathologic diagnosis compatible with giant cell tumor. An incisional biopsy was done based on pathologist's recommendation which revealed a highly vascular mass with final pathologic diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cyst.\nThe best treatment option was deemed to be resection of lesion and due to the size of tumor, total sternectomy was planned.\nAt the time of surgery a longitudinally elliptical midline incision was performed which included previous biopsy site. There was no infiltration or adhesion of mass to skin and subcutaneous tissue and a well-defined, capsulated but highly vascular mass was dissected from surrounding tissues. Due to large dimension of tumor, pectoralis major muscles were pushed laterally to nearly mid clavicular lines (Figures and ). Thoracic cavity was entered with some difficulty in hemostasis on the left side and all attachments of sternum and ribs were cut 2 centimeters away from tumor. The same steps were repeated on the right side. There was minimal adhesion of tumor to right upper lobe that was lysed easily but dense adhesion to anterior part of pericardium was managed by partial resection of pericardium and repairing the pericardium with PTFE mesh. Due to involvement of manubrium, total sternectomy was achieved by disarticulation of bilateral sternoclavicular joints. Large 20 \u00d7 20 cm mass was completely resected and an extensive defect remained in the chest wall (Figures and ). According to previous planning a cryopreserved sternal allograft was considered to repair the defect. Sternal graft was harvested from suitable cadaver in our center and cryopreserved in another tissue bank about one month prior to operation",

The patient had previously been diagnosed with heart failure and severe aortic insufficiency via transesophageal echocardiography. The patient subsequently planned to undergo reconstruction of the ascending aorta and replacement of the aortic valve.\nOn the day of surgery, the patient was in his usual state of health with no signs of infection. The patient had no musculoskeletal symptoms and had never had shoulder complaints or undergone shoulder surgery. In the operating room, the patient was placed under general anesthesia using propofol as an induction agent and remained supine in a Skytron surgical table for the entirety of the surgery lasting three hours and 36 minutes. The surgery included reconstruction of the ascending aorta and the proximal arch with graft and prosthetic aortic valve replacement, followed by sternal closure with wires and a plate. There were no intraoperative complications and the patient\u2019s mean arterial pressure was maintained at 70 mmHg throughout the surgery. The patient did not suffer any spikes in temperature or have any episodes of increased muscle rigidity.\nTwo days following surgery, the patient complained of bilateral shoulder pain and was unable to raise his arms above his head due to weakness and pain. He denied ever having experienced similar symptoms before. The patient had been restricted to bed rest and was continuously monitored via telemetry on the cardiac floor postoperatively. Upon orthopedic consultation, the patient was afebrile, normotensive, and in no acute distress. The patient\u2019s chest, back, shoulders, and upper extremities displayed no bruising or break in the skin and were soft to palpation.

    "original_text": "A girl aged seven years and eight months was referred to our observation because of left peripheral facial palsy, causing the inability to close the left eye and dropping of the corner of the mouth. A first peripheral facial nerve palsy occurred when she was three years and one month old, with complete regression after corticosteroid treatment. At the age of three years and nine months, she was diagnosed with pure red cell hypoplasia, manifested as severe anaemia (haemoglobin: 3.00 g/dL; red blood cells: 1,000,000/mm3) with an extreme lack of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, but high growth of them in culture, probably caused by anti-EPO antibodies. The detection of anti-EPO antibodies, however, is not routinely performed in a clinical setting. The autoimmune hypothesis was postulated on empirical bases, since haemoglobin levels did not increase after recombinant human EPO administration, but normalized after corticosteroid therapy, and the addition of autologous serum to the erythroid precursor culture inhibited EPO growth. When she was 4 years and 4 months old, the patient presented with a second episode of left facial palsy, combined with the acute onset of a strength deficit on the left side of the body. Mingazzini I and II were positive for the left limbs. The imaging assessment showed a haemorrhagic stroke corresponding to the anterior portion of the right putamen and of the external capsule with perilesional oedema, involving the anterior limb of the internal capsule. Blood pressure measurements performed during the hospitalisation revealed high diastolic blood pressure values. These findings suggest a central rather than peripheral involvement of the facial nerve. Three weeks after their beginning, the symptoms had completely regressed. At the age of five years and six months, a third episode of left peripheral facial palsy occurred.

    "cleaned_text": "a girl aged seven years and eight months was referred to our observation because of left peripheral facial palsy, causing the inability to close the left eye and dropping of the corner of the mouth. a first peripheral facial nerve palsy occurred when she was three years and one month old, with complete regression after corticosteroid treatment. at the age of three years and nine months, she was diagnosed with pure red cell hypoplasia, manifested as severe anaemia (haemoglobin: 3.00 g/dl; red blood cells: 1,000,000/mm3) with an extreme lack of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, but high growth of them in culture, probably caused by anti-epo antibodies. the detection of anti-epo antibodies, however, is not routinely performed in a clinical setting. the autoimmune hypothesis was postulated on empirical bases, since haemoglobin levels did not increase after recombinant human epo administration, but normalized after corticosteroid therapy, and the addition of autologous serum to the erythroid precursor culture inhibited epo growth. when she was 4 years and 4 months old, the patient presented with a second episode of left facial palsy, combined with the acute onset of a strength deficit on the left side of the body. mingazzini i and ii were positive for the left limbs. the imaging assessment showed a haemorrhagic stroke corresponding to the anterior portion of the right putamen and of the external capsule with perilesional oedema, involving the anterior limb of the internal capsule. blood pressure measurements performed during the hospitalisation revealed high diastolic blood pressure values. these findings suggest a central rather than peripheral involvement of the facial nerve. three weeks after their beginning, the symptoms had completely regressed. at the age of five years and six months, a third episode of left peripheral facial palsy occurred. brain magnetic resonance imaging (mri) was repeated, showing gliotic evolution of the previous haemorrhagic insult without new lesions. the patient was treated with corticosteroids, with a good regression of symptoms. on the last episode, the patient had initially visited a first level emergency room",

The resection had an extension of 0.7 \u00d7 0.3 cm2, affecting the central margin of the lower eyelid and was treated with direct closure. The hystopathology report of the resection informed solid (nodular) type of basal cell carcinoma characterized by islands of cells with peripheral palisading and disorganized central cells. The margins of resection and the deepest layers were affected.\nAfter the hystopathology report, we decided to plan a more aggressive treatment around the scar of the previous resection. The scar was not well defined (Fig A), so we thought the best approach would be a total resection of the lower eyelid with a full-thickness resection around the scar that would imply a measurement greater than 75% of the full lower eyelid extension.\nWe had a case with 3 limitations for applying the advancement tarsoconjunctival flap: the old age of the patient, the elevated vision loss in the contralateral eye, and the high size of the resection. The patient was advanced in years with a severe vision loss in the contralateral eye, so the occlusion of the right eye and the risk of a second step operation would not be the best options. The defect would be too big for applying this technique.

Physical examination revealed feeble femoral pulses and he was found to be hypertensive with marked differences between the upper and lower limbs (systolic blood pressure upper limb 190mmmHg, lower limb 75 mmHg, with an ankle brachial index (ABI) of 0.39). Electrocardiogram revealed evidence of severe left ventricular hypertrophy. This was confirmed with echocardiography which also demonstrated a tricuspid aortic valve with significant aortic regurgitation in the presence of an aortic root aneurysm of approximately 9 cm. Left ventricular function was preserved. Computerised tomography angiography (CTA) was performed to evaluate the aortic pathology in further detail (Fig. ). The scan noted an aortic root aneurysm (8.8 cm), in addition to the presence of severe aortic coarctation, with subtotal occlusion and a lumen less than 6 mm in size. The coarctation was just distal to the left subclavian artery, at the aortic isthmus. There was clear evidence of collateral circulation to the descending thoracic aorta via the subclavian and intercostal arteries. Coronary angiography confirmed a right dominant coronary system with no significant coronary disease.\nA multidisciplinary team meeting took place and a consensus was agreed to proceed with a two staged hybrid approach, with the first phase involving an endovascular approach to stent the coarctation, followed by a second stage to perform the surgical repair of the aortic root aneurysm. The first stage to stent the coarctation was unsuccessful via the femoral approach, as the guidewire could not cross the coarctation. Assessment through angiography via the left brachial artery showed complete obstruction at the aortic isthmus. The decision was then made to proceed to a single stage surgical approach to treat both lesions.\nAfter induction of anaesthesia, arterial lines were placed in the left radial and left femoral artery.

Her past medical history was significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation needing oral Coumadin. On examination in the emergency room, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits, and the only history provided was the patient had not passed urine for a day by the patient's care provider.

A routine set of blood work at the time was remarkable for anemia with a hemoglobin of 6 g/dL and an elevated INR to 4.5. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and the pelvis at the time of admission with intravenous contrast revealed a large grade 3 RSH extending into the pelvis and causing compressive symptoms over the bladder outlet (Figures , ). There was no evidence of contrast extravasation in the hematoma. The patient was immediately transfused packed red blood cells to maintain a hemoglobin of more than 8 g/dL. Coumadin was held and INR reversed with the help of fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K. The patient had a Foley catheter placed to relieve bladder outlet obstruction. Over the subsequent day, the patient continued to have stable hemoglobin and make urine. In view of the patient\u2019s poor performance index and high risk for surgery, a 14 French catheter was placed in the hematoma.

The initial cervical exam was 2 cm dilation and 50% effacement. Her labor was induced with oxytocin and amniotomy was performed at 5 cm dilation with clear fluid noted. She progressed from 2 cm to 5 cm over the course of 10 hours; interval time to progression to 6 cm was 3.5 hours. The patient then began to have a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding with associated minimal fetal heart rate variability and variable decelerations that did not improve with intrauterine resuscitation. She was taken to the operating room for repeat cesarean delivery due to concern for a uterine rupture and/or a placental abruption. Upon entry into the abdomen, there was no uterine rupture or dehiscence, nor was there evidence of a significant placental abruption. She delivered a male infant with a weight of 2659 g and Apgar scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively; arterial cord pH was 7.26. No extension of the hysterotomy was noted following delivery of the infant. Following repair of the hysterotomy, the bladder was noted to be distended and edematous, despite the presence of a patent Foley catheter. This finding prompted a vaginal exam to assist in evaluating the integrity of the lower uterine segment behind the bladder due to concern for an occult uterine rupture or dehiscence. The vaginal exam revealed a spontaneous detachment of the anterior rim of the cervix from approximately 9 to 3 o'clock.

    "original_text": "This paper reports a case of a 16-year-old Caucasian boy with a unilateral cleft lip and palate seen in the Maxillofacial Department at Great Ormond Street Hospital (London) for closure of his wide alveolar cleft. He had undergone repair of his cleft lip and of his cleft palate at the age of 6 and 14 months respectively and his medical history was unremarkable and he was born following full term pregnancy and a normal delivery.\nAt the age of 8 year deciduous teeth were extracted under a short general anesthetic. Both right and left maxillary canines were present in the arch as he had extensive orthodontic treatment in the past to allow eruption. Radiographs showed absence of the maxillary right central and lateral incisors, which had been extracted due to increased mobility (grade III) following infection.\nThe maxilla was composed of a lesser (right) and a larger (left) segment with a wide maxillary cleft [Figure and ]. As the right canine was not fully erupted, a total space of 15 mm was measured from mesial surface of the upper right first premolar to mesial of upper left central incisor. The former segment had undergone orthodontic expansion in 2005 in order to move to a more buccal position. An oro-nasal fistula was present.\nA secondary alveolar bone grafting procedure was initially declined due to the cleft size and a decision was taken for pre-grafting orthodontics and a segmental distraction approach in order to mobilize the lesser maxillary segment anteriorly to minimize the gap. One year of orthodontic treatment did achieve alignment of the maxillary teeth [Figure and ] and most importantly a 3 mm initial space between the 1st molar and the 2nd premolar in order to minimize risk of dental root injury during the surgery.\nUnder general anesthesia the right maxillary alveolar bony segment was exposed by a high maxillary sulcus incision, while the attached gingiva covering the crest of the ridge from the maxillary right 1st molar up to the right canine were not reflected",
