After completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the patient underwent a right skin-sparing mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy and targeted axillary lymph node dissection, and immediate stage I breast reconstruction with tissue expander placement. Intraoperatively, 1 of 3 axillary lymph nodes was positive for malignancy on frozen section and a level I and II right axillary lymph node dissection was completed. Multiple bulky and soft nodes were found in the axilla. The wound was irrigated, and no bleeding or lymphatic leakage was noted. The remainder of the operation was completed without complications. One drain was placed in the right axillary dissection region, and two additional drains were placed at the right breast following the tissue expander placement.\nOn the first postoperative day, all three drains were found to have serosanguinous drainage at 12 hours postoperatively. At approximately 18 hours postoperatively, the patient was noted to have 100 CC of milky fluid in the right axillary drain. The differential diagnosis for the milky drainage included lymphatic obstruction due to the bulky lymph nodes found at the time of dissection and a right-sided chyle leak. Triglyceride level was sent on the drainage and returned elevated at 1,425 mg/dl. Drain fluid triglyceride levels > 100 mg/dl confirm the diagnosis of chyle leak []. The patient was managed in a conservative fashion with pressure dressings to the right axilla. She was instructed to follow a low-fat diet and discharged home on postoperative day 2.\nThe patient followed up in clinic on postoperative day 12. She reported that axillary drain fluid turned serous and decreased in output, approximately 50 cc/day.

The patient came to the institute for workup of cadaveric renal transplantation before 2 months. His right radial artery was punctured for ABG analysis in ward as a routine workup for sending a patient to dialysis. Special BD 2cc (heparinized) ABG syringe with 23-gauge needle was used for puncture of radial artery. Only one puncture was attempted for collecting the sample. First year resident of Anesthesia Department with experience of about 6 months punctured the radial artery. Compression of about 5 min with bandage was given over the punctured site. After 2 days of procedure, he noticed pulsatile swelling near his right wrist joint over volar aspect without overlying erythema []. The patient denied fever or chill. Allen's test was negative. His hand movement was not restricted. Thrill was palpable over the swelling. Lesion was not painful; hence, the patient was referred to our Radiodiagnosis Department for Doppler ultrasound of his right wrist joint swelling. As the patient had not fever and tenderness over local site, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus test was not done. On ultrasonography, swelling appeared to be cystic in nature measuring about 14 mm \u00d7 9 mm in size, communicating with the right radial artery at wrist joint. On color Doppler imaging, it had typical swirling pattern of flow []. Spectral Doppler imaging revealed a classic to and fro waveform confirmed the diagnosis of PA []. There was no evidence of thrombosis within PA, in radial artery or arteries of the right upper limb. Due to smaller size and asymptomatic nature of PA, the patient was not offered any treatment and close follow-up is advised.

    "original_text": "A 72 year old male Caucasian patient was referred to our unit with a metastatic bony deposit involving his left proximal femur from a known primary prostatic carcinoma. Commonly, prostatic metastases are sclerotic in nature. However detailed radiological evaluation demonstrated a large lytic lesion in this case (Figure ). Due to the high risk of an impending pathological fracture, the decision was taken to perform prophylactic intramedullary nailing of the left femur (Figure ). In order to reduce the increased intramedullary pressure during nail insertion, venting of the distal end of the femur was performed (Figure ).\nThe patient did not have any other significant past medical history and he was not known to be allergic to any medication. He had surgical procedures for other conditions in the past requiring general anaesthesia and had an uneventful recovery in every case.\nDuring the procedure, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest. Fat embolism was initially thought to be the cause of this event due to the increased intramedullary pressure during reaming and nail insertion. Following successful resuscitation, a marked generalized erythematous rash was noticed which lasted for about thirty minutes. This raised the concern of a possible hypersensitivity reaction to one of the anaesthetic agents.

Telemetry revealed atrial flutter with atrioventricular conduction that slowed markedly to ventricular rates as low as 34 beats per minute. A balloon-tipped temporary pacing catheter was floated in via left internal jugular vein until adequate ventricular capture was observed. Fluoroscopy was not used during insertion. A follow-up chest X-ray confirmed appropriate placement of the lead, which revealed the lead in the right ventricle with redundant lead slack forming a loop ().\nThe patient subsequently had a PPM implanted. The PPM was implanted without complication using a standard left cephalic vein access. The lead was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance. Implantation of the PPM lead was carried out without difficulty with active fixation to the right ventricular septal wall. The lead pin was attached to a pacemaker pulse generator which was then placed in a pocket located in the prepectoral plane below the left subclavicular fossa.\nThe TVP was then removed under fluoroscopic guidance. The large loop of redundant wire was noted, but it exited the cardiac silhouette without any resistance or interaction with the newly implanted PPM lead. However, significant resistance was noted when attempting to pull the tip of the TVP lead out through the introducer sheath. This resistance was only encountered when the TVP lead tip was at the level of the skin; fluoroscopy was not performed at this stage to determine the cause of resistance. The resistance was overcome and the TVP lead was successfully removed.

The patient sustained an electrical shock to the right hand while repairing a domestic electrical appliance. He denied any cutaneous injury, loss of consciousness or injury to any other body part due to the electrical shock. He noticed pain in his right hand within one week of injury, which was treated with analgesics without relief. He noticed a subsequent swelling, deep aching pain, cutaneous hypersensitivity and discoloration of the right hand. The patient denied aggravation of symptoms during exposure to cold or any diurnal variation of the symptoms. The patient indicated severe pain, which he rated as 9 on a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS). He was treated with a short course of oral prednisolone with physiotherapy at a peripheral hospital, but the improvement was not significant. The patient is employed as an infantry soldier, and the condition prevented him from being able to handle any weapons. He was also unable to use his right hand for activities of daily living. The patient denied alcohol consumption or tobacco use, and his previous medical history was unremarkable. Examination revealed stable vital parameters, and systemic examination was unremarkable. His right hand was markedly tender, hyperemic with diffuse swelling and cutaneous hypersensitivity (Figure ). Other vasomotor changes were absent, and the radial pulse was normally palpable on the right side. Muscle atrophy was not apparent, and there was generalized weakness of the hand muscles, likely because of the reduced effort by the patient.\nHis hematological and biochemical parameters were all normal, including the C-reactive protein, creatine kinase, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels.

The swelling was painless, slow growing and had acquired the present size in approximately 20 years. There was no history of treatment in the past. Patient was completely asymptomatic, except for ulceration of the overlying skin. On palpation, the swelling was smooth, painless and non-tender. Skin over the swelling was stretched, shiny and showed ulceration over the lower most part. There was no lymphadenopathy or any other palpable mass.\nENT examination of the patient was normal. Thyroid hormonal evaluation showed no abnormality. On ultrasound, the \u201cmass\u201d was iso-echoic with subcutaneous fat. It laid in front of the left lobe of the thyroid which was normal in size and echogenicity and moved freely with swallowing under the mass.

Motor and sensory functions and circulation of the lower extremity were normal without any neurological symptoms.

    "original_text": "A 47-year-old female patient with history of osteoporosis presented with severe low back pain refractory to conservative analgesic therapy. Her past surgical and family history was otherwise non-contributory, and physical examination revealed lumbar pain with palpation and paraspinal tenderness from L2 to L4. A lumbar radiograph revealed a vertebral fracture and degenerative disc disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a compression fracture of the L2 vertebral body with 40% height loss.\nThe patient subsequently underwent elective percutaneous vertebroplasty for vertebral body augmentation and stabilization of the compression fracture. The procedure was performed under conscious sedation and local anesthesia by a bipedicular approach with fluoroscopic guidance. Opacified PMMA cement (6 mL) was slowly injected into the L2 vertebral body until good filling in a symmetrical fashion was observed. The bones of this osteoporotic vertebra were very soft, and the needle was readily guided into the vertebral body. The patient was discharged from the radiology suite in excellent condition, and her postoperative course was uneventful.\nFour years later, the patient developed a respiratory infection, and chest radiographs revealed an incidental finding of multiple dense linear and branching opacities bilaterally (). Non-contrast chest computed tomography (CT) confirmed the presence of tubular high-attenuation material within the right lower lobe pulmonary artery and its branch vessels as well as a small linear high attenuation focus within the anterobasilar aspect of the left lower lobe (). There was also high attenuation material filling a portion of the left lumbar vein adjacent to the second lumbar vertebra extending up to its junction with the inferior vena cava.\nBased on the clinical course, the history of vertebroplasty, and the imaging characteristics, the diagnosis was pulmonary cement emboli following venous cement extravasation.

He exhibited marked jugular venous distension, ascites, and edema on examination. Historically, he had undergone complete surgical repair at age 11, a right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction and pulmonary valve replacement at age 47, and a percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement at age 59. In the months prior to admission, the patient exhibited worsening signs and symptoms of volume overload requiring escalating diuretic doses. Prior to admission, a cardiac MRI demonstrated marked biatrial enlargement, right ventricular dilation and dysfunction, and moderate pulmonary and tricuspid regurgitation (Supplemental ). An echocardiogram on admission demonstrated right ventricular dilation with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 54 mmHg, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and mild pulmonary conduit stenosis. Electrocardiogram at the time of admission demonstrated sinus rhythm with a stable right bundle branch block ().\nThe patient was admitted for treatment of presumed decompensated right heart failure. MAP was 64 mmHg, and CVP was markedly elevated at 27 mmHg.

She is a housewife with no history of routine drug use and no prior history of hypertension, diabetes, allergies, or other chronic disease. She does not smoke tobacco and does not consume alcohol.\nA physical examination revealed that her general condition was good and her vital signs were: blood pressure 112/74 mmHg, heart rate 89 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 times per minute, and temperature 36.6 \u00b0C. There were no abnormalities in her chest and abdomen, or in musculoskeletal and neurological examinations. In a genitalia examination using a speculum, we identified fistulae above her vagina wall that were 1 cm in size. All laboratory findings (that is, complete blood count, liver functions, renal functions, and urine analysis) were within normal limits.\nAfter discussion with our patient regarding the risks and benefits of an open abdominal procedure and laparoscopic approach, we discussed the similarities and differences between the two procedures were her. We chose surgical management using laparoscopic approach with the considerations that it could facilitate precise dissection, offer good visualization, and be minimally invasive, thereby enabling faster recovery.\nOur patient was placed in the lithotomy position and received general anesthesia. A cystoscopy was performed to confirm the fistulae orifice and a stent was inserted into the fistulae tract from her bladder to her vagina. A tamponade was inserted into her vagina up to the vaginal apex, to be able to identify the vagina and prevent loss of pneumoperitoneum.

Hypoplastic VA was defined as a lumen diameter less than 2 mm in an anatomical study () or as with diameter less than 50% of the contralateral side in radiological study ().\nIn this case, each VA originated from the subclavian artery with an external diameter of left 4.6 mm and right 5.0 mm; and entered to the foramen transversarium with a diameter of left 3.3 mm and right 5.0 mm (). The extracranial parts of both VAs did not show macroscopic anomaly, but intracranial part of the left VA had hypoplasia with a total length of 21 mm (). The external diameters of the intracranial parts of VAs were found to be 3.7 mm on the right side and 1.0 mm on the left side. The vertebrobasilar junction was found to be at the level of bulbopontine sulcus. The posterior inferior cerebellar artery bilaterally arose from the basilar artery 2.5 mm from the vertebrobasilar junction. The other brain vessels had no anomalies in their course or in the origin of their branches on either side.\nHistopathologically, FMD is heterogeneous with various degrees of collagen hyperplasia, internal elastic lamina rupture, and disorganization of the tunica media (, ). For histopathological classification of FMD, tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (), Orcein for elastic fiber (), and immunohistochemistry with anti smooth muscle actin antibody for tunica media () and anti-CD31 antibody for endothelium (). Compared to the right VA (), both extracranial and intracranial left VA pathologically diagnosed as an intimal type of FMD.

It showed a mass-like lesion at the right L5\u2013S1 foramen and a diagnosis of hernia or tumour was considered. Over a 1-month period, the patient was managed clinically with analgesics with partial resolution of symptoms.\nThe patient then presented to the emergency department of our hospital owing to her persistent symptoms and an MRI of the lumbar spine (T1 and T2 weighted sequences) was obtained (). At this point, no contrast injection was performed as it is not included in the low back pain/radiculopathy investigation protocol in the emergency department. It showed the previously described lesion at the right L5\u2013S1 foramen, as well as other ipsilateral lesions in the posterior paraspinal muscles and the anterior epidural space. Most of the lesions had a mass-like appearance and low signal intensity in all MR sequences. Interestingly, one lesion in the posterior paravertebral muscle showed mixed signal intensity on T2 weighted sequence, defining a fluid\u2013fluid level. All the lesions were unchanged compared with the outside scan. The radiology team suspected that the lesions were calcified and suggested a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the lumbar spine ( and ) to confirm their initial suspicion and rule out possible soft tissue components associated with the lesions. The CT scan confirmed the calcified nature of the lesions and also showed no contrast enhancement. It also contributed to an additional finding of interstitial lung disease, as seen in a few images at the base of the lungs in the thoracolumbar region. A CT scan of the chest was suggested () and showed signs of pulmonary fibrosis and oesophageal dilatation.

He was born at full term by normal vaginal delivery and had no significance in his past medical history. There was no family history of congenital defects or consanguinity. The anomaly was located in the ventral midline of his neck (Fig. ). The superior aspect was composed of a skin tag leading to a short mucosa-like raw surface. Inferiorly, there was a sinus present with a greenish, thick residue occluding the opening. There was no contracture of the neck. He did not appear to be troubled by the lesion and a full examination was otherwise normal, except for adenoidal hypertrophy.\nHe had an MRI done elsewhere, indicating a soft tissue mass without any fistula tract. Despite contrast material being injected through the opening at the caudal end of the lesion, the diagnosis of MCC was established. No evidence of any other neck anomaly was found (Fig. ). The sinus, less than 1 cm in length, was found to extend caudally to the suprasternal notch. There were no attachments to underlying structures.\nA surgical removal and immediate closure with multiple Z-plasties were performed. Surgical removal was done with an incision 1\u20132 mm from the periphery of the lesion, deepened down to the supraplatysmal plane (Fig. ). During the surgery, the sinus at the caudal end of the lesion was probed and followed caudally until it ended, which was found to be approximately 2 cm long. This underdeveloped fistula tract ended right above the thymus gland. The cranial end of the defect had a fibrous band extending up to the mandible and this band was resected together with the cervical lesion.

The patient then underwent removal of hardware, repeat fixation with 90/90 plating and iliac crest bone graft (ICBG).

The fracture site at the medial column was debrided and cancellous graft was placed without removing the plate. After harvest of the MFCF as described above, the graft was placed in the medial column crossing the fracture site and secured with two 2.0 mm cortical screws after elevating the periosteum about 5 mm at both ends of the graft.

    "original_text": "We present the anaesthetic management of a 34-year-old gravida III, para 1 woman who was 34 weeks pregnant and who presented to a University Hospital setting for caesarean delivery. She was recently diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and atrial septal defect (ASD). Her foetus was also diagnosed on a prenatal ultrasound as having an ASD. She was also suffering from gestational diabetes. Her clinical history included dyspnoea at rest and orthopnoea requiring two pillows whilst sleeping. She had a severely restricted functional capacity. She had a previous uneventful caesarean section 4 years prior as well as a miscarriage in the first trimester 3 years prior. She admitted that her symptoms were much worse in this pregnancy. Her physical examination revealed a pansystolic murmur in the left apex. An echocardiogram revealed a moderate sized ASD with severe PAH, moderate pulmonary and tricuspid regurgitation and enlarged right heart. A cardiology consultation recommended placing her on oral furosemide, aspirin and potassium supplements.\nAfter counselling the patient and her family pre-operatively in consultation with the obstetrician, the patient was advised regional anaesthesia for the delivery. On the day of the caesarean delivery, after routine monitors were placed in the operating room, a radial arterial line was placed for beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring.

He had no history of head trauma, injury to the spine or dura puncture. The headache was postural in nature because the headache occurred when he stood up or sat, and it subsided when he lay down. The character of the headache was a dull, continuous pain in the occipital area with some radiating pain to the parietal and frontal areas. Visual analog scale (VAS) score was 8-9 points and dizziness was accompanied when standing or sitting. However, when he lay down, the VAS score decreased to 1-2 points. Physical and neurological examinations were performed on the day of admission and no abnormal findings were observed. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed no abnormal findings and laboratory data on the patient were also within normal limits. Radionuclide cisternography was checked and it showed possible cerebrospinal fluid leakage at the cervicothoracic junction level () and the patient was diagnosed with spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Conservative management was administered including hydration, bed rest, and NSAIDs. Yet, the symptom persisted and the patient was referred to the pain clinic for an epidural blood patch. The patient was 175.2 cm high and his body weight was 77 kg. His occupation was aquaculture, breeding abalone. The patient was not obese, but he had a relatively well-developed musculature. Upon entering the operation room, the patient was placed in the prone position on the C-arm table. Both arms of the patient were placed over his head. The lower cervical area and the upper thoracic area were prepared and the skin was anesthetized with a local anesthetic agent.

At admission, blood pressure was high at 190/130 mmHg. Heart rate was normal at 78 bpm. The clinical examination was unremarkable. There was no evidence of aortic dissection and the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for blood pressure stabilization.\nPrior to admission, the patient was seen for the first time by cardiologist because she suffered from symptomatic hypertension with headaches, scotoma, tinnitus, epistaxis, paresthesia in the upper limbs, and dizziness lasting for 4 months. The episodes occurred several times per month but were more frequent of late and tended to happen every 2 days, lasting from a few minutes to an hour. The patient felt well between those episodes except for fatigue. She had been taking a combined antihypertensive drug (angiotensin-conversion enzyme inhibitor with diuretics) for 3 days prescribed by her general practitioner.\nDiagnosis of hypertension was established by her GP, confirmed by blood pressure self-measurement, which showed systolic pressure up to 180 mmHg and diastolic pressure up to 80 mmHg. The patient also had palpitations and tachycardia up to 147 per minute.\nThe patient had no major medical history, although she had depression when her first husband died from a car accident 20 years ago, leaving her in charge of a small child. She has now remarried and had 2 other children. She explained that her son from her first husband had psychological issues and drinking addiction; when drunk, he could be verbally and physically violent towards her.

CT showed an acute burst fracture at the T12 vertebral body with an osteolytic mass-like lesion within the vertebral body and pedicle, causing severe encroachment of the spinal canal (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a bulging posterior cortex, with an acute fracture of the vertebral body and severe compression of the spinal cord (Fig. ). Considering his medical history and the MRI findings, a pathologic fracture with a tumorous condition was suspected. Therefore, the evaluation of the malignant potential and metastasis in the remote area was necessary. Hence, 18FDG PET/CT was performed, and 18FDG uptake at the T12 level was measured.

She has had cataract surgery in the past in addition to colonic polypectomy for benign polyps a few years prior to her presentation. Her family history was significant for uterine cancer in her mother, without known genetic predisposition. On physical examination, she was hemodynamically normal and the only pertinent finding was tenderness to palpation in her right upper and lower abdominal quadrants. All blood tests were within normal limits including a white blood cell count and liver function tests. A right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrated gallbladder distention with mild gallbladder wall thickening, but no evidence of gallstones, sludge, or pericholecystic fluid. A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a markedly dilated extrahepatic biliary ductal system (intrapancreatic common bile duct > 2.5 cm) and a markedly distended gallbladder (). The patient was admitted to the hospital for treatment of acute cholecystitis including bowel rest and antibiotics. Given the marked dilation of the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts an obstructing mass at the head of the pancreas or the distal bile duct had to be ruled out. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) demonstrated a distended gallbladder with wall thickening, edema, and pericholecystic fluid confirming acalculous cholecystitis, with a mention of focal narrowing and wall thickening of the cystic duct. The extrahepatic bile duct had a fusiform dilation measuring 27 mm in the largest dimension (). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) failed to show a pancreatic head mass or distal common bile duct stricture; however the cystic duct did not opacify, suggesting an obstruction in the absence of gallstones. The patient's clinical status did not improve during a short",

The patient had fallen down and sustained the injury to his right elbow while hanging from the rootlets of a Banyan tree, following which, he had pain, swelling, and deformity of the right elbow. He had sought treatment from a local bone setter for four weeks following which pain and swelling decreased, but the deformity and elbow stiffness had persisted, for which he attended our hospital.\nOn examination, the Beighton hyperlaxity score of the patient was 5/9. There was flexion deformity of the elbow joint and wasting of muscles of the arm and forearm. The olecranon process was displaced from the olecranon fossa of the right humerus and an abnormal bone mass was palpable on the anterior aspect of the distal humerus. There was a flexion deformity of 40 degrees of the elbow joint with further flexion of 70 degrees. Pronation and supination were normal. There was a valgus laxity of the right elbow joint. The differential diagnoses were neglected dislocation of the elbow joint (posterior/anterior) and mal-united supracondylar fracture.\nAntero-posterior and lateral radiographs of right elbow demonstrated an anterior dislocation of the elbow joint with an anterior bone mass at the distal humerus. The bony anatomy of the elbow appeared unclear on radiography, and a Computed Tomogram (CT) with 3D reconstruction () confirmed an anterior dislocation of the right elbow joint with a bony projection from the anterior border of the distal humerus. We hypothesised that because of hyperlaxity the patient had sustained anterior dislocation of the elbow joint without associated fracture. Massage and attempts to reduce the elbow joint by the bone setter had led to the formation of a heterotopic bone mass on the volar aspect of the humerus.\nWe performed an open reduction of the elbow by combined",

She was referred to an outpatient clinic with a complaint of a 3 \u00d7 4 cm mass that had been located in the right parotid region for eight months and recently grew rapidly to cause total facial nerve palsy. The mass was mobile, and the patient did not report pain. The patient's computed tomography (CT) indicated a lobular-contoured, 4 \u00d7 2.5 cm solid mass lesion with heterogeneous contrast enhancement in the anterior lobe of the right parotid gland (). A fine needle aspiration biopsy revealed a malignancy of an unknown type. Neither physical and endoscopic examinations nor positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) checks succeeded in establishing the primary origin of the malignancy.\nHowever, an elevated skin flap revealed a pigmented lesion that had infiltrated the superficial parotid gland. Following a frozen-section examination, the patient was diagnosed with melanoma. We observed the temporozygomatic and buccal branches of the facial nerve penetrating a 5 \u00d7 6 cm mass originating from the superficial lobe of the parotid gland (). We then performed a total parotidectomy operation in which we resected the temporozygomatic and buccal branches and dissected the deep lobe. The results of an immunohistochemical analysis found the melanoma to be HMB-45 positive, S100 positive, Melan-A positive, and PanCK negative. These findings verified the malignant melanoma diagnosis (Figures , , , and ).\nNo primary origin of the melanoma was detected in the head, the neck, or any other region during the patient's postoperative dermatology consultation. Considering the possibility that the primary metastatic malignant melanoma might have regressed, we decided to check the patient's earlier photographs. Upon examination of photographs that were taken five to six years ago, we detected a 3 \u00d7 3 cm hyperpigmented lesion in the right facial region (Figures and ).
