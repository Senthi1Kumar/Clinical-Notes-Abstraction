Forty-three months after first MS attack, she presented with regurgitation and dysphagia that appeared 2 months ago. This was initially considered to be a new attack of MS. By history taking and neurological examination, other signs were recognized: easy fatigability (on examination), nasal speech, and ptosis. The new signs made the neurologist suspect myasthenia gravis (MG).\nThe diagnosis of MG was supported by positive edrophonium test. Slow repetitive nerve stimulation of spinal accessory nerve at 3 Hz shows a 23% decrement in CMAP amplitude. This amount of decrement is abnormal and is consistent with a neuromuscular junction transmission disorder, but serum acetylcholine receptor antibodies (ACh-R Ab) were negative. Other antibodies which may be present in MG patients were not assessed. Computerized tomography scan of the thorax revealed no thymic enlargement and just persistent remnants of the gland were detected. She has received 60 mg pyridostigmine bromide three times per day and interferon beta-1b was discontinued. The signs and symptoms of MG were incompletely relieved after a few days.\nShe was discharged with mild orofacial weakness and followed. After two weeks, she presented with severe bilateral ptosis, intermittent double vision, chocking during swallowing, and dyspnea. With diagnosis of MG crisis, the patient was admitted to intensive care unit and underwent tracheal intubation followed by plasmapheresis 4 sessions comprising exchange with albumin 2 liters in each day. In addition, prednisolone 25 mg per day was prescribed. After extubation, pyridostigmine bromide every 4 hours was administered via nasogastric tube. After plasmapheresis the patient still had diplopia and ptosis and mild dyspnea and the gag reflex was impaired.

After 6 months of treatment, the patient developed grade 3 hepatotoxicity with ALT and AST elevations from normal values to 882 U/l and 383 U/l, and an elevated bilirubin of 25 umol/l. Imatinib was paused for two weeks and parameters rapidly declined to normal limits. Treatment was then continued at 400 mg OD and sustained tumor shrinkage was seen in subsequent CT scans. After 16 months of neoadjuvant therapy tumor shrinkage ceased and tumor size was reduced from 18 cm to 14 cm (22% reduction). A complete tumor resection was performed at that time. Consistent with the clinical response, the pathological examination revealed a tumor regression of 20% (Figure ) with low expression of proliferation markers (MIB <1%). Due to the high risk of recurrence, adjuvant therapy with imatinib 400 mg OD was initiated. After 7 months of adjuvant treatment, grade 4 hepatotoxicity developed with an ALT 1837 U/l and AST 1022 U/l (Figure ) and an elevated bilirubin of 90 umol/l. Imatinib was paused for a total duration of 8 weeks, and subsequently the elevated transaminases declined to values within normal limits.

After resting, he showed improvement and had intermittent attacks without any treatment. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) examination indicated stenosis at the beginning of the left internal carotid artery. Because of recurrent symptoms, he sought admission to our hospital for further treatment. Moreover, he had diabetes for 17 years and was treated with an orally administered antidiabetic medication. He also had hypertension for 10 months (blood pressure up to 220/120 mmHg) and was treated with an orally administered antihypertensive drug. He had 20-pack years of smoking history.\nRoutine examination with CTA and DUS before surgery was performed. CTA indicated a small niche shadow in the left internal carotid artery on sagittal view (Fig. ), and no significant stenosis was found. The diagnosis based on CTA was atherosclerosis plaque surface ulceration. In the preoperative ultrasound examination, a membrane-like structure protruding into the lumen from the lateral posterior wall at the beginning of the left internal carotid artery on gray scale was noted, and an isoechoic plaque could be seen at the basilar part of the membrane-like structure (Fig. ). Moreover, the membrane-like structure projected into the lumen in a certain curve and was not floating in the blood.

She also had low backache and swelling over the right parietal region for 5 months. She had tenderness over the lower lumbar spine on examination. Palpation revealed a large 10 \u00d7 8 cm firm mass in the anterior neck, predominantly on the right side, and an immobile hard swelling over the scalp in the right parietal region. Contrast-enhanced CT imaging () performed previously showed a large enhancing mass involving the right lobe and isthmus of the thyroid gland with multiple subcentimetre nodules in bilateral lungs. Fine needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid mass revealed it to be a follicular neoplasm (Bethesda category IV). Based on this clinical information, a tentative diagnosis of metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma was made. The patient was planned for thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine therapy depending on the histopathology. She underwent right hemithyroidectomy in December 2014 under cervical block. Intraoperatively, the surgeon visualized a very small atrophic left lobe of the thyroid but in view of the patient's overall condition, complete thyroidectomy was considered a difficult procedure to perform. The final histopathology report revealed follicular carcinoma with capsular and vascular invasion.\nThe patient was referred to the department of nuclear medicine for further management. As per institutional protocol, after hemithyroidectomy, she underwent radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) and thyroid scan, which showed 1.4% 24 h RAIU and no pertechnetate uptake in the region of the thyroid gland. A pertechnetate whole-body sweep was performed in the same sitting and revealed no uptake in the already known metastatic site.

    "cleaned_text": "an 82-year-old female patient presented with a history of goitre for 10 years with recent rapid increase in its size, dysphagia and hoarseness of voice for 1 month. she also had low backache and swelling over the right parietal region for 5 months. she had tenderness over the lower lumbar spine on examination. palpation revealed a large 10 \u00d7 8 cm firm mass in the anterior neck, predominantly on the right side, and an immobile hard swelling over the scalp in the right parietal region. contrast-enhanced ct imaging () performed previously showed a large enhancing mass involving the right lobe and isthmus of the thyroid gland with multiple subcentimetre nodules in bilateral lungs. fine needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid mass revealed it to be a follicular neoplasm (bethesda category iv). based on this clinical information, a tentative diagnosis of metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma was made. the patient was planned for thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine therapy depending on the histopathology. she underwent right hemithyroidectomy in december 2014 under cervical block. intraoperatively, the surgeon visualized a very small atrophic left lobe of the thyroid but in view of the patient's overall condition, complete thyroidectomy was considered a difficult procedure to perform. the final histopathology report revealed follicular carcinoma with capsular and vascular invasion.\nthe patient was referred to the department of nuclear medicine for further management. as per institutional protocol, after hemithyroidectomy, she underwent radioactive iodine uptake (raiu) and thyroid scan, which showed 1.4% 24 h raiu and no pertechnetate uptake in the region of the thyroid gland. a pertechnetate whole-body sweep was performed in the same sitting and revealed no uptake in the already known metastatic site. thyroid function test showed a low normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) value (0.5 \u00b5iu ml\u20131) with normal t3 and t4 levels. neck ultrasonography showed residual tissue in the neck, predominantly on the left side. in view",

The patient required post-op ventilation after both the surgeries for a day.\nOn examination patient had a mallampati grade-3 airway. Her weight was 25 kgs and securing a good IV access seemed difficult.\nAfter discussion of all the possible options it was decided to manage the case with total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with caudal epidural analgesia.\nThe patient was premedicated with syrup Promethazine 125 mg on the night and morning of surgery. The routine monitoring was instituted and a 22 G IV cannula was inserted in the left forearm with difficulty. The patient was given inj Midazolam 1 mg IV for smooth separation from the parents. The difficult airway cart was kept ready, patient was induced with inj Fentanyl 50 mcg, inj Propofol 50 mg iv and after ensuring smooth mask ventilation inj Rocuronium 25 mg iv was given. Direct laryngoscopy done with MAC 2 blade, Lehane and Cormack grade-3 view was seen, which improved to grade-2 view with backward and downward pressure on the larynx. The child was intubated with a six cuffed endotracheal tube.\nAnesthesia was maintained with an infusion of inj Propofol started at 5 mg/Kg/hr to achieve a BIS level of 50\u201360.

He was referred to our hospital for further evaluation.\nHe reported a history of rectal insertion of a paintbrush four weeks ago, which resulted in rectorrhagia and pain during defecation since that time. The 4-week delay in seeking medical care was because of the patient's mortification. In physical examination, no fever, abdominal tenderness, or rebound was observed. In his CT image, the paintbrush was in the abdominopelvic cavity, located in the middle part of the lower abdomen. Oblique orientation of the FB was seen with the left tip pointing to the left lower abdomen and the right tip to the posterior of the lower abdomen, just anterior to sigmoid bowel loops. The location of the FB was reported in the mesenteric area with adjacent fat stranding and not in the bowel loops (). However, the rectal examination was unremarkable. We performed another CT scan for reassurance and reevaluation, which had the same result in comparison to the first image. He underwent rigid sigmoidoscopy under general anesthesia, with no findings in the last 25 cm of the rectum and sigmoid colon. Subsequently, a colonoscopy was performed, which did not show any abnormality. Eventually, exploratory laparoscopy was performed.\nThe patient was taken to the operating room for general anesthesia and was placed in the supine position. Insufflation was done via the insertion of a Veress needle into the umbilicus.

On the day she was admitted, her pain had suddenly increased in intensity and she had noted the presence of fresh blood on her toilet paper.\nThe woman had been examined by a gynecologist three days earlier after experiencing mild to moderate abdominal pain. She had had a copper intrauterine device (IUD) for three years and usually had regular periods. However, for the last few weeks, she had only experienced some spotting. A physical examination by the gynecologist revealed some vaginal discharge, but no vaginal bleeding. The uterus and the adnexa were tender when bimanual palpation was performed. Ultrasound showed an endometrial lining of approximately 5 mm. The IUD was located in the uterine cavity. Both ovaries were normal, but some fluid was seen in the right fallopian tube. No fluid was visualized in the pouch of Douglas. The gynecologist tried to remove the IUD, but this procedure was unsuccessful since the IUD strings could not be seen. The patient's temperature was 36.7\u00b0C. However, routine biochemistry showed that serum CRP was 100 g/L and \u03b2-HCG was 412 mIU/mL. The gynecologist concluded that the woman had a pelvic infection and prescribed doxycycline and metronidazole tablets. As the serum \u03b2-HCG was suggestive of an early stage of pregnancy, an ectopic pregnancy could not be excluded. A follow-up consultation was therefore scheduled for three days later. The patient was also encouraged to contact a hospital immediately if her condition worsened.\nTwo days later, the patient saw fresh blood on her toilet paper. Her pain was also more intense.

Although she experienced slight difficulty in swallowing, she did not experience pain or tongue paralysis. Her medical and family histories were unremarkable.\nIntraoral examination revealed a well-defined 3.5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 cm-sized solid, spherical submucosal nodule adjacent to the sublingual gland; the nodule was covered with light bluish smooth mucus (Fig. ). The patient experienced slight pain when pressure was applied to the tumor. Mobility and sensory functions of the tongue were normal, and no lymphadenopathy in the submandibular region was detected on palpation. All relevant laboratory test results were normal. Enhanced computed tomography revealed a 2.8 \u00d7 1.8 \u00d7 2.1 cm-sized well-defined, solid, heterogeneous nodule that did not appear to involve the mandible (Fig. ). In addition, a three-dimensionally reconstructed image showed a nodular lesion occupying the left floor of the mouth with abundant blood flow (Fig. ). No enlarged lymph nodes were found in the submental or submandibular regions.\nThe initial clinical impression was a benign salivary gland tumor, dermoid cyst, or benign connective tissue neoplasm. The patient was scheduled for surgery via an intraoral approach. First, an elliptical incision was made around the periphery of the sublingual gland through only the oral mucosa, and a full-thickness tissue flap was prepared along the lingual aspect of the sublingual gland. After the sublingual gland was freed from its surrounding tissue with blunt dissection, a well-circumscribed tumor without capsular extension was found beneath the body of the sublingual gland and located above the submandibular gland duct and lingual nerve.

The patient experienced sudden respiratory distress when she was lifting heavy cargo during farm work. She also complained orthopnea with pink bubble sputum cough. The patient was 155 cm in height and weighed 48 kg. Her heart rate was 103 per minute, and blood pressure was 99/63 mm Hg. Physical examination revealed a 4/6 systolic murmur in cardiac apex. Electrocardiogram demonstrated depression of ST segments at multiple leads: I, II, aVL, and V3 to V6. Meanwhile, blood test showed no troponin elevation. Acute pulmonary congestion was detected by chest X-ray. Echocardiogram found a prolapsed posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with massive regurgitation, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 68% and a normal sized left ventricle. The patient denied of similar symptoms in her past history.\nTherefore, she was preliminarily diagnosed of acute left heart failure caused by mitral regurgitation and scheduled for valve repair surgery. Routine coronary angiography was performed to exclude coexisting coronary artery disease. However, the left main coronary trunk could not be catheterized. Meanwhile, collateral vessels could be seen flowing from right coronary artery (RCA) to fill the left coronary system (Fig. ). The patient was then suspected of left main coronary atresia or complete occlusion. She received CT coronary angiography for further diagnosis, which confirmed absence of left coronary ostium, with abnormally small LAD and left circumflex arteries (LCX), both filled by collateral vessels arising from RCA.\nDuring operation, the patient's mitral chordae of the posterior leaflet was found ruptured, with dysplasia of papillary muscle (Fig. ). Then, a successful mitral valvuloplasty was first performed. Although with worry that the small caliber left coronary system may not be a suitable target for surgical revascularization, we performed CABG with left internal mammary artery anastomosed to proximal LAD anyway",

His electrocardiograph had revealed a sinus rhythm with a QRS duration of 140 ms along with a left bundle branch block morphology. He underwent a cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) device implantation. However, 2 weeks after the procedure, he was re-admitted to our hospital with a 4-day history of pain and swelling at the CRT-D pocket site, associated with scant serous drainage. Prior to this admission, he had undergone a skin incision and drainage at another hospital, but the procedure had failed to relieve his symptoms. The patient had a history of hypertension, a myocardial bridge in the left anterior descending coronary artery and diabetes mellitus (on irregular therapy). He also had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis 40 years previously and had completed the curative treatment course successfully, at the time. His regular medications included metoprolol, perindopril, torsemide, and amiodarone.\nDuring re-admission, the patient did not have complaints of fever, chills, or fatigue. The physical examination was unremarkable, except for a 2-cm long, open incision on the upper left side of the chest, with mild localized edema over the CRT-D pocket. The skin around the incision was erythematous, and a small amount of scant serous discharge was noted on pressing the pocket site. Considering the likelihood of CRT-D infection, we collected the patient\u2019s blood samples to perform cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The samples of the exudate were also tested, using microscopic examination and culture, not only for the usual causative bacteria but also for the rarer acid-fast bacilli.

The patient developed pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the peripheral hospital emergency room for which he was successfully defibrillated to normal sinus rhythm after two attempts with 360 J. The total resuscitation period for the first arrest was 15 minutes. Prior to dispatch to the primary PCI center, the patient was started on parenteral amiodarone with a loading dose of 150 mg followed by 50 mg/hr. En route to the tertiary care hospital with PCI capabilities, the patient suffered a second cardiac arrest with pulseless VT/VF. Immediate CPR was initiated by the paramedics prior to arrival at the primary PCI centre. In the ER, the patient required intubation and 40 minutes of CPR with incessant VF refractory to defibrillation and anti-arrhythmic therapy. Specifically, the patient received a total of 4 mg of epinephrine and a total of 7 defibrillation shocks (360 J each). He also received lidocaine 100 mg and amiodarone 150 mg loading doses followed by infusions of both anti-arrhythmic agents. He was started on lidocaine 2 mg/min and continued on the amiodarone 50 mg/hr intravenously. Due to his young age and witnessed arrest, a decision was made to initiate ECMO for hemodynamic support in the emergency department. Peripheral veno-arterial ECMO access was obtained using 17 size French (F) arterial cannula and 24/29 F venous cannula (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN). A Maquet Rotaflow centrifugal pump and a Quadrox oxygenation system were used to complete the ECMO circuit (Masquet, Rastaat, Germany) as shown in Figure .

In the maxilla, Wunderer and Posterior LeFort I osteotomies with extractions of upper first premolars were carried out. In the mandible, lower segmental (Hofer) osteotomy with extractions of lower first premolars, and advancement and reduction genioplasty were carried out.\nAt two weeks after surgery, there was wound dehiscence between the upper left canine and second premolar region. One month post surgery, a cleft like defect distal to the upper left canine was noted.\nUpon initial orthodontic assessment 6 months after surgery, a suppuration site was detected distal to the upper left canine with a probing depth of 8 mm. Removal of sequestrum and granulation tissue was carried out and the suppuration stopped and gingival recession 5 mm was noted with reduced probing depth to 3 mm. However an alveolar ridge deficiency remained between the upper left canine and second premolar region with no active inflammation.\nThe patient was referred to the oral surgeon to have the alveolar bone graft prior to the orthodontic tooth movement. Ramus bone graft was carried out in 2007 to the bony defect. Unfortunately, bone regeneration distal to the upper left canine did not occur.\nIn order to close the space between the upper left canine and second premolar without worsening the periodontal attachment and bony defect, a very light orthodontic force was applied more than three months after the bone grafting. 014 inch copper NiTi wire with stainless steel ligature laceback from upper right second molar to upper left second premolar (0.010 inch stainless steel wire) was used with the canine bracket rebonded to more incisal position to attempt to intrude it at the same time as distalising canine root and mesialising upper left second premolars because of angulations of the bracket slots (Fig. ). The laceback was tightened every visit",

Chest radiography revealed that it was well-defined, with several nodules in both lung fields and the chest computed tomography (CT) confirmed the aforementioned findings of uncertain origin (). Pelvic CT and magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed a lobulating retroperitoneal mass measuring 148\u00d7100\u00d7154 mm at the right posterior aspect of the vaginal stump in continuity with the vaginal apex (). Routine laboratory investigations and tumor markers including alpha-fetoprotein, CA 19-9 and CA-125, were revealed to be within normal range.

Also, nerve stimulation therapy was applied, and a probatory surgical removal of both seminal vesicles and an extension surgery on the anus were performed.

    "original_text": "A 67-year old female with acute respiratory failure due to severe AS was referred for consideration of TAVI. She underwent ventricular septal defect repair at the age of 10. At the age of 57 she presented with progressive breathlessness secondary to severe mitral regurgitation and underwent a mitral valve replacement with a 27 mm Carpentier Edwards Magna Valve. Six years later she developed further progressive dyspnoea and underwent an urgent redo mitral valve replacement for a stenotic prosthetic mitral valve. A 33 mm Carbomedics Valve was inserted into the mitral position. She has end-stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis.\nTransthoracic echocardiography showed a degenerated bicuspid aortic valve with a peak velocity of 5.2 m/s (peak gradient 108 mmHg; mean gradient 68 mmHg, area of 0.43 cm2). The mitral valve prosthesis was functioning normally. Invasive coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries. Following a Heart team discussion, it was decided to perform TAVI due to her previous mitral and redo mitral valve replacement. The aortic valve was a Sievers Type 0 bicuspid valve.

General physical examination of the patient was unremarkable. Abdominal examination was normal. Digital rectal examination revealed a large, smooth, symmetrical mass lying anterior to the rectum. Ultrasonography of abdomen revealed a large hypoechoic mass with echogenic septations in the pelvis posterior to the urinary bladder. Contrast-enhanced computerized tomogram (CECT) of abdomen and pelvis revealed a huge pelvic cyst 8 \u00d7 7 cm in diameter () lying between the urinary bladder and the rectum in the rectovesical pouch. Provisional diagnosis of primary pelvic hydatid disease was made, but hydatid serology was not suggestive of the disease. Radiological examination of chest (chest X-ray PA view) was normal. CECT of the chest is done in our setup only if chest X-ray shows a doubtful lesion in order to decrease the financial burden of the treatment. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a large hydatid cyst in the rectovesical pouch (). There were no similar cystic masses in any other abdominal viscera (). Cyst was completely excised without any spillage after packing the surrounding area with 1% cetrimide-soaked sponges. Final diagnosis was confirmed by pathological examination. Postoperative period was uneventful. Patient was put on 3 cycles of albendazole therapy; dose of the albendazole was adjusted according to the body weight of the patient. Each cycle of albendazole therapy was of one month duration. After each cycle patient was advised a holiday period of 2 weeks, and in that holiday period liver function and complete blood counts were assessed which in both holiday periods were normal, and subsequently 2nd and 3rd cycles were completed.

He also complained of nausea and loss of appetite but no new change in bowel habits. He was under investigation for chronic diarrhoea of 10 years. His other relevant medical history included type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension. On examination, the patient was noted to have a large body habitus (BMI 28) and stable observation. Per abdomen there was tenderness, guarding and percussion tenderness in the right iliac fossa. There was no palpable visceromegaly. The urinalysis was negative for any abnormality. All his bloods tests including C-reactive protein and amylase were normal. Based on the clinical findings of localized right iliac peritonism, a provisional diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made and patient was taken for surgery. With changing trends in approach to acute surgery and increased use of laparoscopic intervention in our department, a laparoscopic appendectomy was planned. This revealed a macroscopically normal vermiform appendix with bulky mesoappendix and minimal serosanguinous in pelvis. This prompted examination of other viscera which revealed a torted section of right distal omentum lying 10 cm distal to the appendix between lateral ascending colon and adjacent anterior abdominal wall (), forming a congested, dusky, fatty mass measuring 4 \u00d7 3 cm (, ). There were inflammatory adhesions between the torted omental mass and anterior abdominal wall. Appendectomy and local resection of torted omental segment were carried out. Both specimens were retrieved in a bag through 10 mm umbilical port. Postoperatively, the patient made a good overall recovery apart from superficial wound infection at the umbilical port site which was successfully treated with oral antibiotics.

    "original_text": "A 76-year-old Japanese female, with no prior medical history and no symptom, visited our hospital with the heterogeneous hypoechoic lesion in the liver segment VI incidentally pointed out in abdominal ultrasonography (US). There were no abnormal findings in her routine laboratory data, including liver function tests, serology profile for hepatitis B or C, and tumor markers including CA 19-9, alpha-Fetoprotein, and CEA. A previous history of alcohol abuse was not documented. Computed tomography (CT) with contrast demonstrated a 1.1 cm sized low-density lesion with mild ring enhancement on the rim in the arterial phase, located in the liver segment VI ().\nWithout any definite diagnosis from clinical imaging, US-guided biopsy was performed. The specimen showed necrotic tissue with trabecular pattern alignment of reticulin fibers in silver stain. The immunohistochemistry examination showed no positive staining with CK7, CK19, CK20, and hepatocyte in the tissue. Since the possibility of hepatocellular carcinoma with necrotic change could not be ruled out, she underwent laparoscopic anatomical IV segmentectomy of the liver.\nOn the cut section of the surgical specimen, a 1.2 \u00d7 1.2 cm sized, homogeneous, whitish-yellow-colored nodule with central small cystic area was observed in the liver segment IV. The nodule was well demarcated from surrounding normal liver tissue with the fibrous capsulation (). Histologically, the liver nodule was necrotic tissue without viable cells and signs of inflammation, which had fibrous capsule and central cystic change (). In silver stain, the nodule showed trabecular pattern alignment of ghost cells and reticulin fibers orthogonal to the capsule (), which was similar to the hepatocyte-originated neoplasm. Also, the findings of chronic hepatitis were observed in the background liver (). There were no signs of bacterial or fungal organism and calcification around or inside the lesion. Although the nodule was located next to the peripheral Glissonian pedicle of segment IV, there were no abnormal vessels around or inside the lesion",

In the maxillary anterior area, there was a discrete, bulbous enlargement in the interproximal region. In the maxillary posterior area, there was diffuse enlargement, which extended to the alveolar mucosa (). Gingival enlargement was most severe in the palatal area, extending beyond the cingulum of the maxillary anterior teeth (). The gingiva was pale blue and had a glazed texture with loss of stippling.
