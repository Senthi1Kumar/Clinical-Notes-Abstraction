A radiography revealed osteolysis with partial ossification (Figure a and b) in the region from the proximal tibial epiphysis to the metaphysis. The patient was referred to our department where a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a bone tumor located in the proximal tibia. A tissue biopsy was performed, revealing atypical spindle-shaped tumor cells and multi-nucleated giant cells, as well as a neoplastic osteoid formation in the interstitial tissue, which led to the diagnosis of osteosarcoma (Figure c).\nAt this time no apparent metastatic lesions were observed. The administration of preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin (120 mg/m2 on day 1) and doxorubicin (30 mg/m2 on days 1 to 2) was not effective and the tumor continued to grow. On completion of two courses of chemotherapy a pathological fracture occurred and an amputation of the right femur was performed. The histological response rate of the resected specimen was less than 10% of the entire lesion. Following surgery, five courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with ifosfamide (3 g/m2 on days 1 to 4) and VP-16 (75 mg/m2 on days 1 to 4) were administered and the patient was discharged as disease free.During follow-up, a computed tomography (CT) scan at 9 months after discharge revealed multiple metastases in both lungs (Figure a), and chemotherapy was re-initiated. The chemotherapy did not result in any marked change in the pulmonary metastases.

A sharp piece of glass caused a deep wound with a length of about 3 centimetres on the right cheeks. The patient showed no signs of facial nerve injury. The wound was then toileted and sutured. After 10 days from trauma the patient began to complain of the appearance of a continuous colourless and odourless fluid from the wound, which increased after food intake. Therefore the patient came under our observation on 20th day from trauma. A clinical examination revealed on the wound scar a 3 mm orifice discharging a clear serous secretion, suggesting the diagnose of posttraumatic parotid fistula. The patients were invited to limit oral intake for a week in order to reduce salivary output; steristrips were placed to close the fistula and a compressive dressing was applied for 7 days, with no results. Due to severe discomfort caused by a large amount of secretion, a device for transdermal delivery of scopolamine (Transcop Recordati OTC S.p.A.

She had been pregnant three times and given birth to three children. On physical examination, there were no remarkable findings. As to laboratory tests, levels of aspartate amino transferase (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glutamyl transferase and total bilirubin were within normal ranges. Ultrasonography showed a few strongly echoic stones but there was no gallbladder wall thickening. Neither intra- nor extra-hepatic bile ducts were dilated. Routine preoperative computed tomography (CT) revealed a series of tortuous collateral veins at the liver hilum, irregularly surrounding the gallbladder from the neck to the fundus (Figure a, b).

It was heard about 50% of the time during the day and became louder when she experienced fatigue at her job in accounting. The patient described attenuation of tinnitus by manual compression of the left posterior auricular area. The patient did not complain of hearing impairment, fullness in the ear, hyperacusis, dizziness, or headache. She had no past head or neck trauma, no exposure to ototoxic drugs or extremely loud noise, chronic medical illness, or neuropsychiatric condition. The tinnitus was not audible even with a stethoscope around the left ear and mastoid area. The patient described that the Valsalva maneuver, or manual compression of the left internal jugular vein, reduced the loudness of the tinnitus, but it was unaffected by head position or compression of the right neck. The otoscopic examination and pure-tone audiogram were normal.\nAn axial temporal bone computed tomography with contrast enhancement revealed that the left MEV had a prominent opening to the sigmoid sinus and the large canal of the vein crossing the mastoid bone to the soft tissue, without other accessory MEVs ().

Her medication included venlafaxine, and reverse transcriptase inhibitors efavirenz (non-nucleoside) and lamivudine (nucleoside). She had originally attended 4 years previously with left nipple discharge associated with pain and discomfort of her left breast. Ultrasound imaging with core biopsies revealed multiple benign IDPs in her left breast and she underwent a Hadfield\u2019s procedure (radical subareolar duct excision). Another Hadfield\u2019s procedure was performed in the following year (2007) after recurrence of the benign IDPs. In 2010 she underwent a left subcutaneous mastectomy with implant reconstruction following development of a further IDP in her left breast. This form of surgical treatment was decided most appropriate due to the extent of the IDP, difficulty of radiological follow-up and to exclude atypia and risk of subsequent malignancy. In the mastectomy specimen a single IDP was present measuring approximately 38\u00d722mm in maximum dimension. The IDP contained several suspicious foci of solid atypical proliferations, which after immunohistochemical staining were regarded as atypical ductal hyperplasia. The degree of atypia was not considered to amount to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and there was no evidence of invasive neoplasia. No axillary lymphadenopathy was noted at the time of the mastectomy. In situ hybridisation for the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) was performed on two separate IDPs (in 2008 and the IDP in the mastectomy specimen in 2010).

The pathological stage was IIIA (T2N2M0). After surgery, the patient received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy (tamoxifen) as adjuvant therapy.

She refused to undergo surgery due to personal reasons and chose to start capecitabine chemotherapy instead. Following five cycles of chemotherapy, the patient was revealed to have had a complete regression of the local tumor, and she then chose to perform a rigorous observation of the local tumor. By July 2009, she had again developed a new local lump in the right breast with progressive enlargement, but she did not undergo further inspections and treatment. Later, in September 2010, the patient was referred to our hospital with lung metastases, pleural effusion, multiple bone metastases, and asymptomatic BMs. Histopathologic examination of the lump in the right breast indicated that the tumor was ER positive, PR positive, and HER-2 negative.

A history of distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer 2 years ago and low cardiac function without coronary disease was noted. The patient was previously a smoker, and had received cilostazol. An endovascular procedure was planned for the right ischemic limb after postoperative recovery from gastric surgery. The right common femoral artery (CFA) and superficial femoral artery (SFA) were occluded with an ankle-brachial index value of 0.3. The right common iliac artery had an aneurysmal change of 34 mm in diameter. The measurement of psoas muscle mass index at the third lumber vertebrae level was 4.62 cm2/m2.\nThe patient looked pale but was conscious. He was thin and weighed 40 kg (body mass index, 14.5) due to loss of appetite after gastric surgery; however, his left thigh was reddish, edematous and painful (). Hemodynamics, such as blood pressure and heart rate, were stable. Blood tests revealed a hemoglobin level of 3.41 mmol/l. Ultrasonography showed a 72 \u00d7 52 mm PFAA with a thick thrombus and hematoma extending into the adductors (). A venous thrombus was also observed in the left femoral vein. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a ruptured left PFAA 64 \u00d7 54 mm in diameter (). In addition, right iliac artery aneurysm and right CFA and SFA occlusion were also observed.\nEmergency surgery was performed due to an aneurysmal rupture associated with severe anemia.

    "original_text": "A 66-year-old man had been diagnosed with Ta bladder cancer 6 years before he complained of dry cough in July 2009. He had a history of recurrent non-muscle-invasive bladder tumors and had therefore undergone 7 transurethral resections (TURs) and had received intravesicular chemotherapies (8 cycles of weekly mitomycin-C after the 4th TUR and 5 cycles of biweekly pirarubicin after the 5th TUR). All tumors were <1 cm, well pedunculated, and papillary. The number of tumors ranged from 1 to 6 in each respective TUR. The pathological findings of all TURs indicated the presence of urothelial carcinoma (stage Ta without carcinoma in situ, grade 1 or 2) without lymphatic or vascular invasion. The last TUR in January 2009 showed the same findings as the previous TURs, i.e., there were 3 tiny papillary tumors located at the right lateral wall, at the posterior wall, and adjacent to the left ureteral orifice, and pathological examination indicated results similar to those of the previous TURs. Chest radiography at 6 months after the last TUR detected a round nodule (diameter, 7.5 cm) in the right lower lung. We carefully rechecked the chest radiograph obtained in April 2008, which showed a small nodule (diameter, 1 cm) in the same area. These observations suggest that the lung metastasis had occurred more than 1 year previously. The initial diagnosis based on the computed tomography findings was primary lung cancer (). Therefore, initial treatment consisted of video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy. The histopathologic features of the pulmonary lesion and the TUR specimen of the bladder cancer were qualitatively similar.

Twelve days after the operation, adjuvant chemotherapy was started with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. She received cisplatin (92 mg/day for 4 days) and 5-fluorouracil (1,530 mg/day for 1 day). Two days after the 1st chemotherapy, the patient presented with a sudden onset of right flank pain and dizziness. Emergency computed tomography (CT) imaging of her abdomen and pelvis was performed. A large thrombus was identified in the abdominal aorta at the origin of the renal arteries, and it involved the right renal artery causing renal infarction (). The CT scan prior to the chemotherapy showed a normal aorta at the origin of the renal arteries. Chest X-rays showed no abnormality. The electrocardiography and echocardiogram excluded arrhythmia or intracardiac thrombi. Initial laboratory findings were within normal limits; prothrombin time international normalized ratio 1.01, activated partial thromboplastin time 33.7 seconds, protein C activity 125%, antithrombin III 108%, blood urea nitrogen 13.8 mg/dL, creatinine 0.74 mg/dL, except for protein S activity 56%. Only protein S activity was lower than the normal limit (71 to 103%). A therapeutic intravenous infusion of unfractionated heparin was commenced. To minimize surgical burden to the patient who was on her 17th day after major surgery, hybrid surgery was chosen. Hybrid treatment was performed under general anesthesia. A transbrachial aortic angiogram was performed, which revealed a large filling defect in the aorta just at the origin of the renal arteries and there was no flow to the right renal artery. A cut-down of the right common femoral artery and a puncture of the left common femoral artery were performed.

On light microscopy, an acral melanoma was diagnosed, with a Breslow thickness of 1.5 mm. Clinical staging was T2 N0 M0, with a normal LDH (355 mg/dL) and normal chest and abdomen CT findings.\nBased on the clinical stage and Breslow thickness, a sentinel node biopsy and a wide-margin excision were carried out. On lymphoscintigraphic examination, a major uptake of radionuclide was localized in the popliteal and groin lymph nodes, which were excised and submitted to histopathological examination. These lymph nodes were deemed positive for metastatic melanoma and, consequently, a lymphadenectomy of the deep and superficial groin as well as popliteal regions was indicated. After this procedure, histopathological examination disclosed seven popliteal lymph nodes, all being disease-free.\nNormally, there are 2 to 9 lymph nodes localized within the fat tissue surrounding the nerves and major vessels of the popliteal fossa. Popliteal lymph nodes are deep structures encountered under the investing fascia of the leg, and they receive the lymphatic drainage of the deep structures of the distal leg and foot. Although infrequent, the lymphatic drainage from the skin is direct to these lymph nodes in some individuals. The surgical procedure of popliteal lymph node dissection involves en bloc removal of all fibrous, fatty, and lymphatic tissue in the popliteal fossa, with careful preservation of the nerves and vessels.\nThe patient is placed in the prone position with the knee slightly flexed.

The chest pain started gradually, and was relieved by rest and exacerbated by exertion. She was started on capecitabine therapy 3 days before the onset of chest pain. She denied shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, fever, syncope, heartburn, and peripheral edema. The patient did not have a history of CAD or had known risk factors for CAD. She denied the use of cocaine. The patient did not describe symptoms suggestive of panic attack. On examination, her heart rate was 100 bpm and regular. Her physical examination was otherwise unremarkable.\nFive years before the current event, she underwent mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection for a stage III (pT2N3) breast cancer. The tumor was ER+, PR+, HER2+, and she received adjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab, followed by tamoxifen. She was diagnosed with metastatic disease in the liver in 2014, and was started on trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel. Fifteen months later, she had disease progression in the liver and was switched to trastuzumab-emtansine. Nine months later, she progressed again, and therapy was changed to lapatinib and capecitabine (1,500 mg b.i.d.). Three days after starting capecitabine, she experienced acute-onset chest pain.\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) testing showed normal sinus rhythm and no changes suggestive of coronary ischemia. Cardiac enzymes were negative. Complete blood count and chemistry panel were within normal range. CT angiography of the chest did not reveal any evidence of pulmonary embolism. A transthoracic echocardiogram documented normal cardiac function and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. Her chest pain resolved after aspirin and analgesics were administered upon admission in the ER.

    "original_text": "A 60-year-old man with alcoholic hepatic cirrhosis and ascites developed perianal epidermoid cancer, for which he underwent combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy with good initial response. Nine months later, he was found to have an enlarging lesion in his perianal region, which upon biopsy was shown to represent a recurrence. Abdominoperineal resection was performed, with malignancy-negative margins. At the time of this surgery, 4 L of ascites were evacuated. Because of prior radiation, the patient's perineal tissues were extremely frail. Although primary closure of the perineal wound was possible at the time of the abdominoperineal resection, the patient began to leak ascitic fluid through the wound soon on postoperative day 2.\nOn postoperative day 3, a reinforcing line of cutaneous sutures was placed in an attempt to control the process, but this ultimately proved inadequate. A concurrent medical therapy aimed at decreasing ascites was undertaken, and consisted of a regimen of diuretics and paracentesis sessions.\nBy postoperative day 5, the leak was so severe that frequent bedside dressing changes (every 2\u20134 hours) were inadequate, and VAC dressing was applied to an open anterior area of the perineal wound (Fig ). It was hoped that the VAC would contribute to closure by preferentially channeling the flow of ascitic fluid and protecting the remainder of the wound, and that the subatmospheric pressure would promote \u201ccollapse\u201d of the perineal tissues and subsequent gradual wound closure.\nInitially, it was hoped that the patient would be able to tolerate limited ambulation while on VAC therapy. However, every time he stood or sat up, more than 1 L of ascitic fluid drained with gravity and overwhelmed the drainage capacity of the VAC device and canister. With each such occurrence, complete VAC dressing change was required. Therefore, it was decided to place the patient on strict bedrest. This maneuver decreased the fluid drainage from 400",

Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a hypovascular tumor in his pancreatic body. He was referred to our hospital for further examination and treatment. He had no significant past medical history and no surgical history, but had a family history of pancreatic cancer (his uncle had had this disease). Although he had no history of smoking, he regularly consumed alcohol.\nOn examination, his abdomen was soft and flat, without any evident mass or tenderness. His laboratory data were unremarkable, except for the carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA-19-9) level, which was elevated to 139 U/mL. Abdominal enhanced CT revealed an 18-mm hypovascular tumor in the pancreatic body and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the tail side of this tumor (Figure ). The tumor was compressing the splenic vein. Endoscopic ultrasound showed a 15-mm low echoic tumor that had ill-defined borders and was located next to the splenic vein. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography demonstrated disruption of the main pancreatic duct in the pancreatic body (Figure ). We diagnosed PDAC with invasion of the splenic vein and performed distal pancreatectomy, lymph node dissection, and splenectomy.\nMacroscopic findings of the resected specimen showed a 35 mm \u00d7 18 mm tumor in the pancreatic body and no other lesion (Figure ). Pathological findings revealed a moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma with invasion of neutrophil in the main lesion (Figure ). The tumor had infiltrated the tunica externa of the splenic vein.

He was diagnosed with a fracture of the right femur. The following month, he again fell from a couch, sustaining a new fracture of the right femur. In addition to the fracture, his x-ray showed thin, osteopenic bones ().\nAt the age of 11 months, the boy was assessed in our institution, in order to reach a diagnosis which would explain his three low-energy fractures. An eye check revealed blue sclera, heart sounds were normal, as were his teeth. His full metabolic bone profile (), showed low levels of procollagen type 1 C-terminal propeptide (PICP).\nAt 17 months, further laboratory tests were performed. The boy had microcephaly as well as generalised floppiness and delay in gross motor milestones (not sitting unsupported at 11 months, not walking independently at 17 months). His weight and head circumference were both below the 3rd centile for age and sex in all visits. Due to faltering height (initially at the 50th centile, then at the 10th centile in the last visit), a failure to thrive work up was undertaken, which revealed no comorbidities (e.g. celiac disease, hypothyroidism).\nBoth parents were present during the assessment. The mother, who had been pregnant for the 3rd time, had had a miscarriage at 9 weeks. The father bore a striking resemblance to the child.

The patient was sharing a seatbelt with one other sibling in the back seat of a 4-door sedan. The vehicle was involved in a \u201cT-bone\u201d collision, which resulted in a temporal head injury against the side door. At the time of presentation, the patient complained of neck tenderness, pain at the right skull base, and nausea. The patient did have poor recollection of the accident; however, there was no indication of loss of consciousness. The patient denied any neck or head pain prior to the accident, and denied any fever, chills, emesis, or seizures. Prior to his presentation, the patient was otherwise healthy, performed well in school, has no family history of coagulopathies, was not taking any medications, and had a negative review of systems except what was discussed earlier. On physical examination, the patient was alert and oriented and appeared well nourished and well hydrated. His pupils were equal and reactive to light, extraocular movements were intact, his smile was symmetric and his hearing present in both ears. He had no otorrhea or rhinorrhea, but some ecchymosis was noted around the right ear. There was some neck tenderness at the level of C3, a neck brace was applied as a precautionary measure pending imaging results. He had full power and normal tone in his upper and lower extremities.

She also had fever, weight loss and decreased appetite. In her past medical history she had been treated for seizures with valproic acid (15 mg/kg/day) for three years. Her seizures were documented by EEG findings.\nOn physical examination, her blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg and she had a pulse rate of 88/min, a respiratory rate of 14/min and oral temperature of 38.6\u00b0C. Her growth and development were normal, reaching menarche at the age of 13, followed by regular cycles until two months before admission. Her weight was 48 kg and her height was 154 cm. She had received all vaccinations since birth according to the national vaccination plan. Her family history was negative for any hereditary or metabolic disorders.\nHer consciousness level was normal and she had no neck stiffness. In spite of being awake, she could not communicate with anyone and only used indistinct words. The pupils were normal in size and equally reactive to light. Her sclera were pale.\nOn neurological examination, her upper limbs were mildly spastic, and her muscle strength was 2\u20133/5 as far as she could cooperate. Her upper limb reflexes, including the biceps, brachioradialis, and triceps, and also her sensory examinations were normal.\nHer lower limbs, however, were flaccid and atrophic; the muscle strength was 0/5 and the patellar and Achilles reflexes were absent. She showed an extensor plantar reflex. Her lower limb sensory examination showed lost senses of light touch, pain, temperature, vibration and joint position.

He had to pad the head in order to reduce the incidence of reflux while sleeping. The patient began to cough while symptoms of regurgitation and heartburn aggravated 1 year ago.\nThe endoscopy result was esophagitis LA-C and atrophic gastritis with erosion. The patient was diagnosed as having GERD in a local hospital and received treatment of life adjustment and medicine including PPI and gastrointestinal prokinetic drug. The symptoms of cough, heartburn, and vomiting were relieved after taking drugs such as PPI in the beginning. However, the patient felt that symptoms were aggravated in the past 2 months and reoccurred after he stopping using drugs. He had a 5-kg weight loss during a period of 2 years. The body mass index of the patient was calculated to be 19.3 after hospital admission in our center. Physical examination revealed only abdominal slight tenderness.\nThe DeMeester score was 1.56 and the result did not meet the standard of acid reflux disease.\nThe lower esophageal sphincter pressure was lower than normal, all swallowing is invalid peristalsis.\nBecause the patient's 24-hour pH monitoring did not meet the standard of acid reflux disease, the patient completed upper gastrointestinal radiography to exclude other causes.\nThe results of the upper gastrointestinal radiography revealed esophageal reflux disease and possible gastritis; hence, SMA oppression syndrome (descending part of duodenal dilation, the contrast agent blocked through the tract, formation characteristic of penholder oppression) was considered (Fig. ).

She was readmitted for recurrence and growth of the discolored skin area, consistent with cellulitis that did not recede after the administration of oral antibiotics (doxycycline and sulfamethoxazole). Following the last admission, she had developed an extensive area of red-purple discoloration surrounding a dark purple, raised round lesion that was 2 cm in diameter, with a smooth surface and puffy consistency. The lesion was located in the anterior aspect of her right shin.\nDespite extensive discoloration of the skin area, the patient was afebrile and did not have leukocytosis.

    "original_text": "A 33-year-old gentleman who was allegedly involved in a motor-vehicle accident was referred to our unit for further management of the suspected orbital fracture. Initial assessment in the Emergency Department (ED) showed that the patient was drowsy, not opening his eyes, or responding to questions, possibly due to alcohol intoxication. His conscious level improved gradually within 24 hours. Clinical assessment showed a right periorbital hematoma and markedly swollen right cheek. Step deformity both over the right supra- and infraorbital rim cannot be appreciated due to the swelling. Satisfactory mouth opening was also recorded. We reviewed the computed tomography (CT) done for the assessment of concomitant traumatic brain injury. The right temporal bone fracture with a fractured fragment in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) space, the right zygomatic arch fracture, the right greater wing of the sphenoid fracture, the orbital floor fracture, and lateral and medial walls of the right maxillary sinus fracture were reported. The patient was subsequently observed in the neurosurgical ward for 48 hours prior to his discharge. Outpatient assessment in the oral and maxillofacial clinic a week after trauma noted grossly symmetrical malar prominence, with resolving right periorbital hematoma.

In June 2012, the patient presented with palpable masses on the right thyroid, isthmus and lateral neck. Subsequently, the patient underwent a bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy and lymphadenectomy. Histological assessment of the surgical thyroid specimens and the neck lymph nodes revealed multiple carcinoma foci.

The patient had no past history of cancer or surgery. He was an ex-smoker (40 pack/year), and worked as a screenwriter and photographer. He had no history of asbestos exposure. He was initially treated with antibiotics, and his symptoms were resolved. However, due to persistent abnormal chest X-ray findings, a CT scan of the chest was carried out revealing a 5 cm \u00d7 4 cm paraspinal mass in the upper right chest, which was also intensely hypermetabolic on a corresponding positron emission tomography scan without evidence of lymph node metastasis. No pleural effusion was detected []. A radiologic differential diagnosis included a posterior mediastinal neurogenic tumor and a metastatic carcinoma. Because the mass was located adjacent to the esophagus, an esophagogastroscopy was arranged to rule out esophageal cancer, and this was normal. A magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and a bone scan were negative. Laboratory studies were all within the normal range. The mass was aspirated under CT guidance using coaxial technique and a 22-gauge needle. Air-dried and alcohol fixed smears were stained with Romanowsky and Papanicolaou method.
