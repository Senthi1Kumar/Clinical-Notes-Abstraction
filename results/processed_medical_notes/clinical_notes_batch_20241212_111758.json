Gastroduodenal endoscopy with biopsies identified an adenocarcinoma of the second part of the duodenum. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a huge duodenal mass of 7 cm in size developed from the second part of the duodenum, close to the anterior wall of the IVC, without extension to other major vessels (e.g. coeliac, hepatic or superior mesenteric artery) or metastases (Fig. ). After discussion in a multidisciplinary digestive cancer board meeting at our institution, she was planned for a pancreaticoduodenectomy.\nThe patient underwent a bi-subcostal laparotomy. A Kocher maneuver was not possible because of strong adhesions between the tumor and the anterior wall of the IVC. In order to ensure adequate resection margins, we performed a pancreaticoduodenectomy with en-bloc resection of a 3 cm\u00b2 area of the anterior wall of the IVC (Fig. A), after total clamping of the right and the left renal veins, and of the IVC from either side of the involved area. Direct suture of the IVC was not possible. We decided not to use a prosthetic graft for the venous reconstruction because of the risk of infection regarding the high rate of infectious complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy, particularly in case of soft pancreas texture. Thus, since the posterior wall of the IVC is usually more floppy than the anterior one because of its higher distance from the renal veins, we harvested a transversal patch of 20 \u00d7 30 mm in size from the posterior wall of the IVC, below the confluence with the renal veins (Fig. B).

In the past, she had sustained severe gastroenteritis (30 years ago) for which she was transfused 2 units of blood. She developed jaundice 25 years ago which responded to medical management. Since 6 years, she had progressive dysphagia to liquids and solids associated with weight loss and nocturnal cough. She underwent oesophageal manometry and upper GI endoscopy 2 years ago and was diagnosed to have achalasia cardia. Apart from classical findings of dilated oesophagus and narrowing at the gastro-oesophageal (GE) junction, endoscopy revealed the presence of three columns of grade I-II varices. She had no history of GI bleed. During the same time, she was also detected to have hepatitis C with high viral load and was treated with interferon decreasing her viral load.\nShe received botulinum toxin injection for treatment of achalasia cardia, but had recurrence of symptoms of dysphagia within few months of the injection.

She denied the other medical history, except for hypertension, which she had controlled well by pills. Her physical examination was normal, except for a tracheal shift. Doppler ultrasound on the neck revealed bilateral thyroid nodules and a substantive bump at the entrance of the thorax. Chest radiograph showed a tracheal shift (Fig. ). Enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck noted a large substantive mass below the right lower pole of the thyroid with calcification, and two lobes of the thyroid both had nodules without any hint of lymph nodes (Fig. ). Core needle biopsy and immunohistochemistry revealed papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).\nThe positron emission tomography-computed tomography (Fig. ) indicated that the lump from the thoracic inlet area to upper mediastinum had high metabolism, and malignant neoplasm should be considered. Moreover, the tumor, along with surrounding invasion, caused the trachea to migrate to the left. However, the metabolic image of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes increased mildly, which was non-specific. Both sides of the thyroid might also favor nodular goiter. Laryngoscopy showed right vocal cord paralysis. The bronchoscopy and cytopathology of the brush fluid were normal (Fig. ). The tumor mark and thyroid function tests were almost normal.\nAfter all the examinations, we still had no idea whether the mass metastasized to the substernum or originated there. We opted to diagnose after excision. During operation, we found multiple nodules in both sides of the thyroid, as well as the mass, which was right behind the sternum, outside of the trachea and inside of the right carotid artery.

Initial evaluation showed best-corrected visual acuity was 30/60 in his right eye, with an intraocular pressure that was within the normal range. He has been receiving anti-VEGF treatment for age-related macular degeneration over the past 5 years. For the tumor, he underwent conjunctival tumor resection and amnion transplantation without mitomycin C in his right eye. The patient was then started on a topical treatment that consisted of 0.5% levofloxacin and 0.1% betamethasone four times daily. The postoperative course had been good until a scleral ulcer emerged at a nasal ischemic necrotizing lesion 4 months later (2 months after stopping the local steroid drop treatment). The postoperative examination at 4 months showed that scleral melting to the uvea had occurred on the center of the tumor-resected sclera. The conjunctival graft was avascular with the presence of ocular pain (Fig. ). Anterior slit-lamp examination revealed that there were no remarkable \ufb01ndings in the eye. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that there was no orbital lesion. After diagnosing SINS, 0.1% betamethasone was immediately restarted four times daily, preparing for an urgent scleral patch transplant surgery. The peripheral conjunctiva contact with the melting site was removed, and free conjunctival autograft transplantation was also performed. Histopathological analysis of the removed conjunctiva led to the current diagnosis and subsequent pathological search. After 2 weeks, there was complete and rapid regression of the scleral melting (Fig. ).

He recognized these fears as irrational, intrusive, causing irritability and extreme anxiety. He also tried to resist his urge to go to the administrative office of his previous employment and check the records. He was afraid he may give in to these urges that could cause public humiliation as he knew they were irrational fears and records would be in order. He was also unable to concentrate on his work and suffered from initiation phase insomnia.\nPatient was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder predominantly obsessions.

In addition, an abdominal physical examination disclosed no positive findings.\nAfter admission, we conducted a routine form of laboratory test and found all data were within normal limits except for a remarkably increased level of fasting blood glucose (11.79 mmol/L). Abdominal enhanced computer tomography (CT) showed a 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 cm round-like, slightly hyperdense mass lesion in the lower pole of right kidney with inhomogeneous enhancement (Fig. ). There was no sign of organ infiltration and distant metastasis. No abnormalities were revealed from electrocardiogram examination as well as chest x-ray. Thus, taken together with the result of physical examination, imaging findings, and related laboratory test, a clinical diagnosis of right renal tumor was made.

    "original_text": "A 15-year-old Caucasian female presented with an intra-articular fracture and adjacent laceration at the distal portion of the proximal phalanx of the thumb resulting in near complete loss of the interphalangeal joint (Figures and ). The injury was incurred from a table saw accident. The patient had an initial pain level of 4/10 and was unable to flex her thumb. The patient and her family were offered a joint arthrodesis for joint stability, but they did not desire a fusion. The patient felt a fusion would limit activities important to her such as texting, playing video games, and applying cosmetics. Joint replacement was offered to the patient as an alternative treatment. In the present case, an HUD was utilized in an off-label manner and inserted into the interphalangeal joint of the patient's thumb. The patient and family were counseled that this was not a standard treatment option and that if fusion was needed in the future, it could be more complicated and require bone grafting compared to using fusion as the initial alternative.\nThe patient was followed for 22 months postoperatively and has remained happy with her choice of procedure. The patient's motion in the thumb IP joint is currently a 40 degree arc which is very reasonable given the repair of the flexor pollicis longus tendon and collateral ligament as well. There was excellent range of motion (ROM) in the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP) which is comparable to the contralateral side. Radiographs demonstrated good seating of the joint implant with no evidence of loosening or periprosthetic fracture (Figures and ). The collateral ligaments were all stable at the IP joint, and the scar on the left volar thumb was well-healed. The patient reported pain of 0/10 at her most recent follow-up and recorded a DASH score of 6.82. No known complications have arisen as a result of the surgical reconstruction to this point in time.",

    "original_text": "Case 1- A 15-year-old female patient presented to our clinic in July 2016 with right ankle pain and walking disability. The patient had a history of ankle trauma in her childhood treated with a plaster cast. Her family stated that her ankle joint had a normal function and they did not see any deformities in her ankle before the trauma. She was able to perform plantigrade bearing but had some pain during walking on uneven ground. Moderate varus deformity, 15\u00b0 limitation of dorsiflexion in ankle, and also decreased subtalar foot eversion were detected during physical examination. Standing bilateral, full-length, weight-bearing radiographs were obtained to evaluate potential limb length discrepancies and deformities of the hip, knee, femur, and foot. Radiological examination revealed that the right tibia was 15 mm smaller than left and both femurs were equal. Medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) and lateral distal tibial angle (LDTA) measurements were made by taking the midline of the tibia collinearly. In the radiographs, no diaphyseal deformities were detected; on the other hand, a deformity was found in the joint line. Her ankle varus deformity was moderate with the lateral distal femoral angle of 105\u00b0 varus angle. Also, sagittal plane deformity was detected. Her ankle anterior distal tibial angle (ADTA) was 70\u00b0 (Figure 1). A written informed consent was obtained from the legal guardian of the patient.\nBased on the medical history and radiographs of the patient, we concluded that the right ankle varus deformity was attributable to the physeal disturbance in childhood. The increased varus deformity may have caused overload into the lateral aspect of the ankle joint, leading to pain. First, the patient underwent conservative treatment with a foot orthosis and physical therapy for three months. After this period, patient\u2019s complaints did not change and realignment ankle surgery was planned. For surgery, multiple corrections with external fixator were planned because of multiplane deformities and length discrepancy.",

The patient was free of systemic diseases and was not receiving any medication. He also did not have a story of allergy. The patient apparently represented physical means of Crouzon syndrome like craniosynostosis, involving high and widened forehead, parrot like nose, deep V shaped maxillary arch, proptosis of the eyes, abundant, and thick dark hair, and as the most distinct feature anteroposterior flattening of the cranium [Figures and ].\nDental history revealed that both primary and permanent dentitions were complete initially but a removable partial denture was fabricated at the age of 10 due to early tooth loss caused by severe periodontal destruction. Unfortunately, the patient had not used the dentures as he could not have adopted himself to it.\nThe patient's main expectation was to improve the reduced chewing ability, which was caused by excessive number of tooth loss. There were a total of 14 remaining teeth, 8 in the maxilla and 6 in the mandible, most of which were malpositioned and periodontally involved [Figures and ]. The probing depths of most teeth were 2 to 3 mm, which was 7 mm in the mesial sight of the maxillary right first molar, 5 mm in the mesial sight of the second left incisor, 4 mm in the maxillary left canine and the mandibular left first molar. The overall periodontal situation was associated with poor oral hygiene. Right maxillary first molar, left maxillary first incisor, both mandibular first incisors, and right mandibular first molar teeth exhibited a mobility of mod 1 according to Miller's index.

She underwent an elective classical caesarean section and sterilization at 36 weeks of gestation, where placenta percreta with bladder involvement was confirmed. Surgical details and immediate recovery were similar to case 1. Intraoperative blood loss was approximately 300 mL. She was discharged from the ward on postpartum day 10 with a plan of regular follow-up as in previous cases (). On the 42nd postpartum day, she experienced profuse vaginal bleeding. This was not preceded by fever, abdominal pain, or vaginal discharge. On admission, she was pale and afebrile, had a pulse rate of 120 beats/min, and her blood pressure was 90/50 mmHg. The abdomen was soft and nontender, and the uterus was not palpable abdominally. Vaginal examination revealed continuous bleeding, without passage of placental parts. Her hemoglobin was 6.1 g/dL, and the platelet count was 60 \u00d7 109/L. Emergency laparotomy was performed with a midline incision. The uterus was 10 weeks in size, and the ovaries appeared normal. Placental invasion into the bladder from the left side of the uterus was noted. Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral internal artery ligation were done by a team composed of an obstetrician, a general surgeon, and a urologist. During the surgery, four units of crossmatched blood, two units of uncrossmatched group-specific blood, two pools of platelets, one pool of fresh frozen plasma, and twelve pools of cryoprecipitate were transfused using guided thromboelastometry, under the supervision of the transfusion medicine specialist.

There were no other associated symptoms such as radiation of pain nor lower limb weakness, and there was no reported history of trauma or heavy weight lifting. She was referred to general surgical clinic for suspicion of inguinal hernia as a mass was felt over right groin by the patient. However, upon physical examination there was no cough impulse nor inguinal mass was found. In view of the atypical presentation of \u201cinguinal hernia\u201d, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in August 2013. In view of suspicion of pathology originating from the round ligament, MRI would be ideal for soft tissue differentiation. A mass of 3.2 cm \u00d7 0.8 cm in size was found in right groin area, which was in the right inguinal canal and originated from the muscle of the posterior wall. It was isointense T1-weighted and hyperintense in T2-weighted images. The initial diagnosis was a \u201cround ligament cyst\u201d and she was initially managed conservatively with painkillers. In view of persistent pain, another set of MRI was performed 3 years later and it showed that the \u201ccyst\u201d was actually a solid mass with complete encapsulation. The size of the mass has increased from 3.2 cm \u00d7 0.8 cm to 5.2 cm \u00d7 3.8 cm over the 3 years. Differential diagnoses included round ligament cystic lesion, soft tissue tumors and hemangioma (Fig. ).\nAfter discussion of pros and cons of surgical intervention, operation was arranged and inguinal canal was explored by open approach under general anesthesia.

He did not improve, so he was transferred to the pain clinic. He received lumbar 4/5 laminectomy and discectomy three months ago, and he had no systemic diseases like hypertension or diabetes. Since then he complained of postherpetic neuralgic symptoms such as spontaneous pain, allodynia, and hyperalgesia. On the fourth day of his hospitalization, he complained of right lower back pain around the region of spinal surgery but with no radicular pain to the lower limb, so we performed a lumbar epidural block.\nAfter he took a right decubitus position, axenic disinfection and local infiltration with 2% lidocaine on the region for the procedure were done. We conducted a lumbar epidural block at the lumbar 4/5 interspace with a 20 G Tuohy needle via the median approach. After the loss of resistance using air we confirmed that CSF had not been aspirated before the local anesthetic injection. We injected 0.125% bupivacaine 10 ml with triamcinolone 40 mg. The patient took a rest on the bed for about 30 minutes. He did not show specific symptoms immediately like dizziness, nausea, or vomiting. The patient moved to his room on foot. While walking for about five minutes, he lost consciousness suddenly in front of the elevator near his room. Immediately, we ventilated him manually via facial mask with 100% O2.

The covering mucosa in this area was normal. The third mandibular molar was clinical crown absence. The second mandibular molar was a sound tooth with no mobility. Extra-oral examination showed only a slight facial asymmetry with a left facial enlargement. The cervical lymph nodes were within normal limit by manual examination. Radiographic findings demonstrated a well-defined, unilocular radiolucent lesion measuring 2.5x3.4 cm. associated with an unerupted third molar (Fig. ). The internal structure showed radiopaque materials at the anterior portion. Bone expansions were noted. Root resorption was unremarkable.\nA provisional diagnosis was a calcifying odontogenic cyst. Under local anesthesia, an incisional biopsy was performed at the distal area to the second mandibular molar. Microscopic examination of the specimen showed many spindle-shaped cells in a loose myxoid stroma. The histopathological diagnosis of odontogenic myxoma was made. Due to the histopathological result of odontogenic myxoma and the inadequate of the bone, partial mandibulectomy with iliac bone graft was performed. Then, the specimen was sent for microscopic examination.\nThe received specimen was a part of the left mandible extending from the mesial aspect of the second mandibular molar to the ramus. A crown of the second mandibular molar was present in the specimen. Because the entire tumor was inside the mandible, the specimen was decalcified for a few days before cutting. The cut surface of a tumor showed a well- circumscribed multilobulated, whitish solid mass that was easily separated from the surrounding bone",

She had been taking vitamin K antagonists, which were switched to low-molecular-weight heparin, and she was treated with magnesium sulfate and intravenous antihypertensive drugs. A primary caesarean section under general anaesthesia was performed at 30 weeks of pregnancy due to fetal distress, delivering a growth-restricted, premature girl of 920 g. Postsurgery the mother developed severe postpartum haemorrhage with a total of 5000 mL blood loss, and treatment was complicated by her anticoagulation therapy. She received blood transfusions and was discharged from the hospital with a haemoglobin level of 77.3 g/L. Three days later she was readmitted with complaints of fatigue, severe dyspnoea and fever. She had pleural effusion and thrombocytopaenia. She was later transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) due to deterioration of her condition, and echocardiographic examination revealed severe left ventricular dysfunction with mild dilatation of the ventricles. ECG showed a sinus tachycardia with low voltages in the extremity leads and a QS pattern in V1\u2013V3 (). Coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries and she was diagnosed with PPCM. She soon went into cardiogenic shock with high lactate levels, and when high dosages of inotropes could not stabilise her extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was started. Heart failure medication was started, which stabilised her condition, and after 15 days the ECMO could be removed. ECMO was complicated by cannula-related severe ischaemia of her right foot, which had to be amputated. She was transferred to a rehabilitation clinic after hospital discharge.\nBecause of the combination of multiple venous emboli, pre-eclampsia with proteinuria, pleural effusion and the thrombocytopaenia, the patient was referred to an immunologist, who diagnosed her with antiphospholipid syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).",

    "original_text": "Two years prior to presentation to our hospital, an 11-year-old girl recognized that her left patella was dislocated with a 'giving way' when cutting to the left. She was capable of repositioning it by herself and saw an orthopedic surgeon who did not point out any skeletal abnormalities on plain X-ray. After 1 year had passed, her father noticed that her knee looked odd; however, it was again diagnosed as intact by another surgeon. Since the deformity gradually became apparent, she was referred to our hospital. Although her body height and weight belonged to the lower 10th percentile, she did not have any associated anomalies that present with patellar instability, such as Down syndrome [] or Kabuki make-up syndrome [,]. She also denied any history of injections into the quadriceps muscle.\nPhysical examination did not reveal general joint laxity or macroscopically apparent malalignment of the lower extremity. Although the patella was in the femoral trochlear groove in extension, it laterally dislocated with the knee in flexion beyond 45\u00b0 (Figure ). She complained slight discomfort by an apprehension test. The passive lateral patellar tilt test was negative since the soft tissue attachment to the lateral border of the patella was diffusely stiff and tight, but no cord-like band was palpable.

She reported that the headache started about 4 weeks before and it was intermittent at first but became constant 7 days prior to admission. She described the headache as pressure-like pain at the occipital regions bilaterally radiating to the vertex. Her headaches were associated with intermittent bilateral ear pain. She denied any focal weakness, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia. Aggravating factors for the headache included staring at the computer screen at work. She tried over-the-counter anti-inflammatories along with baclofen which helped initially. She denied any recent travel outside the US, had no recent sick contacts, reported infrequent alcohol use, and denied any toxic habits such as smoking and illicit drug use. She had no previous history of similar headaches personally or a family history of headaches. Physical examination, including a detailed neurologic examination, was within normal limits.\nOf note, eight months prior to her presentation for evaluation of her headache, she had an episode of acute word-finding difficulties. She presented to our hospital and was admitted for a workup of suspected ischemic stroke. A brain MRI showed a focal T2 hyperintensity within the posterior left temporal lobe assumed to be due to an acute ischemic stroke. She was admitted and further workup was unrevealing of the etiology of her suspected ischemic stroke. As an outpatient, a repeat brain MRI one month after hospitalization showed resolution of this left temporal lesion.

His symptoms began after an acute traumatic injury to the left lateral knee, in which he suffered a small cut with a break in the skin. Before the injury, the patient was asymptomatic and denied any pain, bleeding, or skin breakdown to the bilateral knees. On physical examination, the patient had a large, tennis ball-sized mass over his left knee anterior to the patella and patellar tendon, with a second irregularly shaped firm mass inferior to this (). There were multiple areas of skin breakdown over the large mass overlying the patient\u2019s left knee, which was draining purulent and sanguineous fluid that appeared to be gouty tophaceous material. There was no surrounding erythema. Over the right anterior knee, there were two large, firm masses (). The superior mass was tennis ball sized and the inferior mass was smaller and irregularly shaped. There was thinning of the overlying skin, which remained intact. He denied any pain to the right knee. The patient\u2019s examination was also remarkable for a 3\u00d73 cm, firm, mobile, non-tender, soft tissue mass over the proximal right olecranon. He denied any pain or limited range of motion or function secondary to this mass. His medical history consisted of gout, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia. The patient reported a distant history of a similar mass being resected from his right knee. His surgical history also included removal of the left knee bursa and carpal tunnel release.

She also reported pain in her left knee and left lower back. Relevant history included a left hip arthrodesis following a vehicle accident approximately 40 years prior. Examination revealed that the patient was able to ambulate very short distances with assistance of a single-point cane and used a scooter for travelling longer distances. When ambulating, the patient did so with an antalgic gait. Conservative pain management for the current presentation had included steroid and local anaesthetic injections in the right hip. Physical examination found that the left hip had no range of motion due to arthrodesis, and no apparent strength of the abductors. While LLD was difficult to accurately assess due to a fixed flexion deformation of the left hip, a valgus deformity in the right knee, severe pelvic obliquity and degenerative scoliosis, the left leg was grossly estimated to be 10-15 mm shorter than the right. No neurologic deficit was present.\nPre-operative radiographs (Figure ) revealed a left-sided hip arthrodesis with the hardware securely in place. Significant pelvic obliquity was also noted on imaging, which further revealed advanced degenerative scoliosis in the lumbar spine and osteoarthritis of the right hip, with a loss of joint space superiorly. While right hip arthroplasty was deemed necessary, it was advised that conversion of the left hip fusion to THA should be completed prior, to optimise the outcome of the right hip THA.

At that time, treatment including endoscopic removal of the bamboo splinters and closure of the wound was performed. On physical examination, an indistinct scar was observed in the right perianal area and the wound was clean. Laboratory examination revealed copious red and white blood cells in the urine; the urine culture grew no organisms. Plain X-ray and intravenous pyelography showed distortion of the bladder and normal urine drainage in both ureters (), and abdominal sonography showed a perivesical mass on the right lateral bladder wall. Under general anesthesia, transurethral cystoscopy showed erythema and ulceration of the right lateral bladder mucosa with a foreign body embedded in granulation tissue ().

She was taken to the operating room for bone biopsy/culture and operative cultures grew Enterococcus in broth. She subsequently returned to the operating room for resection of the most distal 19 cm of the femur. Intraoperatively, purulent exudate was noted in the knee and along the hardware. Her remaining proximal femur and tibia were reamed and a 12.5 \u00d7 700 mm Smith and Nephew intramedullary nail was placed.

Although he felt pain in the abdomen at the time of ESWL, he paid little attention to it. Five days later, his abdominal pain had worsened and he was admitted to the emergency department. Physical examination showed significant tenderness of the abdomen and high blood pressure of 176/105 mmHg. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a contained rupture of the abdominal aorta with a retroperitoneal hematoma (33 \u00d7 25 mm) around the periaortic area. More remarkably, a disruptive calcified plaque was found at the level between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae (). The patient reported that his medical history included smoking, hypertension, and diabetes. Liver function, renal function, lipid and blood parameters, and other routine laboratory examination findings were within the reference range.\nPreoperative CT angiography demonstrated normal morphology of the abdominal aorta, renal artery, and superior mesenteric artery. Based on the patient\u2019s history and CT results, we suspected rupture of the abdominal aorta after ESWL. We identified the contained rupture, which was essentially a pseudoaneurysm of the abdominal aorta. The size of the hematoma was 33 \u00d7 25 mm (). Considering the risk of mortality associated with a ruptured abdominal aorta, we performed endovascular aortic repair. Preoperative preparation included strict bed rest and control of the blood pressure to less than 130/80 mmHg. The surgery was performed in the digital subtraction angiography room under general anesthesia. Open femoral exposure was performed, and a pigtail catheter was inserted to the aorta. Aortic angiography showed the location of the aortic lesions.

An extraoral examination upon initial presentation revealed unremarkable findings and no complaints of paresthesia. An intraoral examination also confirmed the absence of redness and tender swelling of the left mandibular mucosa (). Panoramic radiography revealed an extensive multilocular radiolucent area with imprecise borders and a \u201csoap bubble appearance\u201d (). Computed tomography showed an approximately 39 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 11 mm tumor that extended to the roots of four teeth (#33 - 36; Figures and ). We considered that the odontogenic tumor was benign and an incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia. The histopathological findings revealed loosely arranged spindle-shaped cells in a myxoid fibrous stroma, indicating a clinical diagnosis of an odontogenic tumor. Segmental resection of the mandible was planned. The patient was given repeated and careful explanations about the high likelihood of recurrence, but he insisted upon a more conservative approach as he desired functional and cosmetic preservation. Conservative surgery then proceeded under general anesthesia after endodontic treatment of #33 \u2013 36 was completed. The surgery consisted of extracting the second premolar from the left mandible, followed by total enucleation and vigorous curettage of the bone (). The surgical specimen () revealed apparently benign, spindled-shaped cells in a loose and abundant mucoid stroma (Figures and ). These findings confirmed the diagnosis of odontogenic myxoma.
