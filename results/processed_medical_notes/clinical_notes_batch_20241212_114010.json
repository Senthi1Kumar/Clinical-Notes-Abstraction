She had pain, deformity and restriction of movements of her right shoulder joint. She also complained of right chest pain. There was no significant past medical history and she was not on any oral anticoagulants.\nOn examination, there was deformity consistent with dislocation of the right shoulder. Movements of the right shoulder were restricted due to pain. The radial pulse was present and there was no distal neurovascular deficit. Radiograph revealed anterior dislocation of the right shoulder with comminuted fracture of the greater tuberosity (). Chest radiograph revealed fractures of 2nd, 3rd and 4th ribs on the right side. The haemoglobin level was 12gm/dl.\nAfter resuscitation, the patient`s right shoulder was reduced with closed manipulation under sedation and Entonox inhalation, confirmed with check post-reduction radiograph, with greater tuberosity fragment mildly displaced (). Examination of the right upper extremity after reduction revealed intact radial artery pulse and evidence of posterior cord palsy of the brachial plexus. The patient was transferred to high dependency unit (HDU) for monitoring and observation.\nAfter six hours of admission to HDU, the patient\u2019s haemoglobin level continued to drop steadily, and she was transfused with six units of blood over a period of ten hours. The radial artery pulse was present throughout this time. However, there was continuous drop of blood pressure and haemoglobin level despite aggressive resuscitation.

There was associated mild tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension. An angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries. Left ventricular (LV) systolic function was preserved with an ejection fraction of 55%. The patient was planned for MVR. His routine blood investigations demonstrated increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels to 345 IU/L (normal LDH range: 100\u2013190 IU/L), but haemoglobin level, serum bilirubin, liver enzymes, and coagulation profile were normal. During blood grouping and cross matching, altered clotting response was detected at 37\u00b0C that led to the suspicion of presence of CAs. An immediate haematology consultation was obtained and the baseline CA titer was found elevated (1:1024 at 4\u00b0C) with a high thermal amplitude of 30\u00b0C. Oral prednisolone was prescribed at a dose of 60 mg once daily for 1 month and CA titers were repeated periodically, as shown in . The patient was taken up for surgery after confirming CA titers of less than 1:16 at 30\u00b0C. He underwent uneventful balanced general endotracheal anaesthesia. Comprehensive haemodynamic monitoring included a radial arterial catheter, a central venous triple lumen catheter, and transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE). Intraoperatively, intensive temperature monitoring was done and all necessary precautions were taken to avoid exposure to the active temperature range of CAs. Intravenous fluids and irrigation fluids were warmed before administration. The inhalational gas supplied to the patient was set at 37\u00b0C using a heated circuit. Lower body thermal blanket and higher operation theatre temperature helped to maintain the core temperature above 34\u00b0C. The patient was anticoagulated with heparin to achieve activated clotting time (ACT) of more than 480 s. Warm crystalloid fluid was used to prime the CPB circuit and warm blood cardioplegia was delivered through aortic root to sustain electromechanical silence while targeting the myocardial temperature",

On presentation physical examination was notable for altered level of consciousness and mild symmetrical decrease in power of 4/5 in all four limbs. Laboratory workup including complete blood count, electrolytes, coagulation panel, lipid profile, urine, and serum drug screen was unremarkable. CT scan head revealed a 1.5 cm left temporoparietal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema as shown in (). As part of the diagnostic workup, an ECG was also performed on admission which was normal. The patient was admitted to the neurointensive care unit (NICU) for further management. A computerized tomography angiogram was performed, which showed early draining veins at the site of the lesion, suspicious for an underlying vascular malformation. Subsequently a cerebral angiogram was performed which confirmed the presence of an AVM underlying the hemorrhage (). A partial embolization of the AVM was performed, and the patient was boarded for surgical resection ().\nOn day 3 of admission, the patient complained of sudden-onset chest pain.

Because the ascending aorta was unsuitable for arterial cannulation, the surgeon elected to perform axillary cannulation via the right subclavian artery with side graft anastomosis. The patient arrived to the operating room (OR) with nicardipine and esmolol infusions running through an 18-gauge peripheral intravenous (IV) line in the right antecubital (AC) fossa. Prior to induction of anesthesia, we disconnected the infusions from the right AC and administered medications though an 18-gauge IV in the left forearm. The patient also had a left radial arterial line (AL), and we placed the pulse oximeter and noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) cuff on the RUE. After intubation, we placed a right radial AL, and the surgeons placed a left femoral AL. All arterial pressures correlated closely. Additionally, a 9-French central line was placed in the right internal jugular vein. The patient was cleansed and draped for surgery with her arms tucked to her sides.\nShortly after the procedure began, the right radial AL tracing went flat, and the pulse oximeter waveform was lost. We attributed this to the surgeon partially clamping the right subclavian artery in preparation for arterial cannulation. We switched the pulse oximeter to the left hand and relied on the left radial and femoral AL for pressure readings. Just prior to arterial cannulation, we noted that the right radial pressure returned, although about 20 points lower than the left radial/femoral. Immediately after initiating CPB, the right radial mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased to 200 mm Hg, and left radial/femoral MAP decreased from 60 to 30 mmHg.

Clinical examination revealed a convergent strabismus fixus with severe hypotropia of both eyes (Fig. ). The patient complained of increasing loss of eyesight and heavy retrobulbar pain. Visual acuity had deteriorated significantly from 0.6/0.5 to 0.1/0.1 within 3 months. A contrast enhanced orbital MRI scan showed distinct swelling of all extraocular muscles with bilateral compression of the optic nerve (Fig. ). There was no history of comorbidities except nicotine abuse. Laboratory tests showed a euthyroid biochemical status with TSH within the normal range, but elevated levels of Anti-Thyroid Peroxidase Antibody, Anti-Thyroglobulin Antibody and Thyroid Receptor Antibody. The patient\u2019s daily medication comprised of 200 \u03bcg L-Thyroxin and 200 \u03bcg Selenium. Over many years, the patient had shown only mild to moderate symptoms of GO, but following a thyroidectomy, the symptoms had recently worsened dramatically. Since the disease could not be controlled by high-dose systemic glucocorticoid therapy, bilateral three wall orbital decompression had been performed twice previously. In the first step, the medial orbital wall had been resected via an endonasal approach. Due to ongoing findings as before, two months later partial resection of the orbital floor and fenestration of the lateral orbital wall via a combined transconjunctival/transcaruncular approach with piezosurgery had been performed. In addition, high-dose systemic glucocorticoid therapy was conducted prior to surgery and for the first two months after surgery.

The pain was independent of activities and poorly responded to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and physiotherapy. A physical examination showed a painless palpable mass in the right paraumbilical and lower abdominal region without peripheral neurovascular deficits. Laboratory tests were normal, except for an unspecific, mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Abdominal ultrasound showed a large, encapsulated, oval soft-tissue mass, which was 21 \u00d7 16 cm in diameter in the right retroperitoneum. Subsequent abdominal MRI confirmed a homogenous soft-tissue tumour with a thick, smooth, capsular lining. This tumour lay in the right retroperitoneum paravertebrally and displaced the iliopsoas muscle distally and the right kidney craniolaterally, without any signs of ipsilateral hydronephrosis (). Although the tumour was large, it was considered benign because it was not heterogenous, had no irregular margins, and there were no signs of adjacent organ involvement. Management options were discussed at a staff meeting. We decided not to perform a percutaneous biopsy because of the difficult position of the tumour. Symptom-relieving surgery was decided as the best choice of treatment.\nFollowing preparation, the patient underwent surgery. The encapsulated mass was removed in toto together with its capsular lining, but without definable and clear peripheral nerve encasement or invasion. Identification of the nerve of origin is common, despite complete tumour excision. The procedure was performed without complications and there was no need for blood product substitution. However, extensive bleeding may be encountered from the adjacent vessels.\nA histological examination and immunohistochemical staining confirmed the diagnosis of benign encapsulated cellular schwannoma.

She complained of small nodules in the left parotid region that had developed over the course of 2 years. Her main complaint was of recurring periods of worsened symptoms characterized by the exacerbation and remission of gland volume that was possibly triggered by occasional otolaryngologic infections or unrelated to these infections. These symptoms suggest juvenile recurrent parotitis. Facial panoramic radiography revealed the presence of multiple circular radiopaque masses in the left parotid region (Fig. ). The ultrasound revealed increased volume of the left parotid, with imprecise borders, heterogeneous echotexture with hypoechoic and hyperechoic areas within it. These features were suggestive of an inflammatory process associated with calcifications in the parenchyma of the gland. CT scan revealed a dense mass in the left parotid; it was heterogeneous and included calcifications in its center (Fig. ). Because of the association between the patient\u2019s clinical history, her clinical presentation, and the imaging findings, the possible origin of the calcified materials was questioned. There was evidence of sialoliths or dystrophic calcification associated with recurrent inflammation/infection. Sialoliths are typically symptomatic because of their association with secondary bacterial infections, which are generally treated with systemic antibiotic therapy. Spontaneous remission of bacterial sialadenitis associated with sialoliths is not expected. In addition, sialoliths generally observed as oval-shaped calcified masses or fusiforms on imaging. Because of the pediatric nature of this case, the clinical conduct selected to treat this patient was clinical follow-up and the use of imaging and functional assessments of the gland affected every 6 months or when any signs and/or symptoms appeared. After 48 months, the patient is asymptomatic, without periods of exacerbation of the condition. Recent ultrasound (Fig. ) demonstrates an improvement in the inflammatory aspect of the gland.

The patient did not initially seek medical consultation. In March 2018, the patient detected a painless enlargement of the mass and sought medical consultation at his local hospital. A breast ultrasonography examination revealed a mass, 23.7 mm \u00d7 7.5 mm in diameter (Fig. ). No abnormality was identified in the left breast. Mammography revealed a well-circumscribed mass of mixed density in the right breast, with no evidence of invasion of the ipsilateral axillary nodes (Fig. ). The patient refused to undergo fine needle aspiration cytology examination. The provisional clinical diagnosis was a lipomyoma or adenoma fibrosum.\nThe patient was referred to our hospital for further assessment, surgical management, and treatment. The patient's history was reviewed. We noted the following characteristics: current smoker (with a long history of smoking); no alcohol consumption; no history of trauma to the region; no history of prior surgery or radiation exposure of the region; and no personal or significant family history of cancer. With no important history identified, the clinical diagnosis of a hamartoma was established. The physical examination revealed a soft, mobile, painless mass located in the right breast, measuring approximately 2 cm in diameter, with no abnormality identified in the left breast. On March 27, 2018, the patient underwent surgical resection of the mass at our hospital. Gross examination of the resected mass revealed an oval, well-defined, and encapsulated mass, with gray-yellow coloring and a smooth margin (Fig. ). The nodule was very soft and had a fibrotic envelope. Pathological examination confirmed",

The patient commented that he had been suffering from similar neck pain for many years prior to the accident.\nAccording to Canadian C-Spine rules and due to the mechanism of the accident radiography of the cervical spine was indicated. Antero-posterior and lateral radiographs as well as 45\u00b0 oblique views of the cervical spine were taken as a first imaging study (Figure ).

In addition, a vertical gap in the midline of the C5 arch was seen on the antero-posterior radiograph. No anterolisthesis of a vertebral body was detected.

He had been implanted a dual chamber ICD (Model 1871, Vitality DR, Guidant Corp.) for secondary prevention due to resuscitated sustained ventricular tachycardia, not related to a correctable cause, in the context of severe ischemic cardiomyopathy. His past medical history was significant for coronary artery disease (old myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass surgery), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's medications included metoprolol, ramipril, glimepiride, aspirin, and simvastatin.\nInterrogation of the stored events revealed that the recent episode of shock was an appropriate defibrillation (21 J biphasic shock) of ventricular arrhythmia (cycle length 330 ms) that classified into the VF zone. However, electrocardiographic examination and evaluation of the current electrograms revealed the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) with a ventricular response of 84 beats/min (Figures , ). The duration of AF was unknown while no event of inappropriate shock attributed to AF was detected. All hematological and biochemical studies including thyroid function tests were within normal limits. An echocardiographic study showed left ventricular (LV) dilatation with global systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction: 0.20) and evidence of increased filling pressures. The left atrial (LA) anteroposterior diameter was 41 mm and the LA diastolic volume 36 ml.\nTaking into account the severely impaired left ventricular systolic function as well as the absence of LA enlargement we decided to follow a rhythm control strategy. Therefore, the patient was placed on appropriate anticoagulation therapy for 4 weeks and scheduled for cardioversion. He was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit and placed to electrocardiographic, non-invasive hemodynamic, and respiratory monitoring. After performing mild sedation with midazolam, the patient's ICD was externally programmed to deliver an R-wave synchronized ventricular biphasic shock of 31 J. The cardioversion was successful with immediate restoration of sinus rhythm (Figure",

In October 2006, he underwent a pelvic ultrasonography (US) because he presented a \"pressure sensation\" in the rectum and rectal imperiosity for four weeks. Physical examination revealed no additional symptom, except the rectal examination that detected a 4-cm hard pre-rectal mass filling the right side of the pelvis. The WHO performance status was equal to 0. Ultrasonography (US) discovered a tumour located at the right side of the pelvis. Serum prostate-specific antigen levels were normal. The patient was thus referred to hospital.\nComputed tomography (CT) of abdomen and pelvis revealed an 8-cm heterogeneous tumour predominantly located on the right side of the pelvis likely arising from the right seminal vesicle, reaching the median line and adherenting to the posterior bladder wall and the anterior rectal wall. Due to the rectal clinical symptoms and the suspicion of rectal adherence on CT scan, the core needle biopsy was CT-guided transperineal rather than transrectal. Pathological analysis revealed a well-differentiated leiomyosarcoma. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of a mass centred on the right seminal vesicle, causing mass effect on the prostate and left seminal vesicle, without a cleavage plane with the right prostate and the right obturator muscle, suggesting invasion (Figure ). Otherwise, MRI clearly showed fat interface between the mass, the posterior bladder wall and the anterior rectal wall without any sign of involvement. Complete clinical and radiological screening did not detect any lymphadenopathy or distant metastasis. Based on these data, the tumor was considered completely resectable, and surgery was decided.\nBefore surgery, the examination under general anesthesia revealed that the mass was difficult to mobilize.

Four days prior to presentation, he sustained a pencil scratch trauma to the right oropharynx secondary to a fall on the bed whilst playing with a pencil in his mouth. He bled moderately and was taken to nearby emergency room where the bleeding stopped spontaneously. Examination at that time showed minor superficial mucosa trauma. The parents were reassured, and the patient was discharged home on Tylenol for pain. He drooled for a few hours but returned to baseline activity level on the same day. Three days later, he complained of right-sided neck pain associated with reduced oral intake. The parents noticed right-sided jaw fullness and swelling. He was sent to emergency room the next day upon the recommendation of his pediatrician. In the emergency department, he looked unwell with fever of 38.9\u00b0C, right neck and jaw swelling with multiple right cervical lymphadenopathy, the largest measuring 3 cm, with overlying erythema. He also resisted neck movements due to pain. The rest of the examination of oropharynx, ears, and nose as well as other systems were within normal limit.\nComplete blood count showed white cell count of 13,000/mm3, with 84% neutrophils and 10% bands. However, blood culture was negative. Soft tissue radiograph showed asymmetric right neck swelling, deviation of airway to the left, without evidence of a foreign body. Computerized tomography [CT] scan of neck showed a lesion with air-fluid interface, consistent with an abscess, in the right parapharyngeal space with surrounding inflammatory changes. The inflammation extended into the parotid gland, carotid sheath, the masticator muscles, as well as the retropharyngeal space, with mild mass effect noted on the airway. The upper part of internal jugular vein could not be visualized, possibly due to compression or thrombosis of upper third of the internal jugular vein. Further imaging",

The patient did not consent to knee arthroplasty or arthroscopic joint debridement and, since she suffered from type 2 diabetes, numerous glucocorticoid injections made the patient\u2019s blood glucose level difficult to control. Taking into consideration all available therapeutic options, the patient was referred for RSV as a supportive treatment.\nUnder US guidance, the suprapatellar recess of the right knee joint was punctured from the lateral approach. Approximately 40 ml of clear, yellowish fluid was evacuated, and 185 MBq of colloidal yttrium-90 (90Y) citrate was injected followed by 2 ml of sterile saline to flush the residual radiopharmaceutical from the needle. A sterile dressing was applied, the knee was immobilized, and the patient was advised not to walk or stand for at least 48 hours in order to minimize the risk of radioactive leakage. Thirty minutes after RSV, post-therapeutic positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with 90Y was performed (Biograph 64, Siemens) [], showing diffuse distribution of the radiopharmaceutical in the suprapatellar recess and medial knee compartment, with no evident extra-articular radioactivity ().\nDuring the follow-up visit after 4 weeks, the patient complained of a draining sinus with discharge of yellowish, turbid fluid and tender erythema at the site of the joint puncture (). US examination revealed that the sinus canal was 8 mm deep and was surrounded by hyperechoic tissue, with an increased power Doppler signal.

Several consecutive attempts to catheterize the LCCA were unsuccessful due to unfavorable trajectories off the aortic arch, at which point it was decided to proceed with an alternative access route.

The primary survey showed decreased air entry on the left side of the chest. All peripheral pulses were palpable and symmetrical on initial presentation.\nChest radiograph showed the left side chest opacification indicating hemothorax []. Thoracostomy was performed with an initial gush 450 ml of dark blood. Pericardial focused assessment with sonography for trauma was equivocal, and chest X-ray demonstrated a failure to fully evacuate the hemothorax.\nThe secondary survey showed superficial left hand, thigh, and leg cut wounds. Pieces of shrapnel were embedded in the left arm, anterior chest, and abdominal wall. He was stabilized and had CT of the brain, cervical spine, chest and abdomen. CT of the brain and cervical spine were normal. CT of the chest revealed fractures of the left first and second ribs. A hyperdense foreign body was seen penetrating the anterior chest wall soft tissue guarded by ribs without deep penetration to the heart []. There was evidence of retrosternal soft tissue hematoma and left-sided hemopneumothorax with underlying pulmonary contusion. Mild hemopericardium with air was seen within the pericardial sac but no significant major vessel injury. The left lateral chest wall and anterior wall surgical emphysema was also seen. CT of the abdomen [] showed pellets within the anterior abdominal wall with related surgical emphysema but no evidence of peritoneal penetration.

The swelling had gradually increased to its size at presentation and was associated with mild physical discomfort. Apart from these findings, there was no significant history as far as the patient's swelling was concerned.\nThe initial examination revealed a cystic, non-mobile, non-tender mass approximately 15 cm \u00d7 15 cm in size attached to the back in the midline in the lumbosacral region. However, the patient's blood counts, urine analysis, and liver function test results were normal.

On the basis of our clinical suspicion of a cystic tumor, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was performed to confirm the diagnosis. The results were positive for a mature cystic teratoma. Accordingly, the patient was prepared for surgery, and MRI was performed to establish the extent of the tumor. MRI of the lumbosacral spine revealed a well-defined lesion in the midline extending to the right gluteal region in the subcutaneous plane from approximately the L3-L4 to the S4 vertebrae and crossing the midline. It was further observed that the tumor was hyperintense on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2-weighted images, which was suggestive of fat contents.

The latest Cesarean section ended up with iatrogenic injury to the apex of the bladder. The defects of the bladder and uterus were repaired separately. The patient was in satisfactory condition when discharged from the department of obstetrics.\nHowever, after three months the patient developed severe abdominal pain at the end of urination associated with scanty periods accompanied by hematuria. On the basis of characteristic symptoms vesicouterine fistula was suspected. This diagnosis was confirmed by cystoscopy. The patient was offered surgery, which she refused. Subsequently, due to resolution of symptoms the patient stopped seeking medical attention, although she periodically suffered from urinary incontinence, menouria, and recurrent infection of lower urinary tract.\nAfter examination the patient was diagnosed with missed abortion of ectopic pregnancy at 11 weeks of gestation localized in the bladder. The fetus in the cavity of the urinary bladder was detected at ultrasound examination (). The vesicouterine fistula was also well visualized.

The examination showed a partial depression in the left front rib and abnormal breathing (see Fig. ).\nAdmission chest CT examination: 1\u20136 rib fractures on the left side (of which 3, 4 ribs are long comminuted fractures (see Fig. )); left pneumothorax, left traumatic wet lung; a small amount of liquid pneumothorax on the left side.\nPatient was given early chest straps, multiparametric monitoring, analgesia, and oxygen therapy. The chest pain was still severe. The visual analogue scale scored 7\u20138 points for the pain at rest and 9 points for the cough.\nPhysical examination revealed that the left chest wall was recessed and abnormally breathed. The CT scan of the rib showed a long comminuted fracture of 3 and 4 ribs. The key to successful operation was the reduction and fixation of these two rib fractures. A preoperative CT scan was performed to reconstruct the 3D model based on the scan results (see Fig. ), and 3D printing technology was used to prepare 3 and 4 rib models (see Fig. ). The three D print models of each fracture segment of the two ribs were adherently reconstructed.\nThe two rib metal plates were separately shaped according to the reconstruction model (see Figs. and ).\nThe patient is scheduled to have a open reduction and internal fixation of 3\u20136 rib fracture.

He had history of occasional holocranial headache for two months. There was no memory or behavioral changes or compromise of school performance. Systemic examination was normal and neurological examination revealed no gross deficit except blurred margins of optic disc. Contrast enhanced CT scan showed large defined isodense mass lesion involving the bithalamic region with continuity in midline. Lateral ventricles were enlarged anteriorly and posteriorly to the mass. There was no enhancement on contrast.\nMR of head showed huge bithalamic lesion, of size about 7 cm \u00d7 7 cm \u00d7 5 cm interconnected with massa intermedia without any gap in between, occupying whole of the third ventricle, except a part anteriorly. It was uniformly isointense on T1 weighted and, hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR weighted images, with no contrast enhancement.\nThere was no restriction to diffusion weighted images. Extent of lesion was up to midbrain, infiltrating bilateral cerebral peduncles reaching to left medial and posterior temporal and medial occipital lobes. Lateral ventricles were dilated with periventricular lucency and no perilesional edema was present [Figures \u2013]. MR spectroscopy (water suppressed proton MRS) of the tumor revealed choline and creatinine peaks with creatinine peak greater than choline peak. The N acetylaspartate signal was decreased. Small lactate peak was also noticed [].\nAs the mass was very bulky and ventricles were also obstructed, a decision to debulk (and not only biopsy) was taken in order to reduce the mass effect in supratentorial compartment.

The asymptomatic lesion was followed for 3 months and demonstrated slight enlargement, leading to suspicion of JXG. She was referred for diagnosis and management.\nOn examination, visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye and intraocular pressures were normal. The only abnormal ocular finding was a minimally pigmented, vascular iris mass, measuring 6.0 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness, located in the nasal aspect of the iris []. Gonioscopy and ultrasound biomicroscopy revealed that the lesion was confined to the iris with no extension or seeding into the angle or ciliary body. Fluorescein angiography revealed intense vascularity confined to the mass and not involving the surrounding normal iris []. Our differential diagnosis included amelanotic iris melanoma versus JXG.\nFNAB was performed for diagnostic purposes. Using an operating microscope, a 27-gauge needle was passed through the clear cornea 1 mm from the limbus and directed into the tumor with aspiration using standard technique.[] Cytopathology revealed atypical cells with spindle morphology, ovoid nuclei, and prominent central nucleoli, which were immunoreactive for melanocytic markers melan-A and HMB45, consistent with spindle B malignant melanoma cells [].\nBased on the cytopathological diagnosis of melanoma, basal sector iridectomy was performed. Histopathology revealed an amelanotic neoplasm, composed predominantly of spindle B melanoma cells and few cells with intermediate morphology between spindle B and epithelioid melanoma. There was one mitotic figure per 40 high-power fields []. There was minimal invasion into the trabecular meshwork and base of the pars plicata. The tumor appeared to be completely removed.

She had no history of previous disease and her psychomotor development was normal. However, 2\u20133 months before admission, the child\u2019s behaviour showed problems with concentration. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) revealed the existence of a large cystic tumour with peripheral calcifications expanding from the sella to the third ventricle area and acute hydrocephalus (Fig. ).\nMagnetic resonance imaging identified a large solid pathological area with fluid accumulation in the sellar and suprasellar region (Fig. ).\nBased on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with a tumour expanding from the sella to the third ventricle, most likely an adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma with concomitant acute occlusive hydrocephalus. The recommended treatment included a right-sided pterional craniotomy with extensive resection of the tumour.\nA deterioration in the patent\u2019s status necessitated immediate surgery with resection of the tumour. A pterional craniotomy was performed on the right side under general anaesthesia with the patient in a supine position. After reaching the base of the brain and evacuation of fluid from basal cisterns, the tumour\u2019s wall was cut, and a thick yellowish fluid was drained. The tumour was separated from the right optic nerve, right ICA, optic chiasm and left optic nerve. Instead of the pituitary stalk, two thin bands were found, extending from the third ventricle and running towards the sella turcica on both sides of the tumour. After separating the tumour from those bands, it was incised slightly above the sellar diaphragm, dissected from the third ventricle wall, along the lamina terminalis, and removed.

The more common causes for his symptoms had been ruled out by pulmonology medicine and video laryngoscopy, which showed left vocal cord paralysis, before our examination. The patient's surgical history included uneventful staged bilateral carotid endarterectomy in 2002. Thoracic computed tomography revealed a 4.3 \u00d7 5.2 \u00d7 5.0 cm saccular thoracic aneurysm in zones 1 through 3 of his aorta (, A and B). Because of the patient's age and multiple comorbidities, including calcific plaque in and near the ostium of all three brachiocephalic vessels, open debranching was not considered; rather, a staged hybrid repair was selected.\nThe initial procedure was a right-to-left carotid\u2013carotid bypass performed via a retroesophageal route using a 6-mm ringed polytetrafluoroethylene graft. This was followed by ligation of the proximal left common carotid artery. Scarring from the patient's previous cervical interventions and calcification of the proximal common carotid arteries added to the technical challenge of the procedure. A left carotid\u2013left subclavian bypass was not performed in the same setting because of further scarring at the left supraclavicular area; thus, revascularization of the left arm was planned for the endovascular portion in the subsequent procedure. Postoperatively, the patient showed no signs of a neurologic deficit apart from hoarseness that continued from his preoperative condition.\nThe second procedure was initiated by direct cutdown and cannulation of the right femoral artery and left brachial artery, percutaneous access to the left femoral artery, and right radial artery access for placement of a marker wire in the brachiocephalic artery. A 38-mm covered stent-graft was deployed just before the origin of the innominate artery to cover the origin of the left carotid and left subclavian arteries. A second 34-mm covered stent-graft was placed distally. Type Ia and type II endoleaks were observed with initial angiography, the latter",

He is a retired teacher with no history of involvement in activities requiring excessive kneeling. He is ambulatory in his community and can walk comfortably with the assistance of a cane.\nThe patient's general physical examination results were within normal limits; positive physical findings were limited to the involved knee. There was an anterior knee swelling involving mainly the prepatellar area, approximately 7 cm in diameter, fluctuant, and not tender to palpation, with minimal surrounding erythema; the erythema was present mainly at the punctum. The punctum was draining a yellowish discharge on pressure (). There was no bony tenderness at the patella, distal femur, or proximal tibia. There was no detectable knee effusion, instability, or crepitus. The range of motion was well preserved (5\u2013110\u00b0), as it was a prosthetic knee.
