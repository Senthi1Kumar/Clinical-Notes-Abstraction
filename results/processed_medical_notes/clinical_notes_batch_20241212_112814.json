    "original_text": "An 80-year-old man was referred to our hospital for syncope caused by severe AS. Twelve years previously, he had undergone CABG that comprised bypass grafting of the left internal thoracic artery (LITA) to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and of the saphenous vein from the ascending aorta to circumflex branch. He had also undergone pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis 10 years prior to the surgery. Unfortunately, the details of the surgical procedure and findings were unknown because the surgery for pericarditis was performed at another hospital. Preoperative computed tomography indicated that the pericardium around the aorta and right-sided left atrial area were almost intact. However, severe adhesion appeared to be present from the anterior to diaphragmatic aspects of the heart. Echocardiography showed severe progressive AS with moderate aortic regurgitation. Other examination data were as follows: aortic valve area of 0.6 cm2, mean trans-aortic valvular pressure gradient of 86 mmHg, bicuspid aortic valve, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 70%. Although the patency of the LITA\u2013LAD graft was confirmed, computed tomography and coronary arteriography showed that the saphenous vein graft was occluded. We discussed the treatment strategy (TAVR or AVR) in a \u201cheart team.\u201d The heart team considered TAVR not to be suitable for his deformed bicuspid aortic valve. We decided to use a right parasternal minimally invasive approach, which is optimal for performing AVR to avoid median sternotomy-related injury, especially to the patent LITA\u2013LAD graft.\nA 7-cm right parasternal incision extending from the inferior edge of the second costal cartilage to the superior edge of the fourth costal cartilage was made (Fig. a).

She denied hematuria, lower urinary tract symptoms, pain, fever, fatigue, or weight loss. Her medical history was significant for hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea. Family history and social history were noncontributory. Physical exam at the time of presentation was normal.\nOn CT, the tumor was an exophytic, enhancing mass (3.0 \u00d7 2.0 \u00d7 3.5 cm), arising from the lower lateral pole of the left kidney with areas of low attenuation at its inferior aspect. The remainder of the urinary system was normal. No adenopathy or sign of metastasis was detected. An imaging obtained later the same year demonstrated no interval change in the size of the lesion. Biopsy was positive for an oncocytic neoplasm, which at the time was classified as an onocytoma. The patient was managed conservatively and presented 2 years later for repeat imaging.\nA repeat CT was significant for an interval increase in the size of the mass from 3.5 to 5.6 cm in the greatest dimension. Tumor compressed the lower pole calyces without ureteral obstruction. There was no radiologic evidence of tumor calcification, fat, or infiltration into the adjacent tissues. Fine needle aspiration and the biopsies of the mass were again consistent with an oncocytic neoplasm.\nComparative radiologic images are provided (); the top images are radiographs with a smaller tumor from 2 years ago, while the bottom radiographs are from the patient's recent CT with a larger tumor.

The patient had no history of alcohol or tobacco use and was diagnosed with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the right tonsil in September 2012. He was treated with three cycles of cisplatin along with radiation therapy to his neck and upper chest over two months with good response.\nIn 2014, recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma was discovered in his cervical lymph nodes. He was treated with bilateral selective neck dissection. In 2015, he developed severe dysphagia, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy with dilation was performed. Tracheostomy tube was placed due to airway compromise.\nHe underwent a second esophagogastroduodenoscopy with dilation three months later in July 2015 for continued dysphagia; during the procedure, an abnormal area on the posterior pharyngeal wall was noted. Subsequent direct laryngoscopy with biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma in-situ. However, the gross appearance of the lesion was suspicious for invasive disease; positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography (PET-CT) was consistent with local progression of his carcinoma.\nIn November 2015, he was treated with two cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy. He was then transitioned to nivolumab; he received 16 cycles from December 2015 to July 2016. In August 2016, he was restarted on carboplatin and paclitaxel. After three cycles, the patient decided to discontinue chemotherapy in November 2016.\nIn January 2017, the patient presented to his otolaryngologist for routine tracheostomy tube change. He described a two-month history of a neck rash that was initially painful, had spread to his chest, and was vesicular in appearance. The otolaryngologist noted not only a malodorous discharge near the tracheostomy site, but also skin lesions that were suspicious for varicella zoster virus infection.

Upon examination, her visual acuity was 20/60 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 12 mmHg in the right eye and 14 mmHg in the left eye. The anterior segment was normal in both eyes. Dilated fundoscopic examination showed right eye vitreous and preretinal hemorrhage and bilateral arterial macroaneurysms (active and involuted), retinal arterial beading, and sclerosed retinal vessels [Figure \u2013]. No macular edema was detected on optical coherence tomography in either eye. Ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography demonstrated multiple macroaneurysms on the optic discs and major retinal arterioles in addition to a significant peripheral retinal ischemia in both eyes [Figure and ]. The patient underwent laser photocoagulation to the peripheral avascular retina in both eyes.\nSystemic workup included echocardiography which showed severe supravalvular pulmonic stenosis with a peak gradient of 70\u201380 mmHg that required urgent pulmonary valvuloplasty. Other cardiac findings included small patent ductus arteriosus with normal right ventricular function. Abdominal ultrasound imaging demonstrated cirrhotic liver features with splenomegaly but normal kidneys. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and neck vessels was unremarkable. Genetic testing of the patient showed splicing mutation of IGFBP-7 with autosomal recessive inheritance.\nAt 12-month follow-up, dilated fundus examination showed complete resolution of the vitreous and preretinal hemorrhage in the right eye and the macroaneurysms in both eyes.

Subcutaneous emphysema was present, extending from the inferior border of the mandible to the clavicle. Videolaryngoscopic examination showed normal vocal cord mobility.\nX-rays of the cervical region and chest were taken immediately in the anteroposterior and lateral view. A soft tissue neck (STN) lateral view revealed a radiopaque foreign body shadow at the level of the C6\u2013C7 vertebral body level (). This was further confirmed with contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the neck with fine 1-mm cuts, which also showed that the radio-dense foreign body lodged in the tracheoesophageal party wall at the level of second and third tracheal rings, corresponding to the C7 vertebral body ().\nThe patient was taken for immediate surgical exploration. A low tracheostomy was performed under local anesthesia at the level of the fourth tracheal ring, which was below the level of the penetrating wound. A Portex cuffed tracheostomy tube (size 7.5) was inserted, and general anesthesia (GA) was administered through the tracheostomy tube.

    "original_text": "A right-handed 80-year-old Caucasian female was referred for further evaluation of reading difficulty. She initially presented at age of 72 years with reduced vision and glare. She had no history of stroke or head injury. Following bilateral sequential phacoemulsification and insertion of intraocular lenses, she was diagnosed by a general ophthalmologist with low tension glaucoma in the left eye on the basis of unilateral superior arcuate field defect, temporal neuroretinal rim thinning, and a maximum intraocular pressure (IOP) of 17 mmHg at several clinic visits over an 18-month period (Figures -). Timolol and then subsequently combined timolol-latanoprost eye drops were prescribed and IOP was reduced to around 12\u201315 mmHg. Despite good control over 4 years, the left visual field defect progressed and left sided homonymous hemianopia developed in the right visual field without significant change in the optic nerve heads (). Since she was also experiencing difficulty in reversing her car due to poor vision on the left-hand side, her antiglaucoma medication was ceased and ocular diagnosis reevaluated. Brain and orbital computer tomography (CT) scan showed no compressive lesion in the posterior visual pathway. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits (without contrast) demonstrated no mass or infiltrative lesion in the optic tracts or nerves that could explain the hemianopia. Although technically difficult, visual electrophysiology demonstrated delayed P50 and N95 implicit times with only mild reduction in amplitude on pattern electroretinography (PERG) whilst small and large check pattern visual evoked potentials (PVEP) were significantly reduced ().

His symptoms had been progressively worsening for the previous 7 months. The patient was a pharmacist and was not overweight. He had a history of UC in 2002 that was diagnosed during the workup of chronic diarrhea. The patient did not have any medication for UC. He did not smoke, nor did he use recreational drugs. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/20 OS. Eyelid examination was unremarkable. The pupils were equal and reactive. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Ocular movements were full and he was orthophoric in all gaze directions. Dilated fundus examination showed retinal folds between the macula and the optic disk and bilateral grade-2 optic disc swelling (Fig. ). Visual field testing revealed enlarged blind spots and diffusely decreased visual field sensitivity in both eyes (Fig. ). Ocular ultrasonography revealed enlarged optic nerve sheaths. Brain MRI ruled out brain tumor and venous thrombosis. There were signs of ICH including empty sella and bilateral lateral venous sinus stenosis. Lumbar puncture showed CSF opening pressure of 26 cm of water with normal CSF contents. The headaches persisted after lumbar puncture. Ancillary testing did not reveal vitamin A deficiency or anemia. Idiopathic ICH was suspected. The patient was treated with a daily dose of 1000 mg of acetazolamide that was gradually tapered. Headaches initially improved but the treatment could not be decreased under 750 mg a day without recurrence of the symptoms.\nExtensive review of systems showed that patient still had chronic diarrhea.

His serum level of creatinine was slightly high (2.11 mg/dl). Colonoscopy revealed a semi-protruding polyp (2 cm in diameter) in the sigmoid colon for which a polypectomy was carried out.

Although, the gonadal vessels were recognized in the correct posterior plane, the left ureter could not be identified on either side. The dissection was continued into the right side of the retroperitoneum. However, the plane between the fascia propria of the rectum and the presacral fascia was unclear and firmer than usual.

The vertigo attacks occurred commonly in lying down and each episode of vertigo lasted about few seconds. Aside from nausea, there were no other associated neurological or otological symptoms including hearing loss or tinnitus. The patient reported an uneventful medical history but underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute calculous cholecystitis 5 days before the presentation. The procedure lasted 75 min and was completed without any complications during surgery. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged without any problems 4 days after surgery.\nOn examinations, neurologic findings were normal and otological examination revealed normal ear canals and tympanic membranes, with no demonstrable spontaneous nystagmus. The patient was evaluated with the device-assisted diagnostic tests for BPPV. On the right Dix\u2013Hallpike test, brief vertigo and vertical upbeating nystagmus with counterclockwise torsional component toward the dependent ear were induced ( and ). The roll test was negative. The patient was diagnosed as having right posterior canal BPPV and then treated with the device-assisted Epley maneuver as described elsewhere. The performance of the diagnostic or repositioning maneuver was reproduced by the diagnosis and therapy system for BPPV (Byrons Medical Science & Technique Inc., Jinan, China). Next day, the patient still complained of repeated episodic vertigo, but the vertigo attacks occurred when rolling over in bed rather than lying down, therefore the patient was re-evaluated. This time the Dix\u2013Hallpike test was negative, indicating the posterior canal BPPV was resolved, but the roll test showed a geotropic direction-changing horizontal nystagmus (), with more intense nystagmus when patient\u2019s head turned to the right than to the left.

    "original_text": "A 61-year-old woman presented with pain in her chest wall for two months, and had no significant medical history, such as trauma, infection, or tumor. The pain was located in the left lower chest in a band-like pattern overlapping the T10 dermatome. The pain was intermittent and occurred several times a day, continuing for 10\u201320 min each episode and alleviated when lying down. The pain was considered to be intercostal neuralgia.\nTo identify the cause of the neuralgia, we performed MRI, which revealed multiple cysts at the T9\u2013T11 nerve roots bilaterally (Fig. ). No other causal abnormality for the chest wall pain was found other than the cysts. The interior of the cysts showed similar intensity to the CSF on imaging. The largest cyst was at the level of the left T10 vertebra and had a linear shadow that suggested the presence of nerve root fibers. Computed tomography (CT) with myelography was also performed to study CSF communication between the thecal sac and the cysts. After 10 mL of 240 mg I/mL iodinated contrast medium (Omnipaque 240, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., Japan) was injected into the thecal sac at L4/5 in the lateral recumbent position, the first CT image was taken immediately (left and middle columns of Fig. ), and revealed multiple cysts from T6\u2013L2, including small cysts. The cysts were enhanced by the contrast medium and most showed the same intensity as that of the thecal sac at the corresponding level; however, the largest cyst at left T10 and another at left T9 showed much higher concentrations of the contrast medium.

    "cleaned_text": "a 61-year-old woman presented with pain in her chest wall for two months, and had no significant medical history, such as trauma, infection, or tumor. the pain was located in the left lower chest in a band-like pattern overlapping the t10 dermatome. the pain was intermittent and occurred several times a day, continuing for 10\u201320 min each episode and alleviated when lying down. the pain was considered to be intercostal neuralgia.\nto identify the cause of the neuralgia, we performed mri, which revealed multiple cysts at the t9\u2013t11 nerve roots bilaterally (fig. ). no other causal abnormality for the chest wall pain was found other than the cysts. the interior of the cysts showed similar intensity to the csf on imaging. the largest cyst was at the level of the left t10 vertebra and had a linear shadow that suggested the presence of nerve root fibers. computed tomography (ct) with myelography was also performed to study csf communication between the thecal sac and the cysts. after 10 ml of 240 mg i/ml iodinated contrast medium (omnipaque 240, daiichi sankyo, inc., japan) was injected into the thecal sac at l4/5 in the lateral recumbent position, the first ct image was taken immediately (left and middle columns of fig. ), and revealed multiple cysts from t6\u2013l2, including small cysts. the cysts were enhanced by the contrast medium and most showed the same intensity as that of the thecal sac at the corresponding level; however, the largest cyst at left t10 and another at left t9 showed much higher concentrations of the contrast medium. three hours after the injection, the intensities of the cysts and the thecal sac were equal on the second ct (right column of fig. ). the next day, another ct examination showed no detectable contrast enhancement. based on these findings, we suggested a diagnosis of multiple perineural cysts.\nthe patient was treated",

He had a history of diabetes, end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis, spinal cord injury at level T5-T6 due to a motor vehicle accident at the age of 16, and bilateral hemipelvectomy and lower-limb amputation because of recurrent osteomyelitis related to the pressure ulcers. His first tracheostomy was performed outside hospital in anticipation of the need for long-term mechanical ventilatory support as a result of acute respiratory failure secondary to gas gangrene from the pressure ulcer infection and pneumonia with CO2 narcosis. He underwent his third tracheostomy 72 days before admission. The tracheal cannula (Speech Cannula\u00ae, Koken\u00ae, Tokyo, Japan) had been used with the cuff inflated. There was a small amount of hemoptysis 4 days prior to obvious onset of the TIF. He had no anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent, and his platelet and coagulation function tests within the normal range.\nOn day 16 in the hospital, massive hemorrhage from the tracheostomy site ensued during suctioning, followed by cardiopulmonary arrest from asphyxiation. After cardiopulmonary resuscitation and replacement of the tracheostomy tube with an endotracheal tube were performed, he was transferred to the intensive care unit where he suffered a second cardiopulmonary arrest from hemoptysis-induced upper airway obstruction. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy showed the TIF as the source of bleeding based on the right anterior location of the hemorrhage and adjacent anatomical location of the trachea and innominate artery, as observed on previous computed tomography (Figure A). The cuff of the tube was hyperinflated, but even a slight movement of the tube resulted in recurrent massive hemorrhage. Thus, an endovascular stent graft was placed from his right common carotid artery under general anesthesia. Because the innominate artery was short (4 cm), placing endovascular stent within the length of innominate artery was not expected to be sufficient to seal the bleeding site.",

His medical history included no systemic disease other than hypertension that had been present for 5 years and was controlled with medical treatment. In ophthalmologic examination, his corrected visual acuity was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.2 in the left eye. He had no history of previous ocular surgery, and anterior segment examination was normal. Fundus examination revealed no pathology in the right eye but BRVO was detected in the superotemporal region of the left eye ().

Fundus fluorescein angiography of the left eye showed late filling, dilation, and increased tortuosity of the superotemporal retina vein and areas of capillary nonperfusion consistent with BRVO (). Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated retinal thickening (710 \u00b5m) and cystoid macular edema (). The patient was diagnosed with macular edema associated with BRVO and Ozurdex was injected.

She had received the initial diagnosis of UC in 1997 when she developed abdominal pain and rectal bleeding with loose mucous stools and underwent a diagnostic colonoscopy with a gastroenterologist. She responded to mesalamine (Asacol) given for a period of 6 weeks, which was later discontinued by the patient.\nFor the next 12 years, she was relatively stable with standard American diet recommendations and did not exclude wheat and dairy or focused on the inclusion of particular fermented foods.

    "original_text": "The patient in this study is a 23-year-old female with ESRD secondary to hypoplastic kidneys. She received an offer from a brain dead, 9-month-old female donor with a terminal creatinine of 0.2 mg% and donor weight of 10 kilograms. The recipient-to-donor weight ratio was roughly six-to-one. After performing the standard multi-organ procurement, it was noted that the donor left renal vein was essentially dismembered from the inferior vena cava (IVC). This prohibited performing the standard en-bloc technique to transplant the kidneys. Normally, the suprarenal IVC is sutured closed, and the infrarenal IVC is spatulated at the iliac bifurcation for anastomosis to the recipient iliac vein. The pediatric kidneys were divided on the back table similar to an adult kidney procedure. The left renal vein was separated completely. The aorta was split down the middle and Carrel patches were made around the renal arteries. The right renal vein was elongated using the donor IVC in the standard fashion, and a venotomy was made on the side of the IVC for the anastomosis. The transplant then proceeded normally by exposing the right iliac vessels. Adequate exposure was achieved. The internal iliac veins were ligated and divided to elevate the external iliac vein and allow for a tension-free anastomosis. The external iliac artery was dissected to its full length, from the takeoff of the internal iliac artery to the inguinal ligament. The two kidneys were transplanted by stacking them on the same side. The left kidney was placed higher to allow the longer vein to cross over the iliac artery. The arterial anastomosis was performed using Carrel patch to the external iliac artery. The iliac veins were reconstructed in the usual fashion to the external iliac veins.

She denied having fevers, night sweats, dyspnea or chest discomfort, and did not report a history of chemical exposure or trauma to the eye. On exam, she was afebrile, HR 60 and BP 120/59. Her right eye had diffuse conjunctival injection, corneal opacification and a dense vitreous with loss of red reflex. Visual acuity in the right eye was intact only to hand waving. Extraocular movements were full and there was no periorbital erythema or swelling. Left eye exam was normal with clear conjunctiva and 20/20 visual acuity. Ophthalmology evaluated the patient emergently and vitreous aspiration was performed. Empiric intravitreal vancomycin and ceftazidime were administered for a diagnosis of acute endophthalmitis.

    "original_text": "A 47-year-old woman came to our center with an increase in volume of her left breast without sign of infection. She is the mother of two children, without hormonal treatment. She has no hereditary history of breast cancer. In 2004, a breast augmentation was performed using retropectoral textured silicone gel implants, Allergan style 110, 330cc. The clinical examination revealed that her breasts were slightly dissymmetrical. The left breast was much larger than the right without suspicious mass detected and no palpable lymphadenopathy. On the mammography, the mediolateral oblique (MLO) view without compression demonstrates that the left prosthesis is deformed on its anterior pole and a periprosthetic collection developed mainly on the anterior surface of the prosthesis (). In Eklund incidence, no lesion is observed. We then performed a bilateral ultrasound. This exam did not show any tumoral lesion or cyst in both breasts. But it confirmed the existence of a significant left periprosthetic fluid reaction predominant in the inner region (). To get a diagnosis, a partial evacuation by fine needle aspiration is performed. The bacteriologic analysis of a part of this sample demonstrated no infectious sign. The pathologic evaluation of the second part of this sample identified atypical cells () and a positivity for CD30 (). Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated an expression of CD45 and CD3. The cells did not express ALK and CK7. This sample was also submitted for a blind analysis to four independent anatomopathologists who all came to the conclusion of a breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

    "cleaned_text": "a 47-year-old woman came to our center with an increase in volume of her left breast without sign of infection. she is the mother of two children, without hormonal treatment. she has no hereditary history of breast cancer. in 2004, a breast augmentation was performed using retropectoral textured silicone gel implants, allergan style 110, 330cc. the clinical examination revealed that her breasts were slightly dissymmetrical. the left breast was much larger than the right without suspicious mass detected and no palpable lymphadenopathy. on the mammography, the mediolateral oblique (mlo) view without compression demonstrates that the left prosthesis is deformed on its anterior pole and a periprosthetic collection developed mainly on the anterior surface of the prosthesis (). in eklund incidence, no lesion is observed. we then performed a bilateral ultrasound. this exam did not show any tumoral lesion or cyst in both breasts. but it confirmed the existence of a significant left periprosthetic fluid reaction predominant in the inner region (). to get a diagnosis, a partial evacuation by fine needle aspiration is performed. the bacteriologic analysis of a part of this sample demonstrated no infectious sign. the pathologic evaluation of the second part of this sample identified atypical cells () and a positivity for cd30 (). immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated an expression of cd45 and cd3. the cells did not express alk and ck7. this sample was also submitted for a blind analysis to four independent anatomopathologists who all came to the conclusion of a breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma. for this patient, the bia-alcl-specific tnm staging system is t1n0m0 (stage ia). the patient underwent bilateral implant removal and capsulectomy. the total samples were analyzed. similarly to the first case, no lymphomatous infiltration was found in the periprosthetic capsule and cd30 remained negative on each slides. fifteen days after the surgery the patient received a pet/ct scan which showed a slight hyper",

She expressed great concern over her problems being persistently ignored at all ERs she had been to.\nMs. M was found hiding in the closet of a primary care doctor\u2019s office early in the morning before it was open for business. Apparently, she saw the janitor approaching and got scared. When the police were able to get into the closet, they discovered a knife, a pair of scissors, and a child's toy phone (which she had been using to call her doctor) in her possession. She revealed that she had gone to the office out of exasperation because she believed that no doctors were listening to her concerns.\nShe informed the team of the inpatient psychiatric unit about her history of hypertension and migraine headaches. All radiological imaging was negative for structural problems. She became increasingly irritable and accused the treatment team of not having her best interests in mind. She refused meals because she was convinced that they were poisoned and laced with psychiatric medication.
