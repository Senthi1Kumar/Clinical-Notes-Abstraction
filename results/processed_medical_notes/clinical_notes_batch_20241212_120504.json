Examination showed lateral joint line tenderness without any ligamentous laxity. Plain radiographs of the knee were normal. Further imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed discoid lateral meniscus with a horizontal tear (\n). Diagnostic scope was done and we found an incomplete discoid lateral meniscus with complex vertical tear involving anterior horn with horizontal extension into the midbody (\n). Arthroscopic all-inside repair was done without any implant. Postoperatively, the patient's knee was protected with a brace. Postsurgery, 6 weeks, the brace was discontinued and the patient started full weight bearing without pain. At 6 months postsurgery, the patient was pain free and without any mechanical symptoms.\nThe position was supine, with the leg hung freely at the end of the table. A tourniquet was used to secure hemostasis. A standard anterolateral portal was used for diagnostic arthroscopy. The finding was an incomplete discoid lateral meniscus with peripheral vertical tear of the anterior horn and partial horizontal tear involving the mid body but not breaching the inner peripheries (\n). A standard anteromedial portal was made and the tear was further assessed using a probe. The tear site was prepared for repair. An additional far medial portal was made to allow arthroscopic instrumentation. A suture passer loaded with synthetic monofilament absorbable suture, introduced through far medial portal, while viewing through anteromedial portal (\n). The torn central fragment and the peripheral rim of the meniscus were penetrated and the tip of suture was pulled through using an arthroscopic grasper through anterolateral portal. The suture passer was reversed out of the far medial portal, leaving the suture inside. Then, a suture retriever was introduced through anterolateral portal and used to retrieve the suture tip bringing both suture-ends out through one portal. Both",

The myoclonic jerks ceased with a bolus injection of midazolam or Norcuron, but the effect was transient. On day 6 of hospitalization, an EEG was performed and it showed complex spike waves in both frontal lobes lesions, which was consistent with cerebral dysfunction and status epilepticus. On day 12 of hospitalization, although the myoclonic jerks continued, the patient's mental status improved so that he was able to intermittently obey simple commands.

    "original_text": "A 25-year-old male carpenter presented with a 1 year history of a significant fall sustaining multiple injuries. The major disabling injury following trauma was a fracture in both bones of left forearm which was treated with an open reduction and internal fixation. The patient also told a history of pain and swelling in the posterior aspect of the right elbow following the initial trauma. He was diagnosed as only soft tissue injury of right elbow. Soon after the swelling subsided, he noticed a depression in the posterior aspect of the elbow just above the olecranon for which he never sought any intervention. When he returned to his work as a carpenter after healing of other fractures, he felt disability limiting his activity which included inability to hammer and lack of extension. Clinical examination revealed a depression just above the olecranon at the osteotendinous junction of triceps. The limb was always kept in extension. He was able to do everything related with flexion, pronation, and supination, but was depending only on gravity for extention. There was obvious wasting of arm and forearm when compared with the other limb. There was no instability detected in the elbow. Radiographs revealed avulsion of a fleck of bone from the olecranon which migrated proximally attributing to the chronicity of the conditions []. The other limb regained full function with no abnormality.\nSurgery was planned to fill the defect in the triceps and to reinforce it to the olecranon. The exposure of the tendon by midline posterior exposure showed a gap of 7 cms [].

Adjacent teeth had no sign of decay or pain during the percussion and there was enough space for the eruption of the impacted teeth.

The patient had a past medical history of a gastric ulcer, a right ankle plating after fracture 20 years ago and a headlice infection 6 months before first presentation. She was a smoker, social drinker of alcohol and was not taking any regular medication. She lived alone and had been struggling to manage independently.\nSince her symptoms commenced 3 years previously, the patient had presented to emergency department (ED) on 11 occasions. Her primary complaint was of dysaesthetic sensory symptoms including a feeling of water retention and a gel infiltrating the skin of her face, trunk, arms and legs, feeling there was something stuck on her skin and feeling her hair was stuck down. In the weeks before the onset of her symptoms, the patient started using an olive oil moisturising cream, to which she attributed her symptoms.\nWhile dermatological examination was conducted, comprehensive neurological examinations were not documented during the first presentations to the ED, which focused on the patient\u2019s facial dysaesthesia.\nThe patient was frustrated that her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as delusional by the ED staff. She refused assessment by liaison psychiatry and mental health review by her general practitioner. The patient was felt to have capacity throughout all consultations. The patient was not taking any psychiatric medications.\nOver time her symptoms progressed. She started to complain of back pain, multiple falls and episodes of her right leg giving way which had progressed to severely compromised walking and coordination. The patient also complained of episodes of urinary and faecal incontinence. This led to a lumbar MRI which ruled out cauda equina syndrome.

Chest \u00d7 ray suggested the pulmonary congestion. Electrocardiography revealed sinus rhythm. The morphological changes of the mitral valve revealed by echocardiography included leaflet and subvalvular apparatus thickening, shortened chordae tendineae, and commissural fusion. The tricuspid valve was intact and right ventricular and atrial sizes were normal under echocardiography.\nThe operation of mitral valve replacement was scheduled after a provisional diagnosis of serious mitral stenosis.

Upon the opening of the left atrium by longitudinal incision, we observed unexpectedly that a large polypoid mass infiltrated the entire anterior mitral leaflet and part of posterior mitral leaflet, resulting in a 0.5 cm2 orifice area. In addition, part of the left atrium was also involved with the same lesion. According to the character of the mass, we considered it to be heart sarcoma.

    "original_text": "A 52-year-old female presented to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery with a painless swelling in the floor of the mouth on the right side since 1-year, with no obvious increase in size. The swelling was not associated with any changes in salivation, but she had difficulty in articulation due to its size. Her medical history was insignificant. She had no history of tobacco use or any other adverse habits.\nOn retraction of the tongue, a solitary 5 cm \u00d7 4 cm swelling was noted in the floor of the mouth on the right side, crossing the midline till the lower left central incisor, completely obliterating the lingual vestibule and occupying the entire floor of the mouth on that side []. The mucosa overlying the swelling was adherent to the lingual gingiva in the region of the lower right premolars []. On palpation, the swelling was well defined, firm in consistency, regular surface, nontender, nonpulsatile, and not bimanually palpable. The mucosa overlying the swelling was freely movable except at the region of attachment to the gingiva. The submandibular ducts were patent and milking of the gland yielded normal saliva.\nThere was no evidence of salivary calculi or bony erosion in the mandibular occlusal radiograph. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed an enhancing mass lesion in the right sublingual region [Figures and ].

Earlier that day she had been seen by her family physician regarding a subcutaneous abscess located on her abdomen and was on her way to see a general surgeon when she had an accident, whereby she was flung from her wheelchair. She was fully immobilized and on a backboard. She was later taken off the backboard after passing Nexus criteria for cervical spine immobilization, with no complaints of pain other than in her left lower quadrant. After being taken off the backboard, a full physical examination was performed. The patient's vital signs were blood pressure of 124/59, heart rate of 107, respiratory rate of 18, temperature of 97.5\u00b0F, and a pulse oximetry of 95% on room air. Auscultation of lungs found them to be clear bilaterally in all fields; cardiac auscultation found normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Upon examining the patient's abdomen, bowel sounds were found in all 4 quadrants and pain was elicited upon palpation of her left lower quadrant, where an 18 \u00d7 8-cm subcutaneous abscess was noted. The abscess was fluctuant with a central area of black necrotic skin measuring 8 \u00d7 3 cm. Upon direct palpation around the abscess, some oozing was noted centrally. During the physical examination we learned that the patient also suffered from Parkinson disease complicated by dementia, so her husband became our primary historian. Upon questioning him about the mass, he said he had noticed it in the previous 2 days, with the central black necrosis only being present since the previous day.

His local physician performed knee aspiration, which revealed massive haemarthrosis of the knee, although the patient had no hereditary disease or drug usage that might be associated with a haemorrhagic tendency. However, despite the conservative treatment via aspiration, haemarthrosis of the knee persisted. Therefore, at 4 months after the onset, the physician performed arthroscopy, which revealed limited joint surface degeneration with no colouration, lateral meniscus degeneration, and a partial tear, which was suspected to be the source of bleeding. Thus, lateral meniscectomy was performed to address the tear.\nUnfortunately, the haemarthrosis of the knee persisted, and the patient was referred to our institution at 3 years after the onset, due to refractory haemarthrosis and osteoarthritis progression. At the admission, left knee radiography revealed the end stage of osteoarthritis (), and we performed various examinations to investigate the cause of the chronic haemarthrosis. However, the cause remained unclear, as enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and thallium scintigraphy did not reveal the presence of any tumorous lesions, such as pigmented villonodular synovitis or hemangioma. Furthermore, blood analysis failed to identify the cause of bleeding tendency, as platelet counts, alanine transaminase levels, aspartate transaminase levels, activated partial thromboplastin time, and prothrombin time were all normal.

Multiple ultrasound examinations were done at different intervals during the course of pregnancy.

No other signs and/or symptoms were reported. The patient denied smoking, drinking alcohol, or taking any medications besides her prenatal vitamins.\nIntraoperatively, the tumor was found to be extra-peritoneal originating from the right abdominal wall.

Following the delivery of a live male newborn (Birthweight: 3560 g; Apgar score 9 at 5 min) through a lower segment transverse uterine incision, a general surgeon was called in for an intraoperative consultation.

The owners reported that the dog had a history of trauma to his right forelimb several years before presentation. The owners reported that the dog had been mildly lame on his right forelimb for about two months, and then a firm lump on the lateral aspect of his elbow was detected. The primary care veterinarian radiographed the elbow and a lobular, smoothly margined, mineral structure was noted on or adjacent the right distal humerus ().\nAt presentation, a 3 cm firm mass was palpated on the lateral aspect of the right elbow. Pain was elicited on full flexion of the right elbow, accompanied by resistance to joint flexion and discomfort on palpation and a mild lameness of the right thoracic limb.

G Dental college and Hospital, Sullia, on September 29, 2011 complaining of bleeding and swollen upper and lower gums with pain since six months. On clinical examination, the gingiva was red in color, soft, and edematous in consistency with spontaneous bleeding on probing. The size of the gingiva was enlarged with severe calculus deposit and probing pocket depth measuring 6 mm with exudation on digital pressure. Routine intraoral photographs were taken []. The patient's oral hygiene was poor with no significant history of medication. The case was diagnosed as Generalized Chronic Periodontitis. The patient was advised to rinse his mouth with chlorhexidine 0.12% mouth wash and was advised to carry out the following hematological investigation like fasting blood sugar, bleeding time, clotting time, differential count, and total count. The test was advised prior to the treatment so as to rule out any systemic condition and patient was advised to report to the department for the necessary periodontal treatment next day.\nOn September 30, 2011, the patient reported as per the scheduled appointment. The blood investigation results were normal. On extraoral examination, face was symmetrical with no palpable lymph nodes.

Physical examination revealed a nontender, fetal-head-sized hard mass on palpation of the lower abdomen. Laboratory evaluation revealed anemia (9.5 g/dL) with elevated serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (13.59 ng/mL, 56.07 U/mL).\nAbdominal sonogram showed a large mass in the pelvic cavity with ascites and a metastatic liver nodule in S8.\nOne day after admission, the patient complained of severe abdominal pain, and the serum hemoglobin level decreased to 7.15 g/dL. Computed tomography (CT) showed a ruptured 14 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 12 cm sized heterogenous low density mass in the pelvic cavity with fluid collection (), and there were multiple liver nodules and an enhanced nodule with fat infiltration in the omentum (). Urgent laparotomy was performed and multiple liver metastases and peritoneal and omental seeding of the tumor were found. The mass originated from the sigmoid colon. Sigmoid colectomy and tumorectomy were performed with an end colostomy for survival. Worsening abdominal distension and vomiting occurred 10 days after operation, and a repeat CT showed a 10 \u00d7 13 cm sized new mass in the pelvic cavity with small bowel obstruction. Repeat laparotomy was performed for palliative cytoreductive treatment, with small bowel resection and end ileostomy with debulking. The patient tolerated a slight advance in diet after the second surgery for three days, but ultimately abdominal distension recurred with a hard palpable mass, and the patient died of abdominal compartment syndrome due to rapid tumor growth 22 days after the initial operation.

MRI demonstrated an intradural-extramedullary tumor extending from T10 to T12 on the ventral side to the spinal cord (). The tumor was isointense with the spinal cord on T1- and hyperintense on T2-weighted images (). It was also well enhanced (). On axial enhanced images at the level of T11-T12 the tumor extended laterally into the intervertebral foramina on the right side (). With the patient in the prone position and under general anesthesia we attempted total tumor removal. After the midline skin incision we performed T9 to T12 laminectomy and opened the dura mater.

The lesion extended from the alveolar process of the premolars to the anterior region of the outer wall of the maxillary sinus, the palatine process, the lateral wall of the nasal cavity, and close to the floor of the orbit. The bone wall was relatively well preserved, but a part of the lesion had entered the nasal cavity []. The lesion showed heterogeneous isointensity on T1-weighted MRI and hypointensity on T2-weighted Magnetic resononce imaging [].\nThe tumor was pathologically diagnosed as ameloblastoma based on biopsy results. Total resection of the tumor and partial resection of the maxilla was scheduled. However, based on the patient's request and her age, removal of the tumor and curettage of the bone around the tumor, and extraction of #11, #12, #13, and #14 were performed under general anesthesia.

His past medical history included several hospitalizations for severe episodes of anemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding that required multiple endoscopic interventions on the colon, with plasma Argon coagulation and blood transfusion. Endoscopic examinations showed multiple sites of angiodysplasia of the duodenum and of the colon. Further evaluation with an endoscopic capsule revealed multiple arteriovenous malformations of the intestine, especially in the jejunum with no evidence of tumors or polyps. He was also known to have a moderate degenerative calcified aortic stenosis. Repeat echocardiography revealed severe aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 50 mmHg, and an orifice area of 0.8 cm2. Moderate aortic insufficiency was also noted. Although he was advised to undergo aortic valve replacement, the patient refused the operation due to the potential intestinal hemorrhage secondary to anticoagulation. The relation between intestinal angiodysplasia and aortic valve disease was not made.\nThe patient continued to suffer from intestinal bleeding requiring several transfusions. His exercice tolerance decreased dramatically over the months and he was admitted in May 2009 to undergo aortic valve replacement. Blood testing showed a hemoglobin level of 11g/dl (two weeks following transfusion of two packed cells units) and a platelets count of 128000/mm3. Values of bleeding time, prothrombin time, Ristocethin cofactor activity, Von Willebrand and factor VIII levels were all in the normal range. Von Willebrand factor was measured via gel electrophoresis. Echocardiography confirmed progression of his aortic stenosis with a mean pressure gradient of 66 mmHg, a maximal gradient of 97mmHg and a functional area of 0.7cm2. Coronary angiography revealed severe stenosis of the left anterior descending and the right coronary artery.\nUnder standard cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic valve replacement and two coronary artery bypass grafts were performed. In order to avoid long term oral anticoagulation, a 23mm Carpentier-Edwards pericardial bioprosthesis was chosen. The postoperative course was uneventful. There was no",
    "cleaned_text": "a 68 year-old male, was admitted to the hospital in march 2008 with a history of melena. his past medical history included several hospitalizations for severe episodes of anemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding that required multiple endoscopic interventions on the colon, with plasma argon coagulation and blood transfusion. endoscopic examinations showed multiple sites of angiodysplasia of the duodenum and of the colon. further evaluation with an endoscopic capsule revealed multiple arteriovenous malformations of the intestine, especially in the jejunum with no evidence of tumors or polyps. he was also known to have a moderate degenerative calcified aortic stenosis. repeat echocardiography revealed severe aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 50 mmhg, and an orifice area of 0.8 cm2. moderate aortic insufficiency was also noted. although he was advised to undergo aortic valve replacement, the patient refused the operation due to the potential intestinal hemorrhage secondary to anticoagulation. the relation between intestinal angiodysplasia and aortic valve disease was not made.\nthe patient continued to suffer from intestinal bleeding requiring several transfusions. his exercice tolerance decreased dramatically over the months and he was admitted in may 2009 to undergo aortic valve replacement. blood testing showed a hemoglobin level of 11g/dl (two weeks following transfusion of two packed cells units) and a platelets count of 128000/mm3. values of bleeding time, prothrombin time, ristocethin cofactor activity, von willebrand and factor viii levels were all in the normal range. von willebrand factor was measured via gel electrophoresis. echocardiography confirmed progression of his aortic stenosis with a mean pressure gradient of 66 mmhg, a maximal gradient of 97mmhg and a functional area of 0.7cm2. coronary angiography revealed severe stenosis of the left anterior descending and the right coronary artery.\nunder standard cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic valve replacement and two coronary artery bypass grafts were performed. in order to avoid long term oral anticoagulation, a 23mm carpentier-edwards pericardial bioprosthesis was chosen. the postoperative course was uneventful. there was no",

Two months prior to admission, the man presented with progressive dysphagia and weight loss of 11 lbs. Initially, the patient could swallow solid food but with time, the patient felt that solid food could not pass through the oesophagus. He could ingest soft food and drink without any problem. He was later admitted to our hospital for evaluation.\nThe chest radiograph taken on admission day was normal. Panendoscopy revealed one ovoid swelling with intact mucosa at 35 cm from the incisors, which was suggestive of one submucosal tumor (Figure ). Oesophagogram also demonstrated an area of filling defect in the lower third of the oesophagus without any fistula. A chest CT scan showed a cystic lesion in the posterior mediastinum measuring around 5 \u00d7 5 cm adjacent to the lower third of the oesophagus without evidences of malignant features (Figures and ).\nThe junction between the cyst and the oesophagus was not clear, suggesting that the cyst was probably embedded in the esophageal wall. The cystic lesion was thought to be a foregut cyst. The patient's laboratory data were all within normal limits, including complete cell counts, biochemistry, C-reactive protein, CEA, SCC, CA125 and CA19-9.\nThe patient underwent a thoracoscopic excision of the cystic lesion through the right side of the thorax using three thoracoports. Under thoracoscopic view, the lesion was identified beneath the mediastinal pleural after retraction of the diaphragm by a Foerster sponge forceps and division of the pulmonary ligament by way of electrical cauterization. The lung tissues were not adhered to the pleura where the cyst was located. The mediastinal pleura was opened by an L-shaped hook electrode and the capsule of the cystic lesion was identified (Figure ). With careful and delicate dissection by a suction tube and an L-shaped hook electrode, the cystic lesion was completely excised (Figure ).",
