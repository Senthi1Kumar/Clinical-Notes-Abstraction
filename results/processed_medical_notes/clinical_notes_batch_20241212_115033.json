During the assessment, patient complained of having an intermittent backache for a long time; she described a constant pain in her right hip and groin spreading to right knee that started 1 week ago and was increasing with rest. Patient also reported there was pain and slight swelling in the right ankle 10 days before that lasted for 3 days. In her background no previous illness is noted. Patient had an abdominal pain lasting for the last 6 months and abdominal ultrasound was performed; a solid mass was detected in the liver. We learned that the patient had no history of arthritis, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, psoriasis, or previous operation. She has not been using any medication except for analgesic. The patient had no relatives with history of inflammatory disease or malignancy in her family history. In the physical examination loss of lumbar lordosis was detected. Waist movement was slightly restricted to all directions due to pain, hand fingertip-to-floor distance was 10 cm, sacroiliac compression test was positive on the right, FABERE test was positive on the right, her right knee was warm and tender, there was no rash on the skin, local sensitivity was detected in the right upper quadrant with palpation, and other system evaluations were normal. Sacroiliac MRI was seen because of the suspicion of sacroiliitis.

The history started two months prior to referral to our hospital with a trivial fall at home on the stairs, in which she managed to break her fall with her hands. There was no trauma to her head, chest, back or pelvis. There was no immediate complaint of pain nor neurological deficit and she was well thereafter.\nTwo days after the fall, she developed low grade fever, persistent back and abdominal pain aggravated by movement. She was taken to a general practitioner who had found no abnormality in radiographs of the spine and pelvis. A diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis had been made and she was prescribed antibiotics and analgesic. Her symptoms worsened and she was taken to a district hospital, where the doctors confirmed no abnormalities in her spinal and pelvic radiographs and also found urine microscopy examination normal. The diagnosis of gastroenteritis was retained and symptomatic medication prescribed.\nA week later, she had difficulty passing motion, in addition to her low grade fever and back pain. The mother took her to another general practitioner and was diagnosed as constipation and treated with laxatives.\nTwo weeks later, her lower limb weakness worsened and she was no longer able to walk.

Her past medical history did not present other hospitalizations for the same symptoms. Due to the clinical manifestations, the patient was initially treated as a case of pulmonary embolic disease and subjected to a massive anticoagulant therapy. Considering the clinical diagnosis and the child to term, an emergent caesarean delivery was performed in order to avoid foetal complications. The caesarean section was successfully performed under general anaesthesia using Stark's method due to the urgency related to the patient's clinical condition of increasing dyspnoea. Moreover, although the pAVM was still unknown at time of the caesarean section, the execution of spinal anaesthesia seems to be not indicated because of the risk of pAVM association with other AVMs, such as those located in the spinal cord, especially in case of HHT.\nThe foetal outcome showed an Apgar index of 3, 6, and 9, respectively, at minutes 1, 3, and 5; these data are in line with the administration of general anaesthesia and the acute maternal condition of severe dyspnoea.\nTaking into account the foetal weight at birth, it showed a restriction of the expected value. The child weight was in fact 2590 gr at 39 weeks of gestation. However, ultrasounds performed during the pregnancy reported a reduction of the potential foetal growth from the 33 weeks of gestation without any Doppler alteration.

The patient had been healthy until he developed a cardiogenic cerebral infarction in 5 years prior to this presentation. Although the details were unclear, the patient had suffered a gunshot wound to the right thigh and the superficial femoral artery had been ligated to achieve hemostasis 40 years previously. He had also been thrown from a bridge of approximately 40 m in height. At that time, he injured his waist and back, however, he successfully recovered while being conservatively treated. The relationship between these traumatic events and the current event was unknown; however, he had been aware of a pulsatile mass in his right groin for at least 20 years. Subsequent contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography revealed the presence of an irregular aneurysm from the right common iliac artery to the right common femoral artery, the maximum diameter of which was 50 mm (Fig. , ). Since the patient had no history of connective tissue disorders or vasculitis, and a blood analysis revealed no inflammatory findings, we clinically diagnosed the patient with a right iliac arterial pseudoaneurysm, which was thought to have been caused by an old infection or past trauma. We performed surgery to resect the aneurysm and performed in situ reconstruction with a bifurcated vascular prosthesis (Hemashield 16 \u00d7 8 mm; MAQUET Holding B.V. & Co. KG, Rastatt, Germany). Since the right common femoral artery was enlarged and showed severe adhesion to the surrounding tissues due to previous surgery for the gunshot wound, we decided to use the right deep femoral artery for peripheral anastomosis. On entering the abdominal cavity, the right iliac arterial aneurysm was irregular, with a whitish surface, and it adhered to the small intestines. These findings were suggestive of chronic inflammation. According to the usual procedure, the prosthetic bifurcated graft was anastomosed to the transected aorta, distal of the inferior mesenteric artery, and the left limb of the graft was anastomosed to the left common iliac artery.

She experienced sudden onset severe, sharp, localized pain in the left lower quadrant which gradually spread to become diffuse lower abdominal pain. She reported vaginal bleeding consistent with the time of her normal menses, though heavier than usual. Her past medical history was significant for left tubal ectopic pregnancy six months prior, medically managed with methotrexate. On admission, her hemoglobin was found to be 6.3 g/dL and she was transfused two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).\nNine days prior to her current admission, she presented to a local hospital with a similar episode. At that time, she was diagnosed with a ruptured ovarian cyst and managed conservatively. Six days prior to her current admission she was re-admitted to the local hospital after experiencing the same abdominal pain with a near syncopal episode. The outside facility performed a diagnostic laparoscopy which revealed intraperitoneal blood without active bleeding. She received transfusion of two units pRBCs at that time.\nHer menstrual history was significant for menarche at age 15 followed by a history of heavy, long, irregular menses sometimes lasting up to two weeks. She reported a history of frequent urinary tract infections since childhood. She denied tobacco or alcohol use. She reported an allergy to penicillin, was not on any oral contraceptives, and reported no other medications or supplements. Further history did not reveal any bleeding dyscrasia.

No fracture was seen on radiographs, and he was placed in a removable splint for comfort and discharged. The patient was scheduled for follow-up but would not present to an orthopaedic clinic until three years post injury, at age 11. At age 11, when the patient was seen at an outside orthopaedic clinic, he reported continued wrist pain from his initial injury three years prior. He described dull pain in his right wrist with intermittent swelling after several minor falls while playing soccer. Radiographs did not reveal a fracture or other pathology, and the patient was again diagnosed with a wrist sprain and given a brace for comfort. He was compliant with the brace, but 8 months later, he again returned to his pediatrician with continued pain. Interval radiographs revealed a right-sided, displaced scaphoid waist fracture (). He was referred to our clinic for further management. He was noted to have tenderness located at the anatomic snuffbox but full range of motion. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was ordered to further evaluate for AVN and osseous bridging given the chronicity of his symptoms, and he was placed in a thumb spica wrist brace. His MRI demonstrated the scaphoid waist nonunion with concerns for AVN (). At this point, the patient and parents elected to undergo surgical fixation of his nonunion. Due to the concern for AVN on MRI, utilization of a vascularized bone graft was considered. However, it was felt that given the young age of the patient, drilling of the bone would be sufficient to stimulate bone growth and avoid the more aggressive procedure.\nThe patient underwent surgery at 11 years and 3 months of age.

She has an extensive chart history in the hospital system, with numerous admissions in the emergency, internal medicine, obstetrics/gynecology, and psychiatry departments. Her earliest documented EEG in the hospital chart at 22 years of age showed spikes with phase reversing in the left and right temporal regions, indicative of an underlying structural abnormality, with moderate generalized slowing. She came to our attention in the department of psychiatry as a consult request for the evaluation of psychosis, also at the age of 22. She was admitted for birth out of asepsis, having given birth at home, and brought to the hospital for further care, whereupon a consult was placed for the reported presence of psychotic symptoms. As she did not meet the criteria for any psychiatric disorders at the time, psychiatry deemed her symptoms a manifestation of ictal episodes due to her temporal lobe epilepsy. Collateral information from the patient\u2019s mother revealed that she began having seizures at 13 years of age, with increasing frequency of seizures during her pregnancy. The patient\u2019s mother also noted that she was poorly adherent to her then-current antiepileptic medications of valproic acid 250 mg and oxcarbazepine 600 mg. From the information given by the mother, it was unclear whether or not this regimen changed for the patient during pregnancy.\nThe psychiatry team encountered the patient two years later, the patient was brought to the emergency department on a 72-hour involuntary psychiatric hold for danger to self and danger to others.

    "original_text": "A 56-year-old female was referred to our department from another facility in the patient\u2019s area for a rapidly progressing tumor in the gallbladder and liver area. The patient reported several-month right upper quadrant pain and 4-kg weight loss over the past year. There was no laboratory sign of obstructive jaundice at the day of admission. Preoperative CT and MR scan (Figs. and ) of the liver was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with a tumor in the gallbladder area with a relatively massive infiltration of the S5 and S6 liver segments and extensive regions of necrosis. Given the potentially resectable lesion according to preoperative imaging, exploratory laparotomy was indicated to attempt radical resection. During the exploration, a voluminous tumor was found attached to the peritoneum. Intraoperative ultrasound was performed and revealed a tumor originating from the gallbladder bed area and reaching up to the area of the hepatic hilum and extensive involvement of the hepatoduodenal ligament by the tumor through the lymph nodes. The tumor was classified as inoperable due to this finding. But during the exploration, however, a rupture of the fragile tumor occurred with massive eruption of the necrotic mass and the gallbladder content into the abdominal cavity, accompanied by bleeding of the liver parenchyma. We decided that the condition could only be managed by attempting modified resection. We performed cholecystectomy and non-anatomical resection of hepatic segments S5 and S6 and partial resection of S4 without lymphadenectomy as a debulking operation (Fig. ). The course of hospitalization was uncomplicated, and the patient was discharged to home care on postoperative day 9.

    "cleaned_text": "a 56-year-old female was referred to our department from another facility in the patient's area for a rapidly progressing tumor in the gallbladder and liver area. the patient reported several-month right upper quadrant pain and 4-kg weight loss over the past year. there was no laboratory sign of obstructive jaundice at the day of admission. preoperative ct and mr scan (figs. and ) of the liver was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with a tumor in the gallbladder area with a relatively massive infiltration of the s5 and s6 liver segments and extensive regions of necrosis. given the potentially resectable lesion according to preoperative imaging, exploratory laparotomy was indicated to attempt radical resection. during the exploration, a voluminous tumor was found attached to the peritoneum. intraoperative ultrasound was performed and revealed a tumor originating from the gallbladder bed area and reaching up to the area of the hepatic hilum and extensive involvement of the hepatoduodenal ligament by the tumor through the lymph nodes. the tumor was classified as inoperable due to this finding. but during the exploration, however, a rupture of the fragile tumor occurred with massive eruption of the necrotic mass and the gallbladder content into the abdominal cavity, accompanied by bleeding of the liver parenchyma. we decided that the condition could only be managed by attempting modified resection. we performed cholecystectomy and non-anatomical resection of hepatic segments s5 and s6 and partial resection of s4 without lymphadenectomy as a debulking operation (fig. ). the course of hospitalization was uncomplicated, and the patient was discharged to home care on postoperative day 9. histologically, the tumor was confirmed as minen of gallbladder (figs. , , and ), and its non-neuroendocrine component had the character of moderately differentiated tubular gall bladder adenocarcinoma, while the neuroendocrine component had the appearance of small cell carcinoma and was dominant, accounting for more than 65% of the viable tumor. the neuroendocrine component contained extensive necrosis, with mitotic index 64/10 hpf and a proliferation index of 70% (f",

Pathology of the polyp revealed heterotopic gastric mucosa with benign lobules of gastric glands.

At that time, he was instructed to follow up for a repeat endoscopy for surveillance in two years. As recommended, two years later he presented to our office for surveillance of his duodenal lesion. Due to his history of atrophic gastritis and a large duodenal lesion, we performed an upper endoscopy that showed atrophic gastritis, duodenitis, and a single 10 mm polyp in the second portion of the duodenum. The duodenal polyp was biopsied. Pathology revealed polypoid gastric metaplastic mucosa with focal epithelial atypia including nuclear enlargement, stratification, nucleoli, and few mitoses. The patient was referred for endoscopic ultrasound to further characterize the lesion and complete resection. Several weeks later he underwent an endoscopic ultrasound that revealed a 13-mm pedunculated and sessile polyp on the lateral wall opposite to the major papilla in the second portion of the duodenum (). The polyp was removed en bloc using a hot snare following a 4-mL saline lift. Two endoclips were placed for hemostasis. Pathology revealed a pyloric gland adenoma (Figures , , and ) with predominantly low grade dysplasia (Figures and ) and some small areas of focal high grade dysplasia.

He had an EGD at an outside facility 2 years earlier for evaluation of abdominal pain which showed a 1.2 cm duodenal polypoid lesion in the second portion of the duodenum. Pathology of the polyp revealed heterotopic gastric mucosa with benign lobules of gastric glands. He also was found to have chronically active H. pylori gastritis with numerous Helicobacter organisms and atrophic gastritis with patchy areas of intestinal metaplasia. At that time, he was instructed to follow up for a repeat endoscopy for surveillance in two years. As recommended, two years later he presented to our office for surveillance of his duodenal lesion. Due to his history of atrophic gastritis and a large duodenal lesion, we performed an upper endoscopy that showed atrophic gastritis, duodenitis, and a single 10 mm polyp in the second portion of the duodenum. The duodenal polyp was biopsied. Pathology revealed polypoid gastric metaplastic mucosa with focal epithelial atypia including nuclear enlargement, stratification, nucleoli, and few mitoses. The patient was referred for endoscopic ultrasound to further characterize the lesion and complete resection. Several weeks later he underwent an endoscopic ultrasound that revealed a 13-mm pedunculated and sessile polyp on the lateral wall opposite to the major papilla in the second portion of the duodenum (). The polyp was removed en bloc using a hot snare following a 4-mL saline lift. Two endoclips were placed for hemostasis. Pathology revealed a pyloric gland adenoma (Figures , , and ) with predominantly low grade dysplasia (Figures and ) and some small areas of focal high grade dysplasia. The slides were read by the in-house pathologist and were also reviewed by a GI expert pathologist at the University of Michigan.

    "original_text": "Our patient was a 65-year-old Caucasian man with an 18-month history of ALS, who presents with progressive dyspnea and palpitations. A previous evaluation of his dyspnea attributed the cause to neuromuscular weakness and he underwent a pulmonary evaluation. A chest X-ray demonstrated clear lung fields. His arterial blood gas revealed a pH 7.4, carbon dioxide partial pressure 62, oxygen partial pressure 117, on fraction of inspired oxygen 40% and concomitant blood chemistry demonstrated elevated serum bicarbonate, both consistent with chronic carbon dioxide retention. Pulmonary function testing indicated a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 79% and FEV1/forced vital capacity of >80%. These pulmonary function tests did not represent a significant decrement from baseline.An electrocardiogram (ECG ) was obtained which demonstrated hemodynamically stable new third degree atrioventricular (AV) block with a junctional escape rate of 50 beats per minute (Figure ). A previously obtained ECG indicated normal sinus rhythm. On further review, he was not prescribed medications with AV nodal blocking properties while at home or during his hospitalization. On echocardiogram, a structurally normal heart was observed with normal left ventricular dimensions and function without significant valvular disease. He was offered a permanent dual chamber pacemaker for definitive treatment, however, he declined.\nWe believe that his symptoms were probably attributable to his AV block. The original symptoms of dyspnea with palpitations were initially attributed to ALS neuromuscular weakness during periods of exertion. The narrow complex escape rhythm suggested the block occurred at or above the level of the AV node, an area innervated by the autonomic nervous system. The role of ALS as the etiology for the development of AV block has not been previously reported.

At that time, she tried to swallow rice and vegetable roll in order to dislodge the fish bone when she felt the pain of the foreign body, but it was not effective. Subsequently, she underwent fiberoptic laryngoscopy because of the sensation of foreign body in the pharynx. But the result of examination showed that no foreign body and no abnormalities were detected. The uncomfortable symptoms were alleviated after a week and therefore no further diagnosis and treatment were done.\nShe occasionally suffered from the foreign body sensation and tingly sensation on the left neck area when turning her head within two months after onset of symptoms. She came to our hospital for further examination. Except for mild tenderness at the left neck, there are no other pathognomonic signs from the physical examination which are specifically related to a residual foreign body in the neck.\nAfter neck ultrasonography had been performed, the report revealed the presence of abnormal echo structure which was approximately 2.43 cm hyperechoic linear image embedded in the left part of the thyroid lobe and surrounded by a thin hypoechoic area (). Other routine examination showed no abnormalities, including blood examinations and thyroid function tests. Combined with medical history, the diagnosis was residual fish bone in the thyroid.\nIn order to remove the foreign body, the patient underwent an exploratory surgery. After isolating and cutting the left middle thyroid vein, a sharp object piercing the surface of the dorsal thyroid membrane was found. We held the tip of the object with a mosquito forceps and pulled it out gently. The sharp object was a fish bone about 2.45 cm in length ().

No malignancy was associated with the specimens recovered. In December of 2016, the abdominal pain persisted and a mass was palpable on physical examination in the mid-abdomen on the right. Colonoscopy was performed and biopsy showed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the caecum.\nCT was performed in December of 2016 and the primary right colon malignancy along with bilateral ovarian metastases were imaged. Percutaneous biopsy of the right ovarian mass showed well differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with a colonic primary. From December of 2016 through December of 2017, the patient was maintained on chemotherapy. Initially, she was treated with FOLFOX. After four cycles, because of neuropathy, the oxaliplatin was stopped. The patient was maintained on 5-fluorouracil and bevacizumab.\nIn December of 2017, a CT documented marked regression of the primary tumor. It was not visible by CT. However, multiple lymph nodes within the mesentery of the distal small bowel were enlarged. Also by CT a pelvic mass showed that the right ovary had increased in size to 15 cm in greatest diameter despite the fact that the primary caecal malignancy was no longer visible by CT.\nOver approximately one month the patient became rapidly more symptomatic with abdominal distention from ascites and an expanding right ovarian mass. On February 1, 2018 the patient underwent cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC in a specialized center for management of peritoneal metastases. At the time of surgery she underwent a greater omentectomy, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, complete pelvic peritonectomy, right colon resection, and small bowel resection. She received HIPEC with mitomycin C and doxorubicin with systemic fluorouracil.

She presented to the emergency medical centre for outpatients with abdominal pain and vomiting 3 h after being struck in the abdomen by a basketball. She had a slight fever but her other vital signs were stable. Her abdominal examination was revealed spontaneous pain and tenderness in the left upper quadrant. Plain abdominal radiography revealed abdominal intestinal gas and blood examination indicated moderately elevated serum amylase level. Hospitalisation was deemed necessary and she was transferred to our university hospital. She was hospitalised 4 h after injury. Blood tests were repeated () and they indicated an increase in white blood cell count and serum amylase level. However, other blood test results were normal. Free air and the colon cutoff sign were absent on abdominal radiography. However, abnormal bowel gas, which indicates paralytic ileus was observed in the abdomen X-rays. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to rule out traumatic intra-abdominal injury (). CT revealed a cystic mass measuring 55 mm at the pancreatic body and tail () with associated heterogeneous internal density and smooth rim enhancement ().

He had various symptoms, including dysphagia, foreign body sensation, and headache. Our patient had been treated by several specialists including an otolaryngologist, a neurologist, and another dentist, during the past few years with no relief or signs of improvement. At first presentation, he complained of constant neck pain and odynophagia; however, palpation of the tonsils did not worsen the pain. Our patient had no history of a trauma, surgical treatment, or neurological or infectious foci. After clinical examination and basic radiological diagnostics, an elongated SP was suspected as the cause of his problems. Computed tomography (CT) images showed a longer and thicker right SP when compared with the left side. Our patient was diagnosed with Eagle\u2019s syndrome in view of the neck pain and radiographic images (Fig. ). Analgesics (daily doses of meloxicam 10 mg) were administered to our patient; the condition was explained to him and operative treatment was recommended. Our patient declined the strong percutaneous approach; therefore, we decided to use the transoral approach. To minimize the risk of damage to the surrounding healthy tissue and difficulty in locating the SP, preoperative digital planning was performed for computed navigation.\nAn investigation of the cervical blood vessels on the right side demonstrated that the SP and the branches of the internal and external carotid arteries were located in proximity to each other. Therefore, accurate preoperative planning was essential. Furthermore, since the transoral approach was being employed, it was necessary to reproduce the same mouth opening conditions during the taking of preoperative images as that required during surgery. This is because the position of the SP and the blood vessels may change depending on the position of the mandible during the mouth opening",

His complaints had emerged over the past six month and were accompanied by slight night sweats and a moderate weight loss. Physical examination and routine laboratory studies on admission including hemoglobin, white blood count and C-reactive protein (CRP) were within normal range. Conventional radiographs of the chest and the thoracic spine revealed a compression fracture of the third thoracic vertebra (Th3) and a solitary pulmonary nodule of the left upper lobe (Figure ). On the basis of this coincidence, a pathological vertebral fracture secondary to metastatic lung cancer was suspected. The further work-up included a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and of the spine, which confirmed the thoracic vertebral compression fracture. Moreover, it revealed lytic destructions of the posterior margins of both adjacent vertebral bodies and showed an intraspinal soft tissue mass expanding between Th2 and Th5. Additionally, a tumorous lesion of the ventral left upper lobe was observed. Apparent mediastinal lymphadenopathy was interpreted as metastatic disease of the mediastinal lymph nodes (Figure ).

The patient had been at her usual baseline state of health with no significant past medical history prior to visiting the chiropractor for neck adjustment earlier that day for tension like soreness. The patient underwent neck manipulation after which she immediately complained of neck pain, diaphoresis, and proceeded to experience cardiac and respiratory arrest. Emergency Medical Services was called, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed with one round of epinephrine administered. It was reported that the patient was pulseless and apneic for 3 minutes prior to EMS arrival. The patient was intubated on transport and her Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3T prior to arrival. Mean arterial blood pressure was 80 with palpable femoral pulses at arrival to the emergency department. Upon arrival in the emergency department, a CT stroke protocol was performed which demonstrated bilateral severe distal cervical vertebral artery dissections with acute thrombotic emboli seen in the left cervical vertebral artery ( and ). This was accompanied by complete occlusion of the basilar tip including the proximal posterior cervical arteries.\nThe patient received an initial bolus of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV rtPA) at this time and the decision was made to proceed with endovascular intervention given the recent onset of occlusion. The patient was brought to the neurovascular angiography suite and femoral access obtained. Angiography of the left vertebral artery demonstrated severe dissection involving the distal cervical vertebral artery segments at the C1-C2 level with presence of sub occlusive thrombi. There was an occlusive clot in the left Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA).

    "original_text": "A 28-year-old Burmese pregnant woman was referred to our institute because of complicated pregnancy. Two years previously, she had a history of progressive dyspnea and orthopnea. A thorough investigation was carried out, a large left atrial mass was diagnosed, and she was scheduled for surgery. Due to economic problems and poor communication the patient was lost from the schedule and all attempts to contact her failed. She arrived at the hospital again and was pregnant. The pregnancy was unplanned and she had had no antenatal care. The estimated gestation by ultrasound was 24 weeks. The patient reported constant dyspnea on exertion in NYHA II without any progression in symptoms. On physical examination, vital signs were stable with a pansystolic murmur grade IV at apex. The chest film showed cardiomegaly and the cardio : thoracic ratio was 60%. Electrocardiography showed a normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria. On echocardiographic examination, as shown in , a large, smooth surface, mobile mass, measuring at least 9 \u00d7 4 cm was found in the left atrium. There was no calcification or bleeding in the mass. The stalk of the mass was attached to the interatrial septum. The mass protruded into the mitral valve orifice causing both significant left ventricular inflow obstruction and severe mitral regurgitation with mitral annular dilation. The left ventricle was dilated with a good ejection fraction at 70.1%. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic volumes were 53 mL and 157 mL, respectively. The estimated pulmonary pressure was 75 mmHg which indicated severe pulmonary hypertension.\nThe patient was admitted immediately. A multidisciplinary team was established to deal with this special situation including cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, obstetricians, anesthesiologists, pediatrics, and neonatologists.

At presentation, he reported no fever, no changes in his dialysate, and his abdominal pain was unrelated to his oral intakes. The past medical history was significant for hypertension and end stage renal disease (ESRD) for which he has been undergoing peritoneal dialysis since January 2017. His initial blood pressure was 210/111, and he was admitted to ICU/IMC for 24 h. He was then transferred to a regular medical ward. During his admission on the medical wards, the patient continued experiencing constant gnawing abdominal pain while undergoing his scheduled peritoneal dialysis. It was during these dialysis sessions on the medical floor that the drained dialysate fluid began to take on a cloudy characteristic and the patient developed a low-grade fever. This initially led the team to suspect bacterial peritonitis. The patient was placed on empiric ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Gram staining and fluid analysis of the dialysate showed presence of gram negative rods and peritoneal fluid samples showed a WBC count of 528 cells/\u00b5L with 25% neutrophils and 75% lymphocytes. After 4 days of non-improving pain, the patient\u2019s peritoneal dialysis catheter was removed and a hemodialysis catheter was subsequently placed so dialysis could continue. Five days after peritoneal fluids were sent, B. vesicularis was identified by our lab with antibiotic sensitivities still pending. Clinically the patient had greatly improved since the removal of the catheter, with resolution of both the abdominal pain and fevers.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary atherosclerosis, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He reported a prior history of sequential knee replacements with infections in each knee as well as a family history of immunoglobin deficiencies, which made him a very high risk for post-implantation infection. Initial implantation of a dual-chamber pacemaker was performed due to sick sinus syndrome. The device was placed in the left pectoral region without the utilization of a biological ECM pouch. At the initial two-week post-procedure wound check, erythema was observed at the incision with tenderness. Three weeks of oral antibiotics were administered, and the infection cleared without the removal of the device. A few years later, the patient developed congestive heart failure along with chronic right ventricular pacing, and the patient needed an upgrade of his dual-chamber pacemaker to a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) system. This device was implanted using a biological ECM pouch due to the patient's history of prior infection.\nSix weeks after the implantation of the CRT pacemaker, the patient was admitted to the hospital for a moderately sized hematoma and suspected infection of the device pocket and incision. Laser lead extraction of the complete device system was performed, and cultures obtained from the leads were determined to be acid-fast bacilli along with gram-negative rods. After a six-week regimen of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, the patient underwent device reimplantation on the contralateral side. Due to concern regarding the patient's high risk of CIED infection within the pocket as well as at the incision site, a 10 cm by 1 cm strip of biological ECM, commonly used for vascular reconstruction, was utilized in addition to a biological ECM pouch enclosing the device.

This was the second time over the last month that he experienced some palpitations and dyspnea with exertion. Previously, the patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction and had a stress echocardiogram which showed mild/moderate pulmonic stenosis, normal right ventricle, and thickened pulmonic valve with doming, but otherwise normal stress test. He was sent home from the emergency room with follow-up with his primary care physician and cardiologist. His cardiologist ordered a cardiac MRI to further evaluate the pulmonic valve. The MRI revealed a large mass starting near the pulmonic valve and extending into the main pulmonary artery and 4 cm into the right pulmonary artery and 3 cm into the left pulmonary artery (Fig ). The MRI findings were suspicious for a pulmonary artery sarcoma. The patient was admitted into the hospital for further evaluation of the mass. Although the patient's vital signs were stable with normal oxygen saturation he was started on heparin due to suspicion of a thromboembolism. CT scan of the chest was done which showed the large pulmonary artery mass and 2 small 9 mm nodular densities of the right lung without lymphadenopathy (Fig ). PET-FDG showed uptake in the pulmonary artery trunk, but the 2 nodules did not show abnormal FDG uptake. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and the pulmonary artery mass and 2 lung wedge resections were completely excised. Frozen section evaluation was consistent with sarcoma.\nGross pathology showed a large intimal sarcoma filling the pulmonary artery (Fig ). It infiltrated the arterial media without extension into the adventitia. The neoplasm consisted of spindled and stellate-shaped cells deposited in variably myxoid stroma (Fig ).

    "cleaned_text": "a 51 year old previously healthy male presented to the emergency room with complaints of dyspnea, chest pain and palpitations while playing tennis. this was the second time over the last month that he experienced some palpitations and dyspnea with exertion. previously, the patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction and had a stress echocardiogram which showed mild/moderate pulmonic stenosis, normal right ventricle, and thickened pulmonic valve with doming, but otherwise normal stress test. he was sent home from the emergency room with follow-up with his primary care physician and cardiologist. his cardiologist ordered a cardiac mri to further evaluate the pulmonic valve. the mri revealed a large mass starting near the pulmonic valve and extending into the main pulmonary artery and 4 cm into the right pulmonary artery and 3 cm into the left pulmonary artery (fig ). the mri findings were suspicious for a pulmonary artery sarcoma. the patient was admitted into the hospital for further evaluation of the mass. although the patient's vital signs were stable with normal oxygen saturation he was started on heparin due to suspicion of a thromboembolism. ct scan of the chest was done which showed the large pulmonary artery mass and 2 small 9 mm nodular densities of the right lung without lymphadenopathy (fig ). pet-fdg showed uptake in the pulmonary artery trunk, but the 2 nodules did not show abnormal fdg uptake. cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and the pulmonary artery mass and 2 lung wedge resections were completely excised. frozen section evaluation was consistent with sarcoma.\ngross pathology showed a large intimal sarcoma filling the pulmonary artery (fig ). it infiltrated the arterial media without extension into the adventitia. the neoplasm consisted of spindled and stellate-shaped cells deposited in variably myxoid stroma (fig ). the 2 lung wedges were positive for metastatic sarcoma.\nthe patient tolerated the surgery well and was discharged with oncology follow-up as an outpatient. adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and ifosfamide was initiated soon thereafter. eighteen months later and",

She denied a history of fever on admission, but was treated with cyclophosphamide 1 month prior for an episode of cerebral lupus. She had noticed a papule over the left deltoid region which progressed to an ulcer over 1 week. Fever was noted following several days of hospital admission and the ulcer site became painful. She had worked in paddy fields several months prior to the admission when she was in good health. However, she could not recall any precipitating injury at the affected site during working. She is a mother of two and both pregnancies were uncomplicated. She denied history of alcohol abuse or smoking.\nOn examination she was emaciated and had a GCS score of 15/15 following recovery of status epilepticus. There was no obvious lymphadenopathy. At presentation, the size of the ulcer was about a 3 cm lesion and it gradually developed in to an ulcer with a necrotic center with surrounding erythema. A tentative diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum was made with the appearance of the ulcer (Figure ). It gradually advanced into the underlying muscle over 3 weeks of onset despite the antibiotic treatment. Examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory systems, and the abdomen was normal.\nHer full blood count, blood picture, and other supportive investigations showed evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia, which was suggestive of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura which resolved following plasmapheresis. Her ESR was persistently normal. Renal functions were stable during hospital stay, so were the liver profile. Chest radiography revealed evidence of bilateral mild pleural effusions and echocardiography revealed a thin rim of pericardial effusion and good cardiac function.

He was 160 kg at the time of presentation with a BMI of 55.36 kg/m2. He was diagnosed to have cirrhosis with persistently high bilirubin which fluctuated between 2 and 5 mg/dL. His Child's score at presentation was B9 with a MELD score of 14. Extensive evaluation for the etiology of liver disease including viral markers and autoimmune markers and iron and copper studies were all negative. There was no history of alcohol intake; hence, in view of morbid obesity and dyslipidemia, the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis for cirrhosis was considered. His gastroduodenoscopy showed small varices with portal hypertensive gastropathy, and a triple-phase CT scan of the abdomen showed a shrunken liver with splenomegaly, multiple portosystemic collaterals, and no ascites. He was listed for deceased donor liver transplantation and advised weight reduction with dietary and behavioral measures. However, he did not show any significant improvement over the next three months. Since he was morbidly obese and had failed medical therapy for weight reduction, he was planned for bariatric surgery after counseling for worsening of liver disease in the postoperative period and a possible requirement for immediate liver transplantation in that eventuality. A prospective living donor was identified in the family and completely worked up in case the patient showed signs of worsening liver disease following bariatric surgery. He underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and had a smooth postoperative course. Following bariatric surgery, he had a significant reduction of weight from 160 kg to 102 kg in six-month period. However he developed worsening of his liver disease in the form of progressive jaundice, ascites, and recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy. His Child's score worsened from B9 to C12, and MELD score increased to 24 over the next six months. In the absence of availability of cadaveric donor, living donor liver transplantation was considered as his weight had now decreased",
