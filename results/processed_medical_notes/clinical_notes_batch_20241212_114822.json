Periosteum was seen exposed in lower third of tibia and wound was badly contaminated. Radiographs of the leg showed a distal third tibia fracture with a segmental piece of tibia which was further comminuted. The fibula fracture was at the same level as tibia and was short oblique fracture. Patient presented immediately after the injury and debridement was done within 2 hours of injury. A thorough wash was given with debridement of all dead and devitalized tissue. Fracture was fixed using a biplanar external fixator (). Wound dressing was done regularly and intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics were given. Two further debridements were needed and at 4 weeks the wound was healthy enough to perform a cross leg flap. At 3 weeks post flap surgery, the external fixator was removed due to multiple pin track infections and the limb was immobilized in a long leg cast. At 3 and half months post injury the wound was healthy. Radiographs showed that the segmental tibia fragment was showing good union response at the proximal end; however the distal end appeared to be rounded with attempt to callus formation which is non bridging ().

The imaging was relevant for a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 \u00d7 109/L. The patient elected to proceed with surgical intervention for hernia repair.\nThe patient presented to the hospital setting for his elective right inguinal hernia repair. A classic oblique incision was made in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks. The external oblique aponeurosis was opened and the hernia isolated and examined. The hernia was noted to be comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum that had a chronic, scarred appearance. The base of the appendix could be seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity. Initially, there was no indication to perform an appendectomy at the time of the procedure if the appendix could be successfully reduced into the abdominal cavity. However, the chronic appearing adhesions in the area prevented this step. In order to reduce the appendix at that point, a relaxing incision was then made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum entered",

There was no mural nodule, no calcification, and no eccentrically located mass within the cystic area. The benign mucinous cystic tumor of the pancreas was the most favorable preoperative diagnosis.

At this point, the surgeon sat at the surgical console located about 3 m from the operating table. The assistant surgeon was positioned on the patient's left side for temporary use of laparoscopic instruments through Port 4. In spite of our previous experiences of robot surgical system, the cystic tumor and the remaining splenic vessels were so closely adherent that bleeding was frequently encountered, and most operation time was spent for this process. The risk of cyst rupture was also considered when we tried to separate and divide the small splenic vessels from pancreatic cyst (). Therefore, concomitant segmental resection of splenic vessels was thought to be necessary for spleen preservation.

On clinical examination, he could move the fingers of the hand and there was no evidence of any neurovascular deficit distal to the injury. Crepitus could be felt in the distal part of the radius just proximal to wrist joint and movements around the wrist were painful and limited. There were no other associated injuries, and medical history was not significant for any medical illness. A clinical diagnosis of the fracture of lower end radius was made and radiographs were consistent with the clinical diagnosis. Radiographs showed a comminuted fracture of the distal third radius with intra-articular extension for which open reduction and internal fixation through a volar FCR approach was planned. He underwent the definitive treatment of open reduction and internal fixation of the fractures distal radius under regional anesthesia. We had planned to fix the distal radius fracture using the usual FCR approach using 3.5 mm distal end radius locking plate. We could not identify the absence of the FCR tendon preoperatively because of severe swelling of the distal forearm. The incision was made at its usual location and we identified one tendon in the superficial plane which we thought was FCR, but when we traced the tendon proximally it started thinning without any muscle belly and when traced distally to its attachment, it was confirmed to be tendon of palmaris longus (PL). We could not find any tendon between PL and the traced radial artery. At that stage, we realized that FCRL was absent in that patient. We wrongly identified the PL tendon as the FCR because it was the tendinous structure at the most radial location of the volar distal forearm. When we found the median nerve just radial to the PL tendon, we were then able to identify the anatomical abnormality described in this case and immediate post-operative X-ray (-). Therefore, we changed the approach to the classic Hen",

Medical history included chronic Hepatitis C virus infection with no other medical conditions reported. The patient was allowed to decide which hip would be performed first. 5 months after scheduling, the patient was admitted for surgery arriving in a wheelchair, and new pelvis radiographs were taken (). Other causes of the rapid destruction of the hip joint were ruled out, and the patient was diagnosed of bilateral RDO. Keeping in mind a possible septic etiology, despite there was no history of septicemia and inflammatory markers were elevated due to chronic hepatitis, we decided to take samples for microbiology and histology during the procedures. The right hip was performed through an anterior approach by a senior surgeon following standard antibiotic prophylaxis with 2 g of cefazolin 20 min before skin incision. An uncemented prosthesis was implanted with no complications. Femoral head destruction led to an important defect in the posterior and superior wall of the acetabulum. This conditioned high and medial implantation of the cup to achieve stability. 4 days after the first procedure was performed, one out of six cultures was positive for Enterococcus faecium with no local and systemic signs of infection or pain. Synovial biopsy revealed fibrosis, chronic inflammation, calcifications, macrophages, and osteoclast giant cells with no signs of acute inflammation. Urine cultures were negative. The Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria [] were not met and the patient did not receive antibiotic treatment. 6 days later, after a favorable post-operative evolution, the left hip was performed through a posterior approach by a different senior surgeon with the same hip system but with a cemented stem (). In the left hip, the acetabulum was also affected by the bone destruction, but the cup was able to be placed at a correct height.

Approximately one month prior to her representation, she was struck in the left knee by a basketball and developed worsening pain. She was seen by an orthopedic surgeon (December 1999) and was noted to have a valgus posture of both lower extremities, exaggerated on the left by external rotation and she walked with a mild limp. The left knee had no effusion but was hypersensitive to light touch over the lateral aspect where there was soft tissue swelling just below the knee. There was no obvious mass in the area, although firm palpation was difficult because of patient discomfort. Plain films were normal and an MR was ordered that revealed an apparent meniscal cyst in the lateral aspect of the left knee [Figure ]. Biopsy of the cystic structure was performed (November 1999) that revealed a high-grade synovial cell sarcoma. Metastatic work-up consisting of nuclear bone scan and CT of the chest were negative. Amputation was offered by the local care team that included a radiation oncologist because of their concern about possible contamination of the joint space and uncertain functional outcome. The patient was referred to St. Jude Children's Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nAt the time of her evaluation after referral (January 2000), there was a well healed scar with no excessive swelling.

He reported a 37 kg unintentional weight loss over 6 months with postprandial abdominal pain and nausea. In addition, he had exertional angina relieved by rest and sublingual nitrates. He had an abdominal CT scan for evaluation of the hernia, and this demonstrated severe atherosclerotic abdominal aortic disease with occlusion of the origin of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries and patency of the inferior mesenteric artery. This was confirmed by mesenteric angiography which demonstrated occlusion of the celiac and SMA with a large mesenteric collateral originating from the inferior mesenteric artery (). This artery had a 90% orifice stenosis. With his cardiac history and symptoms, he underwent coronary angiography, which demonstrated significant left main and 3-vessel CAD (). Left ventricular function was preserved with no valvular heart disease by transthoracic echocardiography.\nHe was referred initially for evaluation for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and reported a brief episode of slurred speech in the past 2 months. A carotid duplex was obtained and showed 80\u201399% left internal carotid artery stenosis and 50\u201379% right internal carotid artery stenosis. Given his severe symptomatic carotid and mesenteric arterial disease, there would be significantly greater risk of neurological and mesenteric ischemic complications associated with CABG. The decision was made to perform surgical revascularization to address each vascular system in a staged and combined manner.\nThe patient underwent uncomplicated left carotid endarterectomy and was admitted postoperatively. He had no neurologic complications and was taken for combined CABG and mesenteric bypass on the fourth postoperative day. After induction of anesthesia and placement of hemodynamic monitoring lines, the procedure was initiated with a median sternotomy and mobilization of the left internal mammary artery as a pedicled graft.

His comorbidities included chronic renal failure, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia. He had undergone an endovascular AAA repair 9 years previously for treatment of a 5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. This treatment was complicated by the subsequent development of bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms. In attempting to endovascularly repair these aneurysms 3 years after the initial surgery, a rupture of the right external iliac artery necessitated placement of a covered stent across the origin of the right internal iliac artery and into the body of the main aortic endograft. Ongoing surveillance of his aortoiliac system with duplex ultrasound demonstrated the gradual development of bilateral IIA aneurysms. A dedicated CT angiogram performed 6 years after the IIA origin was covered showing the sac having expanded to a diameter 6.4 cm. The source of expansion was thought to be a type II endoleak from collaterals originating in left iliac system. Endovascular embolisation of these vessels was attempted via a left sided femoral artery puncture, with angiography demonstrating the origin of the endoleak being the right superior gluteal artery that was being fed through a plexus of collateral channels through the body of the sacrum. It was not possible to cannulate these vessels with a microcatheter, and therefore endovascular treatment of the endoleak was not possible. The patient was offered an open procedure to manage the enlarging IIA aneurysm, which was declined due to the significant risks in light of the patient's previous abdominal interventions and poor overall health ().\nThe decision was made to treat the aneurysm via direct puncture method employing a posterior approach under CT visualisation. Under general anaesthetic and with the patient in a prone position, CT guidance was used to insert a 17-gauge needle into the right superior gluteal artery. The artery was accessed via a transgluteal approach with the catheter passing through the sciatic notch. Contrast injection in the angiography suite confirmed the catheter to be situated",

The swelling had been gradually increasing in size over the last 8 months with dull continuous pain in the eye and periorbital area. There was progressive diminution of vision for the last 6 months in the affected eye, and at the time of presentation in the hospital, the affected eye was completely blind. The progressive increase in the size of the swelling and pain in and around the eye compelled the patient to avail hospital services. The treatment history was not significant. The patient was being treated by a local doctor with eye drops and certain oral medicines the records of which were not available with her. She did not have any history of significant ocular disease or any ophthalmic surgery. There was no history of similar disease in the family.\nOn examination, an intraorbital mass protruding from the left eye was visible. Axial proptosis with stretched out sclera along with dilated blood vessels covering the entire exposed part of the eye ball was seen. The underlying cornea was barely visible through the widened palpebral aperture with hyperemic keratinized conjunctiva tissue. The swelling was more prominent in the region superior to the upper eye lid. The skin appeared stretched along with dilated vessels in the superior part of the eye ball []. On palpation, the mass was tender and soft in consistency. Fundus examination was not possible because of overlying vascularized keratinized tissue over cornea. The intraocular tension was also not recorded because of these reasons. The status of the pupil of the diseased eye could also not be commented upon, even though it appeared slightly dilated.

He had a history of systolic heart failure with a left ventricle ejection fraction of 20%. In the emergency department atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate was noted with a heart rate of 140. A diltiazem infusion was started and he was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. Repeat echocardiogram several days later showed progressive worsening of his ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 18%. He was started on inotropic support and underwent placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) to assist with hemodynamic stability. Approximately 24 hours later the patient had an episode of melena associated with a drop in his hemoglobin from 10.1 to 7.7. He was started on proton pump inhibitor infusion. He underwent emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed erythema and erosions in the gastric fundus compatible with gastritis as well as grade 1 reflux esophagitis but no evidence of active bleeding. A Helicobacter pylori stool antigen was found to be negative. A colonoscopy was performed after hemodynamic stabilization for further evaluation of melena and pretransplant screen. This was positive for abnormal vascularity, congestion, nodularity, erosions, erythema, and ulceration in the cecum and ascending colon suggestive of ischemic colitis which was later confirmed by biopsy (). Given the unusual involvement of nonwatershed areas such as the cecum and ascending colon, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast was performed to evaluate the celiac and mesenteric vasculature. There was no significant narrowing of either vessel noted on the CT; however the inferior metallic marker of the IABP was found to be inferior to the origin of the superior mesenteric artery ().

At that time, a tortuous basilar artery had been found, but without any aneurysmal dilatation (). She had undergone endovascular trapping of the giant fusiform aneurysm, involving the petrous to cavernous parts of the right ICA, at another hospital (). However, she developed severe headache seven months after the treatment. At the time of admission, she complained of progressive dyspnea, as well as dull headache in the occipital area. Neurologic examination revealed a 6th cranial nerve palsy on the right side and increased deep tendon reflexes in the four extremities. On MR imaging, a giant aneurysm of the basilar artery was found to be compressing the brain stem (). Cerebral angiography showed a fusiform giant aneurysm, with an irregular contour, involving the basilar trunk (). The left anterior inferior cerebellar artery originated just proximal to the basilar trunk aneurysm. In addition, another de novo small paraclinoid aneurysm was found on the left ICA.\nTo relieve the brain stem compression, we decided to obliterate the basilar trunk aneurysm in spite of the risk associated with this intervention.

Colonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were performed, but the bleeding site was not clear in the visible range of the stomach, duodenum, and colon. On hospital day 2, capsule endoscopy was performed, and bleeding from the small intestine was detected. On hospital day 3, the patient developed shock due to massive bleeding. Hence, emergency transcatheter arterial embolization was performed. He had a history of surgery for anal atresia and small bowel stoma as a neonate, and he required hemodialysis because of chronic renal failure with bilateral kidney malformations. Computed tomography performed before transcatheter arterial embolization showed that the anatomy of the left common iliac artery was normal. However, the right external iliac artery was defective. Blood from the right common iliac artery flowed directly into a traveling vessel: the internal iliac artery. The blood vessel descended at an acute angle to the pelvic floor, and then, it rose and flowed into the femoral artery (Fig. ). We chose to insert the catheter from the left femoral artery and then further selectively advanced the catheter to the superior mesenteric artery, which is the responsible vessel for gastrointestinal bleeding. Regarding the superior mesenteric artery, the branch from the aorta was at the same level as the celiac artery, and the right hepatic artery originated from the superior mesenteric artery. But angiography did not show a clear extravasation from either branch of the superior mesenteric artery. Small intestinal endoscopy was performed on hospital day 8. However, it was impossible to advance the endoscope because the small intestinal adhesion was very strong. Thereafter, there was no massive bleeding. He was discharged home on hospital day 20 after red blood cell transfusion. Later, he was hospitalized again for small intestinal resection. In the abdominal cavity, the small intestine was firmly adhered. First, 30 cm of the adhered small intestine was resected.

There was a patent anterior communicating artery with brisk cross filling of the left cerebral vasculature from the contralateral right side as well as patent left PCOM artery. Considering the complex anatomy, size of aneurysm and presence of good collaterals with patent anterior and PCOM artery, a plan was made in another hospital to treat the aneurysm with parent vessel occlusion rather than flow diverter stent. Subsequently, the aneurysm was treated in October 2016. Initially, a balloon occlusion test of the left ICA was performed which was negative for any neurological change during 20 minutes of balloon occlusion with blood pressure challenge as well. Subsequently, occlusion of the left ICA proximal to the aneurysm was performed using multiple coils (, ). There was no antegrade flow into the left ICA after occlusion with a patent flow into the left cerebral hemisphere through a patent anterior and PCOM arteries (, ). Angiogram of the left vertebral artery after occlusion of left ICA showed retrograde filling of the left ICA para-ophthalmic aneurysm (, ). This was considered to occlude overtime considering the competing antegrade intracranial flow. Patient remained asymptomatic after the treatment. Follow up angiogram after 6 months and 2 years demonstrated no antegrade flow in the left ICA, however there was persistent filling of the left ICA aneurysm in a retrograde fashion through the PCOM artery (). The aneurysm was followed up for another year and showed no evidence of occlusion with similar retrograde filling through the PCOM artery with no much change in its size. At this stage, considering the persistent filling of aneurysm, treatment was contemplated and the patient was transferred to our institution",

Physical examination was done in the emergency department and revealed stable vital signs; the patient was conscious, moving all his limbs; there were warm palpable pulses of the upper arms.\nThe CTA of the aorta revealed a large dissection flap from the origin of the left subclavian artery extending down all the way to the level of renal arteries; there was enlargement of the false lumen at the proximal aorta with large aneurysmal dilatation (mural thrombus) and a compression of the true lumen (ascending aorta). Additionally, there was a large entry point seen 2 cm distal to the right subclavian artery. The aberrant right subclavian artery was noted crossing posterior to the trachea and arising as a last branch of the aortic arch distal to the left subclavian artery; also, the left vertebral artery was arising directly from the aortic arch. There was no other evidence of vascular dissection or occlusion below the level of the renal arteries (Figures and ).\nThe patient underwent general anesthesia for thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) two days after his first day of admission; the procedure was done through the right femoral approach; an angiogram was performed intraoperatively (). Stent graft with a size of 34 mm \u00d7 15 cm was used and deployed into the descending thoracic aorta; the intimal entry tear was completely covered by the stent, and the false lumen was obliterated.

Physical examination was done in the emergency department and revealed stable vital signs; the patient was conscious, moving all his limbs; there were warm palpable pulses of the upper arms.\nThe CTA of the aorta revealed a large dissection flap from the origin of the left subclavian artery extending down all the way to the level of renal arteries; there was enlargement of the false lumen at the proximal aorta with large aneurysmal dilatation (mural thrombus) and a compression of the true lumen (ascending aorta). Additionally, there was a large entry point seen 2 cm distal to the right subclavian artery. The aberrant right subclavian artery was noted crossing posterior to the trachea and arising as a last branch of the aortic arch distal to the left subclavian artery; also, the left vertebral artery was arising directly from the aortic arch. There was no other evidence of vascular dissection or occlusion below the level of the renal arteries (Figures and ).\nThe patient underwent general anesthesia for thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) two days after his first day of admission; the procedure was done through the right femoral approach; an angiogram was performed intraoperatively (). Stent graft with a size of 34 mm \u00d7 15 cm was used and deployed into the descending thoracic aorta; the intimal entry tear was completely covered by the stent, and the false lumen was obliterated.

At the admission, physical examination revealed pain and tenderness in the right lower quadrant with no signs of bowel obstruction, mimicking an acute appendicitis. Laboratory investigation has not shown important pathological signs. Ultrasonography examination of the abdomen showed a contracted gallbladder with normal bile ducts, no pathologies affecting the pancreas and neither free fluid, nor signs of acute appendicitis. In consideration of the clinical status of the patient and the persistent acute abdominal pain even with a negative ultrasound, a CT scan was performed to better comprehend the nature of the underling pathology. CT scan was performed four hours after the hospital admission, and demonstrated a thickened cecal wall with a small number of pathological nearby lymph nodes, confirming the absence of peritoneal free fluid. Given the absence of radiological signs of GI perforations and of other surgical and medical emergencies, we decided to perform a colonoscopy to better understand the etiology of the underling pathology. Colonoscopy was performed 24 hours after the hospital admission and after an adequate bowel preparation and revealed a massive, ulcerated, stenotic and necrotic lesion that involved the caecum and the right colon. Biopsies of the lesion were performed and the microscopic examination showed a cell proliferation composed by large, pleomorphic cellular elements with vesicular nuclei, hyperchromatic nucleoli and eosinophilic cytoplasm, mixed with necrotic tissue.

Eight years earlier the same patient, who had a known history of gastric ulcers, presented with a similar clinical picture to a different surgical unit. On admission he showed signs of haemorrhagic shock with a haemoglobin level (Hg) of 7 g dL. Emergency upper GI endoscopy was unable to identify the source of bleeding due to large volumes of blood in the stomach. Surgical treatment with a laparotomy was decided and the intraoperative findings demonstrated an acute gastric hemorrhage secondary to a massive propyloric ulcerative lesion. Resection of the lesion was decided and a distal gastrectomy and Billroth II reconstruction performed. The subsequent histology revealed a <2 cm gastrointestinal stromal tumour, with a mitotic rate of < 5 mitosis/50 per HPF, lacking necrosis and localized to the gastric mucosa.

She was evaluated by an x-ray abdomen that revealed multiple air fluid levels and the CT \u2013 Scan of the abdomen revealed a circumferential growth involving the sigmoid colon with impending perforation and small loculated collections reaching to the superior border of urinary bladder and uterus extending to the lateral abdominal wall suggesting micro abscesses. Gastroscopy performed was normal and the colonoscopy was inconclusive due to narrowing proximal to the sigmoid colon ( and ).\nThe patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and sigmoid colectomy subsequently. The findings were an exophytic sigmoid colon tumor proliferating extraluminally with small bowel adhesions. Tumor was adherent to the lateral pelvic abdominal wall with a subcutaneous abscess pocket. Tumor perforation in sigmoid colon was noted with minimal contamination. Tumor was found infiltrating the lateral wall of uterus. No ascites, lymphadenopathy or free peritoneal/omental deposits were noted.\nThe histopathology report of the patient suggested a moderately differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma with a single sclerosed lymph node suggesting tumor metastasis with foreign body giant cell reaction ().\nThe patient underwent extensive evaluation by gynecology and urology departments to identify a possible primary source of malignancy in the urogenital tract. Their evaluations were negative. The patient did not have any skin lesions or ulcers suggesting skin primary as the source.\nThe patient recovered well from the surgery with parental nutrition support. She was ambulatory and was given oral feeds on 7th postoperative day. Subsequent CT Scan of the abdomen suggested a small fluid collection at the site of surgical anastomosis with few air pockets suggesting abscess formation/leakage.

    "original_text": "The adverse reaction to clozapine occurred in a 57-year-old married Caucasian woman with a long history of treatment-resistant chronic schizophrenia (ICD10 F20) who has required continuing care in hospital for many years, due to the severity of her condition. She first developed schizophrenia at around the age of 18 and has received antipsychotic medication for almost 40 years. There is a family history of schizophrenia with her son and a maternal cousin both having the condition. Despite the recognized advantages of treating many patients with schizophrenia in community settings, her symptoms - both positive and negative - have been resistant to a range of treatments and as a consequence she has been in hospital since 1985. Periodically, the patient can also exhibit challenging behaviour that requires skilled nursing support; on occasion, she has required nursing in the intensive psychiatric care unit rather than the rehabilitation ward. The patient has been prescribed many different antipsychotics over the 40 year duration of her illness, including second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic medication, with unfortunately no benefit to symptoms or functioning. A trial of clozapine in June 2003 was discontinued about a month later following development of acute renal failure, when she required transfer to the general hospital unit. At that time, the renal failure was attributed to clozapine by internal medicine specialists, although the patient was also taking lithium at this time, and developed secondary lithium toxicity with a peak lithium of 2.2 mmol/L before all medication was discontinued.\nIn November 2007, after a multidisciplinary case review, it was decided that the patient might benefit from a retrial of clozapine, especially given her failure to benefit from all atypical antipsychotics available in the UK. This was considered a reasonable strategy given that the adverse renal effects seen previously when clozapine had been introduced, were thought to have been caused, or exacerbated by, lithium carbonate.

    "cleaned_text": "the adverse reaction to clozapine occurred in a 57-year-old married caucasian woman with a long history of treatment-resistant chronic schizophrenia (icd10 f20) who has required continuing care in hospital for many years, due to the severity of her condition. she first developed schizophrenia at around the age of 18 and has received antipsychotic medication for almost 40 years. there is a family history of schizophrenia with her son and a maternal cousin both having the condition. despite the recognized advantages of treating many patients with schizophrenia in community settings, her symptoms - both positive and negative - have been resistant to a range of treatments and as a consequence she has been in hospital since 1985. periodically, the patient can also exhibit challenging behaviour that requires skilled nursing support; on occasion, she has required nursing in the intensive psychiatric care unit rather than the rehabilitation ward. the patient has been prescribed many different antipsychotics over the 40 year duration of her illness, including second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic medication, with unfortunately no benefit to symptoms or functioning. a trial of clozapine in june 2003 was discontinued about a month later following development of acute renal failure, when she required transfer to the general hospital unit. at that time, the renal failure was attributed to clozapine by internal medicine specialists, although the patient was also taking lithium at this time, and developed secondary lithium toxicity with a peak lithium of 2.2 mmol/l before all medication was discontinued.\nin november 2007, after a multidisciplinary case review, it was decided that the patient might benefit from a retrial of clozapine, especially given her failure to benefit from all atypical antipsychotics available in the uk. this was considered a reasonable strategy given that the adverse renal effects seen previously when clozapine had been introduced, were thought to have been caused, or exacerbated by, lithium carbonate. given the severe and refractory nature of the patient's condition, and taking into account the circumstances of the previous trial of clozapine, there appeared compelling grounds for a reintroduction of clozapine. the patient's",

While it had not noticeably increased in size over the last year, the mass had recently started to produce dull pain.\nThe patient's past medical history was notable only for gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypercholesterolemia, and an overweight BMI of 29.1. When prompted, she denied any history of back trauma or back surgery. During the patient's physical examination, it was difficult to identify the mass at the location she indicated. After palpation in various positions, the mass was finally identified when she was instructed to stand and flex her back forward. In this position, a mass approximately 5 cm in diameter was palpable several centimeters inferior to the point the patient had indicated. The mass was soft and mobile with a smooth border.

This was associated with nausea and loss of appetite, made worse by movement and not relieved with intramuscular morphine injection. There was no history of recent or past trauma to the chest or abdomen. On examination, she was tender in the right upper quadrant and right iliac fossa with rebound and guarding, with a Rovsing positive sign and normal bowel sounds. She was incidentally found to have some marfanoid features including the long span of upper limbs, a high arched palate and the very soft early diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation. The patient had a positive family history of Marfan's syndrome but had never undergone genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis.\nA likely diagnosis of appendicitis was made on the clinical picture associated with a pyrexia and raised white cell count and C \u2013 reactive protein. Her abdominal X-ray at that time showed absence of gas in the right side of her bowel. Her chest X-ray did not show any obvious abnormality (Figure )\nShe was taken to theatre the same day for appendicectomy through a standard right iliac fossa incision. There was a small amount of free fluid but the right iliac fossa was filled with a normal looking gall bladder and small bowel only with no sign of the caecum, appendix, ascending or proximal transverse colon. The terminal ileum was found to run up under the right lobe of the liver towards the hilum. The right iliac fossa wound was closed and we proceeded to an exploratory laparoscopy.\nAt laparoscopy, the liver was retracted to see under the right liver lobe. The proximal transverse colon was found to be running up towards the liver hilum were it felt to be tethered. This suggested a possible herniation of the right colon into the chest. The procedure was abandoned and a CT thorax and abdomen were performed to define the anatomy involved.",

Treatment included SMT to the spinal levels thought to have restricted motion, soft-tissue treatment to the musculature of the upper back and a recommendation for core stability exercises. On a subsequent visit RH reported that she could neither lie prone on the treatment table nor could she perform even the most basic core stability exercises because to do so would result in severe abdominal pain, throat tightness and headache.

    "original_text": "An 87-year-old woman presented to the accident and emergency department after sustaining a fall while on holiday. She complained of pain and reduced range of movement in her left shoulder. Her past medical history included hypertension atrial fibrillation, for which she took aspirin 75 mg once a day. She had previously undergone a thyroidectomy in 2000 for hyperthyroidism. She was otherwise fit and well with no known drug allergies.\nOn examination her left arm was bruised and painful when movements were attempted. Her distal neurovascular status of the affected limb was normal with no deficit detected. Plain film radiographs of her left shoulder demonstrated a minimally displaced and impacted fracture of her proximal humerus (as shown in ). After discussion with the orthopaedic registrar on call she was placed in a collar and cuff and sent home to attend the next available fracture clinic.\nWhen she was reviewed in the following fracture clinic it was noted that she had developed a swelling and erythema on the left side of her neck in the distribution of her external jugular vein (as shown in ). It was also found that the collar and cuff had been applied rather tightly. She was referred to the on call ENT registrar who made a diagnosis of thrombophlebitis of her external jugular vein. Further questioning did not reveal a history of further thrombotic events. The ENT registrar felt the erythema may be developing cellulitis and so started the patient on antibiotics (flucloxacillin 500 mg four times a day for 5 days) and placed her in a better fitting sling. The fracture was deemed suitable for nonsurgical management with regular clinical and radiological follow-up. As she was only on holiday in the region, further follow-up was arranged for two weeks in her local hospital.\nTwo days later, she represented to the accident and emergency department with pain and gross pitting oedema in her left arm. A Doppler scan demonstrated near complete occlusion of the left subclavian and axillary veins consistent with a deep vein thrombosis. She was started on",
