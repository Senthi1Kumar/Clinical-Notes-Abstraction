She suffered from end-stage renal disease since 2007 because of aHUS due to a heterozygous disease-causing mutation resulting in a two base deletion with frameshift in the membrane cofactor protein (MCP) gene which leads to a STOP codon at AA 254. At the time she was treated with plasma exchange. In 2014 she underwent kidney transplantation. The kidney donor was a 58 year old male who died of myocardial infarction. The organ quality was considered good due to absence of any chronic alterations and achievement of primary function with a serum-creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL. In the following 2 years the patient suffered from progressively worsening transplant function which was assumed to be the consequence of a severe cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection with encephalitis and the need for nephrotoxic antiviral therapy. Unfortunately, no biopsy was performed to validate that assumption. Subsequently, in December 2018 she developed ESRD again and was treated with hemodialysis since then. The patient remained on the calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) tacrolimus as immunosuppressive therapy to avoid immunization since further kidney transplantation was planned. On admission an abdominal X-Ray showed no pathological findings, however an ultrasound suggested intussusception of the small intestine (Fig. a). Additionally, a contrast enhanced CT-scan of the abdomen showed inflammatory wall thickening of the small intestine (Fig. b).

She described the pain as sharp in nature, 10 over 10 in severity, localised to the left lower side of the chest with radiation to the left shoulder tip. She said that her pain got worse with a deep breath or any movements. She denied any previous history of similar pain. She reported feeling nauseated with multiple episodes of non-bilious, non-projectile, non-bloody vomiting. Her review of systems was positive for decreased appetite, subjective fever with frequent rigours and sweats. She denied measuring her temperature at home. Social history was significant for intravenous cocaine and subcutaneous morphine abuse. Family history was positive for premature coronary artery disease in her brother and pancreatic cancer in her son. On physical examination, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 175/103 mm Hg, heart rate 113 beats per minute, temperature 36.7\u00b0C, respiratory rate 22 per minute and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Her oral mucosa was dry. There was reproducible chest tenderness in the left lower side. Heart sounds S1 and S2 were heard without any murmurs, rubs or gallops. Lungs were clear to auscultation with good air entry bilaterally. Her abdomen appeared normal on gross inspection. Normal bowel sounds were heard in all four quadrants.

Her chest computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a diffuse infiltrative mass lesion in the anterior chest wall with bilateral pleural effusion and multiple metastatic lymphadenopathies in both the neck and axilla. The abdomen-pelvis CT scan revealed multiple liver, lymph nodes, and abdominal wall metastases.

    "original_text": "A 52-year-old male patient complained of pleuritic pain of the right chest, a persistent cough, and yellowish blood-tinged sputum for two months. He had been diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and completely recovered after medical treatment; he had no other underlying diseases. The patient was a heavy daily drinker and had lost 7 kg over the previous six months before admission to the hospital. His blood pressure was 125/80 mmHg, pulse rate was 100/min, and body temperature was normal. Right breathing sounds were decreased with crackles. Chest radiographs showed old tuberculosis scars and a newly developed empyema in the right lung field (). Tomography showed several cavitary lesions of different sizes, some of which had fluid collection, which suggested an infected cyst, an old tuberculosis scar, or active tuberculosis. Partial calcification of the pleura, pleural thickening, and pleural effusion were also found (). A yellowish substance was located in the lumen of the right upper lobe apical segmental bronchus at bronchoscopy and a pathologic examination of the substance was performed. The pathologist reported the substance to be pulmonary aspergillosis ().\nThe empyema was drained through a percutaneous catheter and air leakage was observed. Amphotericin B (AMB) was injected after the patient was diagnosed with pulmonary aspergillosis.

Conventional radiography of the knee demonstrated an osteochondral flake near the medial patellar margin, whereas the femoral fracture remained unnoticed (Figure ).

Surgical treatment consisted of diagnostic arthroscopy, open reduction of the fracture, and internal fixation with three 40-mm headless compression screws (Figure ). The screws were placed in posterior to anterior and caudal to cranial directions. The anterior horn of the lateral meniscus was fixed to the joint capsule using FiberWire 2-0, and the ruptured retinaculum was fixed to the medial patellar margin with two Mitek anchors. A 3 \u00d7 3 cm tumor close to the articular capsule turned out to be a lipoma and not, as initially suspected, a neurofibroma.\nAfter surgery, the knee was stabilized with a knee orthosis, and partial weight-bearing was prescribed for 10 weeks.

Seven days later he presented paresthesia of the lower limbs and, less than 24 hours later, bilateral hypoesthesia and paraparesis. He was unable to initiate urination or defecation, but was not incontinent. He denied fever and any infectious episodes over the previous weeks.\nThe patient had been diagnosed of Blau syndrome at the age of 5. The condition manifested as a generalized papulous rash, recurrent arthritis, and tenosynovitis, which started when he was 2 years old. His mother had been misdiagnosed as having rheumatoid arthritis as a child, after presenting similar symptoms. Genetic study confirmed an autosomal dominant mutation in the NOD2/CARD15 gene. The patient had been treated earlier with corticosteroids and methotrexate and, over the previous 8 years, since the diagnosis, had also received etanercept, with good disease control. He had never presented ocular manifestations.\nPhysical examination revealed a normal mental status, with no cranial nerve involvement. Funduscopic examination was normal. Muscle tone strength and deep tendon reflexes of the upper limbs were normal. He had hyperreflexia in both lower limbs, an extensor plantar reflex and bilateral exhaustible clonus. Muscle strength in the lower limbs was decreased, graded 2 to 4 out of a maximum of 5 in the different muscle groups, the most highly affected being the psoas and quadriceps. He had tactile and pain hypoesthesia with a sensitive level at T12 and normal thermal and vibratory sensation.

His gram stain revealed gram-negative diplococci and subsequent chocolate agar plated cultures grew Neisseria species, not gonorrhoeae or meningitidis. Further biochemical speciation (via RapID NH System by Remel, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, USA) showed Neisseria mucosa to be the etiology of the patient\u2019s bacterial peritonitis.

She tolerated the transplant without complications and was in remission until January 2012 when routine blood work identified increased serum protein and anemia. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) demonstrated an abnormal band in the gamma region and M protein spike of 1.9. Urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) demonstrated a monoclonal kappa light chain. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated a monoclonal plasmacytosis of 10\u201312% consistent with plasma cell dyscrasia. There was no evidence of CML. FISH studies and BCR-ABL testing were negative. A bone study was negative for blastic and lytic lesions. Cytogenetics showed a normal male karyotype of donor origin. These findings were consistent with a new diagnosis of IgG kappa smoldering multiple myeloma.\nOur patient was followed with watchful waiting until repeat bone marrow biopsy showed multiple myeloma with rapid progression to active disease. FISH study at diagnosis was positive for an IgH/FGFR3 rearrangement. She was treated with Revlimid, Velcade, and dexamethasone beginning in February 2013.

    "original_text": "A 49-year-old man with a background of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia presented with dyspnoea and exertional chest pain. Coronary angiography () demonstrated an RCA aneurysm in a right-dominant coronary system. Computerised tomographic (CT) coronary angiography () and three-dimensional reconstruction of CT images () further characterised the aneurysmal RCA to be arising from the normal position on the aorta with fistulous connection to the RA. Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated preserved biventricular function with a mildly dilated right ventricle (RV) and no significant valvular abnormalities. The coronary sinus was dilated to 40 mm but agitated saline (bubble) test was negative for persistent left superior vena cava. Following multidisciplinary discussion, informed consent was obtained for surgical intervention on symptomatic and prognostic grounds.\nAt operation, the aneurysmal RCA was exposed following median sternotomy (). It was dilated at 4 cm and tortuous with a normal course along the anterior atrioventricular groove descending down towards the crux but extending further and then turning back to drain into the RA just anterior to the insertion of the inferior vena cava.

He was asymptomatic and he did not have any specific medical history. He had a habit of drinking one or two cups of alcohol daily for several decades. The laboratory tests at the time of admission revealed that the CA19-9, CEA, alpha-fetoprotein, amylase and lipase levels were within the normal limits. The ultrasonographic images showed a hypoechoic mass in the uncinate process of the pancreas, and this was not accompanied by dilatation of the main pancreatic duct. There was no discernible vascularity within the mass on the color Doppler image (). We then performed contrast-enhanced multidetector-row CT. The contrast-enhanced dynamic CT images revealed two round masses with one each in the uncinate process (about 2 \u00d7 1.8 cm for the mass size) and tail (about 1.8 \u00d7 1.5 cm for the mass size) of the pancreas; these isodense masses on the unenhanced CT images were slightly hypodense, slightly hyperdense and slightly hyperdense, respectively as compared to the pancreas parenchyma on the contrast-enhanced arterial, portal, and delayed-phase CT images that were obtained at 30 seconds, 75 seconds and 180 seconds, respectively, after the injection of contrast agent (). There were no enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen. MR imaging was performed to further evaluate these pancreatic masses. The MR images demonstrated that the two masses were hypointense and hyperintense on the T1-and T2-weighted images, respectively ().

She gave a history of rapid weight gain, hyperpigmentation, fatigue and weakness, with all complaints beginning in the third trimester. Her first child was born out of full-term cesarean section under spinal anesthesia, the indication being cephalopelvic disproportion and recovery was uneventful. She weighed 60 kg before pregnancy and had gained 30 kg in this pregnancy, the majority of which was gained in the last trimester. She also complained of hyperpigmentation over the arms and the back. No other positive medical or surgery history was elicited.\nOn examination, she weighed 90kg and had abdominal striae but the colour could not be discriminated because of her dark complexion. She had thin skin, moon facies and buffalo hump too. Her blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, and her pulse rate was 106/min with a normal systemic examination. Her complaints and cushingoid features demanded serum cortisol levels. We also sent her blood for thyroid function tests and sugars apart from other routine examination.\nThyroid function tests, blood sugars and rest of the hematology were normal. However, serum cortisol was raised which was upto 26.33 \u03bcg/dl. Given her clinical features and high serum cortisol, a presumptive diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome was made. But, the case, because of its rarity demanded further investigations to discern the etiology. The most common cause of Cushing's syndrome in pregnancy lies in the adrenal glands; either an adenoma or adrenocarcinoma.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit revealed 3.8 \u00d7 3.0 \u00d7 1.5 cm enhancing orbital mass involving the lateral and superolateral aspect of the peripheral right orbit as well as an irregular 1.1 \u00d7 1.1 \u00d7 2.4 cm mass along the inferior aspect of left orbit []. Also noted were abnormal signal enhancements within the lesser sphenoid wing and the anterior body of the mandible on the right.

The large cells were positive for CD20 B cells with co-expression of CD10 BCL6 and MUM-1. By corresponding flow cytometry, they were found to be kappa chain restricted. These features were consistent with high grade large B cell lymphoma. The small lymphoma cells were CD20+ B cells with co-expression of BCL2 and aberrant CD43 and partial CD5. Flow cytometry revealed lambda restriction. These morphological and phenotypic features were consistent with MALT lymphoma. B cell immunoglobulin gene rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was done to detect clonality. Peaks migrating at 318, 255, and 274 bases were present on B-cell immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH).

On physical examination, the patient was active, not in distress with diminished breath sounds along the left lung. The rest of physical examination was unremarkable. A chest radiograph showed complete collapse of the left lung (). Laboratory investigations showed a white blood cell count of 23000/mm3 with 73% of polymorphonuclear cells and 17% lymphocytes, hemoglobin 10 g/dL, hematocrit 30.5%, and platelets 543,000/mm3. CRP was 8.5 mg/dL (negative < 0.3). The purified protein derivative (PPD) test was negative.\nRigid bronchoscopy revealed a small part of seed surrounded by a grayish-white polypoid mass adherent to the bronchial wall and completely obstructing the orifice of the left main stem bronchus. Removal of the foreign body and excision of the surrounded polypoid mass were performed. The chest X-ray done after bronchoscopy showed almost complete expansion of the left lung (). However, five days later, the patient started to develop high grade fever with persistence of cough. Repeat chest radiograph showed again complete collapse of the left lung. CT scan of the chest with IV contrast revealed complete obliteration of the mid left main stem bronchus by an ill-defined hypodense/enhancing lesion, causing obstructive changes in the left lung with near complete collapse and mediastinal shift to the left with air bronchogram at the base. There were small scattered lymph nodes, subcarinal and left superior mediastinal (13 \u00d7 18 mm).

The girl had 20 years of experience of rock climbing, being taught early tricks by her father at the age of 8 years. The ascent consisted of three pitches of 90-100 feet (ca. 30 m) each. The climbing distance was defined by the climbing rope which had been fixed at a defined length. The girl took the lead on the third pitch, to a total height of 300 feet (ca. 90 m).

    "original_text": "An 11-year-old boy was admitted for biopsy of a skin rash and an enlarged axillary lymph node. No family history of autoimmune disease or autoinflammatory disorder was evident, and he had received no blood transfusion or stem cell transplantation. The patient had suffered from recurrent fever since infancy. At one-month old, the patient presented with fever without source, maculopapular rashes, and poor weight gain. Laboratory examinations revealed elevated levels of liver enzymes and C-reactive protein (CRP). Despite a careful examination, however, neither infection nor neoplasm was detected. There was also no evidence of biliary disorder. As the patient was well fed and his general condition was not much affected, he was followed closely as an outpatient, without therapy. Liver biopsy at seven-month old demonstrates features of chronic active hepatitis, with lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration in Glisson's capsule yet without fibrosis and with a diffuse hepatocyte ballooning pattern.\nPrimary immunodeficiencies including phagocyte disorders, antibody deficiencies, complement deficiencies, and combined T- and B-cell immunodeficiencies [] were refuted through further examinations. Liver markers gradually normalized by age 3, whereas CRP levels remained elevated, and skin rash and fever without source relapsed occasionally. This long-standing fever and elevation of CRP levels without infection or neoplasm were considered possible indicators of autoimmune disease. However, as laboratory findings supporting the diagnosis of autoimmune disease such as positive antinuclear antibody test were not obtained, a definite diagnosis could not be established. At age 4, petechiae developed on the trunk, associated with thrombocytopenia and positive anti-dsDNA autoantibodies. Intravenous pulse steroid therapy was administered and this ameliorated both the clinical and laboratory findings. Petechiae and purpura disappeared and remittent fever resolved.

    "cleaned_text": "an 11-year-old boy was admitted for biopsy of a skin rash and an enlarged axillary lymph node. no family history of autoimmune disease or autoinflammatory disorder was evident, and he had received no blood transfusion or stem cell transplantation. the patient had suffered from recurrent fever since infancy. at one-month old, the patient presented with fever without source, maculopapular rashes, and poor weight gain. laboratory examinations revealed elevated levels of liver enzymes and c-reactive protein (crp). despite a careful examination, however, neither infection nor neoplasm was detected. there was also no evidence of biliary disorder. as the patient was well fed and his general condition was not much affected, he was followed closely as an outpatient, without therapy. liver biopsy at seven-month old demonstrates features of chronic active hepatitis, with lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration in glisson's capsule yet without fibrosis and with a diffuse hepatocyte ballooning pattern.\nprimary immunodeficiencies including phagocyte disorders, antibody deficiencies, complement deficiencies, and combined t- and b-cell immunodeficiencies [] were refuted through further examinations. liver markers gradually normalized by age 3, whereas crp levels remained elevated, and skin rash and fever without source relapsed occasionally. this long-standing fever and elevation of crp levels without infection or neoplasm were considered possible indicators of autoimmune disease. however, as laboratory findings supporting the diagnosis of autoimmune disease such as positive antinuclear antibody test were not obtained, a definite diagnosis could not be established. at age 4, petechiae developed on the trunk, associated with thrombocytopenia and positive anti-dsdna autoantibodies. intravenous pulse steroid therapy was administered and this ameliorated both the clinical and laboratory findings. petechiae and purpura disappeared and remittent fever resolved. platelet count increased within normal range and crp turned negative. the elevation of anti-dsdna autoantibodies diminished within normal limits at this time. nevertheless, crp level rose again soon afterwards. low-dose oral prednisone (5 mg/day) was commenced, but high",

This finding of swallow\u2013cough sequence has been referred to as Ono's sign.[] A chest radiograph revealed complete opacification of the right hemithorax with volume loss suggesting complete collapse of the right lung with mediastinal shift to the right []. A plain and intravenous contrast-enhanced CT study with oral contrast swallow was performed on a 128-slice MDCT scanner (Siemens Somatom Definition AS, Erlangen, Germany). The study revealed complete collapse of the right lung with irregular dilated ectatic bronchi in the right lower lobe []. There was stenosis and diffuse narrowing of the right mainstem bronchus with nodularity of the mucosa seen best on the virtual bronchoscopy []. The right main pulomanary artery (MPA) was narrow in caliber. There was a resultant significant shift of the mediastinum and heart to the right. An air-filled tract was noted extending from one of the right lower lobar bronchi toward the posterior mediastinum with ill-defined soft tissue around it. The possibility of an esophagobronchial fistula was suspected, and we did a CT oral contrast swallow study to detect it. Oral contrast swallow study performed with the patient in right decubitus position using diluted non-ionic iodinated contrast medium (1:20 dilution of iohexol with normal saline). It depicted the site and the fistula tract between the right lateral wall of the esophagus and one of the ectactic bronchi in the right lower lobe of the lung. Thick MIP images and VRT processing demonstrated the fistula site and tract [Figures and ]. Right adrenal gland calcification was also noted.

She had gone to her primary care physician, who performed a chest X-ray and urged her to come to the hospital. Upon presentation at the emergency department, her oxygen saturation was above 95% on room air, and she was not in any respiratory distress, but her exam was significant for decreased breath sound on the right. A chest X-ray confirmed a large right-sided pneumothorax with small pleural effusion. A chest tube was inserted on the right side for the resolution of the pneumothorax, and subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed bilateral diffuse bullous disease of the lung with multiple cysts (Figure -). The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for right thoracoscopic wedge resection of a lung bleb and talc pleurodesis. Gross examination of the specimen revealed several dilated air-like spaces ranging from 0.2 cm to 0.4 cm in size. The hospital course was complicated by postsurgical pneumonia, but she recovered fully and was discharged to home with only minimal symptoms of dyspnea on exertion. Upon further investigations, she was found to have multiple small lesions of angiomyolipoma on the right kidney with diffuse retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. One of the lymph nodes was biopsied, and pathology revealed predominantly spindle cells positive for HHF35 and smooth muscle actin, consistent with the diagnosis of leiomyoma. At the eight-month follow-up at the pulmonology clinic, her pulmonary function test (PFT) showed normal vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), but moderately reduced diffusion capacity, which may also be related to LAM. At her 12-month and 24-month follow-up visits, her PFT results showed improvements in peak flow and diffusion capacity, and the patient continues to report no symptoms other than minimal dyspnea on exertion.",

Her prenatal course was complicated by the White's classification A1 gestational diabetes, rubella non-immune status, and a urinary tract infection. The estimated fetal weight at 38 weeks and six days of gestation was 3,680 grams or eight pounds and two ounces, which is at the 73rd percentile for gestational age.

There was no change in the bowel habit and no rectal bleeding. There was no past history of any other medical or surgical problems.\nAbdominal and anorectal examination, routine blood tests, x-ray abdomen, ultrasonography of abdomen, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy/ colonoscopy did not reveal any abnormality. A abdominal CT scan with oral and intravenous contrast showed an encapsulated sac\u2013like mass of small-bowel loops with no dilatation in the left upper abdomen crossing the midline and indenting the posterior wall of the stomach [Figures and ]. A diagnosis of left paraduodenal hernia was made and the patient taken up for diagnostic laparoscopy.\nThe surgeon as well as the camera person stood on the right side of the patient. The laparoscope was inserted through a 10-mm supra-umbilical port. A 5-mm epigastric port was placed just below the xiphisternum as the left-hand working port, a 5-mm port in the right midclavicular line was used as the right-hand working port and a fourth port in the left midclavicular line below the subcostal margin was used by the assistant for traction. Intra-operatively it was observed that most of the small-bowel loops were lying within a large hernial sac []. The anterior wall of the hernial sac was formed by the left mesocolon. As the neck of the sac was narrow, small bowel could not be reduced. The sac was opened with an ultrasonic shears and the bowel was freed up []. There was no evidence of volvulus or bowel ischaemia.

    "original_text": "A 17-yr-old Caucasian female presented to the Department of Clinical Genomics at Mayo Clinic for an evaluation of a history of motor and speech delay, scoliosis, and recurrent rash. The patient's neonatal and perinatal history was unremarkable with the exception of mild bilateral hip clicks noted at birth. History of gross motor and speech delay was noted with the patient walking and pronouncing her first words at 18 mo. A reevaluation of the patient's speech comprehension at Mayo Clinic at age 14 showed weaknesses in attention processes. The patient also met the criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-inattentive subtype based on the Conners Parent Rating Scale-Revised (T = 82), the Conners ADHD Index (T = 74), and the BASC Parent Report (T = 74). As such, it was thought that the patient's speech and learning difficulties were due to inattentiveness and ADHD rather than cognitive impairment. Also reported was decreased muscle tone, daytime enuresis, and rashes that were refractory to treatment. The patient displayed distinctive craniofacial features (A) not noted in the parents or siblings (; D). Skeletal findings were significant for short stature, bilateral cervical ribs at C7 resulting in 13 pairs of matched ribs, and progressive scoliosis (B).

The mass was congenital and was followed by the pediatric oncology team with a prediagnosis of hemangioma. The patient\u2019s magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed an infantile hemangioma in the proliferative phase filling the parapharyngeal space ().\nThe child then received propranolol therapy, but despite this treatment the mass continued to grow, and the child was referred to our department at the age of 10 months. The otorhinolaryngological examination revealed an 8\u00d77-cm mass filling the left parotid region, with normal facial nerve motor functions (). Histopathological diagnosis of the mass was provided by an incisional biopsy as sialolipoma.\nWe planned to perform total excision of the mass with a transparotid approach. The facial nerve was monitored intra-operatively, and surgery was performed under magnification using surgical loops. A standard modified Blair incision was used, flaps were raised (), then the facial nerve was identified in a standard fashion using a tragal pointer and posterior belly of the digastric muscle as landmarks.\nThe main trunk of the facial nerve was found to be unusually elongated before pes anserinus. A soft lobular mass was encountered. A tumor involving the superficial parotid lobe was first dissected, then the deep lobe of the parotid gland and portion of the tumor filling the parapharyngeal space were gently dissected under the facial nerve (). A Jackson-Pratt drain was inserted into the wound after the excision of the tumor.\nOn macroscopic examination, the mass was found to be a lipomatous specimen, 9\u00d78\u00d74 cm in size.

The mass was found incidentally by a routine check-up chest X-ray image (). Tumor excision was performed through a right posterolateral thoracotomy, and no evaluation of the resection margin was conducted. Histological examination indicated increased cellularity, mild cellular atypism, and low mitotic activity, which was consistent with a benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor. On the basis of these findings, the tumor was diagnosed as a schwannoma. The possibility of recurrence was not considered, and no long-term follow-up surveillance was performed.\nThirteen years later, she was referred to our hospital with an asymptomatic right posterior mediastinal mass. Similar to the previous occurrence, a cellular schwannoma was detected by a screening computed tomogram. The images revealed a 5.6\u00d74.6\u00d72.5 cm lobulated mass at the level of the 9th, 10th, and 11th thoracic vertebrae with the possibility of involvement in the 11th right neural foramen. To determine the correlation between the mass and the spinal nerve, we performed magnetic resonance imaging. The soft-tissue mass originated from the 11th intercostal nerve, extending to the right neural foramen of the 11th and 12th thoracic vertebrae. Due to its heterogeneous signal intensity, the tumor was thought to be a benign neurogenic tumor ().\nThrough the previous incision, a right posterolateral thoracotomy was conducted. We found two solid round masses at the paravertebral area of the 10th, 11th, and 12th thoracic spinal bodies. With the exception of the apex area, pleural adhesion was minimal. A neurosurgeon examined the lesion and confirmed that there was no severe extension of the tumor through the vertebral foramen.
