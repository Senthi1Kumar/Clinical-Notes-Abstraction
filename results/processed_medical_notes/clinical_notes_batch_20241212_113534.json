A tumor was identified at the opening of his left ear canal, and he was referred to our hospital. The tumor was smoothly covered by the skin, and it was not mobile. It obstructed his ear canal so that the tympanic membrane was hidden from view (Figure ). The pure tone audiogram showed mild conductive hearing loss with an air-bone gap of 20 to 45dB. Computed tomography showed a homogeneous mass from the posterior wall of his left ear canal without infiltration into the other structures. In the ear canal, the area between the tumor and the tympanic membrane was isodense (Figure ).\nConsidering these noninvasive findings, this tumor was suspected to be benign. Surgical treatment under general anesthesia was performed two months after the start of symptoms. The tumor was resected en bloc via a postaural and endaural approach with a margin including cartilage and skin. A significant amount of hyperkeratotic substances were present behind the tumor, apparently retained debris. The tympanic membrane was preserved without appreciable change. A full-thickness retroauricular skin flap and fascia temporalis were used to cover the cutaneous defect of the ear canal.The tumor size was 18\u00d712\u00d712mm. It was well circumscribed and its cut surface was whitish (Figure a). Microscopically, the tumor showed a mixture of epithelial cells with formed ducts and myxomatous stroma with spindle cells. It had a cartilage component. The pathological diagnosis was PA (Figure b).

His parents noticed that he had also lost weight and appetite. There was no history of trauma or a fall. He was diagnosed with MHE at age 3 and had been living a relatively normal life and attending school. None of his siblings or any other member of his family had MHE. His past surgical history was unremarkable. On general examination, he was well nourished, had mild pallor of the mucus membranes, no jaundice, lymphadenopathy, or skin rash. All the other parameters were normal. Examination of the musculoskeletal system revealed normal stature except for the curving deformity of the left leg. There were multiple palpable bony swellings bilaterally on the upper humeri and lower femurs. The lesion on the left distal femur was markedly enlarged and tender, with induration, reddening, and limited range of motion of his knee joint (). Repeat X-rays confirmed the presence of bony outgrowths (exostoses) on the medial and lateral aspects of the distal femurs bilaterally and left metaphyseal widening common in this condition as had been previously identified when he was diagnosed at age 3, and further investigations of the left distal femur swelling () with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a distinct enhancing lesion in the distal aspect of the left thigh at the site of intense swelling and pain.

    "original_text": "A 72-year-old African American male patient with a history of alcohol abuse presented with acute encephalopathy and failure to thrive (FTT) with unintentional weight loss. His electrocardiogram showed new-onset AF. As part of his initial work up for FTT, he underwent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen with an incidental finding of congenital absence of the CS ostium resulting in retrograde cardiac venous blood flow through the PLSVC to the left innominate/brachiocephalic vein, into the (right) superior vena cava and back into the right atrium (). A large thrombus measuring 2.5 cm in its largest dimension and extending into the PLSVC was detected in the coronary sinus (). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) confirmed the findings of CS thrombus with engorged cardiac veins (). Due to high operative risk, the patient was started on anticoagulation instead of thrombectomy and eventually discharged to a nursing facility. Six months following his initial diagnosis, he presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain where he was found to have a large pericardial effusion on CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis. As the CT image was performed without contrast, the thrombus was not visualized, though CS dilatation was still observed. A repeat echocardiogram noted the dilated coronary sinus and persistent thrombus. The patient had features of cardiac tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis with fluid studies suggestive of an effusive-constrictive disease. He continued to decompensate and his family opted for comfort measures.\nPersistent superior left vena cava results as failure of obliteration of the left common cardinal vein during embryological development of the coronary venous system resulting in connection with the CS via the vein of Marshall.

The patient had previously undergone tracheostomy with an inverted U-shaped tracheal incision and mechanical ventilation for central neurogenic respiratory failure due to autoimmune limbic encephalitis when she was 30 years old. Although she recovered from her previous condition after 11 months of tracheal cannulation, she subsequently developed a tracheocutaneous fistula due to the prolonged course of healing and poor nutritional status. Laboratory analysis revealed that her white blood cell count was 2900/\u03bcL, serum total protein level was 5.3 g/dL, and serum albumin level was 3.0 g/dL. Neck sagittal computed tomography showed a tracheocutaneous fistula (Fig. a). Although repair of such fistulae is possible under local anesthesia, her surgery was performed under general anesthesia because the encephalitis had caused residual restlessness.\nThe skin incision was designed as a box around the fistula with two sequential straight incisions emanating from one corner (Fig. b). The length of each skin incision was 25 mm. Bilateral hinge flaps to close the fistula were created from the left and right sides of the tracheal defect, and superfluous skin from each hinge flap was trimmed (Fig. a). A single flap covering the skin defect was elevated from the lateral aspect of the right hinge flap to join with the corresponding sides of the defect (Fig. b). The hinge flaps were inversed to cover the tracheal lumen with skin epithelium and sutured tightly with the platysma muscle using absorbent strings (Fig. b).

Preoperative CA125 was the only tumor marker examined and it was within normal limits. A presumptive diagnosis of ovarian cancer was made and she underwent exploratory laparotomy which revealed macroscopic peritoneal metastases to ovaries, omentum and pelvic peritoneum. At that time total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingoopherectomy, pelvic lymph node sampling, partial omentectomy, appendectomy and evacuation of mucinous ascites was performed. Final pathology revealed low grade mucinous adenocarcinoma in all specimens, arising from an appendiceal primary. The patient received no additional therapy and was followed clinically. She developed recurrent abdominal pain approximately 2 years later. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed progressive nodularity in the mesentery and peritoneal surfaces consistent with recurrent disease. This was further evaluated with a laparoscopy, which revealed mucinous tumor implants along the anterior abdominal wall, right retroperitoneum, diaphragm, and remaining omentum (Figure ). At this time, the patient was referred to the University of Cincinnati for consideration of cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemoperfusion. The patient's past medical history was significant only for a seizure disorder which was managed by anticonvulsant medication and an implanted vagus nerve stimulator. Preoperative CA19-9 was elevated at 59, while CEA and CA-125 were normal. The patient was felt to be an appropriate candidate and underwent exploration. At surgery, extensive disease was noted over the peritoneal surfaces. A complete cytoreduction was achieved requiring, right colectomy, splenectomy, cholecystectomy, omentectomy, and perionectomies of the diaphragms, anterior abdominal wall, and pelvis.

Prior to this, she suffered from back pain for 2 weeks that gradually progressed to pain in both hips as well. There were no complaints of urinary or bowel incontinence. She did not experience any abdominal pain, distension, vomiting or constipation.\nOn examination, the patient had decreased sensation and power in the bilateral lower limbs and up-going plantar reflexes. Abdominal examination revealed no mass or distension. Bowel sounds were active. Anal tone was intact on digital rectal examination.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of her thoracic and lumbar spine with 10 ml intravenous Magnevist showed abnormal marrow replacement affecting the 11th thoracic vertebral body associated with enhancement causing compression of the spinal cord (Fig. ). The initial impression was spine metastases from unknown primary causing spinal cord compression. The patient underwent excision of thoracic spine tumour, decompression laminectomy and fixation the following day. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her thorax and abdomen with 80 ml intravenous Omnipaque 350 was performed 2 days after surgery to look for a primary malignancy.

Review of systems was otherwise negative. The patient's medical history was noncontributory, though her obstetrical history was significant for a prior set of twins (with spontaneous conception of both sets) and a history of four low transverse cesarean sections. On physical examination, the patient's vital signs showed blood pressure 97/61, which was stable for her per chart review. Heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature were within normal limits. Her abdomen was tender to palpation throughout, but there was no distention, guarding, or rebound. FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma) scan by the Emergency Medicine physician was positive for intraperitoneal fluid.

He ignored these symptoms initially, but the burning pain worsened, with concomitant urinary frequency and urgency. He visited another hospital for help, at which routine urine analysis revealed pyuria. Under the impression of acute prostatitis, oral antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin was initiated during an outpatient visit; however, his symptoms remained, with no improvement. Two days before admission to our hospital, the symptoms worsened, with a newly-developed decreased voiding amount (approximately 50 mL per void) and urgency with urge incontinence, accompanied by painful hematuria and blood clot formation, especially at the first urine void of the morning. The patient then presented to our Emergency Department. Urine analysis showed pyuria, over 100 white blood cells (WBCs)/high-power field (HPF), and significant tenderness and swelling of the prostate was noted upon digital rectal examination, but no pus-like urethral discharge was seen. Under the impression of acute prostatitis, for which oral antibiotic treatment had failed, the patient was then advised to undergo hospital admission for advanced antibiotic treatment.\nAfter admission, we consulted an infectious disease specialist for evaluation, and antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone was started immediately.

Past medical history and family history were unremarkable. Physical examination showed he had intact mentation and was coherent. Blood pressure was 100/70 with a regular heart rate of 73 beats/min. The patient did not have any elfin facies or other facial abnormalities. Cardiac findings showed a dynamic precordium, a displaced apex beat at the 6th intercostal space left midclavicular line, with LV heave. A harsh 3/6 systolic murmur is heard at the 2nd right intercostal space which also radiates to the carotid area. Electrolytes and renal function were normal. A diagnostic evaluation showed left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria as well as an enlarged heart with left ventricular prominence on chest X-ray. Serum calcium and other blood chemistries were normal. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a supravalvar aortic membrane with severe obstruction. Peak systolic pressure gradient was 135 mmHg []. There was also concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with severe hypokinesia and depressed global systolic function (29% by Simpson's) and Doppler evidence of Grade III diastolic dysfunction. Preoperative transesophageal echo (TEE) showed a linear echogenic density just above the aortic valve confirming the finding of SVAS. The aortic valve cusps are also thickened and fused indicating the presence of a concomitant valvar aortic stenosis []. The patient eventually underwent aortic valve replacement, excision of the supravalvar membrane and aortic root dilatation with aortotomy and pericardial patch augmentation.

She was a second gravida with no living issue. Before one and a half years back, she had a preterm twin vaginal delivery at 36 weeks of gestation with early neonatal death of both babies.\nIn the current pregnancy, a prior obstetric ultrasound done at 20 weeks showed a myoma measuring 11.5 cm x 8.5 cm in the cervical region and the placenta occupying the right lateral position of the uterus. The patient was not under regular antenatal check-ups. She had no other associated comorbidities.\nOn general examination, she was pale, but her vitals were stable. Obstetrical examination revealed a uterus of term size with mild contractions, and there was moderate bleeding per vaginum. An ultrasound examination was done, which showed a central placenta previa and a central cervical fibroid of size measuring 10 cm x 8 cm (Figures , ). The fetus was in cephalic presentation with an estimated weight of 3.1 kg. The amniotic fluid was of adequate amount. The blood investigations showed anemia with hemoglobin of 7.8 gm%, and liver enzymes were deranged suggestive of obstetric cholestasis. The rest of the blood investigations were within normal limits.\nShe was planned for an emergency cesarean section because of central placenta praevia with antepartum hemorrhage. Blood components were cross-matched before surgery. Given the possible need for a cesarean hysterectomy in case of uncontrolled intraoperative bleeding, informed consent was obtained.\nDuring the surgery, the abdomen was opened by Pfannenstiel incision.

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an AVM measuring 28 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 4 cm in her left calf (). All preoperative examinations, including laboratory tests, electrocardiography, and chest X-ray, were normal. Vital signs before general anesthesia were stable: her blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg and her heart rate was 82 beats/min. Following the application of routine hemodynamic monitoring (3-lead electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure, and pulse oximetry), anesthesia was induced using a bolus intravenous injection of 120 mg propofol and 40 mg rocuronium. A 20-gauge catheter was inserted into the radial artery to monitor her arterial blood pressure continuously. The target controlled infusion of 2% propofol and remifentanil (2-3 \u00b5g/ml and 2-5 ng/ml of the effect-site concentrations, respectively) was applied to maintain anesthesia. Immediately following the injection of ethanol, the patient's blood pressure and heart rate rose slightly to 160/100 mmHg and 100 beats/min, respectively. Thereafter, the patient's blood pressure and heart rate were stable throughout the procedure while she was in the prone position. A total dose of 50 ml of 99% ethanol was injected into the lesion over a period of 30 minutes without the use of a tourniquet. As soon as the patient was turned from prone to supine after finishing the procedure, an abrupt drop in her arterial blood pressure occurred, 40-50 mmHg systolic and 10-15 mmHg diastolic blood pressure with a simultaneous increase in her heart rate to 100-110 beats/min. To restore blood pressure, 20 mg of ephedrine was immediately injected, but the patient's heart rate rather decreased abruptly to < 30 beats/min.

On intraoral examination, an exophytic, sessile, oval-shaped mass measuring 2 cm \u00d7 1 cm was noticed in the lingual gingiva in relation to 33 and 34 []. The lesion was normal in color with white papillary projections on the surface. On palpation, it was firm in consistency, was slightly tender and fixed to the underlying tissue. The intraoral periapical radiograph of the region showed cupping resorption of the bone []. Based on the clinical presentation of a soft-tissue lesion on the gingiva with numerous papillary projections on the surface, a provisional diagnosis of papilloma was given. Pyogenic granuloma, peripheral giant cell granuloma, peripheral ossifying fibroma and peripheral odontogenic neoplasms were considered as differential diagnosis. Excisional biopsy was done, and the tissue was sent for histopathological examination.\nMicroscopically, the lesional tissue showed a superficial hyperplastic stratified squamous epithelium with numerous papillary projections. At multiple areas, the epithelium showed ameloblastomatous change []. The proliferation of transformed epithelium with odontogenic islands budding off into the underlying connective tissue stroma [] was noticed. Within the connective tissue stroma, there were numerous ameloblastomatous islands lined peripherally by tall columnar cells showing reversal of polarity and central stellate reticulum-like cells []. Some of these islands showed acanthomatous change []. The superficial epithelium showed positivity for the odontogenic marker, cytokeratin-19 (CK-19), confirming its odontogenic transformation []. The ameloblastomatous islands in the connective tissue stroma were also positive for the marker, CK-19 []. Based on the clinical and histopathological presentation, the lesion was diagnosed as peripheral ameloblastoma.

He had undergone aortic valve replacement surgery 11 years ago, and had been taking warfarin ever since. Three years ago, he underwent a retromastoid suboccipital craniotomy to remove a right vestibular schwannoma. Unfortunately, an intracerebellar hemorrhage developed 2 months after the surgery, and posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus developed as a consequence. A VPS (Codmann Hakim Programmable Valve; Johnson & Johnson Co., Boston, MA, USA) was placed. All connection sites between the catheters and the reservoir was reinforced with a tie using 3-0 black silk. After the operation, he had been doing well for 18 months.\nHe complained of a recent tendency to trip that began 5 months before admission. At the outpatient clinic, we performed brain computed tomography (CT) first to look for any signs of shunt malfunction. Since CT showed no change in ventricle size, we decided to lower the shunt pressure setting and to observe any symptom improvement in the patients. However, the patient did not get better despite repeated subsequent adjustments of shunt pressure. While attempting to examine the cause of his gait disturbance, we became aware of the fact, by chance, that the distal catheter was not visible on an outside chest X-ray film ().\nAt the time of admission, the patient's vital signs were stable, and his body temperature was 36.3\u00b0C. He had not suffered any abdominal symptoms, and physical examination showed no tenderness or rebound tenderness in the abdomen. Upon neurological examination, his mental status was indicative of slight drowsiness, and his orientation was intact. Mild cognitive dysfunction was observed.

He had also been found to have a vascular abnormality (DAA) as an adult and was observed in an asymptomatic state.\nPhysical examinations showed no unusual findings, and the laboratory examination data, including tumor markers, such as squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen and carcinoembryonic antigen, were all within normal ranges. Chest X-ray demonstrated a widening in the upper mediastinal silhouette, reflecting the superior right aortic arch. An endoscopic examination revealed superficial esophageal cancer located in the left side of the wall in the upper thoracic esophagus and the invasion of the submucosa (Fig. ). A histological examination of biopsy specimens confirmed the presence of squamous cell carcinoma. Enhanced computed tomography showed a swollen lymph node in the right upper mediastinum, which was diagnosed as metastatic (Fig. ). No distant metastasis was detected. Computed tomography also confirmed the DAA. The right aortic arch was dominant, and the descending aorta was located at the right side of the post-mediastinum, as is common in cases of DAA (Fig. ). The patient was therefore diagnosed with upper thoracic esophageal cancer of cT1bN1M0 Stage IIB (UICC-TNM 7th) and a DAA.\nHe underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to sub-total esophagectomy with three-field lymphadenectomy. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen was 2 courses of 5-FU (800 mg/m2) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2) every 3 weeks.\nWe planned to perform radical subtotal esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

During evaluation for pyelonephritis, a CT scan found multiple non- cystic liver lesions in both lobes. Her medications were significant for maintenance immunosuppression, consisting of tacrolimus 1 mg, cellcept 500 mg, prednisone 5 mg. She denied any history of hepatitis, OCP use or diabetes. Her BMI was 26. She was referred to the hepatobiliary clinic where her initial work-up consisted of lab work, colonoscopy, ultrasound and MRI. Her AFP and CEA were normal at 2.3 and 0.8, respectively. Her colonoscopy was normal. An ultrasound revealed multiple echogenic round lesions in both lobes with no ductal dilatation. An MRI showed ~50 hyper-intense lesions measuring up to 1 cm in both right and left lobes (Fig. ). A percutaneous liver biopsy was found to be normal hepatic parenchyma. She was managed expectantly for a year until a follow-up MRI showed an increase in size and number of her liver lesions, some of which contained a fatty component.\nGiven the sheer number of her lesions, a multidisciplinary group at our institution decided that a tissue type and specifically a genetic type diagnosis was required to rule out her risk of malignant transformation. A laparoscopic left lateral wedge resection was thus performed in order to obtain adequate tissue for diagnosis. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged from the hospital after a 3-day hospital stay.\nPathological analysis showed well circumscribed, but non-encapsulated liver lesions, comprised of cords of benign hepatocytes (Fig. a). The hepatocytes had regular, uniform nuclei and a low nuclear to cystoplasmic ratio. The lesions lacked portal structures and had evidence of unpaired arteries. Moderate microvesicular steatosis was noted within the lesions but none within the uninvolved liver parenchyma. Mitoses or pseudoacinar changes were not identified (Fig.",
