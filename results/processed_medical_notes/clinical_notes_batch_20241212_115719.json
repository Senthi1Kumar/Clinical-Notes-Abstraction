The patient had a history of chronic pain syndrome. In 1997 she had an intrathecal drug delivery device implanted to treat refractory chronic back pain in the context of four prior lumbar laminectomies and fusion at an outside medical facility. Her chronic abdominal pain began in 2009 after a small bowel obstruction required an exploratory laparotomy, at which time fibrotic strictures were found which required small bowel resection at the ileum. The patient's pain continued and she went on to undergo cholecystectomy in 2010. In 2011 she underwent evaluation by a local gastroenterologist, with upper endoscopy revealing signs of bile reflux gastritis and retained food. Concomitant motility testing revealed gastroparesis and she was ultimately diagnosed with narcotic-related gastroparesis. In an attempt to decrease the amount of opioids she was receiving from her intrathecal device, she had a spinal cord stimulator (SCS) placed as a therapeutic adjunct. Her pain was marginally improved with the stimulator, though this device ultimately failed and stopped working. Despite the SCS failure, the patient elected not to have the stimulator explanted. Throughout this time course, the patient was also treated concurrently with multiple medication regimens including gabapentin, long acting morphine, fluoxetine, and benzodiazepines.\nIn 2013, due to continued abdominal pain and increasing intrathecal opioid requirements, a repeat CT scan of the abdomen showed enhancement of the terminal ileum and rectosigmoid colon with a new mass-like area of mesenteric inflammation. The diagnosis of sclerosing mesenteritis was considered and she presented to our institution for further evaluation and management.\nDuring preoperative evaluation, the patient stated her abdominal pain was constant, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

History of presenting illness revealed that the patient was apparently normal the previous day morning, after which spontaneous bleeding started by afternoon leading to severe blood loss and hypovolemic shock for which she was admitted to the ICU. Bleeding was continuous; there were no aggravating or relieving factors. Previous hospitalization history revealed she was admitted twice earlier within a period of 30 days, with a similar complaint of bleeding from the oral cavity leading to a significant decrease in the hemoglobin (Hb) levels. No dental treatment was performed in the earlier visits, as it was advised by the pediatrician to wait for a month for the complete recovery of the patient. The parent also gave a history of a similar episode of bleeding from gums, vomiting containing clots of blood 1 year back with decreased Hb level at the time of hospitalization. The patient was discharged without being referred to the dentist one year back. A family history of consanguineous marriage was present. On extraoral examination, purpuric spots were seen in the left leg along with crusting and bleeding from the lips.

Her shoulder problem had started 3 months earlier, and there was no history of trauma or fracture. At first the pain was intermittent and bearable, but then gradually increased. On examination, there were no positive signs except for localized pain. A radiologic examination on 3 April 2017 found no destruction of the shoulder (Fig. ). Pain at the shoulder joint became gradually aggravated, together with the appearance of shoulder joint dysfunction. Two months later, physical examination revealed mild swelling of the shoulder, and markedly restricted shoulder and elbow motion. Mild distal nerve function defects appeared gradually. Radiography on 3 June 2017 showed that the head of the humerus had disappeared within the past 2 months (Fig. ), which was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (Fig. a, b).\nThe patient is a healthy, active individual with no history of weight loss, anorexia, or fever during this period. General and systemic examination findings were within normal limits. Routine laboratory investigations were also normal, including levels of serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

The patient was referred to our hospital to receive IP chemotherapy for peritoneal carcinomatosis of gastric cancer.\nThe upper endoscopy showed scirrhous-type gastric cancer (Fig. ) with the biopsy result of moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. A staging laparoscopy was performed also in our institution showing the tumor exposure to serosa of the stomach and the massive peritoneal carcinomatosis involving the greater omentum (Fig. ). Peritoneal disseminated nodules were found in whole intraabdominal space with a peritoneal cancer index (PCI) score of 23 (Fig. ). Intraperitoneal washing fluid cytology was positive for free cancer cells. An IP access port was placed in the subcutaneous space.\nThe regimen of the intraperitoneal chemotherapy is oral intake of S-1 for 14 days, IP PTX (20 mg/kg) and IV PTX (50 mg/kg) on day 1 and day 8 with 7 days\u2019 rest. This treatment was performed as a clinical study approved by the institutional review board of the University of Tokyo. After our patient received nine courses of chemotherapy in 7 months, a second-look laparoscopy was performed to assess the effect of the intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The disseminated peritoneal nodules had disappeared (Fig. ) and the washing cytology results had turned negative.\nAfter confirming the effectiveness of intraperitoneal chemotherapy, a total gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection was performed. Three of 14 harvested lymph nodes were found to have metastasis. The pathological grading of regression was 2.\nAfter gastrectomy, our patient received the same regimen of intraperitoneal chemotherapy. A follow-up CT scan, which was performed 4 years and 3 months after the IP chemotherapy started, revealed bilateral ovary enlargement.

The lymph node transfer surgery was planned 8 weeks after the accident using a lymph-node-containing free superficial circumflex iliac artery perforator flap from the left inguinal area. Since the patient suffered an open ankle wound and prolonged denudation of the TPT and FDLT, functional impairment was a risk; therefore, debridement around the joint was kept to a minimum in order to focus on preserving joint functionality. Subcutaneous indocyanine green (ICG) injections were performed pre-operatively at two sites around the left anterior superior iliac spine area. ICG lymphography was then performed to identify the lymph flow and the inguinal lymph nodes in the left inguinal region ().

Family history was notable for a grandfather with lung cancer and an aunt with breast cancer.\nUpon physical examination, a limited range of motion of the left shoulder was noted (decreased flexion, extension, abduction, and external rotation).

MRI of the left shoulder confirmed this finding. Biopsy of the lesion was positive for grade 2\u20133 chondrosarcoma. A full diagnostic workup was carried out, including a CT of the chest and upper abdomen and a bone scan, which demonstrated increased uptake in the left upper arm but no additional bone lesions. Hematological and biochemical investigations were within normal limits.\nIn June 2011, the patient underwent a limb sparing surgical operation, and pathology was positive for conventional chondrosarcoma grade 2\u20133, that had destroyed the medullary and cortical portions of bone reaching into adjacent soft tissue. Distal bony resection margin and skin were both free of tumor infiltration. The patient did not receive any adjuvant therapy.\nThe patient remained free of disease for 4 years following surgery. In 2015, the patient complained of increasing pain in his left resected arm and shoulder. Imaging confirmed local recurrence. The patient subsequently underwent amputation of his left arm with resection of scapula. Pathology confirmed diagnosis of a grade 2/3 conventional chondrosarcoma.

Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated positive CD10 and AE1/AE3 staining. Pathologic interpretation of the mass was highly suggestive of metastatic RCC of the clear cell type. There were no lesions present anywhere else by physical examination or CT scan.\nThe patient was closely followed in an attempt to locate a primary renal source of disease with multiple imaging studies negative for a renal primary or other sites of metastasis. However, repeat CT scan 9 months later revealed an asymptomatic pancreatic mass. Endoscopic evaluation was performed with endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration (EUS/FNA). The study demonstrated a 2-cm hyperechoic, well-defined lesion in the body of the pancreas. The remaining pancreatic parenchyma was otherwise normal without ductal dilation or evidence of pancreatitis. Histomorphological analysis of the core biopsy samples yielded similar findings to those of the upper extremity mass. Additionally, an immuno-profile was focally strong for both CD10 and PNRA, which was again highly suggestive of renal cell carcinoma. A central pancreatectomy was performed in August 2008 and tissue samples were positive for PRNA, Vimentin, and CD10, correlating strongly with RCC. The patient continued periodic surveillance to identify a renal primary and further metastasis at three month intervals. Six months later, physical exam revealed left parotid gland enlargement and an MRI revealed a 1.6 cm enhancing mass in the left parotid gland. No other lesions were found on surveillance PET/CT scan at that time. The patient had a superficial parotidectomy and again, pathological analysis demonstrated a clear cell carcinoma that was identical to the previous subcutaneous and pancreatic specimens. The sample was sent for expert verification at an outside institution, which corroborated our findings. Currently, the patient is doing well",

    "original_text": "A 78 year-old male presented to the emergency department with a ten day history of mild abdominal pain, nausea, and distention, worsening over the last day. He did not recall having a bowel movement for at least three days. His past medical history was significant for hypertension, gout, osteoarthritis, and an eighty-pack year smoking history. He had no prior surgeries and took only a blood pressure medication. He guarded during physical exam, and his abdomen was noted to be quiet, distended, and tender to palpation, but without rigidity or peritoneal signs. His laboratory evaluation was unremarkable. The emergency department obtained a CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis, which demonstrated a large amount of free air and fluid, and a mass could be visualized within the lumen of the cecum. A surgical consultation was emergently obtained (Figure ).\nAfter fluid resuscitation, he was brought to the operating room for exploration, where we encountered a minimal amount of fecal contamination and perforation of the cecum. A six centimeter non-obstructive mass and a hard mesenteric nodule were found in the cecum just distal to the site of perforation. The remainder of the colon was palpated and noted to be full of hard stool but otherwise without obvious abnormalities. We proceeded with copious irrigation of the peritoneal cavity and performed a right hemicolectomy with primary anastamosis without difficulty.\nPost-operatively, the patient was extubated but progressed slowly. Final radiologic interpretation of the CT obtained on arrival additionally noted a mass in the tail of the pancreas, a finding the surgical team did not detect on the CT prior to surgery or grossly at exploration. Pathologic evaluation found that the cecal mass contained only tubulovillous adenomatous components and the perforated area demonstrated localized mucosal ischemia but had relatively sharp margins.

The patient had already been admitted to a secondary care hospital 3 months earlier with complaints of right mandibular discomfort and slight tumefaction. A biopsy was then performed and the diagnosis of ameloblastic carcinoma was made histologically. The patient was otherwise healthy with no significant past medical history, including alcohol, smoking or tobacco abuse.\nA complete head and neck examination revealed a painless, firm and fixed right mandibular mass with no cutaneous inflammatory signs. No ulcers or mucosal lesions were found in the oral cavity. Laboratory evaluation, chest radiograph and respiratory function tests were unremarkable. The patient underwent bronchofibroscopy, which revealed only mild laryngeal hyperaemia.\nBoth neck CT () and MRI () were performed, showing a large, solid tumour arising from the ramus and posterior body of the right mandible. The lesion extended to the surrounding soft tissues, with invasion of the masseter and medial pterygoid muscles and caused bulging of the buccal mucosa. The soft tissue component was hypointense on T1 weighted and hyperintense on T2 weighted MR images and showed avid enhancement after gadolinium administration on MR examination. CT scan disclosed striking sclerosis and irregularity of the mandibular ramus with some gas bubbles inside the medullary cavity and an expansive lytic component in the posterior body and angle with some bone-forming matrix inside. Prominent periosteal reaction was also identified, particularly in the outer cortical surface of the mandibular ramus with the typical pattern of a ruptured Codman triangle. No associated cystic lesion was found in the mandible. No enlarged lymph nodes were detected and the evaluation of the remaining cervical spaces was unremarkable.

A month later, she became pregnant but it was an ectopic pregnancy that ruptured after 6 weeks. She was admitted to the hospital and underwent a laparoscopic exploration. Cultures taken from the fallopian tube were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. During her 10 day hospital stay, she developed sepsis and an adult respiratory distress syndrome. She was shifted to Intensive Care Unit and a central line was placed in her left subclavian vein. Her tracheal cultures revealed growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Her blood cultures revealed the presence of Enterobacter cloacae. Bronchial lavage confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and the absence of any malignancy. Antibiotics and anti-TB medications were started. The patient subsequently improved and was discharged home.\nThe patient was a mother of two children, both born of vaginal deliveries without complications. She had no other comorbidities and had no family history of TB.\nShe presented again 2 months later complaining of vomiting, headache, exertional dyspnea, inability to talk, and difficulty opening left eye. There was also a history of significant weight loss over the past month. A brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed disseminated central nervous system TB. Her anti-TB regiment was adjusted by increasing the number of drugs. She was noted to have a left-sided hemiparesis but gradually recovered and was discharged home.\nApproximately 2 months later, the patient represented with a complaint of hoarseness of voice and odynophagia.

Details of lab results are given in . Pro-BNP was elevated at 1762. Chest X-ray revealed unilateral right pleural effusion which was subsequently drained by thoracentesis and was consistent with transudative effusion. She was managed as a case of congestive heart failure. Her heart rate control was optimized and the dose of methimazole was increased to 30 mg once daily. She was discharged home but readmitted 2 days later with recurrent dyspnea. A repeat chest X-ray showed recurrence of the right pleural effusion. Transthoracic echocardiogram was done showing normal ejection fraction and diastolic function. Her heart rate was controlled. Repeat thyroid function tests showed a normal free T3 and almost normal free T4. Patient was diuresed, and the unilateral right pleural effusion was drained again. The fluid characteristics showed a transformation from transudative to exudative likely in the setting of recent diuretic use.\nShe was then discharged home after she had improved clinically only to be readmitted again with worsening dyspnea attributed to reaccumulation of the right pleural fluid a few days later. A repeat drainage with pleural catheter was performed, and the fluids revealed an exudative process with elevated LDH. This was further evaluated with a CT scan of the chest with contrast (Figures and ) which showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a diffuse ground glass process involving the right lower lobe suggestive of pneumonitis. A bronchoscopy was also performed. The bronchoalveolar lavage showed neutrophil predominant fluid, and cytology and adenosine deaminase were negative.

There was accompanying involuntary tremor-like dystonia on the left side of her face and buccal area, which was unnoticeable to other people. Clicking tinnitus and involuntary muscle contraction of the face and buccal area prompted the patient to visit several dental, ENT and neurologic clinics; a diagnosis had still not been made after more than a year, and this caused the patient stress.\nThe tinnitus and dystonic spasm with painful sensation on the left facial area were aggravated over time. Stressful events in her everyday life made the symptoms worse. The patient felt being rejected, sad, frustrated, depressed and even anxious because the painful symptoms remained undiagnosed for a long time. The patient's attempts at relief included herbal medicine, acupuncture and massage, but none of these treatments were successful. The patient also experienced symptom-related depression, anxiety and insomnia, which also created much anxiety among her family members. The patient visited a local neurological clinic where she received brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and an electromygraphic study of her face. Clonazapam was prescribed without a proper diagnosis by one neurologist, but the symptoms were not relieved.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multifocal abnormal bone marrow signal in the right femur, the left femoral neck, and the proximal epiphysis and metaphysis of the right tibia, which was associated with osteolysis and callus formation (). Radio-nucleotide bone scan found increased uptake involving the left sacrum, left proximal femur, and femoral neck region as well as the midshaft of the right femur and the proximal right tibia. Bone biopsy of the lytic lesion involving the midshaft of the right femur was not consistent with malignancy and showed red blood cells and scattered neutrophils and lymphocytes. Over the next several years (2007\u20132015), she was followed by orthopedic surgery and was treated only with intermittent ibuprofen as needed for pain. She was noted to have a leg length discrepancy at the age of 7 years, and in 2014, at the age of 12 years, she had surgery to fuse the growth plate to prevent right leg growth (right leg was 4.5 cm longer than her left leg at that time).\nShe established Rheumatologic care in March 2015 at age 13, and right quadriceps muscle atrophy and failure to thrive with a weight and height under the third percentile were noted at this time. Bone scan revealed increased uptake in the right femur and asymmetry of activity in the growth plates of the knees and ankles with decreased activity in the right side compared to left.

The patient worked as a boat mechanic, and stated that one week ago he was working on a boat engine that was leaking diesel fuel. He worked on the engine for several hours in an enclosed room with it running intermittently. Shortly after leaving work, he noticed a throbbing, dull headache located across his forehead and temporal region, as well as loss of peripheral vision in his right eye. At presentation, the patient described that the headache and vision changes had worsened, but denied any focal neurological deficits. He stated that he first went to an urgent care facility where he was diagnosed with sinusitis and prescribed amoxicillin, which did not relieve any of his symptoms.\nIn the emergency room, the patient was initially hypertensive with a blood pressure of 181/92 mmHg, but it improved to 141/80 mmHg without medical intervention. Neurologic examination revealed a right monocular temporal hemianopia upon visual field confrontation, resulting in an NIH stroke score of one.

His weight was approximately 90 kg; height was approximately 180 cm. He was overweight for his age. The degree of autism was so severe that he could not stand still and stubbornly resisted from entering the clinic. In addition, the muscular strength of the patient made it tougher to control his behavior. We decided to administer 10 mg of midazolam via the intramuscular route. However, the patient's resistance to intramuscular injection made it difficult to do so. As the patient was overweight, sedation via the oral route could not be maintained, and he resisted taking oral pills. Moreover, even intravenous injection was difficult, and there were no professionals and monitoring equipment to perform sedation via the intravenous route. Hence, as an alternative, we decided to try sedation via the submucosal route. First, protective stabilization for the patient who had strong involuntary movements was arranged using physical restraint. Then, local infiltration anesthesia was administered with about 0.6 ml of 2% lidocaine (1:100,000 epinephrine) to the left maxillary vestibule, and midazolam was injected into the submucosa at the same spot.

    "original_text": "A 65-year-old woman with a medical history significant for anal cancer presented for mediport removal. Past surgical history included an elective thyroidectomy two years prior for multinodular goiter. The port was placed 11 years prior for chemotherapeutic treatment of anal cancer, which subsequently cleared with complete clinical response following treatment with the Nigro protocol. Thereafter, the patient failed to continue her scheduled postoperative follow-up evaluations. The patient was referred from her primary care physician for port removal, which was proceeded with as requested. The port-a-cath had been inserted into the left internal jugular vein with the catheter tip in the superior vena cava, and the port was secured in the subcutaneous tissue of the left chest wall along the left upper breast border. Under monitored anesthesia care and local anesthesia, an incision was made over the port site, approximately 2 cm inferior to prior incision site. The port and catheter were identified covered with chronic capsule. Subcapsular dissection allowed for complete freeing of the port, but significant resistance was felt upon pulling the catheter. To reduce subcutaneous tunnel resistance along the catheter tract, a second incision was made superior to the primary incision, closer to the site of left internal jugular vein catheter insertion. A clamp was placed on the proximal catheter end and the catheter transected. The explanted metallic port (measuring 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm) and transected proximal catheter (3.5 cm) were removed. We continued to dissect along the catheter tract to the point of insertion into the left internal jugular vein, followed by venotomy and temporary local tonsil clamp placement. At this point, no reduction in resistance was felt despite sustained traction, suggesting a possible intravascular central vein adhesion to the catheter.

Her gait was slow, limited by lower back pain radiating to the dorsum of her left foot. Inspection of the lower back revealed normal anterior curvature of the lumbosacral spine without overlying skin abnormalities. Her range of motion was limited in a forward flexion.

The mother complained of pain in the nipple which was present throughout the entire breastfeeding session and usually recurred with each episode of breastfeeding. Two weeks after delivery, the mother noticed a tooth on the baby\u2019s lower left gum. A week later, she noticed an ulcer under her baby\u2019s tongue, which occasionally bled.\nIn light of the continuous pain during breastfeeding, the mother became reluctant to continue and infant formula milk was given as a substitute.

There was strong family history of natal teeth, and this baby\u2019s siblings had similar problems.\nOn examination, the mother\u2019s breast appeared to be normal and consistent with a lactating breast. There was no inflammation or engorgement. Some mild eczema was noted around the nipple, but there was no infection. Cervical and axillary lymph nodes were not palpable.\nExamination of the oral cavity of the baby revealed a neonatal tooth over the left anterior region of the mandibular ridge. The tooth measured 2 mm \u00d7 1 mm in size, was whitish opaque, and had Grade II mobility (Fig. ). There was also a whitish ulcer over the ventral aspect of the tongue measuring 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm (Fig. ). The parents declined radiological investigations and tongue biopsy for the baby. Hence, the clinical diagnosis was neonatal tooth associated with Riga-Fede disease causing difficulty in breastfeeding.\nThe baby was then referred to the pediatric dental surgery department.

The patient was diagnosed with gingivitis, and treated with a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug and oral rinsing with chlorhexidine. The condition of the patient did not improve significantly. When she returned a week later, she had no alleviation, but labial paresthesia on the right side of her lip. As the cause of the new symptom remained unidentified, she was referred to the oral surgery group. Initially, the paraesthesia affected only the right side of the lower lip, but by this time it had spread to the skin of the right side of her chin. The oral surgeons decided to extract the lower right wisdom tooth, but the labial paraesthesia still persisted. Since there was an extended composite restoration in the lower right first molar, and translucency around its apical region was visible, the lesion was diagnosed as periapical granuloma. The lesion on tooth 46 was not close to the mandibular canal; this can be seen on Fig. . Therefore, root canal treatment was carried out, despite the uncertain result of the percussion, palpation and sensibility test. The transparent lesion around the apex and the negative sensibility test lead to the decision of endodontic treatment. Diagnosis was made by a dentist who is not a staff member of our Department. The treatment revealed that the pulp was vital. Our oral diagnostic team examined the patient, and we diagnosed the case as cemento-osseous dysplasia based on the panoramic radiograph showing apical translucency lesions around the anterior teeth with vital pulp (Fig. ). The paraesthesia has been continually present ever since. Because the lesion around the lower right canine had already involved the cortical bone by CBCT scan (Fig. ), a root canal filling and removal of the apical lesion were performed.

Resection of perforated bowel segment with proximal ileostomy and mucus fistula of distal ileum was performed. Later, histopathology report confirmed tubercular etiology showing caseous necrosis in mesenteric lymph nodes and epithelioid granuloma in ulcer edge biopsy. Two days after the surgery, the patient was started on oral feeds and was accepting meals orally subsequently. Ten days following surgery, the patient had multiple episodes of bilious vomiting with stoma output decreasing to less than 100 mL per day. Her abdomen remained flat with no increase in bowel sounds. Abdominal radiography showed dilated stomach with no air fluid levels. Oral feeds were stopped and a nasogastric tube was placed for drainage of gastric contents. A contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) abdomen was done to determine the cause of obstruction which revealed a decreased aortomesenteric angle of 15\u00b0 (Figure ).\nAs a result of this decreased angle, an abrupt collapse of the third part of the duodenum was seen along with proximal duodenal and stomach dilation (Figure",

He was in his usual state of health until 1 day prior to presentation when he underwent a successful mechanical thrombectomy using a percutaneous thrombolytic device (Arrow-Trerotola, Arrow International, Reading, PA) for a severe venous stenosis of his left thigh AV graft.

Symptomatic hypotension precluded ultrafiltration that day. Though the patient's symptoms were initially attributed to the residual effects of anaesthesia, his course over the ensuing 2 weeks worsened as he manifested nausea, constipation, progressive weakness to the point of requiring a wheelchair and continued inability to remove any fluid due to persistent hypotension. A chest X-ray revealed only parenchymal chronic scarring. Twelve days after the thrombectomy, the patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation.\nUpon admission, an abdominal and pelvic CT scan with contrast was performed to evaluate his GI symptoms. It revealed a thrombus within the IVC extending from the renal to the hepatic veins (). Extensive venous collateralization was also noted, suggesting a chronic condition. Two days later, a diagnostic venography revealed acute on chronic thrombus material that completely occluded the IVC. An IVC thrombectomy was performed, and a repeat venography demonstrated the presence of a pre-occlusive chronic stenosis in the midportion of the IVC (). An IVC stent was placed that resolved the stenosis and normalized blood flow. Of note, angiography did not reveal any residual stenosis in the patient's patent left thigh",

There was gross neovascularization within the AML, and the patient suffered three life threatening episodes of haemorrhage requiring interventional radiological procedures which attempted to coil the arteriovenous malformations.

Although she did not hit her foot, did not have joint deformities, and did not have morning stiffness, she developed a slight swelling and a hot feeling in the dorsolateral part of the left foot that resolved spontaneously over several days about 2 weeks before onset. Upon neurological examination, she presented with repetitive involuntary toe movement of the left foot in the absence of pain. The movement comprised nonrhythmic extension, flexion, abduction, adduction, and torsion, and was most prominent in the 4th and 5th toes (video). She was able to consciously suppress the movement to some extent, but not completely. The movement was exacerbated when she was distracted. This occurred throughout the day at rest and disappeared during sleep. She had no sensory disturbance, reduced tendon reflexes, weakness, or muscle atrophy, which indicated that she had no other neurological deficits. CT and MRI did not show tumors, infarction, hemorrhage, or any other lesions. Whole spinal cord MRI did not reveal compression or any other lesions.

Fundus examination revealed the presence of papilledema. A head computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed the presence of evolving hydrocephalus. To rule out hydrocephalus\nex vacuo due to volume loss and changes in CSF dynamics subsequent to the previous accident, external ventricular drainage (EVD) was placed which revealed egress of CSF under pressure.

Firstly, we had to rule out post traumatic hydrocephalus\nex vacuo by measuring the opening pressure of the CSF egress and looking for the neurological improvement in the patient following CSF diversion. Secondly, since we not have the programmable VP shunting available, we need to appropriately choose the Chabra shunt depending on the opening pressure so as to prevent either over drainage or under drainage of CSF. Lastly, since it was a post traumatic case, we need to measure the CSF protein (as it may be increased from the lysed traumatic subarachnoid blood) and also we need to rule out subclinical meningitis.

Medical history showed a previous head trauma (car accident) with brain hematoma drainage and a saphenous vein operation. Physical examination revealed edema in the perimalleolar area and painful varicose veins, in the right calf (with considerable aesthetic impact) and left calf (with minor aesthetic impact).

However, the mass had grown so much that he could no longer sit and he decided to seek medical assistance. The patient was in good general health, had no other symptoms and reported no weight loss. The physical examination confirmed a 40 \u00d7 15 cm mass in his right gluteal area and the MRI suggested a possible adipose nature for it. Incisional biopsy showed a similar histological image to that described in the previous case with myxoid and round cell areas. Diagnosis was myxoid liposarcoma and material from the biopsy was sent for cytogenetic analysis and subsequently confirmed the translocation t(12;16) (q13;p11) typical of myxoid and round cell liposarcomas. During the extension study the CAT showed a 7-cm extrapulmonary mass in the posterior mediastinum. The core needle biopsy showed the same histological image as the gluteal mass. As surgical therapy would imply amputation of the leg including the hip and the pelvis (hemipelvectomy) and the patient had a second mass in the mediastinum, neodajuvant chemotherapy was initiated with iphosphamide, adriamycin and DTIC. The control MRI indicated partial response of the mass to chemotherapy and two months after diagnosis simple resection of the gluteal mass was attempted. The histological analysis of the enucleated mass showed less than 10% of tumour necrosis related to chemotherapy and confirmed the existence of widespread areas of round cells, comprising almost 40% of the tumour. After surgery local radiotherapy was initiated with good tolerance. For one year the patient remained well and apparently disease-free, but 13 months after initial diagnosis he consulted on the appearance of a right laterocervical mass. Fine-needle aspiration suggested an adipose tumour and a cervical lymphadenectomy confirmed involvement by myxoid liposarcoma",

The patient was considered to be a poor candidate for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) due to a history of head and neck irradiation and a short neck, another distance of 3 cm from carotid bifurcation, made more difficult a surgical dissection (). Percutaneous carotid artery stenting (CAS) was initially attempted with access via the femoral and right radial approach. However, this procedure was unsuccessful due to a very tortuous and calcified type III aortic arch.\nCarotid artery stenting (CAS) via the transcervical approach was then performed. The patient was given general anesthesia with the head turned towards the right side. The common carotid artery was exposed using surgical cutdown and exploration at the base of neck (). A sheath was introduced into the common carotid artery with passage through the skin of the incision proximally to allow for improved stability of the sheath (). To avoid a clamping post stenting, a gate access on common carotid was prepared with the surgiclose technique, an easy and fast trick, applicable to all vessels to avoid a damage of artery , . The area of stenosis was identified with a carotid angiogram and, previous clamping of common carotid having a flow reversal, was crossed with a filter wire where a RX Spider Filter 6 Fr (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) was used distally in the left internal carotid artery, re-opening right after the artery.

In addition to the liver metastasis, the patient suffered from mild hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The only preoperative imaging was an abdominal ultrasound; thus, an additional CT scan of the abdomen was performed in preparation for the surgical intervention. The metastasis in the CS 7 had a size of 2.2 \u00d7 2.4 cm and was closely attached to the right hepatic vein (Figure ). After careful analysis of the CT scan, it became clear that the proximal part of the middle hepatic vein was completely missing, whereas its distal branches seemed to be open. In order to get more detailed information about the anatomical situation, an additional 3D imaging of this case was performed. It was evident that the middle hepatic vein was missing. Most likely this anatomical pattern was not tumour related because there was a close proximity of metastasis and right hepatic vein (Figure ) making the resection of the right hepatic vein inevitable.

On extraoral inspection, her neck appeared short and thick, giving a double chin appearance []. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Intraoral examination showed a large swelling involving the submental, submandibular, and sublingual areas measuring 3 \u00d7 3 cm2 in diameter, adhered to the deep planes, painless, and displacing her tongue upward. The tongue was elevated to the extent that the soft palate could not be visualized. The swelling was found to be smooth, nontender, and the mucosa on the floor of the mouth was normal []. On application of pressure in the submental region, the growth was getting displaced upward. The size and appearance of the orifices of Wharton's ducts were normal.\nAn ultrasonography was performed, which revealed cystic area with echogenic material and internal echoes within it. There was no evidence of flow within the cystic area on the color doppler [].

His past history involved a high anterior resection of the rectum in our hospital due to intussusception caused by Peutz-Jeghers polyposis (Fig. ). He was hospitalized for 1 month after the procedure. Unfortunately, details of the surgical procedure that had been performed and the reason for his extended postoperative hospitalization were unknown, because clinical records from his previous admission were not available. He was followed up for 3 years after the procedure, during which he had no abdominal symptoms. He remained symptom-free until the month prior to readmission when he began to suffer from hematochezia. On this admission, hematochezia was his only symptom and there were no abnormal abdominal findings on physical examination. Blood test results, including levels of tumor markers, were all within normal limits. Colonoscopy revealed a hemorrhagic tumor with a smooth surface protruding from the anastomosis of the previous high anterior resection, at a distance of 10 cm from the anal verge; a second examination 4 days later revealed that the tumor had disappeared (Fig. ). The biopsied tumor and other small polyps were histologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma and hamartomatous polyps, respectively (data not shown). We performed a low anterior resection of the rectum, including the anastomotic site with the adenocarcinoma, combined with a resection of the ileum for strong adhesion. The patient was discharged from our hospital 42 days after the operation.\nGross appearance of the resected rectum showed a defect of the rectal mucosa with a smooth edge and a mucosal bulge located at the anastomotic site (Fig. ).
