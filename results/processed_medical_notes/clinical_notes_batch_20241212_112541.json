He also reported a productive cough with whitish sputum, shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue. He was on a daily dose of methadone 120 mg for the past 12 years for OUD. Physical examination findings showed a cachectic man with temporal wasting, evidence of dehydration, and a palpable right-sided abdominal mass. Initial labs were remarkable for marked hypercalcemia and findings suggestive of prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI). Imaging studies were remarkable for metastatic lung lesions, and multiple osteolytic lesions in the left femur, ribs, left humerus, C6, and T6 vertebrae. Abdominal imaging showed a large renal mass with renal vein thrombosis. The diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma as the primary malignancy was suspected. The prognosis was discussed with the patient, and he expressed his desire to move forward with treatment. The patient\u2019s AKI improved with intravenous fluids. Hypercalcemia also improved after zoledronic acid treatment. However, the patient's reported pain score was constantly 9 out of 10. Attempts to reduce the dose of his MMT lead to opioid withdrawal symptoms. The pain management team was consulted, and a decision was made to split the patient\u2019s total home methadone dose into 40 mg three times a day. Other non-opioid pain medications such as high-dose Tylenol and Toradol were added to his regimen but the patient reported little to no pain relief. Then, a short-acting opioid in the form of oxycodone 10 mg every four hours was added to control his breakthrough pain. However, the patient continued to have residual generalized body pain which he consistently rated 7 out of 10. His oxycodone was further increased to 20 mg which",

On admission, her vision was counting fingers in the right eye and no perception of light in the left. The patient also gave a one-day history of sensory symptoms in her legs and saddle area with urinary retention. There was a sensory level to pinprick at T8. The appearance of the optic disc was normal. MR imaging showed T2 hyperintensity and enhancement of both optic nerves intracranially just anterior to the chiasm. The brain appeared normal. MR imaging of the spinal cord showed a T2 hyperintense lesion within the distal spinal cord extending across 3 to 4 vertebral segments. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed a white cell count of 59/mm3, 78% of which were lymphocytes and the remainder polymorphs. Matched oligoclonal bands were present in CSF and serum.\nThe patient was treated with high-dose methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone and made an excellent visual recovery, and when seen three months later, her visual acuity was 6/6 in the right eye and 6/9 in the left, N5 bilaterally with no mistakes made on the Ishihara plates with either eye. There was mild bilateral temporal pallor of the optic discs. Oral prednisolone was discontinued after six-month treatment, and she remained entirely well until a year later when she developed pain on moving the left eye and MR imaging of the orbits showed enhancement of the left optic nerve/sheath complex.

Earlier in the day, the patient had presented with severe retrosternal chest pain for which a myocardial infarction was initially suspected, but the electrocardiography and the transthoracic echography performed in emergency excluded the diagnosis. A CT scan was realized and showed a local aortic plaque rupture of the ascending aorta with active contrast leakage, the patient was then transferred to our institution.\nAt admission the patient was haemodynamically stable with good blood pressure, a normal pulmonary auscultation with oxygen saturation at 100%, and no more pain. The patient was considered for open cardiac surgery but was evaluated at a high mortality risk based on his age, his medical history, and significant calcifications on his aorta. Our vascular surgical team decided then to perform an endovascular repair.\nIn emergency, an off the shelf endovascular stent graft was used. The rupture measured 12 mm and was located at just a few millimetres proximal to the IA. The ascending aorta measured 8 cm from the coronary sinuses to the IA. The largest diameter measured along the length of the ascending aorta was 33 mm (Figure).

His medical history included a right lung lobectomy for tuberculosis aged 20, chronic obstructive airways disease and ischaemic heart disease. He was a long-term smoker.\nGeneral examination showed him to be well with no lymphadenopathy. No mass was palpable on digital rectal examination. Full blood count, urea and electrolytes and liver function tests were all within normal limits.\nFlexible sigmoidoscopy and biopsy identified a rectal adenocarcinoma at 8 cm from the anal margin. MRI showed a normal liver and no para-aortic lymphadenopathy. A moderately bulky tumour was identifiable in the mid/low rectum, 5 cm in length. Local staging with MRI was T2 although the tumour was noted to be very close to the levator plate especially on the left. Perirectal and presacral lymph nodes were seen, the largest of which was 1 cm in short axis. CT scan of the chest did not identify any metastatic disease.\nAt laparotomy no peritoneal disease, liver metastases or abnormal lymph nodes were seen. A low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision was performed. Recovery was complicated by chest sepsis and prolonged ileus and the patient was fit for discharge on day 14 post surgery.\nMicroscopic examination showed complete resection margins of a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma extending through the muscularis propria.

    "original_text": "A 52-year-old Caucasian man who had no medical history presented with sacral region pain that had continued for 3 months in April 2012. There was no significant family or psychosocial history. He did not take any medications. He was a computer engineer and his job scope was mainly office work. He lived with his wife and one child in a small flat in Istanbul. He was an active tobacco smoker with a 10 pack year smoking history. Currently, he smoked five cigarettes a day. He did not consume alcohol. His physical examination revealed tenderness and swelling in the sacral region. His vital signs were stable with blood pressure 125/65, pulse rate 70/minute, and temperature 36.2 \u00b0C. A systemic examination was normal and no neurological abnormality was detected. Vertebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a pathological fracture in L5. After a Tru-Cut biopsy, he was diagnosed as having chondroid chordoma. He was treated with preoperative stereotactic radiotherapy to L5 vertebra at a total dose of 15 Gray in two fractions with CyberKnife followed by surgery in May 2012. We aimed to reduce surgical complications by preoperative stereotactic radiotherapy.

Based upon the medical records and history, at the time of diagnosis, the blood pressure was measured just in one limb and no evaluation was done on the other limbs. At that time she underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), which revealed normal findings except for mitral valve prolapse associated with mild mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic insufficiency (AI). However, it seems that the cardiologist who conducted the TTE failed to evaluate the aortic root specifically and simply started medical management of hypertension. One year after the diagnosis of hypertension, she developed left-sided lower motor neuron facial palsy, which was treated with oral corticosteroids (Prednisolone). Notably, the patient's headache was relieved after she took corticosteroid therapy. Recently, she underwent another TTE, which demonstrated severe AI and aneurysmal changes in the ascending aorta. Her cardiologist referred the patient to our hospital for further evaluation.\nThe patient had no history of Kawasaki\u2019s disease in childhood, and she reported no cardiovascular or rheumatologic diseases before the diagnosis of hypertension.

On examination at our center, a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg in the upper limbs was recorded and the pulses were equal in the upper limbs.

As metastasis from a primary site was suspected, imaging examinations, including head and neck magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) examination, were carried out, but since all were negative, it was diagnosed as ectopic malignant meningioma of the primary axillary soft tissue. After surgery, 50 Gy radiation was locally administered, and she received follow-up outpatient observation. In June 2016, chest radiography showed a nodular shadow in the right lung, so she was referred to our department. There were no notable findings in the laboratory blood test results. Chest radiography indicated a similar circular nodule shadow, 1.1 \u00d7 1.0 cm in size, in the right lower lung field. Chest CT showed the 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 cm nodule shadow in the right S4; mediastinal and hilar lymph node enlargement was not observed (Fig. B). PET-CT demonstrated slight uptake in the nodule, with a maximal standardized uptake value of 2.94 (Fig. C). There was no evidence of distant metastasis.

There was no history of hematuria in the past or during the course of his illness. The patient had been using local medicine of unknown nature without improvement. At district hospital, antibiotics and analgesic drugs were given without improvement, and the patient was referred to Bugando Medical Center. On examination, the boy was well nourished with no jaundice or pallor. All the system was essentially normal. Local examination revealed left scrotal swelling, slightly tender, cystic in consistence, could not go above it, and it was irreducible, and the impression of hydrocele was made. The patient was planned for hydrocelectomy. Initial investigation showed hemoglobin of 11.5 gm/dL, blood group B Rh+, and urine and stool was normal with no ova. The patient underwent surgery; the findings were a hydrocele, thickened tunica and small nodules on the surface of the testis which created suspicion for testicular tumor, and orchidectomy was done. The patient had uneventful recovery and was discharged after seven days.\nAt histopathology department, a cystic wall of 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 cm was received, and a testis of 1 \u00d7 0.5 cm, looked atrophic and yellowish with firm nodules on its surface. Histological examination with haematoxylin and eosin stain (H and E) showed active chronic granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid macrophages and foreign body giant cells and numerous schistosomal eggs in the thickened tunica albugenia with eosinophils infiltrate.

During the operation, nerve tumor was observed around the broken nerve ends (A). The neuroma was removed, resulting in a 1 cm defect in the median nerve. To bridge the two ends of nerves, PRGD/PDLLA/\u03b2-TCP nerve conduit (5 mm inner diameter and 15 mm length) was used (B).\nRegular follow-up examinations were conducted postoperatively. First at 3 months after the operation, monofilament touch pressure test was conducted, and the measurements on distal phalanx of index and middle finger had a failed score, while the wrist joints position was 2.0 g, and palmar opposition of left thumb has partially recovered. The function of distal phalanx of index finger and middle finger improved greatly at 6 months post-operation, the measurement from monofilament touch pressure test scored at 300 g (A). However, the nerve conduction signals were still weak. Palmar opposition of left thumb has showed significant improvement, and the patient could hold a pen with her thumb and any other finger (B). Without any external assistant, wrist bending of left hand has recovered \u223c80% as compared with that of the normal side (C).High frequency B ultrasonography confirmed the thick nerve fibers tract in the conduit (D), and broken nerves between the near and far ends have been connected.

He had 20/30 vision in his right eye and 20/40 vision in his left eye and fundoscopic examination showed a uveal melanoma from 8:30 to 11:00 in the left eye (A). Ultrasound A/B scan (B) showed a large lobulated shaped lesion from 8:30 to 11:00 in the left eye extending to within 6.2 mm of the optic nerve with no extraocular extension and basal diameter of 21.5 mm and height of 5.4 mm. The patient opted for our staged EPBT approach and received his first plaque brachytherapy procedure in August 2019 using an Eye Physics plaque 2249 fully loaded with 49 I-125 seeds (A). This was implanted for 71 hours and the prescribed dose was 45 Gy to a height of 9.5 mm. Despite a tumor height of 5.4 mm, we had to prescribe to a height of 9.5 mm to achieve adequate tumor coverage because the basal diameter was very large. The tumor was treated with a 2 mm margin with 96% of the volume receiving 100% of the prescribed dose and the scleral Dmax was 268 Gy. Biopsy at the time of the procedure showed spindle cell uveal melanoma, Class 2 PRAME positive. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the time of diagnosis showed at least 5 hepatic lesions suspicious for metastatic disease, but too small to biopsy. Follow-up 3 months later showed 20/40 vision in his right eye and 20/30 vision in his left eye.

His preoperative physical examinations were unremarkable. Besides the routine monitors, a right radial arterial line was inserted after the Allen test negative for the invasive blood pressure monitoring. The cell saver was routinely prepared preoperatively to provide salvage capability in the event of a major hemorrhage at our institution. After anesthesia induction and intubation, the surgical procedure was started. When dissecting the bone flap during the craniotomy, the blood loss exceeded 600 mL in a short time.\nThe surgeon applied the tamponade hemostasis, and simultaneously we took the rapid fluid replacement, prepared blood products, monitored the artery blood gas and injected metaraminol intravenously according the invasive blood pressure. One hour later, when the hemodynamics stabilized after the treatment, the operation was continued. But after removing the bone flaps, massive bleeding occurred once again. The compression hemostasis was applied. We administrated the patient both allogenic and autologus blood transfusion as well as fluid resuscitation. In addition, tranexamic acid and hemocoagulase were delivered intravenously. Also metaraminol and noradrenaline were applied. In total, 4 units of packed red cells, 400 mL of fresh frozen plasma, 1000 mL of cell salvage, 3100 mL of crystalloid solution and 2500 mL of colloid solution were administrated. When the hemodynamic parameters were stable after the treatments, the oozing of blood in surgical wounds occurred.

She had been aware of the slow but steady increase in the size of the lesion over the past six years. The lesion was not associated with pain, and there was no problem with mouth-opening or chewing. She had no previous facial trauma, and her medical history was not contributory. Clinical examination revealed extraoral swelling on the left side (). The regional lymph nodes were nonpalpable. Intraoral examination revealed a well-defined, round, immobile mass on the buccal plate of the left posterior mandible and buccal expansion. The lesion was bony-hard on palpation. The overlying oral mucosa was normal (). There was no pain, tenderness, or paresthesia. The mandibular first molar had been extracted previously. All of the posterior teeth were vital (positive responses to electric pulp testing). A solitary, round, 3 \u00d7 3 cm well-defined radio-opaque lesion without a radiolucent rim of mandible was detected with panoramic radiography and computed tomography (CT). The lesion extended distally of the second premolar to the mesial aspect of the second molar distal root (Figures and ). A CT scan demonstrated a large, pedunculated mass attached to the buccal surface of the left mandibular body. These clinical and radiographic features were sufficiently supportive of the working diagnosis of peripheral osteoma. There were no features of Gardner's syndrome. Because the lesion was actively growing and caused facial swelling, the patient was prepared for surgery. Under local anesthesia, the lesion was totally removed using a chisel and rotary instruments via an intraoral approach, and curettage of the cavity was undertaken ().

She visited the orthopedic clinic at Beijing Shijitan Hospital CCMU on April 2, 2018.\nExamination showed that the right foot was red and swollen, and the distal hallux had a wound that was 1 cm \u00d7 0.5 cm \u00d7 0.5 cm, with a large amount of exudation. The distal skin margin showed black gangrene, high sensitivity in the area, bone test results were positive, and there was a weak pulsation of the dorsalis pedis.

This hyperpigmentation spared the toes. He was not cyanotic and capillary refill was normal bilaterally. His fingers were normal temperature to touch, and he denied any change in color in response to cold or stress. His sensation was intact bilaterally. The remainder of his physical examination was within normal limits.\nOn further questioning, he could not pinpoint when the nail changes began but he mentions that his wife has been noticing it more for the past few years. He denies any pain or discomfort. Although he did have a prior history of skin cancer, it was unlikely that it was a subungual melanoma because of the presence of the pigmentation on all fingers.

She had also received two occipital nerve blocks through local anesthesia, but with poor effect in long-term pain management.\nThe pain had become progressively more severe, more frequent and associated with nausea. As a result of the unresponsiveness to less invasive procedures, the patient underwent ONS 2 months ago.\nONS was employed through surgery. The patient was placed in prone position under anesthesia.

Pain occurred at rest and was associated with shortness of breath. Upon arrival to the emergency room patient was still in pain, but vital signs were stable. The heart and lung examinations were remarkable for the presence of regular heart sounds with S3 gallop as well as bilateral fine basal crackles. Neither cutaneous nor mucosal petechia nor purpura was noted. The rest of the physical exam was normal. Her past medical history was significant for two uneventful pregnancies and chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) currently in remission. Ten years ago ITP was refractory with relapse during steroid tapering. Subsequently splenectomy was performed, establishing remission. Laboratory blood tests revealed hemoglobin of 15 mg/dL, platelet count of 322 \u00d7 109/L, normal PT and PTT, troponin of 0.5 ng/mL, and CKMB 7.7 ng/mL. Inferior ST elevation was present on initial ECG with poor R wave progression anteriorly.

Molecular studies revealed the presence of KRAS G12D in the neoplastic tissue. A few weeks later, the patient was started on FOLFOX. Evaluation after 4 cycles showed a partial response on the lung and liver, and at that time he underwent resection of the liver and lung lesions. He was then restarted on FOLFOX and completed a total of 11 cycles. Unfortunately, after having stopped treatment with FOLFOX following 5 months, he was found to have new pulmonary and liver lesions, local recurrence, solitary CNS metastases and multiple lymph node metastases. In order to provide better local control, he received short-course radiotherapy (5 \u00d7 500 cGy) to the pelvic area followed by surgery. A few weeks later, he underwent neurosurgery with resection of the posterior fossa lesion followed by stereotactic radiosurgery to the surgical bed. Soon thereafter, he was started on FOLFIRI and bevacizumab, achieving stable disease for 6 months with progression in multiple sites 6 months later. At that time, the patient was cachectic, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 3 and with signs of liver insufficiency with hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient did not undergo any post-operative chemotherapy due to the low malignant potential of her initial pathology. Approximately one year later, she presented to our emergency department with right sided abdominal discomfort for the past two months. The rest of patient\u2019s history was unremarkable. There were no other accompanying symptoms, namely change in bowel habits or weight loss. On physical exam, the patient had a palpable mass on the right side of her abdomen that was tender on palpation. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a 7.6\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202fcm mass with peripheral calcification suspicious for a mucocele versus mucoid epidermoid carcinoma []. Subsequent pelvic and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging also demonstrated findings suspicious for a mass abutting the cecum concerning for an appendiceal mucocele.

There was no remarkable past medical, surgical, or family history. On admission, a large nodular mass on the left lobe of the thyroid was readily recognizable and was irregular, hard, immobile and painless on palpation. Thyroid sonogram findings demonstrated a 6.1 cm \u00d7 3.9 cm mass in the left lobe with low and heterogeneous echo and an enlarged cervical lymph node measuring 2.5 cm \u00d7 1.8 cm on the left side of the neck in the level-III region with hypoechogenicity. Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid disclosed diffuse infiltration of atypical cells with a high suspicion of malignancy, therefore the patient was scheduled for surgery.\nChest radiography and laboratory examinations including thyroid hormone showed no abnormal findings. Blood calcium level was also checked for the possibility of medullary thyroid cancer, and was within normal limits. Neck contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a mass encasing the left carotid sheath vessels, esophagus, and trachea in the left thyroid lobe (Figure ). The man underwent bilateral near-total thyroidectomy and tracheostomy for palliative purposes because adhesions to adjacent structures and the aggravation of dyspnea were observed pre- and intra-operatively. Histological examination from the resected specimen verified moderate differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the thyroid gland (Figure ) with metastasis to the level-III region of the left cervical lymph nodes and characteristics similar to the esophageal lesions. Further workup with introscopy biopsy revealed a squamous cell carcinoma of the distal esophagus (Figure ). One month post surgery, the patient started chemotherapy with a docetaxel and cisplatin (DC) regimen, and radiotherapy according to the 2011 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Esophageal Cancer Guidelines.

He had a seven years history of periodic abdominal pain attacks unrelated to meals and lasting for several days. He had once appendectomy and once laparotomy for acute abdominal findings. Because he had recurrent bouts of abdominal pain, colchicine treatment was started considering the diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). No objective improvement was achieved on this treatment and the patient stopped taking the drug because of the adverse effects such as diarrhea. For the last three weeks, the abdominal pain persisted, became very severe and worsened after meals with nausea and vomiting. In physical examination, the patient was pale and cachectic, abdominal examination revealed guarding and diffuse abdominal tenderness to palpation. There was ascites at level of umbilicus. The patient's past history and family history were noncontributory. In the initial radiological and biochemical assessment, there were no sign of acute abdomen and thus laparotomy was not indicated.\nResults of initial laboratory analyses are shown in table . Diagnostic paracentesis revealed ascites of portal type (serum-ascites albumin gradient was 2.3 g/dL). The cachexia and decreased levels of transferrin saturation, cholesterol, triglyceride and albumin were assessed as a sign of malabsorption and with these findings we considered a small intestinal disease.\nIn abdominal ultrasonography (USG), ascites and portal and splenic vein thromboses were observed. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography showed increased wall thickness of intestinal loops, splenic, portal and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis.

The patient reported that he was well until 4 days prior when he was intoxicated and awoke with the symptoms. For 4 days, slight improvement of weakness occurred. He had no history of antecedent trauma, injury, infection, or mononeuropathy. Neurologic examination revealed weakness of the left wrist and finger extension (Medical Research Council grade II). Finger abduction appeared weak, but strength improved when the hand was passively extended to the neutral position. Wrist and finger flexion was intact. On sensory examination, there was a well-demarcated area of hypoesthesia and a tingling sensation over the lateral dorsum of the left hand between the thumb and index finger extending into the proximal phalanges of the 2nd finger. In addition, reddish skin color and slight edema were observed in the same area (Fig. ). There was no definite change in skin temperature and no pain. Reflexes were normal at the biceps and triceps brachii muscles, but the left brachioradialis reflex was absent. Routine blood analysis showed white blood cell count, C-reactive protein level and uric acid level were normal. According to the clinical information and neurologic examination, he was diagnosed with compressive radial neuropathy. After approximately two weeks of observation without specific treatment, the skin color recovered along with a marked improvement of the weakness and aberrant sensation. A nerve conduction study and electromyography were performed 2 weeks after the onset of the symptoms (Table ). On the affected left side, a normal radial compound motor action potential (CMAP) was recorded over the extensor indicis proprius muscle with the forearm and elbow stimulated. When stimulated above the spiral groove, the CMAP was reduced by 34% compared to that of distal stimulations. The contralateral radial motor nerve study and sensory nerve conduction were normal.
