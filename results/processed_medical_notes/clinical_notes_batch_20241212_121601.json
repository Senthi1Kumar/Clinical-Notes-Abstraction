She was a known hypertensive for nine years and her blood pressure (BP) was controlled on amlodipine 5 mg and atenolol 50 mg orally, once daily. On the preoperative visit, her BP and HR were found to be 130/80 mm Hg and 78 beats per minute respectively. All other investigations were normal. She had no clinical evidence of any end organ dysfunction or limitation of physical activity.\nThe patient received diazepam 5 mg per orally, the night before surgery, atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, per orally, two hours before surgery and glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intramuscularly half hour before surgery. Hydrocortisone 200 mg intravenously was given before induction as she was on long term steroid therapy.\nGeneral anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl 150 \u03bcg and thiopentone 250 mg. Rocuronium 50 mg was administered to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Anaesthesia was maintained with 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen, isoflurane, fentanyl and vecuronium. Continuous monitoring of ECG, pulse oximetry, NIBP, IBP (left radial artery) and nasopharyngeal temperature was done. The patient was positioned prone on the Wilson's frame. After the patient was made prone, there was malfunctioning of temperature probe and temperature monitoring was not possible. The patient was covered with surgical drapes and received warm intravenous fluids. The patient remained haemodynamically stable until the instrumentation was completed which lasted for six hours.

He had undergone a left pneumonectomy due to a pulmonary tuberculosis infection 24 years ago. He had symptoms of dyspnea and hemoptysis. His respiratory rate was 23 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation was 90% in room air. He was conscious, fully responsive to questions, and his initial vital signs were stable. His blood pressure was 150/90 mm Hg, and his heart rate was 100 beats per minute without the use of inotropic drugs. The laboratory findings were as follows: hemoglobin level, 12.2 g/dL; and partial oxygen pressure, 60 mm Hg. Chest computed tomography revealed a 1.7-cm foreign body in the medial basal segment of the right lower lobe and a fracture of the right seventh rib without pneumothorax or hemothorax ().

    "original_text": "A 6-year-old boy presented to us with a history of tube protruding per anus. He had undergone VP shunt (Chhabra-slit-in-spring silicone shunt) at the age of 4 years for congenital hydrocephalus followed by shunt revision 6 months back. After this revision surgery, in the postoperative period, he had mild abdominal pain and distension for 3 days which was settled with conservative management. The child was discharged on the postoperative day 10 with no complaints.\nSix months later, the child presented to us with tube protruding through the anus. There was no history of fever, abdominal distension. Child did not have vomiting, headache, and loss of appetite. Clinical examination did not reveal any signs of peritonitis or meningitis. Peritoneal end of the VP shunt was protruding through the anus []. There was dribbling of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the distal end of VP shunt. Child was investigated with plain X-ray abdomen erect and ultrasonography of abdomen. X-ray abdomen erect confirmed the peritoneal end of the shunt tube going well beyond the pubic symphysis []. There was no knotting of the shunt tube seen. No gas under diaphragm was noted. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis could not trace the distal end of shunt tube. The absence of ascites further supported the diagnosis. After preoperative evaluation and counseling with parents, he was posted for surgery. A small incision was taken at the neck and the tube was cut. Then migrated peritoneal end of VP shunt which was visible per anus was gently pulled, and the shunt was delivered out. Remaining shunt system with shunt chamber was removed after exploring previous parietal incision.

He had neck rigidity and left sided hemiplegia. Investigations revealed a high white blood cell count. CT scan and MRI of brain showed extensive subdural collection of pus bilaterally, more so on the right side.\nSubdural empyema was drained through bilateral burr holes. Patient received metronidazole and ceftriaxone. Pus was cultured but showed no growth even after 21 days. The patient\u2019s condition improved and he was discharged after 3 weeks.\nThree months later he was brought to the Emergency Room with headache and altered sensorium. CT scan of brain with contrast showed a ring enhancing lesion in the left temporo-parietal region. Keeping in view his past history and radiological features of the lesion, a diagnosis of cerebral abscess was made. The abscess was approached through a burr hole and thick yellow pus was aspirated. A drain was left in the abscess cavity. As before, there was no growth on bacterial or fungal cultures.\nCefotaxime, penicillin and metronidazole were given, but fever and neck stiffness persisted. After twelve days, antibiotics were changed to metronidazole, vancomycin and amikacin. The patient continued to deteriorate and a week later ceftazidime and teicoplanin therapy was begun, without any improvement.\nAfter five days, intravenous chloramphenicol was given for three days and then orally for another four days, after which no more chloramphenicol was available at our institution.

The patient had diffuse peritoneal symptoms and was septic on admission to the hospital. He had earlier been diagnosed with COPD stage 1 and is still smoking around 10 cigarettes a day. He had no other known chronic illnesses and did not use any medication. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin\u2013tazobactam) and intravenous fluid therapy was initiated immediately. A computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed free air in the abdominal cavity (Figure ). The patient was recently diagnosed with a suspicious lesion in the right lung and a suspected pathological fracture localized in the lumbar spine. He was then operated on utilizing a novel Graham patch for a perforated duodenal ulcer. The perforation was measured at about 1.5 cm in size. An 18 French drain with low active pressure (suction) was left in the abdominal cavity. Postoperatively, there was a persistent leakage of about 1000 mL per day. On the ninth postoperative day, he underwent an upper endoscopy. The perforation was visualized in the duodenal bulb and could easily be traversed with a 5.8 mm upper slim scope (Figure ).\nThe patient's clinical condition was tenuous, and it was felt that he would likely not be able to tolerate a major surgical intervention such as a Billroth II reconstruction since he was deemed to be an ASA class 4 according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists.

Myasthenia gravis was diagnosed in May 2016 and he underwent thymectomy in November 2016 for thymic hyperplasia. From the point of diagnosis, he had two episodes of myasthenic crisis, precipitated by lower respiratory tract infections that required mechanical ventilatory support. Thereafter, he was on regular pyridostigmine, 50 mg/6 hourly, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 500 mg twice daily, and orally administered prednisolone therapy. He was able to perform his daily routines of life with negligible support. Meanwhile, he developed progressive dysphagia for solids initially and then for liquids for a 3-month duration. He was evaluated by a neurologist and referred to the surgical team for upper GI endoscopy. Since that was also uneventful, he was referred to our radiology unit for a contrast study. On admission to the radiology unit, he had normal respiratory parameters and his limb muscle power was grade 5/5. Due to the possible risk of aspiration, 10 ml of iohexol (Omnipaque\u2122) was given under fluoroscopy guidance.

In 2005 he was treated for a testicular seminoma Stage IIA with orchidectomy and postoperative radiation therapy and has since been recurrence free. Since 2000 he was completely unable to work. Most days he was only able to perform minor in-house tasks. He had severe general myalgic pain, headaches, chronic diarrhoea, increased sweating and dizziness. Cognitive function was markedly reduced and worsening over the years. He was unable to read more than a page or two of writing and suffered from hypersensitivity to noise.\nTwo weeks after single rituximab infusion (500 mg/m2) the diarrhoea vanished, while all the other symptoms remained unchanged. Before treatment he was mostly confined to rest indoors, with very brief walks, usually to and from the garden mailbox once daily.

On physical examination, he had pain on movement of the spine with bilateral Grade IV motor strength in both lower extremities. There was not numbness in both feet and ankles with normal ankle reflexes bilaterally. There was a normal knee reflex bilaterally. There was no obvious bulge in the bilateral kidney region, and the left lateral kidney region knocks out to be positive for pain. The neurological symptoms were ascribed to the compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots by an expanding mass partly protruding into the vertebral canal.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed that the left side of the vertebral body and the left peritoneum showed an elliptical abnormal signal shadow, which showed a dumbbell growth. The MRI scan showed an area of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images in the T12-L4 paravertebral region. At discovery, on the left side of the L1 vertebral body, there was a slightly longer T1/T2 signal, with a size of 8.6 \u00d7 8.4 \u00d7 12.4 cm (Fig. ). The boundary was clear, and the enhanced scan showed an uneven separation. The lesion protruding into the erector spinae muscles and behind the retroperitoneum are connected to the lesion in the vertebral canal through the intervertebral foramen, and the spinal cord was compressed and the boundary was clear.

His right eyelid had a wound of approximately 2 cm and was severely swollen so that his right eyeball was barely visible. Subconjunctival hemorrhage was present, and his vision was somewhat reduced. In the preoperative ophthalmologic examination, his visual acuity was 0.2 in the right eye and 1.0 in the left. There was a limitation of eye movement upward, and the patient experienced diplopia when looking forward and upward. Computed tomography revealed fracture of the right inferior and medial orbital wall and entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle with orbital fat herniation (Fig. ). Six days later, the surgery was performed, with reconstruction of the orbital wall. On the day of surgery, there was no specificity. However, at dawn on the day after surgery, the patient complained of severe pain and proptosis in the right eye and no vision. Retrobulbar hematoma was confirmed on CT, and the patient was consulted to ophthalmology. The intraocular pressure of the right eye did not appear to be high; thus, lateral cantholysis was not performed. The patient was followed-up with, and he was treated with systemic corticosteroids in a standard dosage for 3 days (dexamethasone disodium phosphate, 15 mg/day). However, his vision did not recover, and on the third postoperative day, the access was reopened, and hematoma removal was performed (Fig. ).

She had noticed a sudden enlargment of the painless, dark pink-blue noduler lesion on her nose for the past two months []. There was no palpable lymph node in the neck. The lesion was excised with a 5 mm free margin and the wound was closed by primary suturation. Gross examination of the resected specimen showed a 1 \u00d7 1 cm, pink\u2013blue noduler lesion. The specimen was fixed in a 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde solution and embedded in paraffin. It was routinely processed with hematoxylin and eosin staining. Microscopic examination revealed a nodular tumor located in the dermis. The overlying epidermis demonstrated hyperplastic changes. A heavy lymphocytic infiltration was present mainly at the peripheral portions of the tumor, but some were also scattered between the tumor cells [].\nAt higher magnifications, two distinct populations of neoplastic epithelial cells (small dark basaloid cells and pale cells, which are larger with vesicular nuclei and pale cytoplasm) and tubule formations were characteristic features of the tumor. Tubules lined by two rows of epithelial cells were found within the tumor. The presence of basaloid secretion material, some surrounded by neoplastic cells, throughout the neoplasm attracted attention [].\nThe resulting appereance resembles an eccrine spiradenoma. However in some areas, the tumor showed malignant change. These malignant components were composed of solid aggregates of tumor cells with mild to modarate nuclear atypia, high mitotic figures (12/10 high-power field) and focal tumor cell necrosis [Figures and ].

For a couple of months prior to her visit, she had been aware of an abnormal sensation in her left mandible, which gradually progressed to mild pain and numbness. She visited a general dental practitioner, who diagnosed her condition as osteomyelitis and referred her to our department. Her medical and family histories were unremarkable. On initial assessment, no obvious systemic symptoms were evident. A panoramic radiograph showed a widening of the periodontal ligament space, periapical bone loss in tooth #37, and a diffuse radiolucent lesion involving the left body of her mandible, with an indistinct cortical margin and ill-defined cortical borders of the inferior alveolar nerve canal (Fig. ). Moreover, the radiograph also showed that tooth #37 had previously been treated endodontically. Therefore, a diagnosis of apical periodontitis was suggested and endodontic treatment was performed; however, her symptoms were not relieved. Consequently, a neoplastic lesion was highly suspected and findings of a biopsy of the apical tissue after extraction of tooth #37 resulted in a histopathological diagnosis of tissue inflammation. However, after the biopsy, a gradual progressive swelling of the left mandible occurred (Fig. ). Computed tomography (CT) showed an enhanced lesion on the left mandible, and magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed abnormally high-intensity signal in the bone marrow, with surrounding soft tissue mass (Fig. ).

Her pregnancy was significant for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) controlled by glyburide. She had gestational thrombocytopenia with the lowest recorded platelet count of 111 \u00d7 109 per liter with no clinical sequelae. Her body mass index was 22.5 kg/m2. Her obstetrical history was notable for three spontaneously conceived pregnancies. A previous pregnancy was significant for GDM, managed with glyburide, followed by an uncomplicated labor and vaginal delivery of a healthy term infant. She also had a prior first trimester spontaneous abortion without complications. She had menarche at age 11 years with normal puberty and sexual development. Of note, at age 3\u20134 years, she was diagnosed with idiopathic short stature because her growth curve plateaued, but an endocrine evaluation was normal. She was treated with recombinant growth hormone (GH) beginning at 7 years of age, which was discontinued at the onset of puberty at age 12. She reached a final adult height of 152.4 cm (5 feet).\nIn the current case, the patient had an uneventful labor course and no analgesia or epidural anesthesia.

There was no significant past medical or surgical history. Taking the age and symptoms into account, he was immediately subjected to an electrocardiogram, which was normal except for right axis deviation. The cardiac enzymes were within normal limits. This was followed by a chest X-ray which was reported as left-sided tension pneumothorax for which intercostal chest drainage (ICD) was done. As the patient continued to be symptomatic, he was referred to our institute for further management 6 h later.\nHe presented to our casualty with breathlessness and chest pain along with a nonfunctioning ICD in situ. He was tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 25/min, a heart rate of 120/min, and his blood pressure was normal around 110/70 mm Hg. However, his oxygen saturation was well maintained in room air. Examination revealed a tracheal shift to the right and a tympanic note on percussion of the left hemithorax. He had characteristic findings on auscultation of the chest, with absent breath sounds in the left hemithorax, and the heart sounds being better heard on the right side. We also noticed gurgling bowel sounds in the left side. The abdomen was scaphoid, and there was no tenderness or organomegaly. On suspicion of herniation of abdominal contents into the chest, a nasogastric tube was inserted, and around 2 L of gastric contents were drained. This led to a dramatic improvement in his symptoms.

Her surgical history was significant for a MiniArc sling for stress urinary incontinence four years prior to presentation, endometrial ablation for abnormal uterine bleeding two years ago, remote C-section, and a laparoscopic bilateral tubal ligation. During examination, a hard, tender, and immobile mass was palpated on the anterior wall of the vagina. The epithelium covering the mass was intact and there was no discharge or bleeding noted during the examination. Due to her complaints of urinary urgency and frequency, cystourethroscopy was initially performed. No abnormality was found in the urethra by evaluation using a 0-degree cystoscope. The intravesical cavity was without any abnormal findings using a 70-degree cystoscope and with complete evaluation of the entire bladder including all edges. An MRI revealed a lesion measuring 3.1 \u00d7 2.4 \u00d7 2.2 cm shown along the anterior wall of the vagina, adjacent to the base of the bladder ().\nThe patient opted for removal of the vaginal mesh as dyspareunia had occurred after its placement. Vaginal excision of the mesh and surrounding mass was performed by making a vertical incision in the anterior vaginal wall, and cystourethroscopy confirmed the integrity of the bladder and urethra following the procedure. Specimens of the mesh and surrounding mass were sent to pathology for evaluation (). It consisted of red-pink soft tissue measuring 3 \u00d7 2.5 cm admixed with blood clot.\nHistologically, specimens demonstrated a marked fibroblast reaction with large numbers of giant cells (). Many of these giant cells exhibited osteoclastic features.

The lesion started as a small blister at the distal part of his left middle finger that eventually ruptured and became ulcerated. There was serous discharge that did not smell foul. The patient had experienced a cat bite over his finger 1 month prior to the lesion's appearance. He sought treatment at private clinics twice and was given multiple courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics including oral augmentin, but no improvement was seen. He underwent wound dressing at local health clinics daily and treatment for a diabetic ulcer. However, the lesion persisted by becoming enlarged and reaching the interphalangeal joint area. The patient felt pain in that area.\nOn examination, his vital signs were within the normal range and his capillary blood glucose was 7.9 mmol/L. Examination of his left middle finger showed an ulcerated lesion that was tender on palpation, irregular in margin, measured approximately 2\u00d72 cm with serous and bloody discharge. The skin surrounding the lesion looked normal with no signs of inflammation (). There were no palpable nodules over the dorsum of the left hand or the left forearm and no palpable lymph nodes.\nA full blood panel revealed a hemoglobin level of 13.0 g/dL, white blood count of 6.0\u00d7109/L and platelet count of 165\u00d7109/L. His baseline liver function and renal function test results were in the normal range. His latest hemoglobin A1c result was 7.9%. A skin biopsy taken from the lesion showed irregular epidermal hyperplasia with hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis. Inflammatory cell infiltration was seen within the epidermis.

Thirty days prior to hospital admission, he was started on LTG 25 mg/day along with VPA, since his seizures were no longer under control with VPA. Two weeks later, the dose was increased (50 mg/day). His morning trough plasma VPA level was measured before LTG was added to the therapy yielding a concentration of 85 mg/L. On admission, he presented macular lesions on the front of the thorax that extend to the back, followed by bilateral eyelid edema and ulcerated lesions at the level of lips, jugal mucosa, and pharynx. He developed erythematosus conjunctivitis with ulcers. He presented skin rash with high fever (39\u00b0C) and respiratory failure type I. History revealed that no such lesions occurred earlier and that was the first time such rashes have occurred. Other personal and family history was not relevant. From a dermatologic point of view and based on the history and clinical presentation, a diagnosis of SJS was made. Since the presumptive cause was LTG, the drug was discontinued immediately.

As he remained symptomatic despite maximal dose of flecainide he was changed to sotalol and his symptoms improved. Repeat Holter monitoring showed APBs and occasional ventricular premature beats (VPBs). Cardiac catheterization revealed good left ventricular systolic function with normal coronary arteries.\nUnfortunately, he remained symptomatic with PAF and was unwilling to commence amiodarone given its long-term side effects and opted for percutaneous catheter ablation therapy. Baseline electrophysiology study revealed concentric decremental retrograde and antegrade conduction; dual AV node physiology was not demonstrated and tachycardia was not induced despite use of intravenous isoprenaline infusion, repeat curves and burst pacing. Given his documented PAF, pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) was performed using the Ensite NavX\u2122 electro-anatomic mapping system (St Jude Medical, Minnesota, USA). Ablation was carried out at the ostia of all four pulmonary veins. During the ablation procedure the patient went into AF; ablation was carried out near areas of complex fractionated atrial electrograms around the left superior and inferior pulmonary veins which produced profound bradycardia ().

The patient had already received coronary stent placement and implantation of a defibrillator device due to severe congestive heart failure 2 months prior to this admission. Echocardiogram investigation demonstrated signs of severe left heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction rate of 25%. Furthermore, the patient presented with a high level of catecholamines; therefore, the decision for LVAD/RVAD implantation was taken.

We have no other details regarding dose and frequency of the irradiation. Subsequent health developments and interventions are well documented in the case notes within both the General Practice setting and the hospital departments she has visited since. Relatives, one of whom I interviewed, have told the lady that during the London Blitz, she was treated for an extensive mole on her face and neck that was present at birth, and that being a frail child, she was not expected to live.\nAs a child, right facial asymmetry became progressively more apparent due to arrested development of the skull bones and teeth.

In November 2015, histological examination of colonic polyps removed during routine colonoscopy revealed the presence of prominent nodular aggregates of atypical small to medium size lymphocytes positive for b-lymphocyte antigen CD20 (CD20), cyclin D1, and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), with weak expression of lymphocyte antigen CD5 (CD5) and approximately 20% of the lymphoma cells staining for cellular proliferation marker Ki-67 (Ki-67). The histological diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma was made. He had no symptoms consistent with lymphoma. Complete blood count revealed modest anemia, and normal white cell and platelet counts. The blood smear did not contain abnormal lymphocytes at that time. Serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level was in the normal range at presentation and throughout the course of his disease. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) showed scattered metabolically active enlarged lymph nodes in both axillae, mediastinum, and around the upper abdomen around the pancreas. Diffuse metabolic activity was also detected in the spleen, which was enlarged.

Initially, he felt that his fingers started to feel numb, which went away as the day progressed. However, several days prior to presentation, he noted persistent numbness with new discoloration of his fingertips that began to worsen as well. Upon presentation to the hospital, his left ulnar pulse was not palpable, and his left second to fifth fingertips appeared deeply cyanotic with early gangrenous changes. He denied any other symptoms.\nHe had a past medical history significant for anxiety, depression, alcohol abuse and chronic back pain. He was an active smoker of about 16 pack-years. He also had a remote history of heroin and cocaine use, and his last relapse was documented over 10 years ago. He was a former truck driver who drove mostly with his left hand despite being right-hand dominant.\nOn examination, his left second to fifth fingertips appeared profoundly cyanotic with early gangrenous changes.

    "original_text": "A 62-year-old woman undergoing presurgical evaluation for an olfactory groove meningioma resection was incidentally found to have a pancreatic mass on an abdominal CT in April 2009. The 2.9 \u00d7 2.5 cm mass was centered in the pancreatic body with a round shape, well-defined margins, and avid homogenous enhancement (). There was mild upstream pancreatic duct dilation. There was no lymphadenopathy in the abdomen and pelvis or other signs of another primary tumor or metastatic disease. Differential considerations offered included either a neuroendocrine tumor or a vascular abnormality such as an aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm. An endoscopic ultrasound performed at the time revealed a 2.2 cm well-defined solid hypoechoic mass in the pancreatic body, suspicious for a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Fine needle aspiration of this mass showed no evidence of a malignancy, but only changes of chronic pancreatitis. The patient's abdominal physical examination was normal, and she denied any abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea, or constipation. Repeat CT in October 2013 demonstrated mild interval increase in size of the mass to 3.0 \u00d7 3.0 cm. An endoscopic ultrasound was repeated in December 2013, confirming an increase in size of the solid mass (). Repeat fine needle aspiration of the mass yielded only atypical epithelial cells. The patient's complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and plasma carcinoembryonic antigen levels were all within normal limits. Urine catecholamine metabolite levels were never checked presurgically as the patient exhibited no symptoms or signs of excess catecholamine production. Hence, metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy was also not performed.\nThe patient underwent a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy in March 2014 for excision of the mass.

    "cleaned_text": "a 62-year-old woman undergoing presurgical evaluation for an olfactory groove meningioma resection was incidentally found to have a pancreatic mass on an abdominal ct in april 2009. the 2.9 \u00d7 2.5 cm mass was centered in the pancreatic body with a round shape, well-defined margins, and avid homogenous enhancement (). there was mild upstream pancreatic duct dilation. there was no lymphadenopathy in the abdomen and pelvis or other signs of another primary tumor or metastatic disease. differential considerations offered included either a neuroendocrine tumor or a vascular abnormality such as an aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm. an endoscopic ultrasound performed at the time revealed a 2.2 cm well-defined solid hypoechoic mass in the pancreatic body, suspicious for a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. fine needle aspiration of this mass showed no evidence of a malignancy, but only changes of chronic pancreatitis. the patient's abdominal physical examination was normal, and she denied any abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea, or constipation. repeat ct in october 2013 demonstrated mild interval increase in size of the mass to 3.0 \u00d7 3.0 cm. an endoscopic ultrasound was repeated in december 2013, confirming an increase in size of the solid mass (). repeat fine needle aspiration of the mass yielded only atypical epithelial cells. the patient's complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and plasma carcinoembryonic antigen levels were all within normal limits. urine catecholamine metabolite levels were never checked presurgically as the patient exhibited no symptoms or signs of excess catecholamine production. hence, metaiodobenzylguanidine (mibg) scintigraphy was also not performed.\nthe patient underwent a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy in march 2014 for excision of the mass. a well-circumscribed tan mass measuring 2.8 \u00d7 2.8 \u00d7 2.7 cm was found on the posterior aspect of the pancreas and was diagnosed as a paraganglioma through pathology. the rest of the pancreas and spleen were unremarkable. the patient tolerated the procedure well, but developed a pancreatic duct leak after",

There was no history of trauma. Besides the discomfort in the left elbow, the patient had a history of lumbar disc protrusion and hypertension, which was well controlled with medication. No other medical related history could be traced. Physical examination showed a painless mass (about 1 cm*2 cm) in the ulnar side of her left elbow with no inflammation. Neurologic examination revealed light numbness on the ulnar side of her left hand and fingers. No pathological sign was detected positive. Electromyography (EMG) showed the ulnar nerve across the elbow was injured. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed a subcutaneous irregular abnormal signal in the upper ulnar side of left forearm, hyperintense on T1and T2-weighted image which was considered to be a benign lesion, and joint effusion in the left elbow (Fig. ). X-ray showed degenerated change in the left elbow joint. Laboratory studies revealed the routine blood test, tumor markers, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were all within normal range.
