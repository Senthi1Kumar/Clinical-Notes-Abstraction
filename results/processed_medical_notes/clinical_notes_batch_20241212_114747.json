The other causes of chronic abdominal pain were investigated by several studies including gastrointestinal endoscopies and imaging; however, no definitive cause could be identified.

Peak systolic velocity (PSV) in the celiac trunk was measured as 250 cm/s, and dropped to 170 cm/s with deep inspiration (\u0394PSV = 80 cm/s). Diagnosis was confirmed by three-dimensional (3D) CT angiography confirming the narrowing of celiac artery at the beginning of the celiac trunk arising from abdominal aorta [].\nThe procedure was carried out via four 5 mm trocars. After opening the lesser omentum, crural fibers of diaphragm was dissected to expose median arcuate ligament. Celiac ganglion was cauterized and incised with hook cautery. Then, arcuate ligament was dissected above celiac artery and released with a sealing device (Ligasure; Covidien\u00ae) []. After the releasing of the ligament, celiac trunk was free, and pulsation can be seen clearly at the distal branches of celiac artery. There were no intraoperative complications and the patient was discharged on the second postoperative day.\nIn the postoperative period, patient was admitted to our clinic with recurrent symptoms of mild abdominal pain. The patient underwent postoperative Doppler ultrasonography. PSV in the celiac trunk was measured as 202 cm/s, and dropped to 162 cm/s with deep inspiration (\u0394PSV = 40cm/s). Also, 3D CT angiography was performed to demonstrate the improvement in narrowing of celiac artery. However, surgical clips did not allow for demonstration of celiac artery properly.

The stage of the tumor was pT2N1M0 (IIIA) and she received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (capecitabine oxaliplatin-50,4 Gy RT) postoperatively. After completing the adjuvant therapies, she was well without weight loss, rectal bleeding, or any change in defecation frequency. One year ago she started suffering from upper abdominal pain and the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level rose to 232 ng/mL.

An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed at the time of admission. Although he had developed a DH, this was missed during CT screening ().\nLaboratory evaluations indicated a hemoglobin level of 12.2 g/dl, an alanine transaminase (ALT) level of 259 U/L, and an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 412 U/L; this was thought to be related to the RTA. Other laboratory evaluations indicated that the renal profile, amylase level, and coagulation profile were within the normal range. Hemoglobin level remained stable, while ALT and AST levels decreased during admission. He exhibited no further symptoms and was discharged after 2 days with a cast on the right forearm; no other interventions were considered necessary.\nThree days after discharge, the patient started to vomit. The frequency of vomiting increased with time and persisted for 27 days before medical advice was sought. The patient presented to our emergency department with persistent nonbilious vomiting, abdominal pain, inability to tolerate feeding, and weight loss of 2 kg. He was considered to have an intestinal obstruction. A CT scan was performed, this time revealing a DH causing narrowing of the duodenal lumen ().

The amputated auricle was placed in a plastic bag with saline, surrounded by ice, and brought to the emergency room with the individual. The patient was immediately started on intravenous antibiotics (Ampicillin/Sulbactam 3 g qid plus metronidazole 500 mg qid), and was led to the operating room approximately four hours following the accident. There, it was decided to reattach the ear as a composite graft. In order to enhance the \"take\", the epidermis and outer layer of the dermis of the posterior aspect of the graft were sharply excised with a scalpel. In addition, multiple small fenestrations were made in the cartilage and posterior-anterior perichondrium. The skin margin of the amputated stump was dermabraded for a distance of 0.5 mm from the edge and a postauricular flap was elevated. Both the graft and the amputated stump of the ear were meticulously cleaned with rigorous use of normal saline and povidone iodine 10%. No injection of topical vasoconstricting agents was used. The anterior skin of the graft was sutured in layers to the amputated stump of the ear and the skin of the helical rim was sutured to the elevated postauricular flap. Two vicryl 3-0 sutures were used for fixation of the graft to the tissues of the mastoid bed (Figure ). A Penrose drain was inserted and a loose bandage was applied. The drain was removed three days later and the patient received additional treatment postoperatively with pentoxiphylline orally (400 mg q8h). Antibiotics were administered for a total period of ten days (five days I.V and five days orally). The patient was strongly advised to stop smoking, and was released from hospital on the 7th postoperative day.",

A 2.5 mm \u00d7 38 mm Promus DES was placed in the proximal LAD. Three Promus DES were placed in the mid RCA: 2.5 mm \u00d7 20 mm, 2.5 mm \u00d7 28 mm, and 2.5 mm \u00d7 24 mm stent. His peak CK-MB and troponin were 77.4 and 107 ng/L, respectively. The patient was discharged on optimal medical therapy including dual antiplatelet therapy of aspirin and clopidogrel. Due to financial constraints, ticagrelor or prasugrel could not be prescribed. He was seen one week after discharge with no complaints and was compliant with his medications.\nThe patient presented eight days after the index hospitalization with severe, crushing, substernal chest pressure. The electrocardiogram showed ST segment elevation in the inferior and anteroseptal leads (). An emergent coronary angiogram was performed revealing 100% occlusion of the proximal LAD and mid RCA due to in-stent thrombosis (Figures and ). The patient also developed sustained ventricular tachycardia prior to PCI that was terminated with external defibrillation. Successful PCI with aspiration thrombectomy and balloon angioplasty was performed using a 2.5 mm \u00d7 15 mm NC quantum Apex balloon to the proximal LAD and middle RCA lesion (Figures and ). The patient also developed multiple episodes of symptomatic sinus bradycardia that resolved with atropine and placement of a temporary transvenous pacemaker. We suspected clopidogrel resistance; hence the patient was treated with aspirin and ticagrelor therapy. Further laboratory testing confirmed that patient had homozygous polymorphism of CYP2C192.

The patient complained of a chronically red left eye and double vision in the left gaze. Initial examination disclosed best corrected visual acuity 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye, associated with a left relative afferent pupillary defect and severely reduced color vision on Ishihara testing in his left eye only. Humphrey visual field assessment disclosed diffuse defects in the left eye, but was normal in the right eye. Slit lamp examination disclosed a red left eye with dilated corkscrew vessels, but no evidence of angle closure, blood in the Schlemm canal, or other causes of raised intraocular pressure. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 28 mmHg in the left eye, and 14 mmHg in the right, healthy eye. Fundoscopy disclosed dilated retinal veins on the left side, but no venous stasis retinopathy, or choroidal detachment. The remainder of the ophthalmic examination disclosed mild left abduction deficit, mild ptosis and 3 mm proptosis on the left side. Partial embolization of the angiographically confirmed left dural CCF resulted in incomplete clinical recovery: despite complete regression of the left optic neuropathy and of the left abduction deficit, the left eye remained red, associated with raised intraocular pressure requiring topical medication. Optical coherence tomography angiography of the anterior segment was performed, using a described technique [], with optic disc imaging as well using the AngioVue (Optovue Inc. Fremont, CA, USA).

Plain film examination confirmed the diagnosis of posterohumeral dislocation (Figure ), and the patient was manipulated under general anaesthesia in the theatre (Figure ).\nPreoperatively, it was noted that he had numbness in the distribution of the median nerve.

    "original_text": "A 60-year-old Japanese male presented with severe headache and was transferred to our hospital 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. Diffuse, thick SAH was observed on his computed tomography (CT) scan and a hematoma in the right frontal lobe suggested a ruptured aneurysm at the distal anterior cerebral artery (ACA) or anterior communicating (A-com) artery (Figure a). The degree of SAH of the patient was classified as Fisher CT Group 3, and the highest CT number (Hounsfield number) exceeded 60 in the SAH, which suggested a significant risk for symptomatic vasospasm (Figure a). Subsequent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed the same information on the aneurysms and showed no aneurysm at the distal ACA (Figure b). An immediate operation was considered the best course of action and a left front-temporal craniotomy was chosen in order to reach both aneurysms. After the introduction of general anesthesia, we inserted a spinal drainage tube which was kept closed until the craniotomy was completed.

He was born at 32 weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 2070 g.\nPhysical examination revealed heart rate of 140 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 60 per minute with subcostal retractions and blood pressure of 80/40 mmHg in the right arm. Oxygen saturation in room air was 95% in the right upper limb and 93% in the lower limb. The peripheral pulses were bounding with no radio-femoral delay. The precordium was hyperdynamic and the apex beat was located in the left fifth intercostal space at the mid-clavicular line. On auscultation, first heart sound was normal and second heart sound was narrowly split with loud pulmonary component. No murmurs were audible.\nChest radiography demonstrated cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic ratio 65%) with right atrium and right ventricle enlargement. Lung fields were plethoric. Electrocardiogram demonstrated biventricular hypertrophy with QRS axis of 90\u00b0. Echocardiography revealed a large PDA with predominant right to left shunt and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. On suprasternal view, the aortic arch was left sided with transverse arch measuring 7 mm. Only two arch vessels were seen, with the first vessel probably trifurcating. Isthmus just after the second vessel measured 4 mm; hence, coarctation was suspected [].\nThe coarctation segment did not look narrow enough to explain predominant right to left shunting of PDA. To delineate the severity of coarctation and the arch anatomy, cardiac computed tomographic angiography (CT angiography) was planned.

She was diagnosed with chronic iridocyclitis and treated with topical corticosteroids with limited improvements. More detailed examinations were not performed at that time.

On presentation, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, and intraocular pressure was normal. A slit-lamp examination showed KPs and inflammatory cells (2+) in the anterior chamber of the right eye. A fundus examination of the right eye revealed vitreous opacities (3+). Slit-lamp and fundus examinations of the left eye showed no abnormalities. Since the identification of lymphoma cells in the vitreous is required for a diagnosis of PVRL, we performed diagnostic vitrectomy. A vitreous biopsy sample indicated increased IL-10 levels (379 ng/mL) and an elevated IL-10 to IL-6 (12.6 pg/mL) ratio. A cytological analysis also showed large atypical lymphoid cells, resulting in DLBCL. She was diagnosed with PVRL with CNS involvement and started treatment. She underwent one course of intravenous HD MTX chemotherapy (3.5 g/m2) and radiotherapy to the right eye of 40Gy.

On dynamic imaging, the lesion in segment 8 showed the typical vascular pattern of an HCC (), but that in segment 5 showed an atypical vascular pattern and was closely related to the inferior vena cava (). Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was normal, but serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) level was slightly elevated (63 U/mL); extrahepatic spread was ruled out. The patient was assumed to have HCC on the basis of the presence of 2 focal hepatic lesions within a cirrhotic liver having viral hepatitis, particularly the smaller lesion in segment 8 that showed the typical vascular pattern of HCC on dynamic imaging. The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was below 14; however, because the patient met the Milan\u2019s criteria for selecting patients with an HCC for LT (), she was listed for LT and underwent uneventful deceased-donor LT after a 3-month waiting period. Histopathological examination of the explant confirmed that the lesion on segment 8 was an HCC (), but that on segment 5 was a cholangiocarcinoma (). Further histological evaluation of the lesion on segment 5 revealed that the tumor cells expressed cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK19, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and lacked AFP expression, liver-specific antigens, CK20, and CD34.

Physical examination revealed a firm, well-defined, tender, non-mobile mass in the right neck with dimension about 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 mm. The mass did not move up or down with swallowing. Laboratory data were within normal limits. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrated the right jugular vein filling defect at the level of the cricoid cartilage\u2013thyroid plane (). The grayscale ultrasound and color Doppler flow imaging showed the right internal jugular vein had a hypoechoic mass about 10 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 11 mm with a clear boundary, and the mass had a 3.9-millimeter-wide base located in the posterior wall of the internal jugular vein with a linear blood flow signal in this mass (). The pulse Doppler ultrasonography detected arterial spectrum in the mass with the peak systolic blood flow velocity: 24 cm/s, the end-diastolic blood flow velocity: 6.87 cm/s, and the resistance index: 0.71 ().

At the age of 18 months, her parents noticed sudden onset right ptosis. She suffered neither infectious disease nor cranial trauma preceding the appearance of ptosis.

Physical and neurological examination did not reveal abnormal signs, except for right ptosis. Eye examination was performed by an ophthalmologist. The right eyelid was droopy, and the right pupil was dilated and non-reactive to light. There was exotropia and hypotropia of the right eye position. The symptoms did not resolve with Tensilon. Although the results of blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations were unremarkable, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 9 \u00d7 4 mm tumor at the right CS (Fig. ). There was no evidence of a vascular lesion there with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). The etiology of her right oculomotor nerve palsy was considered to be a CS tumor. However, neurosurgical intervention (i.e., a biopsy or a resection of the tumor) was considered too difficult. The differential diagnoses included inflammatory disease (including Tolosa-Hunt syndrome) and lymphoma, and therefore, systemic corticosteroid pulse therapy was initiated on admission day 7, but the nerve palsy did not improve with appropriate medical treatment.

She had a history of hypertension and myocardial infarction with coronary artery stent insertion. She had been taking 100 mg aspirin per day since coronary artery stenting. Her initial vital signs yielded a blood pressure of 107/60 and heart rate of 81 beats per minute.\nInitial neurologic examination showed eyeball deviation to the right side, left-sided hemiplegia and visual extinction, and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 13. Brain computed tomography (CT) angiography showed occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). Intravenous rTPA infusion was started 3 hours after symptom onset and a subsequent percutaneous cerebral angiogram was performed via right femoral artery access. A 5-Fr Revive IC catheter was introduced into the right internal carotid artery and mechanical thrombectomy with a Solitaire retriever was attempted on the occluded right MCA, which was successfully recanalized (). Follow-up brain MRI showed acute cerebral infarction in the right MCA territory (). Because there was severe hypokinesia of the left ventricle on transthoracic echocardiography, we planned to use anticoagulation to prevent stroke recurrence.\nTwo days after the thrombolysis, the patient complained of vague right abdominal pain, and a laboratory test showed anemia. The patient's hemoglobin initially dropped to 9.5 g/dL from 13.1 g/dL. We did not observe oozing from the puncture site, abdominal or posterior pelvic wall hematoma or signs of gastrointestinal bleeding such as melena, hematochezia or hematemesis. We performed contrast-enhanced abdominal CT and found a right renal subcapsular hematoma with mild compression of the renal parenchyma ().

    "original_text": "A 2-year-old boy with TSC type 2 accompanied by neurologic (epilepsy), renal (angiomyolipomas), and cardiac (rhabdomyomas) manifestations was incidentally diagnosed with an infrarenal aortic aneurysm during a routine magnetic resonance imaging follow-up of his kidney lesions, which was followed by computed tomography angiography. The aneurysm presented with a 1.3-cm long and 0.6-cm wide infrarenal neck and a fusiform dilatation measuring a maximum diameter of 2.8 cm, ending proximal to the aortic bifurcation. The aneurysm did not contain any mural thrombus and was distinguished by an exceptionally thick vessel wall compared with the normal aorta (). Given this rare condition, the available literature was reviewed and aortic repair planned in a multidisciplinary setting with participation of vascular surgery, pediatric cardiothoracic surgery, pediatric surgery, and pediatric anesthesiology. A conventional open transperitoneal approach was chosen, the aneurysm and infrarenal neck exposed, clamps applied to the neck and both common iliac arteries, and the aneurysm opened.

The patient first noticed a mild reddish discoloration involving her upper lip around 5 years back, which progressively increased in size without any apparent discomfort. Gingival changes started at around the same time, the gingiva appearing fiery red in color and friable with an edematous consistency and granular surface texture. There was no associated pain; however, bleeding on brushing was noted. The patient's medical history was unremarkable except for a case of mild dust allergy. She also reported about the occasional appearance of an isolated red patch on her face on excessive exposure to sunlight.\nExcision of the gingival lesion of the upper arch was done 4 years back; however, it gradually reappeared after 1 year. Patient couldn\u2032t associate the recurrence of symptoms with the use of any specific food, drug, cosmetic items or dentifrice. She was previously treated for the lip lesion by the physician with a course of systemic and topical steroids for 1 month without any perceivable improvement of the condition, and hence the treatment was stopped as per medical advice.\nOn clinical examination, the patient was systemically healthy without any apparent skin lesions. Her lips were incompetent; and, irregular verrucoid plaque lesions were noted on the inner aspect of both lips. The upper lip appeared edematous and dry with exaggerated fissures []. Intra oral examination showed generalized enlargement of marginal and attached gingivae []. Abundant plaque deposits were also present.

The physical examination revealed weight loss (15 kg) and an abdominal mass of approximately 20 cm in size on the major axis, located in the epigastrium and left hypochondrium. The mass was not very mobile and was poorly limited. A blood test showed anaemia (8 g/dl). A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a voluminous mass of approximately 22 cm in size from the rear cavity of the epiploon with a predominant mix of aerobic and fluid components. The mass had a thickened and irregular wall and pushed back the stomach (Fig. ). This observation was suggestive of a gastric duplication with blocked communication. An oesophagogastroduodenoscopy did not reveal any lesion up to the 3rd duodenum apart from an aspect of extrinsic compression of the anterior side of the cardio-tuberosity junction. An exploratory laparotomy was decided upon, as the ultrasound endoscopy was not available. During this exploration, a large tumour of a suspicious nature was found at the expense of the posterior gastric wall extending from the spleen to the left hepatic lobe and left diaphragmatic cupola.

A histopathologic examination revealed a pT1bN0 clear cell RCC with a metastatic lesion in his ipsilateral adrenal gland. In 2004 he was subjected to right adrenalectomy for metachronous metastasis. In 2005 he underwent cerebral radiotherapy for brain metastases from the RCC. He achieved a complete response to radiotherapy, but developed a degenerative encephalopathy with cognitive impairment. After 2 years, in good clinical condition, he decided autonomously not to continue the follow-up. He underwent his last abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan in 2014, with a disease-free result.\nAt admission he showed the result of the fecal occult blood test he took at home, which was positive. Blood tests were performed, revealing the known anemia (hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL) and an increase in C-reactive protein (33.9 mg/L). His carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 19.9 were both not beyond the normal values (respectively, 3.6 ng/mL and <0.8 UI/mL). He was then transfused with two blood units because of his low hemoglobin level. An abdominal examination revealed a tender abdominal mass in his right iliac fossa. He did not complain of pain or nausea and he did not have vomiting. He was subjected to gastroscopy and colonoscopy because of the evidence of GI bleeding; the results were negative for GI lesions and active bleeding. An abdominal ultrasonography (US) was performed and it showed a distended bowel loop with thick wall and \u201ctarget-shaped\u201d feature in the transverse view with two lymph nodes and mesenteric vessels within.

He underwent right upper and middle bilobectomy and systematic lymph node dissection through a posterolateral thoracotomy. On the second postoperative day, 1750 mL of white turbid fluid was drained through the chest tube and the effusion was diagnosed as chylothorax. During the first 24 h following implementation of a fat-free dietary regimen, the color of the discharge became transparent, but another 630 mL of discharge was observed. Although the amount of discharge reduced gradually, it was persistent. Chemical pleurodesis was performed on the sixth postoperative day for which 5 KE of OK-432 (Picibanil; Chugai Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) and 300 mg of minocycline were administered into the thoracic cavity. The discharge began to progressively diminish. Three days thereafter, the amount of discharge had decreased to 150 mL/day, and on the ninth postoperative day, the chest tube was removed. On the 14th postoperative day, the patient complained of dyspnea and dysphagia, and an upper mediastinal mass was detected on chest radiogram (Fig. ). Chest computed tomography revealed a large mediastinal fluid collection 6 cm in diameter surrounded by a thick capsule that was compressing the trachea and esophagus (Fig. ). The mass was suspected to be a mediastinal chyloma. Since the patient\u2019s symptoms were gradually progressing, we performed surgery on the 15th postoperative day. Thirty minutes before the surgery, ice cream was given to the patient to help confirm the leakage point in the thoracic duct. Thoracoscopy revealed a small amount of chylous effusion in the thoracic cavity and an elastic mass in the upper mediastinum. When the thick capsule was incised, chyle began to spill out (Fig. ).

His accompanying injuries were a bilateral haemothorax, nasal bone fracture, and right distal tibia fracture. Under lidocain block, a closed reduction was performed by gentle longitudinal traction.
