The patient noticed sharp pop with accompanying severe pain in the right buttock and proximal posterior thigh when he attempted to kick a ball up hard. The clinical signs included swelling and ecchymosis on the proximal posterior thigh, tenderness to palpation at the ischium, and weakness with active-resisted knee flexion. A palpable defect was not obvious because the injured site was swollen considerably by the hematoma (). There was no X-ray evidence of a fracture of the ischium and magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRI) revealed a complete proximal hamstring rupture at the level of the ischial tuberosity (). The patient was operated on 6 days after the injury. The patient was placed in the prone position and a 15 cm vertical incision was made to the posterior proximal thigh starting at the gluteal crease and continuing distally. The avulsed hamstring tendons were exposed easily by dividing the posterior fascia and retracting the gluteus maximus superiorly. The posterior cutaneous femoral and sciatic nerves were exposed and spared. A single tendon comprised of all three tendons (). The lateral side of the ischial tuberosity was cleared off using a curette to induce healing of the torn tendon to the bone, and three FiberWire No. 2 suture anchors (Arthrex, Naples, FL, USA) were placed in the exposed ischium. To place sutures under sufficient tension, one limb of each suture was woven into the tendon using a crisscross stitch while the other limb was placed on a simple suture to pull the tendon ().

    "original_text": "A 57-year-old male patient underwent aortic valve replacement because of severe aortic regurgitation at a referring hospital at 38 years of age. In the subsequent 9 years, he underwent 4 reoperations because of recurrent endocarditis. After progressive decline of his left ventricular (LV) function, he was transferred to our center and listed for HTx.\nA donor heart became available of a young man in his mid-twenties, presumed previously healthy. He was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism after a long-distance flight, which led to an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity. Echocardiography showed a severely dilated right ventricle (RV) with poor function and LV cavitary obliteration. After resuscitation, he was hemodynamically stable and transported to the intensive care unit. Unfortunately, he was severely neurologically damaged, and brain death was diagnosed after 2 days. Based on serial echocardiography that showed a recovered RV, the heart was accepted for donation and a donor procedure was started.\nDonor heart procurement was uneventful. Because of the 5 previous sternotomies and a high likelihood of a complicated recipient cardiectomy, to limit cold ischemia time, the recipient operation was started as soon as the heart was accepted at the donor site.

The patient had no known exposure to chemicals, did not drink, and smoked one pack per day for about 30 years. He had gout disease and took analgesic medicine. Ultrasonography in our outpatient department revealed a large tumour with central necrosis, measuring about 11 cm in diameter, occupying the right lobe and left hydronephrosis. Gastroscopy revealed pathology of active gastric ulcers without Helicobacter pylori infection. In laboratory studies, the patient had a high serum \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) level of 4280 ng/ml (normal range, 0-13.4 ng/ml) and a positive hepatitis C antibody. We subsequently performed computed tomography (CT) of the liver, which revealed a large tumour with central necrosis, about 12 cm in diameter, located in segments 7 and 8 of the right lobe (), along with left hydronephrosis and a ureter stone.\nThe CT scan also revealed tumour thrombus in the posterior branches of the right portal vein ().\nAccording to Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer classification, we made the diagnosis of HCC with portal vein thrombosis []. However, the patient refused any invasive therapy and examination for HCC, such as a biopsy, surgery, radiofrequency ablation, or transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). The patient agreed only to treatment for left hydronephrosis and the ureter stone, and the regular, oral administration of silymarin medicine of 450 mg per day.\nThe patient was regularly followed-up in our outpatient department with ultrasonography and examination of serum \u03b1-fetoprotein levels. The tumour size gradually decreased, and the \u03b1-fetoprotein level slowly declined () until December 2006.

She was initially treated with palliative radiotherapy for lymphoma in the left iliac area. In 2007, there was clinical evidence of disease progression based on palpable lymph nodes in the right iliac and the left-sided supraclavicular areas. A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen also showed para-aortal lymphadenopathy. She underwent palliative radiotherapy on the right iliac lymphoma to treat its symptomatic mass effect. In September 2008, she was admitted for dyspnoea and a loss of appetite and a subsequent CT scan of the thorax, neck, and abdomen was performed. The CT scan revealed massive left hilar lymphadenopathy with compression of the surrounding bronchial and venous structures and mediastinal (subcarinal) and parasternal lymphadenopathy with a small left sided pleural effusion. A subsequent positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed multifocal disease activity in the pathological areas corresponding to the previous CT scan and low disease activity in the para-aortal region. Nonetheless, despite these extensive radiological investigations it was not possible to differentiate between progression of NHL or another disease pathology such as an underlying primary lung carcinoma.\nAccordingly, a bronchoscopy was performed that showed a slightly oedematous bronchial mucosa in the left lower lobe.

In her medical history, we noted arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and peripheral arterial insufficiency. She also underwent an incomplete closure of a type 2 atrial septum defect in 2001. On presentation, her blood pressure was 180/120 mmHg with a regular pulse at 70 beats per minute.

Right-sided knee-heel testing was positive for dysmetria. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain without contrast revealed an old posterior cerebellar infarction on the left side. Subsequent computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan of the brain showed diffuse atheromatosis and a total occlusion of the left subclavian artery but without stenosis or obstruction in the carotid artery or vertebral artery system. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain two days after the onset of symptoms showed a diffusion restriction in the right dorsolateral medulla oblongata compatible with recent ischemia (Figure 2 ).\nCardiological work-up with echocardiography and duplex of the carotid arteries showed a persistent atrial septum defect with right-left shunt, a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and a subclavian steal syndrome as a result of a complete occlusion of the left subclavian artery. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy on otolaryngologic examination showed right vocal cord paralysis as a cause of her dysarthria. Due to the persisting dysphagia, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was placed for parenteral nutrition.\nOne month after the onset of neurologic symptoms, she complained of a foreign body sensation and a diminished visual acuity in the right eye.

She had a history of prior two cesarean sections and no medical problems. Her vital signs on admission were stable and hemoglobin was 11.6 mg/dL.\nShe was recommended a dilatation and curettage (D and C) procedure due to retained placenta. The patient was noted to have persistent, active bleeding which was unresponsive to uterine bimanual massage, oxytocin infusion, hemabate, and methergine. At that time, patient was also hypotensive and a decision was made to perform an exploratory laparotomy with possible hysterectomy. During laparotomy, placenta was found to be densely adherent to the lower uterine segment and posterior wall of the bladder. We amputated the uterus just above the lower uterine segment, due to great difficulty in separating bladder from the lower uterine segment and packed the cervix and lower uterine segment with Surgicel.

Eight months before he was admitted to our clinic, a subcutaneous tissue mass was excised with a marginal excision from his right thigh; it was liposarcoma. He then received chemotherapy and radiotherapy with a good response but the liposarcoma had since progressed. He was admitted to our hospital, presenting with back pain with radiation and with no neurological deficits. He had a 3-month history of increased back pain, and he did not recall any trauma. A skeletal survey showed no lytic lesions, and a CT scan also showed no evidence of tumors in his spine. A spinal MRI revealed multilevel vertebral body edema (a low signal was seen within the body of his lumbar and thoracic vertebrae, on T1 corresponding to high signal on T2, in keeping with an interosseous metastasis; Fig. ). A CT scan of his chest showed lung metastasis. There was no cord compression. After he and his family gave us written informed consent, Rf-TA and VAP were performed.\nUnder spinal anesthesia in a prone position, this procedure was also performed with bi-plane fluoroscopy through a transpedicular approach by placement of working cannulas unilaterally.

Further investigation had been planned. Abdominal CT on admission to our hospital demonstrated a low-density mass and a pseudoaneurysm in close contact with the wall of the pseudocyst of the pancreatic tail, compressing the stomach (Fig. ).

The patient reported chronic severe pain in the left knee area aggravating in the morning. It is exacerbated when she is active. At the time of admission, she walked with a limp due to refractory pain rated 6/10 on visual analog scale (VAS). Physical examination revealed crackling and creaking sound during knee flexion and extension movement. The knee had lost its strength and range of motion. It resisted knee flexion. Her height, weight, and body mass index were 167 cm, 64 kg, and 22.93 kg/m2, respectively. She had the past medical history of breast cancer, thyroid cancer, and spinal stenosis. She had received IAI of HA 6 times in 3 months and NSAIDs for intractable pain of the medial knee. However, there was no improvement.\nKnee x-ray revealed the loss of joint space, subchondral sclerosis, and bone spurs developing along edges of the knee joint (Fig. ).\nWe presented therapeutic effects of PN to her. Verbal and written informed consent was obtained from the patient before the procedure. The patient was brought to the ultrasound room and placed on the table in a supine position with bent left knee.

At that time a diagnostic excisional biopsy of the lesion was performed and the histological report confirmed: \u201cIII Clark level, Breslow thickness 0.55 mm malignant melanoma with the prevalence of superficial diffusion and without regression or vascular infiltration\u201d. Consequently a wide skin removal was performed, because a melanoma was found on the skin near to the previous excision. However the patient did not have sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure or any follow-up control because he did not accept them.\nAt the beginning of 2013 the patient had several episodes of melena and, with the aim to discover the source of bleeding, we performed a colonoscopy with biopsy (the histological diagnosis was hyperplasic adenomatosus polyp) and a gastroscopy which solely showed an antral gastritis and an inflammatory stomach polyp. Moreover the patient underwent abdominal US and MRI and a total body CT scan that showed right axillary lymphadenopaty, a nodular lesion in the medial lobe of the right lung and a big mass (7 cm of diameter) in the IV\u2013VIII segment of the liver of which an US-guided biopsy was carried out.

Surgical history included a mechanical aortic valve replacement 6 months ago. The patient was taking a vitamin K antagonist. He reported no history of trauma for several months prior to admission. There was no familial tendency toward bleeding. On admission, his heart rate was 110 beats per minute with sinus rhythm and blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg.\nEcchymotic lesion was noted on his left flank and he experienced tenderness of the left flank and left lower quadrant of the abdomen. There was no rebound tenderness though the patient expressed that the pain worsened when bending over. The results of laboratory test revealed decreased hematocrit level at 23.8 % and prolonged international normalized ratio of prothrombin time at 5.25. The platelet count was within normal range.\nAbdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed to evaluate the abdominal and left flank pain and revealed a large hematoma of the left iliopsoas muscle and extravasation of contrast material. Hemoperitoneum was also revealed though the amount was minimal (Fig. ). The patient continued to have abdominal pain and follow-up hematocrit level dropped to 21.5 %. Fresh frozen plasma was infused and an emergent lumbar arterial angiogram was performed for hemostasis. There was active bleeding on the left 5th lumbar arterial branch. Transarterial embolization (TAE) was successfully performed (Fig. ).\nOn day 5 of hospitalization, follow-up abdominal CT was performed. It revealed decrease in the size of the hematoma in the left iliopsoas muscle. However, a new small hematoma was detected in the right iliopsoas muscle (Fig. ).

A radical nephrectomy was performed in July 2012. A pathological report indicated a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) of 16 cm with a clear cell component and some degree of a more aggressive cellular component, giving a Fuhrman grade of 4, pT3a pN0 M1 according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) classification. Sunitinib, 50 mg/day, then reduced to 37.5 mg due to side effects, was administered during 6 months. Because of the painful progression of the pleural metastasis in the upper part of his left lung, radiation therapy was delivered to this tumor. Systemic treatment was further modified for the approved second-line treatment everolimus. This latter treatment induced a significant tumor response in most metastatic sites for 15 months before re-progression. In March 2014, our patient complained of persistent headaches and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified a single right frontal metastasis. Stereotactic radiotherapy was performed and a treatment with axitinib, a second-line TKI directed against VEGFrs, was started. Axitinib induced significant tumor shrinkage in the pleural and lung metastases; the brain metastasis was much improved because a brain MRI was considered almost normal.

A thoraco-abdominal computed-tomography (CT) scan showed a retroperitoneal hematoma surrounding the sub-hepatic inferior vena cava with no intraperitoneal fluid or other abnormalities (Figure ).

The hematoma was unchanged compared to the first scan whereas free peritoneal air was demonstrated (Figure ). At laparotomy, diffuse peritonitis secondary to perforation of the transverse colon was found. Perforation was repaired with direct suture and a sample of peritoneal fluid was collected for cultures. Retroperitoneum was left untouched. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. The patient received 5 days of intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics (imipenem) and was discharged in 8 days.\nTen days later he was readmitted for fever and worsening lumbar pain radiating to the limbs bilaterally with minimal walking impairment. Blood exams revealed increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and leukocyte count. Abdominal CT scan showed no signs of intra or retroperitoneal abscess; the retroperitoneal hematoma appeared decreased in size. No evidence of chest or urinary tract infections was demonstrated.

Resorption of alveolar bone and root deviation of the right lateral incisor was evident in dental X-ray () and in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging ( and ). In clinical examination, the tooth was vital and mobile class 3 according to Miller Classification. Incisional biopsy of the lesion was done () and revealed a plexiform ameloblastoma ( and ). Microscopically, a solid epithelial tumor was observed composed of interdigitating islands of odontogenic epithelium, with stellate reticulum-like areas, polarization of the basal nuclei and a dense matrix. The tumor cells were bland, lacking any sign of atypia. The final diagnosis was plexiform ameloblastoma.\nHaving a finite diagnosis and under general anesthesia, the mass was resected with 1 cm free margins, resulting in marginal mandibulectomy (, and ). Following the resection, the patient received an Essix splint and gauze packing in order to allow secondary healing (). Post-operative recovery was fair, with normal inferior alveolar nerve function and no evidence of recurrence during two years follow-up.

The peripheral cell layer of the tumor masses showed a palisade arrangement of the nuclei (Fig. ). No skin tumor recurrence has been noted to date.\nTwo years later, the patient developed headache, left side weakness with unsteady gait at the age of 44. His brain MRI revealed a huge cystic lesion with fluid-fluid level in the patient's right frontal lobe. There were hemorrhage, perifocal edema, mass effect causing mild midline shift.

An extraoral examination upon initial presentation revealed unremarkable findings and no complaints of paresthesia.
