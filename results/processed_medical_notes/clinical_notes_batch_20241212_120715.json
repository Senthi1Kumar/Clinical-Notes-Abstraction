    "original_text": "A 58-year-old man with a bleeding left eye was brought by paramedics, redirected from Accident & Emergency to Eye Casualty in summer 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLimited history was provided by the patient or known by the paramedic team. The patient was shirtless at presentation and complained of pain. He did not disclose much, except prior assault two years ago which had left the eye with poor sight. He was actively bleeding, and the ocular contents were visibly auto-eviscerating. A collateral history was sought, further examination attempted, and steps were initiated to get the patient prepared for emergency operating theatre.\nThe collateral history corroborated his report of previous assault, with a history of blunt trauma to the left eye, two years prior, resulting in lens dislocation, anatomical dysregulation, vitreous prolapse and subsequent traumatic uveitis which had left him with perception of light only. Fortunately, the right eye had excellent baseline visual acuity achieving 6/6. Follow-up appointments were not attended, and the patient was lost in the system. It was noted that the patient had a history of paranoid schizophrenia and substance misuse involving methadone. He was currently living in sheltered accommodation and we were advised that he had good engagement at this time with his support services.\nOn examination, there was an extrusion of actively bleeding ocular contents through a 3 mm central circular corneal perforation (Figure 1 ) of the left eye.

Presenting symptom was episodes of blood in his stool. Upon rectal examination and rigid proctosigmoidoscopy, he was found to have a tumor at 6 cm from the anal verge. An endoscopic rectal ultrasound was done showing the presence of a rectal tumor extending to the perirectal fat (uT3), it was later on confirmed by a pelvic magnetic resonance imaging, which also revealed the presence of a suspicious 9 mm lymph node in the mesorectum. A positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography scan showed the presence of a single hepatic metastasis in the left lobe of the liver (segments 2/3) measuring 4 \u00d7 3 cm . Laboratory tests indicated an elevated Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 27.4 \u03bcg/L, whereas the rest of the blood test results were within normal limits. He received six cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX + bevacizumab), followed by a short course of pelvic radiation (25 Gy in 5 daily fractions). Afterward he underwent a one-stage laparoscopic liver and rectal cancer resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX + bevacizumab). Pathology of the resected specimens showed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma for both the rectum and the liver with negative margins. However, one of 14 mesorectal lymph nodes was positive. The estimated blood loss was 400 mL and the operative time was 370 min. Postoperatively the patient required parenteral analgesia for 48 h, and resumed a normal diet on postoperative day 3 and was discharged on postoperative day 7. At 1-year follow up, the patient had no evidence of recurrence .\nThe patient was placed in supine position with legs apart.

Laboratory examination showed no elevation of either carcinoembryonic antigen or cancer antigen 19-9. Colonoscopy showed a 20-mm SMT in the anal canal (Fig. ). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a 20-mm cystic tumor on the right site of the lower rectum with no evidence of lymph node or distant metastases (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also showed a 20-mm cystic tumor on the right site of the lower rectum (Fig. ). These findings strongly suggested a benign cyst in the anal canal; therefore, the patient underwent trans-sacral resection for precise diagnosis of the tumor. The pathological diagnosis of the resected tumor was a mucinous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia (Fig. ) with negative surgical margins. The patient was observed in ambulatory practice. Follow-up CT and MRI 14 months after surgery showed a new cystic lesion near the site of the removed tumor (Fig. ). To evaluate whether the new cystic tumor was a recurrence, the patient underwent trans-sacral resection of the cystic tumor again. Pathological examination of the second resected tumor revealed that the tumor was a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the lower rectum (Fig. ) with a possible remnant tumor at the local site. After providing sufficient informed consent, the patient underwent anal sphincter-preserving intersphincteric resection (ISR) with partial resection of the external sphincter along with prophylactic lymph node dissection. Pathological examination showed that the tumor cells were located at the anal gland under the mucosa of the anal canal and that these cells produced mucin and fibrosis (Fig. ).

Her history of poorly controlled T2DM was exacerbated by challenges in continuity of healthcare due to her rural location and further compounded by socioeconomic factors, including poverty and access to appropriate nutritional support. The patient first noticed the lump on her arm 4 years before attending her family physician with this complaint (). The lump was situated at the site of where she injected herself with insulin. The patient described the lump as soft, non-painful and had been gradually increasing in size. At that point, a clinical diagnosis of lipoma was made by the primary care physician without biopsy or histological confirmation to exclude malignancy or infection. Due to a combination of lack of resources in the rural setting and limited patient health literacy, no further action was taken at that time. Subsequently, the mass increased in size and rapidly enlarged becoming firm and painful. Imaging was ultimately obtained, with an ultrasound and MRI revealing a mass suspicious for neoplasia. The patient attributes this delay from presentation to diagnostic imaging to limited access to quality healthcare resources in her rural community due to financial constraints, physical accessibility and miscommunication between members of her healthcare team.\nThe mass grew to approximately 12\u00d715 cm, causing purple discolouration and skin breakdown (). The patient\u2019s pain had become more pronounced, radiating up her neck, with additional numbness and tingling in the tips of her four fingers and thumb. Open biopsy followed, confirming a high-grade pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma. The mass was Murine Double Minute 2 (MDM2) negative, which indicated it was not a dedifferentiated liposarcoma.

At 5 days of age, the child was diagnosed to have pulmonary atresia with a large ventricular septal defect by transthoracic echocardiography. An emergency right Modified Blalock\u2013Taussig shunt was performed between the innominate artery and the right pulmonary artery through a median sternotomy as the baby had low arterial oxygen saturations persistently despite prostaglandin E1 infusion. A median sternotomy was preferred as against a thoracotomy as it would avoid any lung retraction that might contribute further toward arterial oxygen desaturation. The pulmonary arteries are usually larger in their central part, and the surgeon would have the option of performing the shunt on cardiopulmonary bypass in case the baby became further unstable. Finally, a median sternotomy approach would give the surgeon an opportunity to ligate the ductus arteriosus after performing the shunt. For the Modified Blalock\u2013Taussig shunt through the median sternotomy, the right innominate artery was opted instead of the subclavian artery as it is the most accessible artery among the arch vessels, and it is usually considered safe to clamp the innominate artery for short periods of time since the left carotid is left to perfuse the brain. During the subsequent definitive operation, taking down an innominate to pulmonary artery shunt would be easier compared to a subclavian to pulmonary artery shunt.\nThe baby developed a wheeze when she was 7 months old and was initiated at a peripheral health center on ipratropium bromide nebulization (250 \u03bcg QID), salbutamol by an inhaler (400 \u03bcg/3 hourly), and dexamethasone tablet (4 mg OD) with poor response.

An ultrasound examination of the abdomen revealed a single gallstone in the gallbladder which was 0.6 cm in diameter, no hepatic abnormalities, and a normal common bile duct of 0.4 cm in diameter. Physical examination and preoperative blood tests were within normal limits.\nA LC was performed under general anesthesia. The procedure was difficult due to adhesions between the cystic duct, the omentum, and the duodenum, while the gallbladder itself was sclerotic and hard to manipulate. Once the junction between the cystic and the common bile duct was identified laparoscopically, we decided not to perform an intraoperative cholangiogram and continue the LC without any incidents.

He gradually developed resistance to these drugs, with persistent synovitis, progressing joint deformities, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). An acute exacerbation of the illness occurred six years later, during which he was switched to a methotrexate regimen thrice weekly, with partial response. He developed severe anemia and related angina with methotrexate and had to discontinue methotrexate after three years. Since the episode of angina, the patient was started on a daily regimen of low-dose aspirin at 75 mg and simvastatin at 40 mg. He continued to take various non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) without much effect until three years back, when he presented to his clinician with an episode of severe depressive illness. He was referred to a psychiatrist, who started him on escitalopram, a serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitor, at 10 mg/day, and risperidone, an antipsychotic with a serotonin dopamine antagonist action at 1 mg/day.

    "original_text": "A 72-year-old man with chronic alcohol abuse and hypertension, and who had been a smoker, had had past surgical interventions for atherosclerotic vascular disease (bilateral iliofemoral bypass and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair). In April 2001, the patient presented with severe chest pain due to a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. At that time, there was no lung abnormality revealed by a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest. A thoracotomy was performed and a Dacron prosthesis was inserted surgically into the wall of the aneurysm and he had an uncomplicated postoperative course.\nSix months later, the patient was hospitalized because of weight loss, night sweats, a dry cough and progressive dyspnea for the past 4 weeks. Chest radiography and CT showed bilateral interstitial lung infiltrates with miliary appearance. No cavitation was documented. A diagnostic bronchoscopy was performed. A Ziehl-Neelsen examination of the lower respiratory tract samples was positive for acid-fast bacilli. PCR and culture of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed the presence of M. tuberculosis. Hematogenous dissemination of M. tuberculosis was confirmed by a concomitant positive urine culture. Treatment with rifampicin and isoniazid for 6 months, plus pyrazinamide and ethambutol during the first 2 months was given as directly observed therapy, since the strain isolated in culture was susceptible to all major antimycobacterial drugs.\nThree weeks later, the patient presented with massive hemoptysis and severe bronchoaspiration requiring intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

He was discharged only a week before from the same hospital when he was admitted with acute abdominal pain when he underwent a CT-angiogram and a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the abdomen, which showed incidental finding of Arc of Buhler (). There was discussion regarding management of this incidental finding and decision was taken not to embolize it by intervention radiology as it was incidental finding and pain was not attributed to that. He was subsequently discharged after observation in the hospital for a couple of days when his labs remained steady. During this admission the patient was alert and oriented in time and place. Abdomen was soft to palpation and tender on deep palpation without peritoneal signs on clinical exam. The abdominal radiography showed partial small bowel obstruction. The CT-scan of the abdomen showed big retroperitoneal hematoma and free fluid around the liver (). Review of systems was grossly nonspecific on arrival to the ED except sharp abdominal pain. His past medical history was essentially negative for any chronic diseases; his surgical history consisted of inguinal hernia repair. After 40-min the patient had sudden cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation as per ACLS protocol was initiated. The patient was emergently intubated. A right subclavian central line was placed. Volume resuscitation was initiated, patient was started on pharmacologic presser agents and massive transfusion protocol was set up. We were working on provisional diagnosis of ruptured Arc of Buhler. Seven units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 2 units of platelets were transfused.

Her family history except the brother was negative for bleeding tendencies, purpura, and hemophilia. She did not smoke or drink alcohol. She had no allergies. A total colonoscopy showed an ascending colon tumor with severe stenosis (Fig. ). Computed tomography revealed the wall thickness of the ascending colon (Fig. ). There were no distant metastases on the liver or lungs. Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT 93.9 s) was found incidentally during a routine preoperative examination. However, the prothrombin time (11.2 s), platelet count (480 \u00d7 103/L), and liver function test results were all within normal limits. We conducted a cross mixing test, and she was diagnosed with a deficiency pattern (Fig. ). The activities of factors VIII, IX, XII, and von Willebrand factor were normal. The plasma activity of FXI was 3%, and the diagnosis of FXI deficiency was confirmed. It took about 2 weeks from confirmation of an abnormal APTT time to diagnosis of FXI deficiency. A total of eight units of FFP were transfused for 2 days before the operation. After the transfusion, APTT improved to 37 s, and FXI also increased from 3% to 25% as a result (Fig. ).\nIt takes about 3 days to obtain the result of FXI plasma activity in our hospital.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed diffuse interstitial thickening and ground glass opacities with a basilar predominance within the lungs but no honeycombing was seen (). A pulmonary function test was performed and showed reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO < 40%). She was admitted to the hospital and placed on steroids as well as oxygen. During her hospital course she was found to have just progressive thrombocytopenia from 45,000/\u03bcL to12,000/\u03bcL without any other complete blood count abnormalities. Examination of the peripheral blood did not show any circulating atypical lymphocytes and a normal white blood cell differential. Also of note, the patient had abnormal liver function tests. A CT scan of the abdomen showed splenomegaly (18 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 10 cm) without adenopathy.\nA bone marrow biopsy was performed because of the thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly which was reported as negative for a hematolymphoid neoplasm. Hemophagocytosis was not seen. She developed generalized edema and continued to decline. Eventually she became unresponsive and was pronounced dead. At autopsy she was found to have hepatosplenomegaly, massive hemoperitoneum (approximately 4 liters), and diffuse generalized soft tissue edema with bilateral chemosis.\nOn microscopic review of the tissue sections from the organs there was a diffuse infiltrate of large atypical cells with irregular nuclear contours, vesicular chromatin, and occasional prominent nucleoli. These cells were exclusively seen within the lumen of blood vessels of nearly all the organs sampled, including the liver, spleen, kidney, lungs (Figures and ), heart (), aortic wall, and brain.

    "original_text": "A 10-year-old male patient was referred to orthodontic traction of an impacted right lower first molar (tooth 46). During clinical examination, no alteration was noted except the absence of tooth 46. No abnormalities were detected in previous medical history. A cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) showed the presence of a radiolucent image measuring <1 cm located between teeth 46 and 48, which was initially interpreted as a dental germ (). The patient was submitted to surgery under local anesthesia to achieve tooth crown exposure and bonding of an orthodontic device to traction of its right lower first molar. Six months after the procedure, in a routine panoramic radiograph during orthodontic treatment, a well-defined radiolucent image with radiopaque foci was identified in the region of the suggestive dental germ. Additionally, an increasing volume with cortical expansion and fenestration was observed in a CBCT investigation ().\nThereby, a provisional diagnostic hypothesis of odontogenic lesions was made, suggesting adenomatoid odontogenic tumor and COC. The chosen clinical conduct was the surgical enucleation of the lesion. A straight incision was made in the alveolar ridge with flap detachment to facilitate access to the lesion, and an aspiration puncture was performed revealing a liquid content (). During surgery, the lesion was completely detached from the mandibular bone, allowing visualization of a capsule with a cystic aspect (). The specimen was sent for histopathologic examination, and the microscopic findings revealed a cystic cavity lined by a thin odontogenic epithelium with ameloblastomatous features. Ghost cells and calcification foci were also observed. Furthermore, the formation of dentinoid matrix, immature enamel, and fibrous connective tissue was noticed. Therefore, the diagnosis of COC associated with odontoma was established (Figures and 3(b)).

He was diagnosed as hydrocephalus for which VP shunt was inserted. There was no sign of raised intracranial pressure and no history of any other systemic illness. On examination, he was conscious cooperative with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 15. Cranial nerves were normal except optic nerve. Visual acuity was decreased in both eyes. Brain imaging revealed bilateral calcified SDH more on the left side []. Investigations such as electrocardiogram (ECG), biochemical parameters, and hemogram were normal. Patient was posted for craniotomy and removal of hematoma. On the day of surgery patient was taken inside operation theatre and all standard monitors, including ECG, noninvasive blood pressure cuff, and pulse oximetry were attached. Induction was done with 150 mcg of fentanyl and 225 mg of thiopentone. Rocuronium 50 mg intravenously was given to facilitate tracheal intubation. Right dorsalis pedis artery and right internal juglar was cannulated for invasive monitoring. Two large bore (16 gauge) peripheral cannulas were inserted. Bilateral fronto-parietotemporal craniotomy was done to remove the calcified mass. There was grayish white solid hard mass on both sides in subdural space consisting of calcification specs. The bony flap was adhered to the underlying mass. Profuse bleeding occurred at the time of raising the flap on left side. Surgery was lasted about 10 h.

He was knocked down to the ground and dazed, without loss of consciousness. He was immediately sent to the emergency department with a presentation of left chest pain and dyspnea. His vital signs were stable on arrival. An emergency left tube thoracostomy was performed, because his left-sided breath sounds had decreased, with a suspicion of pneumothorax. Ecchymosis and tenderness were detected on the left lower chest, without peritoneal signs. The patient was admitted for further observation and was allowed to intake thereafter. Esophageal rupture was not diagnosed until 84 hours after the injury when the tomato juice the patient had ingested was found in the chest bottle. Upon urgent left thoracotomy, a 4.5 cm laceration was found in the lower third of the esophagus, with severe inflammatory changes in the surrounding tissue. The pleural surface of the adjacent thoracic aorta was also torn. The esophagus was repaired with single-layer interrupted sutures of 3-0 Maxon (Davis & Geck, Wayne, NJ). Bile-containing fluid was predominantly expelled from the chest tube 48 hours after the primary repair. The patient underwent a subsequent transhiatal esophagectomy and reconstruction of the esophagus with ileocolon via the retrosternal route. With aggressive antibiotic treatment and total parenteral nutrition, his general condition was stabilized. He tolerated a full diet seven days postoperatively and was discharged 28 days after the injury. The patient was doing well during the follow-up period of more than five years.\nFive cases including the present case of esophageal perforation caused by external air-blast injury were reviewed (Table ).

One year prior, he had been diagnosed with HCC associated with chronic hepatitis B. He could not undergo surgical resection because of invasion of the hepatic and main portal veins. Therefore, he underwent TACE as a palliative treatment. Although he underwent five sessions of TACE over 10 months, newly viable HCC was found in the left lobe of the liver with thromboses of the portal vein, hepatic vein, and inferior vena cava. Palliative RT was administered to the HCC in the left lobe of the liver and area of left portal vein thrombosis using a dose of 33 Gy comprising daily doses of 3 Gy. He then underwent two additional TACE sessions. One month after the seventh TACE session, the patient presented to our institution with a complaint of persistent abdominal pain. He also had intermittent fever, chills, and weight loss. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a gas-containing cavity suggestive of an abscess within a necrotic mass in the left lateral segment of the liver (). He was hospitalized, received intravenous empirical antibiotics, and underwent ultrasound-guided abscess aspiration, which produced 0.5 mL of turbid yellowish fluid with a foul odor. Percutaneous drainage catheter insertion was difficult because of the small size of the abscess pocket.

    "original_text": "A 40-year-old male patient was referred to a private clinic for endodontic treatment of teeth with a periapical lesion in his premolar region of mandible that was discovered during routine radiographic examination. Panoramic radiography revealed a unilocular periapical radiolucency below the apex of the mandibular left canine extending to the second premolar (Figure ). On the periapical radiograph, the lesion mimicked a radicular cyst; however, the teeth were asymptomatic and the periodontal ligament space and lamina dura were intact. The teeth also gave a positive response to the sensibility tests. The patient had no history of trauma to the jaw. Clinical examination revealed no facial asymmetry and no lymphadenopathy. The most likely diagnosis was a nonodontogenic cyst.\nIt was decided to examine the lesion by CBCT to evaluate the relationship of the lesion with its surrounding structures and reach a definite diagnosis. CBCT images were taken by NewTom CBCT system (NewTom VG) with the exposure settings of 110 kVp, 59.62 mA, 4.3 seconds exposure time, 5 \u00d7 5 cm field of view, and 14-bits gray scale. The CBCT scans revealed a well-defined lingual defect in the canine to second premolar region with no connection to the base of the mandible and a cyst-like appearance. Evaluation of axial, coronal, and sagittal sections confirmed a lingual wall defect; the buccal wall was intact and there was no expansion. The mental foramen was clearly demarcated from the radiolucency by cortical bone and was not part of the lesion.

    "cleaned_text": "a 40-year-old male patient was referred to a private clinic for endodontic treatment of teeth with a periapical lesion in his premolar region of mandible that was discovered during routine radiographic examination. panoramic radiography revealed a unilocular periapical radiolucency below the apex of the mandibular left canine extending to the second premolar (figure ). on the periapical radiograph, the lesion mimicked a radicular cyst; however, the teeth were asymptomatic and the periodontal ligament space and lamina dura were intact. the teeth also gave a positive response to the sensibility tests. the patient had no history of trauma to the jaw. clinical examination revealed no facial asymmetry and no lymphadenopathy. the most likely diagnosis was a nonodontogenic cyst.\nit was decided to examine the lesion by cbct to evaluate the relationship of the lesion with its surrounding structures and reach a definite diagnosis. cbct images were taken by newtom cbct system (newtom vg) with the exposure settings of 110 kvp, 59.62 ma, 4.3 seconds exposure time, 5 \u00d7 5 cm field of view, and 14-bits gray scale. the cbct scans revealed a well-defined lingual defect in the canine to second premolar region with no connection to the base of the mandible and a cyst-like appearance. evaluation of axial, coronal, and sagittal sections confirmed a lingual wall defect; the buccal wall was intact and there was no expansion. the mental foramen was clearly demarcated from the radiolucency by cortical bone and was not part of the lesion. the root apices of the first and second premolars directly contacted the lesion with no sign of resorption (figure ).\nfor more evaluation of the internal contents of the defect, we used the software's ability to determine the gray scale value. the gray scale value of the main contents of the defect in the middle section was approximately in the range of \u221278 to 202 with a mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) of 108 (\u00b131). the",

Her postoperative course was complicated by continued abdominal pain and fever, as well as an episode of rectal prolapse. Of note, she also endorsed an episode of rectal prolapse months prior to presentation which was manually reduced at home. On hospital day 6, due to continued fevers, abdominal and pelvic MRI was obtained.

The etiology was believed to be an infected urinoma caused by instrumentation during stent placement and she was treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole. The patient's fevers and pain continued, prompting an abdominal and pelvic CT on hospital day 10.

She also suffered from abdominal bloating and pain, with intermittent colic-attacks and nausea. Apart from analgesics, she was taking no other medication. The symptoms started at the age of 46 years in the form of swallowing disturbances. She was examined with X-ray of the esophagus because of these disturbances. This examination showed quite normal findings. Three years later the procedure was repeated since the symptoms grew worse. This showed a slightly reduced motility of the most distal part of the esophagus. Five years later this was repeated and also included X-ray of the hypopharynx and ventricle. This examination showed normal oral and pharyngeal function. However, the esophagus had a normal transport function, but a tendency to disrupted primary peristalsis. The ventricular emptying was within normal range. Altogether, there were signs of a slightly disturbed esophageal function after some years of symptoms. Examinations with EGD and colon X-ray were normal. She got a retirement at the age of 50 years because of headache, muscle pain and tiredness. Primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome was suspected because of a feeling of dryness in mouth in combination with swallowing disturbances, but serological markers of this disease were negative. Besides analgesics, she had not taken any special drugs. In addition, around the age of 50 years she was suffering from hard stool, with several days in between stool emptying. After the initial stool passage she got diarrhea. She also suffered from a lot of gases and abdominal pain, with intermittent colic-attacks of pain. Metoclopramide had some effect on the swallowing disturbances, but the patient felt best when avoiding food intake.

Upon investigation, the patient was found to have a history of right sided hip joint TB at the age of 14. The patient had increasing pain on his right lower extremity with restriction of movements especially abduction and external rotation. After seeking medical consultation, a battery of tests were conducted that led to the diagnosis. The Tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) test was conducted in the clinic which was positive as was demonstrated by the size of the induration formed at the site of infiltration. The patient had received anti- TB chemotherapy with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol along with prophylactic antibiotics to prevent the secondary infections. The patient was not clear about the exact duration of the therapy. A progressive restriction on the right hip joint had ensued after a short time post therapy. But further intervention however was not sought since there was a certain degree of alleviation in patient\u2019s condition. After a few years the movement restrictions had grown even more severe accompanied by pain while maneuvering the joint. On presentation, the patient had 0 degree abduction, internal and external rotation. Recent radiological findings showed right hip joint fusion along with deterioration of the articular surfaces [Figure ].

The patient complained of severe, painful limitation of motion on straightening or bending of the elbows, and her left hand was heavily bruised and swollen. Physical examination using palpation revealed burning and local tenderness. X-ray revealed a displaced fracture of the left olecranon with soft tissue swelling. The fracture was defined as a type IIA olecranon fracture according to the Mayo classification system.[ The orthopedic specialist suggested surgical open reduction with internal fixation, but the patient hesitated under the consideration of increased surgical risk due to her history of hypertension and arrhythmia. Therefore, the orthopedic surgeon fixed her left elbow with protective clothing only. Later that day, she visited our outpatient clinic to seek help from TCM.\nIn the first visit, we used the TCM methods for manipulative reduction of the fracture after physical examination. The physician held the patient's left palm in one hand and held the left elbow of the patient in the other hand. Next, the doctor pushed the proximal end of the patient's elbow with his finger to move closer to the distal end, and at the same time, straightened the patient's elbow slowly. Finally, the patient slowly buckled the elbow to 60\u00b0. It was then braced securely. We also asked the patient to avoid flexion and extension activities of the elbow and to fix the elbow with protective clothing for about 1 month, until her fracture had healed. That duration depended on X-ray interpretation to ensure complete union of the fracture. The protective clothing, similar to a triangular scarf, was for fixation and immobilization of the displaced olecranon fracture. The patient removed the protective clothing after about 1 month and then started rehabilitation. At the same time, we prescribed Chinese herbs, namely Jenq Guu",

    "original_text": "A fifteen-year-old boy reported to the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology with a chief complaint of crowding of his upper and lower front teeth. Examination of the face revealed midface retrusion and surgically repaired bilateral upper cleft lip during his childhood with presence of small, bilateral, and paramedian lower lip pits (). History revealed that he was the first born child to his parents. Antenatal history of the mother was negative for any significant illnesses and drug intake during pregnancy. Family history revealed positive consanguineous marriage of his parents and none of the family members had cleft lip/palate. Detailed examination of the lip revealed bilateral lip pits with one pit present at the base of nipple-like elevation (). These lip pits were 3 mm in diameter and 5 mm deep. When the lower lip was compressed, mucous secretion was expressed from one of the lip pits. Intraoral examination revealed collapsed V-shaped palate with severe upper anterior teeth crowding (Figures and ). There was obliteration of the upper labial vestibule due to the adhesion of the lip to the gingiva by a thick fibrous band which blanched on retraction of the upper lip. Patient presented with a short uvula (). However, mandibular teeth were all present and well aligned along with presence of short lingual frenum causing ankyloglossia (). Posterior crossbite was noted which was attributed to the presence of narrow and collapsed arch. General medical examination was performed to rule out presence of systemic problems. Radiographic investigations like chest radiograph, lateral cephalograph, orthopantomograph, and maxillary occlusal view were taken. Genetic studies were not performed as the patient's parents did not give consent for the same.\nThe treatment planned for the patient was orthodontic treatment involving the correction of crowding of teeth and collapsed palatal arch along with cosmetic correction of the lip pits. Patient was also referred to an ENT surgeon for opinion regarding correction of tongue-tie and assessment",

    "original_text": "This 80-year-old male had a past medical history of colon resection with chemotherapy in 2000 and a stroke in 2005. In 2006, he had L3, L4 and L5 lumbar decompression and instrumentation for lumbar stenosis. He did well until 2009 when he developed low back and bilateral leg pain, more on the right. He had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showing adjacent segment disease at L2-L3 with stenosis. He underwent a second lumbar surgery with an extension of the previous L3-L5 instrumentation to L2 with supplemental lateral mass bone fusion. He continued to complain of severe to moderate pain on a continual basis after which he elected to have an epidural neuromodulator placed in 2010. He developed an infection at the battery site and it was removed in 2011. From 2011 to 2018 he has multiple lumbar steroid injections for pain control and was taking opioids daily with only temporary relief. He then underwent a second implantation of a neuromodulator and his leg pain resolved, but shortly after that, he began complaining of upper low back and lower thoracic pain that was constant and different from his previous lumbar fusion pain. The area of pain was localized under fluoroscopy and found to be centered at the T12 and L1 spinal segment above the previous fusion and instrumentation at L2. When computerized tomography (CT) scans from early 2017 were compared to 2018 there were worsening vacuum changes within the T12 fracture as well as in the disc space at T12-L1. When reviewed with neuroradiology, it was felt that the vertical fracture line involving the anterior inferior one-third of T12 extended into the inferior endplate of T12, and connected to the T12-L1 interspace as well (Figure ).\nDetailed comparison of each coronal and axial CT reconstruction slice from 2018 clearly demonstrates the marked progression in the osteonecrosis along the T12 anterior fracture clearly connected to the T12-L1 interspace (Figure ).\nAfter",
