He did not complain of abdominal pain and did not have bleeding manifestations or any other warning symptoms. On examination, blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg and pulse rate was 100 beat per minute and capillary refilling time was less than 2 s. The abdomen was soft and non-tender and there was no free fluid. Lung fields were clear on respiratory system examination. Rest of the examination was normal. His NS-1 was positive and the PCR appeared as DEN 2 serotype.

On the 5th day following admission, he developed postural dizziness, vomiting and heavy diarrhoea. On examination, he was febrile, dehydrated, flushed and had warm peripheries. Blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, pulse rate was 130 beats per minute and a capillary refilling time of 2 s. Ultrasound examination of abdomen revealed free fluid in the hepato-renal pouch with increased gall bladder wall thickness. He was clinically diagnosed as having DHF complicated with septic shock and gastroenteritis. He was taken to HDU and critical phase monitoring commenced. His c-reactive protein was high 112 mg/dl. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics (ceftriaxone and metronidazole) were started cover the sepsis after taking blood and urine cultures. Within about 1 h, the patient deteriorated significantly and continued to have vomiting and diarrhoea. Blood pressure dropped to 60/30 mmHg and the pulse rate increased to 120 beats/min. Several fluid boluses were given including normal saline and IV Dextran 40. The haematocrit value dropped from 36 to 30 and patient went into decompensated shock with no urine output. He needed continuous transfusion of whole blood amounting to 9 pints over 20 h to maintain blood pressure and urine output. However, there were no obvious bleeding sites.",

Cardiovascular exam revealed normal rate and rhythm, grade 1 mid-frequency ejection murmur at left upper sternal border, normal upper extremity pulses and decreased lower extremity pulses. Blood pressure of right arm was 140/88, left arm was 136/90, right leg was 105/67 and left leg was 82/58.

A previously undiagnosed severe isthmic coarctation of the aorta was noted immediately distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery with surrounding collateral arteries. Coarctation was confirmed with echocardiogram that showed peak gradient around 40 mm Hg. Systolic function was normal. Initial imaging was suspicious for malignancy or infectious process. There was concern that the coarctation may be related to the mediastinal process. Initial bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) were non-diagnostic.

During that time, a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed which noted 4 x 4 x 2.3 cm mass in the right adrenal gland, and splenomegaly. Further workup at that time revealed multiple brain lesions on brain imaging, with an unclear source. The patient also had a lumbar puncture (LP) with normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results, negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), negative acid-fast stain and toxoplasmosis. Bone marrow biopsy in the past revealed findings consistent with a myeloproliferative disorder. The patient was scheduled to undergo adrenal biopsy, however, he declined this and decided to leave the hospital. Additionally, the patient saw a neurologist one month ago for persistent neck pain for the past seven months, associated with numbness and tingling in his right hand, which had subsequently progressed to his right forearm and upper arm.

Six months after the initial pull-through, he was approached with a posterior sagittal trans-rectal approach, which was similar to the patient in case 2. The fistula was freed from the rectum and closed in two layers over an indwelling urethral catheter. On the postoperative second day, the urethral catheter got dislodged. He started leaking urine via the distal colostomy stoma, suggesting a recurrence of the fistula. A distal stoma colostogram confirmed the recurrence.

The patient was having weakness on the left side for the past few weeks along with difficulty concentrating. Her symptoms started to worsen when she was leaning towards the left upon standing, veering to the left when driving, and had difficulty standing from a seated position. She was evaluated by her primary care physician (PCP) who ordered a brain MRI. The MRI showed a right frontal lobe mass with surrounding mild vasogenic edema and a small focal area of hemorrhage as seen in Figure .\nThese findings were concerning for high-grade glioma with other differentials including lymphoma and other causes. She was then sent to the hospital for further evaluation. Family history is significant for NHL in the father and brother diagnosed with NHL ~15years ago, who are in remission. On initial exam, vitals were significant for mildly elevated blood pressure but otherwise unremarkable. On neurologic exam, the patient was notably alert and oriented x 3, with intact speech but mild difficulty swallowing. She had mild left pronator drift, left-sided facial droop, left hemiparesis with 4/5 strength on the left upper and lower extremity, and 5/5 strength on the right upper and lower extremity. Sensations were intact in all extremities. She was started on 500 mg of Keppra, every 12 h and 4 mg of dexamethasone, every 8 h.

The umbilical cord of one fetus was once around the neck. Umbilical artery Doppler and a non-stress test showed no unusual symptoms. No distinct evidence of FFTS was observed during the entire pregnancy.

No pathological medical or surgical history was reported and no alcohol or tobacco habits. One year before, he had presented to his surgeon with a subscapularis tumor which had appeared gradually and increased in size during 6 months without associated pain or other symptoms. A physical examination reported a mass size 10cm, palpated in his right subscapularis region. A first resection was realized. Histopathological analysis demonstrated spindle-shaped cells with no identifiable nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic activity. There was no necrosis. A benign tumor with spindle-shaped cells is suspected. On immunohistochemical analysis, the cells stained positive for anti-smooth muscle actin, favoring a smooth muscle origin. The diagnostic of AF was retained. Unfortunately, the mass recurred within a period of 10 months and continued to increase in size reaching 13cm on a computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; Figure ) without regional structures involved (bone, muscle or vascular). A second tumor and lymph nodes resection were performed by another surgeon who reported \u201ca very hard resection without cleavage plane\u201d. Histological analysis regarding two fragments size 4\u00d73cm and 14\u00d710\u00d78cm led to a conclusion of AF tumor; hormonal receptor was not found. The resections of margins were narrowed and lymph node resections regarding four nodes were not involved. At assessment in our oncology and radiotherapy center after this second resection, his World Health Organization performance status was zero, weight 84kg, height 177cm.

Histopathological examination from the lesion at the upper end of tibia was suggestive of osteogenic sarcoma. The patient then received 6 cycles of cisplatin and doxorubicin until June 2008. A computed tomography (CT) thorax done at that time revealed no abnormality. The patient presented to us in April 2012 with cough and pleuritic chest pain for the last 7 days.

Pleural fluid was lymphocytic, exudative in nature with adenosine deaminase level 13.3 (normal <30 U/L). Pleural fluid cytology for malignant cells was negative on three successive occasions. Contrast-enhanced CT thorax revealed a large, heterogeneous, calcified mass (+277 H.U) at left upper and middle lobe extending to the hilum, partially encasing the left main pulmonary artery along with left-sided massive pleural effusion resulting in complete collapse consolidation of the left lung []. CT-guided fine needle aspiration cytology from the lung mass was inconclusive. Flexible bronchoscopy done after pleural aspiration revealed no other abnormality. Thoracoscopy revealed a lung metastasis in right upper and middle lobe exposed on the surface of visceral pleura. A tumor about 2 cm in diameter was found on the surface of parietal pleura. Lung tumor was resected and biopsy of the pleural mass was carried out. Both the sections showed tumor composed of polygonal and spindle-shaped cells with hyperchromatic nuclei.

A chest X-ray showed a left pneumothorax (Fig. ), and a previous chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a subpleural pulmonary nodule with cavitation in the left upper lobe (Fig. ). The patient had been on prednisolone and methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis. He also had a past history of acute coronary syndrome 5 years previously; this was treated with coronary stent implantation followed by anticoagulant therapy. He additionally had a past history of a right pneumothorax 3 years previously that was presumptively caused by rupture of a subpleural rheumatoid nodule and successfully treated with conservative thoracic drainage. Regarding his present admission, the left pneumothorax did not resolve after 1 week of chest tube drainage. There were no bacterial pathogens present in the pleural effusion. We decided to perform pleurodesis because his left lung expanded well after chest drainage and he had some risks for pneumothorax surgery, as previously mentioned. The air leakage finally subsided after six times pleurodesis procedures (with a blood patch once, a talc slurry three times, and OK-432 (streptococcal preparation) two times) prior to discharge (Fig. b). However, he presented to our hospital 1 week after being discharged because the pneumothorax had asymptomatically relapsed (Fig. c). Thus, we decided to perform thoracoscopic surgery to resect the subpleural lesion that caused intractable pneumothorax 2 months after the first admission. The surgery was performed through the fourth intercostal space along the midaxillary line, sixth intercostal space along the anteroaxillary line, and seventh intercostal space along the posteroaxillary line. There were rigid adhesions on the apex, mediastinum, and diaphragm due to repetitive pleurodesis. A sealing test revealed a pleural fistula with air leakage of the left upper lobe where the previous chest CT scan had demonstrated a small subpleural nodule with cavitation (Fig. a).

In January 2019, she fell indoors and injured her face and visited a hospital for medical treatment. Her chief complaint was trismus. A close examination of the head at the head and neck surgery department showed no abnormal findings. She was referred to our department for detailed examination and medical treatment for a suspected mandibular fracture. Her first visit to our department was on the following day. Her family history was unremarkable. Facial findings on the first visit included mild swelling and reddening in the right preauricular region. The intraoral finding was displacement of the median line of the mandible to the right. The right molar was also in early contact, and the left molar had an open bite. Trismus was observed, and her mouth opening capacity was 10 mm between the upper and lower central incisors. A panoramic radiograph showed a right mandibular condylar base fracture (subcondylar fracture, Lindahl's classification []) ().

    "original_text": "A 68-year-old Caucasian gentleman presented to the Emergency Department with a 3-week history of left hip pain, clicking, and difficulty weight bearing, with no antecedent trauma. This occurred on a background history of an ipsilateral ceramic on ceramic (CoC) uncemented THA implanted 10 years previously, with a complicated immediate post-operative course involving a dislocation requiring closed reduction. He suffered from no further complications and was asymptomatic up to this presentation. His background history was significant for a right uncemented CoC THA 6 years previously, type-2 diabetes, and chronic venous disease.\nOn examination, the patient displayed an antalgic gait with no obvious leg length discrepancy. Inspection revealed no evidence of infection at the previous THA incision. The patient suffered from pain on both active and passive movement at the hip, with an audible clicking sound throughout. There was no associated neurovascular deficit.\nPlain radiographic evaluation revealed superolateral subluxation of the ceramic femoral head in relation to the ceramic acetabular component with no associated periprosthetic fracture or dislocation (). Serological evaluation revealed normal infectious markers, consistent with clinical assessment showing no evidence of infection. Further imaging using computerized tomography revealed superolateral deficiency of the acetabular component, with a diagnosis of ceramic acetabular component fracture presumed to be the mechanism behind the patient\u2019s symptoms.\nFollowing initial inpatient management, the patient\u2019s symptoms improved, but nevertheless, he continued to suffer from discomfort and limitation of his activities of daily living (ADL\u2019s).

His medical history included blindness since childhood, polar posterior cataract and strabismus surgery in his RE at the age of 5 years. He has always had general good health, his left eye visual acuity was 20/20 and no ocular abnormality was observed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his orbit and A-scan ultrasonography showed bulbar subatrophy, vitreous haemorrhage, and choroidal calcifications (Fig. ). He had systemic multidrug-resistant hypertension and a fever resistant to multiantibiotic therapy for 3 months before presentation.\nAfter 1 month he underwent enucleation to relieve the pain and a hydroxyapatite prosthesis, 18 mm in size, was implanted. A histopathological examination disclosed an undifferentiated carcinoma arising from the ciliary body. An immunohistochemical study was positive for cytokeratin pool and negative for S-100, HMB45, Melan-a, CD34, CD45, CD3, and CD20 (Fig. ). A total body computed tomography (CT) scan, head and neck MRI were performed and no signs of metastatic disease were detected. A longitudinal follow-up was carried out revealing no remarkable signs. Since June 2008 (1 year after the enucleation procedure) he again had severe head and neck pain, fever and systemic hypertension. A new CT scan and MRI demonstrated a mass involving his entire orbital cavity displacing the prosthesis, which reached his optic foramen and medially eroded the bone wall of his orbit and ethmoid (Fig. ). He underwent a debulking procedure followed by three chemotherapy cycles (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil). After the surgery his blood pressure improved significantly and remained controlled with single therapy and without fever. In September 2008 a new head and neck CT scan and MRI showed a relapse.

Over time, we noticed an occult VMT at the foveal centre, which became evident when the retinal was thin soon after each anti-VEGF injection. Her visual acuity (VA) remained stable at 20/50 under this treatment regime, until she presented a sudden decrease of VA in her right eye from 20/400. On dilated fundus biomicroscopy, as well as standard OCT-scanning, no AMD-progression was apparent. A meticulous thin lined en face OCT-examination revealed an unchanged pattern of the PED, while a MH with a VMT on top of the PED became visible (a). This tiny but full thickness occult MH with a diameter of 568 \u03bcm may have been responsible for the decreased VA, so we discussed further treatment options with our patient. The presence of the firm VMT had already induced the rupture of the multi-layered retina; thus, an additional rupture of the PED monolayer of the RPE may progress to an RPE-tear and possible SR haemorrhage with a consecutive loss of the remaining VA. We discussed the risks of natural progression with the patient and explained possible treatment options: At first, we combined the next intravitreal anti-VEGF injections with a consecutive 1 cc air bubble application and asked the patient to maintain in a prone position over night, but no VMT release was observed.

First pain symptoms with 2 cm tumour occurred 2 years after caesarean section. Over the next 2 years, local burning pain gradually improved and the tumour constantly enlarged in size. The patient did not undergo any hormonal treatment and reported regular menstruation periods with scanty menstrual blood flow occurring regularly every 28 days, lasting 4 to 5 days. On physical examination, there was a palpable dark-red, pigmented tumour located in the abdominal wall within Pfannenstiel incision scar. Gynaecological examination and transvaginal ultrasound showed no abnormalities within reproductive organs. The patient was qualified for a surgical procedure involving resection of the lesion in general anaesthesia. A wide local excision of the lesion with adequate 1 cm margin of healthy tissue was performed. Scar endometrioma involved rectus abdominis muscle fascia and thus wide fascia excision was performed. Side to side linear fascia closure was impossible so non-absorbable polypropylene mesh was used to close the defect. The skin was extensively undermined and mobilized up towards umbilical level cephalically and pubic symphysis caudally with careful preservation of the communicating perforator vessels. Standard subcutaneous suction drainage was used to minimize the postoperative complication of haematoma and the skin was closed with single non-absorbable sutures ().

There was no significant past medical history. The patient had no history of receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Physical examination performed at the time of presentation revealed limitation of left knee flexion but no other abnormality on general physical examination. No lymphadenopathy or organomegaly was detected. Hematologic investigations showed hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dl with MCV = 86, platelet count of 275000/microliter and WBC of10000/microliter. ESR was 35 and biochemical test results of blood were unremarkable. Radiographic assessment of the knee revealed a lytic-sclerotic lesion on the superior part of the tibia and a bone scan showed just one bony lesion in the same area. An open biopsy was performed and the lesion was diagnosed as eosinophilic granuloma. During the 4-month follow up period, without initiation of any treatment, the patient developed constitutional symptoms of weight loss, persistent limping and bone pain in the knee region and generalized lymphadenopathy with splenomegaly noted on physical examination.\nA thoracoabdominal spiral CT scan was performed and showed mediastinal, cervical, right axillary and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathies, pulmonary nodules and hepatic and splenic involvement.\nThe differential diagnosis was disseminated lymphomatous involvement or disseminated Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Bone marrow and cervical lymph node biopsy were performed and the initial histopathologic diagnosis of eosinophilic granuloma for bony lesion was reviewed and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed.\nA biopsy of the lytic bone lesion revealed an admixture of inflammatory cells including many eosinophils with Langerhans cells (Figure ). Langerhans cells showed somewhat glassy pink cytoplasms, indistinct cell borders and longitudinal coffee-bean grooves in their nuclei with undulating or indented nuclear membranes. There was no obvious mitotic activity. As a result, a pathologic diagnosis of eosinophilic granuloma was made. Subsequent bone marrow evaluation showed no abnormality (M/E = 2",

Pain was not associated with eating, stooling, nausea, or vomiting and was only minimally relieved with oxycodone 5 mg. Physical examination revealed left upper quadrant tenderness, however, no guarding or rigidity. There were no other localizing signs of infection. The patient had his port accessed for labs recently, placing him at risk for bacteremia. Initial laboratory workup revealed a white blood cell count of 21 500, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 3.01, and a normal lactate. Blood cultures and urine culture were also obtained prior to antibiotic initiation. He was hospitalized and started on cefepime. Abdominal tenderness was attributed to constipation due to recent history of hard stools and was treated with a bowel regimen.\nAfter three days of therapy, fever and abdominal pain persisted with a rising white cell count to 38 800 and CRP of 29.86. Blood cultures (including fungal culture) and urine culture showed no growth. Antibiotic coverage was expanded to include vancomycin. Abdominal CT was performed due to concern for an abscess, which revealed moderate retained fecal material, asymmetric thickening and edema of the left lateral abdominal wall musculature, reflecting myositis, and mild splenomegaly, however, no intra-abdominal abscess. He also developed 2-3 cm, tender, blanching erythematous patches on his abdomen and upper right arm (Figure ). Workup was initiated for septic emboli and was negative. New lesions continued to erupt, with expanding size of previous lesions. This included a large plaque on the left abdomen/flank where his previous abdominal pain was located.

In March 2012, a 22-year-old female with iron-deficiency anemia, secondary to recurrent episodes of melena, presented as an outpatient to the Department of Gastroenterology at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Nanjing, China). Since infancy, the patient had exhibited massive characteristic venous malformations of the skin, which were deep blue, soft, rubbery and easily compressible. Between 1991 and 2012, the patient had a history of recurrent GI bleeding and iron-deficiency anemia. The patient did not have any history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use or peptic ulcers. The patient had received several blood transfusions and, at 12 years of age, an abdominal surgery was performed to resect the hemangiomas in the stomach. A pathological report revealed hemangioma. According to laboratory examinations, the patient exhibited a hemoglobin level of 41.0 g/l, a red blood cell count of 2,410/mm3, a reduced white blood cell count and an increased neutrophil granulocyte count. Skin lesions of various sizes occurred on the abdomen, hip and leg of the patient (). The patient received a blood transfusion and hemostatic therapy. Following hemostatic therapy, a fecal occult blood test yielded negative results. In order to detect the origin of the hemorrhage, a colonoscopy and capsule endoscopy were performed. Endoscopy revealed several strawberry-like mucosal polypoid lesions with abundant vasculature in the colon and lesions ranging between 8 and 20 mm were blue-violet and sessile (). Colon lesions were removed in an attempt to eliminate bleeding under colonoscopy. During surgery, hemangiomas were ligated with a nylon cord and several small blue mucosal polypoid lesions were treated with sclerosing agent during colonoscopy ().

    "original_text": "A 67-year-old Caucasian female presented for evaluation of persistent burning pain and itching in the vulvar region accompanied by marked erythema and warmth to the touch (). Her symptoms first appeared in childhood but increased in frequency and severity after menopause. During her reproductive years, she had experienced a myriad of urologic and gynecological symptoms. In her 20s, the preponderance of her symptoms involved her bladder, and she was subsequently diagnosed with interstitial cystitis. In her 30s, her gynecologic symptoms became more prominent and she was ultimately diagnosed with endometriosis for which she underwent a hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy at age 33. Throughout this time, her unexplained episodic vulvar symptoms were present; however, it was not until menopause that her vulvar symptoms became persistent and the frequency and severity of her flares dramatically increased. She found that the application of cold water and minimizing humidity and warmth in the perineal region were the only ameliorative modalities consistently effective in decreasing the frequency and severity of her \u201cflares.\u201d It is interesting to note that her mother and a maternal aunt had similar lifelong symptoms which they had attributed to horse back riding.\nOn initial evaluation, the patient had normal appearing vulvar skin and vulvar mucosal changes consistent with the diagnosis of menopausal atrophy.

The patient was referred to our hospital for endoscopic resection.\nLaboratory data, as well as serum carcinoembryonic antigen, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, and cytokeratin-19 fragment levels, were close to normal limits.

    "original_text": "A 46-year-old male was brought to the emergency department at Northwestern Memorial Hospital with multiple stab wounds to the neck and chest. He was hypotensive upon arrival and a right needle thoracostomy returned blood and air, resulting in improvement in blood pressure. Secondary survey demonstrated a stab wound to Zone I of the right neck, approximately 2 cm above the right clavicular head, and a second stab wound to the right thoraco-abdominal area 3 cm above the costal margin and 2.5 cm lateral to the mid-clavicular line. A portable chest x-ray performed at Patient Arrival Time (PAT) + 10 min revealed a right hemothorax. A right thoracostomy tube was placed, which returned 800 mL of blood. By this time the patient had responded to resuscitation of 2 L of Lactated Ringers (PAT + 20 min). The patient did not at this time meet criteria for an emergent thoracotomy (< 1500 mL thoracostomy output and hemodynamic stability), therefore planning the workup for potential surgical sources of bleeding incorporated 3 areas of concern: 1) intra-thoracic injury resulting from the lower right thoraco-abdominal wound, 2) intra-abdominal injury from the lower right thoraco-abdominal wound that was decompressing through a diaphragm injury into the right thoracic cavity and 3) injury to the proximal great vessels from the Zone I neck wound decompressing into the right thoracic cavity. We believed that distinguishing between these three possibilities was important in so far that the optimal surgical approach to each area was different: 1) posterior thoracotomy for thoracic injury, 2) laparotomy for abdominal and 3) median sternotomy/clavicular extension for proximal great vessel exposure.

    "cleaned_text": "a 46-year-old male was brought to the emergency department at northwestern memorial hospital with multiple stab wounds to the neck and chest. he was hypotensive upon arrival and a right needle thoracostomy returned blood and air, resulting in improvement in blood pressure. secondary survey demonstrated a stab wound to zone i of the right neck, approximately 2 cm above the right clavicular head, and a second stab wound to the right thoraco-abdominal area 3 cm above the costal margin and 2.5 cm lateral to the mid-clavicular line. a portable chest x-ray performed at patient arrival time (pat) + 10 min revealed a right hemothorax. a right thoracostomy tube was placed, which returned 800 ml of blood. by this time the patient had responded to resuscitation of 2 l of lactated ringers (pat + 20 min). the patient did not at this time meet criteria for an emergent thoracotomy (< 1500 ml thoracostomy output and hemodynamic stability), therefore planning the workup for potential surgical sources of bleeding incorporated 3 areas of concern: 1) intra-thoracic injury resulting from the lower right thoraco-abdominal wound, 2) intra-abdominal injury from the lower right thoraco-abdominal wound that was decompressing through a diaphragm injury into the right thoracic cavity and 3) injury to the proximal great vessels from the zone i neck wound decompressing into the right thoracic cavity. we believed that distinguishing between these three possibilities was important in so far that the optimal surgical approach to each area was different: 1) posterior thoracotomy for thoracic injury, 2) laparotomy for abdominal and 3) median sternotomy/clavicular extension for proximal great vessel exposure. a focused abdominal sonogram for trauma (fast) done at pat + 20 min was negative. given the range of possible injuries and the patient's current stability, a computer tomography angiogram (cta) of the neck and chest and a ct scan of the abdomen were performed at pat + 40 min.",

    "original_text": "A 28 year old unmarried woman, gravida 0, para 0, was referred to the authors' hospital for a left ovarian cyst. An irregular papillary protuberant lesion was found in the luminal wall of a cyst that had swollen to a diameter of 10 cm. Thus, an ovarian malignancy was suspected and an abdominal left-sided salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. The findings from the histopathological inspections revealed borderline serous papillary cystadenoma, while the cytodiagnosis of ascites revealed a class II classification. Considering the patient's age and the need for fertility preservation, it was decided to observe her progress instead of additional treatments. Two years after surgery, an enlargement in the remaining ovary was identified. An abdominal contrast computed tomography (CT) examination revealed a multilocular cystic tumor, with a diameter of 9 cm and a solid part in the luminal wall of the cyst (Fig. ). A malignancy was suspected and it was decided to perform a right-sided salpingo-oophorectomy. As the patient already had undergone a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and would lose her fertility by further resection of the remaining ovary, the authors presented the cryopreservation of unfertilized oocytes to the patient, who was unmarried, as an option for fertility preservation. As both the patient and her parents desired fertility preservation, it was decided to conduct the cryopreservation of her unfertilized oocytes. As the oocyte retrieval would be attempted from an ovary that was affected by a malignancy, it was decided to conduct laparotomic oocyte retrieval during surgery, instead of conventional transvaginal retrieval, in order to reduce the risk of puncturing or rupturing the tumor.

Less than three months later the patient was unable to walk and was subsequently admitted to our hospital for congestive heart failure.\nA skin examination performed at the time of admission showed the heel ulcer to be extensive (Figures and ), and it was evaluated as grade III according to the Wagner grading system []. Three additional decubital lesions had developed on the sacral area, external malleolus and flexure of the right ankle. These lesions were evaluated as Wagner grade II and were well delineated with a necrotic appearance, without granulation tissue, and covered by purulent exudates.\nA general examination indicated that the patient had congestive heart failure probably due to ischemic heart disease. Echocardiography was not performed, and electrocardiography showed no evidence of myocardial infarction. The patient's diabetes was poorly controlled, with neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin measurements of 40 IU in the morning and 15 IU in the evening, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels >8%, which required adjustments of his insulin dose and addition of on-demand fast-acting insulin.

He was started on insulin therapy the year following diagnosis () with 1 unit of rapid acting insulin analogue, insulin aspart, per 20 g of carbohydrates, and no basal insulin. Eight years after being diagnosed with CFRD, he was approved to start a new therapy, ivacaftor 150 mg orally twice daily for treatment of his CF based on his G551D mutation. Pre-ivacaftor, his insulin regimen was unchanged as he generally averaged between 4 and 6 units of insulin aspart per meal consistent with a carbohydrate content of 100 to 120 g per meal. This dose was consistent with what he received as an inpatient during admissions with stable postprandial levels not requiring additional correction. Within 6 months of starting ivacaftor, he reported recurrent hypoglycemic episodes and stopped insulin therapy. Between starting ivacaftor and the 3 subsequent years, the patient had been hospitalized for CF exacerbations 8 times at our institution.

    "original_text": "A 45-year-old female presented with worsening confusion, memory loss, and loss of bladder control for 3 days. She suffered from dizziness for the past year and altered gait for the past few weeks. Her medical history was significant for hypertension, depression, and headaches. Surgical history was limited to two cesarean sections and a tubal ligation. She was a non-smoker with no history of alcohol or drug abuse. There was no family history of brain malignancy. On physical examination, the patient presented with Parinaud's phenomenon, was orientated to person and place, but could not recall the date and relied on her husband to answer most of the questions. The remaining cranial nerves were intact. No pronator drift was present. Strength, sensation, and reflexes in upper and lower extremities were normal. Initial laboratory results were significant for an elevated white blood cell count of 16.7. Non-contrast CT scan of the head showed the presence of a large posterior fossa mass and hydrocephalus. However, it was difficult to discern the boundaries of the mass [Figure and ]. A follow-up MRI with and without contrast confirmed the presence of a 4.2 \u00d7 3.3 \u00d7 4.6 cm3 mass in the tectal region compressing the cerebellum and obliterating the fourth ventricle [Figure and ]. The mass caused a 4 mm tonsilar herniation through the foramen magnum. MRS demonstrated an elevated choline/N-acetylaspartate ratio and an increase in lactate suggesting an aggressive neoplasm as opposed to an abscess []. A ventricular-peritoneal shunt was initially placed to relieve the hydrocephalus and after discussion with the patient's family surgery was performed to determine the pathology of the mass. The patient subsequently underwent a suboccipital craniotomy with biopsies of the necrotic mass. Biopsy of the lesion was consistent with GBM [Figure \u2013]. Her postoperative CT scan showed improvement of hydrocephalus and a decrease in tumor size [Figure and ]. The family declined further treatment after diagnosis",

She was referred to us for further medical workup under a suspected diagnosis of esophageal hiatal hernia. Her past history and family history were unremarkable. At the first visit, a physical examination yielded no positive findings, and hematologic/blood biochemical tests also showed no abnormalities. However, a plain chest X-ray revealed a stomach gas bubble that had obliterated the cardiac silhouette within the mediastinum. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) and upper gastrointestinal series revealed an intrathoracic herniation of the stomach, with slight torsion of the corpus ventriculi. The patient was thus diagnosed as having a type IV esophageal hiatal hernia and underwent a laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication in February 2011.\nThe intraoperative findings revealed a markedly enlarged esophageal hiatal orifice, resulting in the intrusion of the stomach and the greater omentum into the esophageal hiatus. The stomach and greater omentum that had been drawn into the mediastinum through the enlarged esophageal hiatal orifice were restored to their intraperitoneal positions. The esophageal hiatus was plicated dorsally and then ventrally; however, durable closure of the hiatus seemed difficult by this method alone, and mesh reinforcement was subsequently undertaken. A Bard Composite Mesh (PTFP/ePTFP) was cut from the margin to the center and shaped so as to create a keyhole around the abdominal esophagus, with appropriate clearance. To reinforce the hiatus, the mesh was fixed in place using sutures at a distance of about 5 mm from the abdominal esophagus (Fig. (A)). Fundoplication was then performed using the Toupet procedure (Fig. (B)). The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on the 7th hospital day.\nThe patient visited our outpatient clinic 1 month after the surgery and then once every 2 months.
