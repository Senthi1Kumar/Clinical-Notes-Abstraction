He had experienced no chest symptoms since starting the medications. No significant ST changes had been noted on previous periodic electrocardiographic examinations (). The patient was fitted with a Holter monitor as regular testing for sinus bradycardia (Rubenstein type I) in November 2020. The patient experienced no chest symptoms during the recording. Next day, after removing monitoring device, he was subsequently seen on an outpatient basis. Electrocardiography for regular check-up showed giant negative T waves in multiple leads (), and echocardiography showed decreased wall motion on the apex (, ). A blood sample showed mildly elevated troponin T (0.109 ng/dL). Based on the diagnostic assessment, acute coronary event was suspected, and the patient was immediately hospitalised. Emergent coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery stenosis (). Left ventriculography of right anterior oblique) view showed a narrow neck and apical ballooning during systole (, ). Left ventriculography of left anterior oblique view showed that apical wall motion was severely decreased while basal portion of left ventricular septum and posterolateral wall normally contracted (). Takotsubo syndrome was considered a possible diagnosis, and other diseases were excluded according to the guideline. As the patient did not experience any physical or emotional stress and had no chest symptoms during the clinical course from before onset to hospital discharge, it was concluded that he had asymptomatic takotsubo syndrome.\nHolter monitoring performed before admission showed a consistent sinus rhythm; no significant arrhythmias were recorded.

Two drug-eluting stents were implanted at the aneurysmal site of the left anterior descending artery and the high lateral branch. However, coronary angiography after coronary intervention demonstrated residual stenoses of the left anterior descending artery, high lateral branch, and left circumflex artery, and intravascular ultrasound revealed stent malappositions at the sites of the coronary aneurysm (Fig. ). Because the duration of patency of the stent implanted within the coronary artery aneurysm was unpredictable and a residual lesion was present, he was referred to our department for CABG. Echocardiogram showed left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 19%. Enhanced computed tomography revealed bilateral occlusions of the internal thoracic arteries and a small fragile sternum after sternoturnover fixation (Fig. ). Considering postoperative respiratory dysfunction associated with instability of the thorax following median sternotomy, low left ventricular function, and left coronary artery as the only target vessel, we selected left thoracotomy for CABG without cardiopulmonary bypass.\nThe left radial artery and great saphenous vein were harvested with the patient lying supine under general anesthesia. He was then placed in a semi right lateral decubitus position (Fig. ). The thoracotomy was made by a left anterolateral incision at the fifth intercostal space.

He experienced general weakness, fatigue, and weight loss in the last several months. The patient BMI was 20 kg/m2. In physical examination, vital signs were normal. In abdominal examination, a scar of previous surgery in the right subcostal area (subcostal incision) with near 15 cm length was noted. In hematological examination, Hb was 11 g/dl. In serum biochemistry, renal function tests, electrolytes, and bilirubin were all within normal limits. Only mild elevations of hepatic enzymes were noted. Serum and urinary catecholamines were normal. Serum levels of cortisole and aldosterone were normal. In CT scan that was done with intravenous and oral contrast (), a large mass located in the subhepatic area and intervening with the upper pole of the right kidney was noted. In the report of previous operation that was done in Iraq, tumorectomy was failed due to severe adhesions of the mass to the peripheral tissues. This mass was isolated from the liver. The patient scheduled for right adrenalectomy with the midline laparotomy incision. After opening the layers, the mass was located in the lodge of upper pole of the right kidney. It was severely adherent to the peripheral tissues, due to severe adhesion of the mass to the subhepatic area, its differentiation from the kidney or adrenal was difficult. Due to severe bleeding from the subhepatic bed subcapsular resection of the mass with the adherent kidney performed. Its total size was 14 cm \u00d7 10 cm and it weighted 2250 grams.

The patient and her husband\u2019s medical records were unremarkable. Maternal serum screening for Down\u2019s syndrome in the second trimester represented low risk and the ultrasound at 12 and 20 weeks of gestation revealed no abnormalities.\nUltrasound examination was repeated in our hospital and revealed a cystic mass measuring 2.16 \u00d7 1.05 cm in the posterior midline portion of the fetal brain (). However, color Doppler showed no vascularity in or around the mass. There were no ventriculomegaly or other extracranial abnormalities, nor were there any signs of fetal hydrops or other anomalies.\nFetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI was recommended to get more information. MRI at 32 weeks gestation showed a isolated triangle occipital mass measuring 2.5 \u00d7 2.4cm along the posterior surface of the brain with high signal intensity on T2 weighted MRI with occipital lobe compressed forward and superior longitudinal sinuses dilated ().

A decision was made to perform bilateral THA on the patient (Fig. A\u2013C).\nBoth left and right hips were completely fused, making dislocation impossible.

He had suffered an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction one month earlier and had undergone emergent RCA stenting with a drug eluting stent. Following that index admission, he had been discharged but presented three days later with a cardiac arrest, from which he was resuscitated. He had been noncompliant with his dual antiplatelet therapy and was found to have RCA in-stent thrombosis requiring repeat stenting with a drug eluting stent. After a good neurological recovery, he was again discharged and subsequently enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation. During the rehabilitation session, he was found to have sustained tachycardia with associated nausea and lightheadedness but no symptoms of palpitation, chest pain or dyspnea. He was treated with intravenous adenosine in the ambulance and allegedly had some brief sinus rhythm, but arrived in the emergency department in a regular tachycardia with hemodynamic stability. The electrocardiogram showed tachycardia at the rate of 176 beats per minute which was regular with narrow complexes in most leads and a maximum QRS duration of 115-120 milliseconds in leads I and aVL, with slurring of the QRS upstroke. There was an abrupt R-wave transition between leads V1 and V2 (as in Figure ). The arrhythmia failed to respond to intravenous diltiazem but resolved after 150 mg of intravenous amiodarone. The sinus rhythm electrocardiogram demonstrated a significantly different QRS complex than during tachycardia, both in axis and without the slurred QRS upstroke in leads I and aVL (Figure ).\nThe patient was admitted to coronary care unit and was continued on intravenous amiodarone infusion.

The patient was otherwise feeling well and had no symptoms. Physical examination revealed a 2-cm ulcerated lesion on her pubis (shown in Fig. ). There were no palpable inguinal lymph nodes, and examination of the genital parts was normal.\nThe biopsy results from another medical center came back with a diagnosis of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma on all the samples. The excision was incomplete, and therefore this patient was addressed for further management.\nThe patient's case was discussed at our multidisciplinary meeting, and wide local excision was decided. The histological report of the reexcision revealed a lesion with a depth of 4 mm in the dermis reaching the limit of the hypodermis, with tumoral cells infiltrating the dermis and harboring nuclear atypia and high mitotic activity. The lesion was ulcerative with a fibrinous leukocytic exudate. Vascular emboli were reported, and clear margins of 1 cm were achieved (shown in Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for carcinoembryonic antigen and cytokeratin (CK) 7 on the luminal ductal borders. p40 and CK5 and 6 were also positive on the whole cell population, and epithelial membrane antigen was heterogeneously positive. Those characteristics were consistent with the diagnosis of EPC. TNM classification was pT2.\nGiven the presence of vascular emboli, a staging CT scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was performed, which showed an image compatible with pelvic carcinomatosis. An additional FDG-PET scan was then requested, which displayed a hypermetabolic left inguinal lymph node and focal uptake in the right colon (shown in Fig. ). Further investigations were conducted, which included a total colonoscopy and an inguinal left node biopsy.

    "original_text": "In July 2014, a 59-year-old Japanese female with no significant past history presented to our hospital with a lump and pain in her right breast that had gradually worsened for 3 years and 3 months. She had never undertaken any mammography breast cancer screenings, although it was offered through the local government of Minamisoma City. In April 2011, she first noticed a lump in her right breast. It continued to gradually enlarge, and in September 2012, pain appeared in her breast, leading to the first disclosure of her symptoms to her general practitioner, whom she had frequently (3\u20134 times per year) visited for antimicrobial treatment for recurrent urinary tract infections since March 2010. However, she was falsely diagnosed with intercostal neuralgia due to her pain, without consideration of the lump.

It had the same signal characteristics as that of the tumor. This lesion was not present in the initial CT scan [], which was done two months prior to the MRI.

Scimitar syndrome is a very rare anomaly described to occur in about two of 100,000 births, of which females are affected in a twofold predominance. This syndrome is defined by the presence of a scimitar vein that provides an abnormal venous drainage of the right lung into the inferior vena cava. In addition, several other cardiopulmonary anomalies have been described in association with a scimitar vein (reviewed in []) including but not limited to hypoplasia of the right lung with consecutive dextroposition of the right heart, pulmonary sequestration, perimembranous ventricular septal defect, and a persistent ductus arteriosus. All these abnormal findings were present in the case described here.\nAt the age of five months, the girl underwent surgical repair to redirect the anomalous lung veins via patch into the left atrium, closure of the ventricular septal defect, and ligature of the ductus arteriosus. The pre- and postoperative situations are illustrated in . The postoperative cardiac catheterization on the day of the operation showed complete obstruction of the right-sided pulmonary venous return and missing anterograde perfusion of the right lung.

Long-term oxygen therapy and PH-specific treatment with an endothelin-receptor antagonist (bosentan) were established. The course during the following years was characterized by frequent pulmonary infections but the clinical status remained stable under treatment with bosentan, diuretics, and oral anticoagulation.

On further enquiry, the patient revealed that he had an erythematous patch over glans without the nodular lesions for the past 4 years.

She was diagnosed with an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) at the right basal ganglia by brain computed tomography (CT) (). Three days later, a chest X-ray revealed a diffuse haziness in both lung fields (). Her pulmonary status was further complicated by an inability to cooperate with respiratory toilet and total opacification of both lungs on the chest X-ray. She was intubated due to aspiration pneumonia. Her condition was worsened despite intravenous administration of culture-specific antibiotics and repeated sputum drainage.

An initial evaluation revealed the presence of swelling, tenderness and reduced motion of the right knee joint because of pain. She was afebrile and did not have hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Her white blood cell count was 0,6\u00d7109/l, absolute neutrophil count was 0,3\u00d7109/l.

She says that she was told that the surgery did not work as expected, and she became deaf in that ear. At the time of surgery the surgeon reported high pressure and flow of perilymph that he characterized as a \u2018gusher\u2019. Her hearing in her left ear was already poor at the time of the operation on her right ear, and it had been deteriorating gradually. She was fitted with a hearing aid in her left ear soon after the surgery. There is no record of imaging or a previous audiogram, and it is thought that an inadequate (unmasked) audiogram was used to formulate the initial diagnosis of otosclerosis.\nOur patient accepted the surgery failure and her misdiagnosis was only corrected when she decided to seek further assessment and a second opinion due to progressive deterioration of her hearing in her better ear to a level that a monoaural hearing aid was not providing enough benefit. She also reported intrusive tinnitus in her right ear and symptoms of imbalance.\nA tympanometry investigation revealed normal type A tympanograms with absent ipsilateral and contralateral acoustic reflexes bilaterally. Her audiogram showed a moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear and a profound sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear. Word discrimination scores in quiet using AB word lists [] were relatively poor at amplified levels. Videonystagmography was performed and caloric testing revealed a significant canal paresis in her right ear.\nImaging of temporal bone (Figure ) revealed enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome in her right and left ears.

Fetal anatomy was regular, except for the presence of an anomalous umbilical cord cyst. It had a maximum size of 18 mm and regular margins and was adjacent to the abdominal wall. This cyst was avascular, had no internal septa or vegetations, and was within the umbilical cord, embraced by the two umbilical arteries, in communication with the bladder. Its size varied during the ultrasound examination, which lasted several hours, configuring the diagnostic suspicion of an allantoic cyst with patent urachus ().\nAmniocentesis was performed to rule out chromosomal or genomic anomalies. The traditional karyotype study and array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization- (CGH-) array showed no alterations related to an allantoic cyst, such as trisomies 13 and 18. Subsequently, the patient underwent a second trimester screening exam at our center during the 21st week of gestation. The biometric values appeared overall greater than a week compared to gestational age, and the allantoic cyst showed an increased size, with a maximum diameter of 46 mm; the remaining anatomy explored by ultrasound was regular (). In the following ultrasound check, performed during the 32nd week of gestation, the cyst and the bladder were no longer visible, due to cyst rupture, while an omphalocele of 35 \u00d7 31 millimeters appeared, consisting of loops of small intestines coated with membranes (). The patient then underwent fetal magnetic resonance imaging, which confirmed the ultrasound findings and showed a stretching of the bladder dome through the abdominal wall defect.\nGestation was carried out regularly, and delivery was by elective cesarean section in a facility equipped with neonatal intensive care and pediatric surgery unit.

A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a right atrial mass close to the RA-IVC junction. A transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed the presence of a pedunculated right atrial mobile bilobular mass measuring 2.1 \u00d7 1.8 cm, not arising from the interatrial septum with extension into the inferior vena cava (Figures \u2013). A secundum atrial septal defect was also identified. The patient was referred to cardiac surgery for resection of a presumed right atrial myxoma given the possibility of embolization. The intraoperative TEE suggested the presence of one bilobulated mass arising low in the right atrium.\nUsing aortic and bicaval cannulation, a right atriotomy was performed and a discrete 2 \u00d7 3 cm mass was removed from the IVC-RA junction near the Eustachian valve. The right atrium was closed and the patient weaned from bypass. The specimen did not appear to be a myxoma, so it was sent for frozen section and interpreted as being ectopic liver tissue. In the interim, a repeat TEE showed an additional discrete 2 \u00d7 2 cm mass in the IVC near the hepatic veins. Femoral venous cannulation was then performed to allow for visualization of the IVC below the pericardial reflection. Through the same right atriotomy and using additional suction directly in the IVC, the IVC mass was visualized and resected. Both specimens were interpreted as showing partially encapsulated liver parenchyma with mild steatosis, fibrosis, ductal proliferation, and periductal chronic inflammation, consistent with ectopic hepatic tissue ().\nDespite a brief period of cardiopulmonary bypass, the patient had persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure ascribed to her morbid obesity and underlying lung disease.

However, echocardiography revealed a huge, immobile mass without pedunculation occupying both atria (Figure A). Due to its atypical characteristics and position, we performed a magnetic resonance imaging scan. Images showed a well-defined mass within the inferior portions of both atria with high signal intensity on T2 weighted images, slightly high signal intensity on T1 weighted images, no fat suppression on fat saturated images, and strong peripheral enhancement on gadolinium enhanced images. In addition, multiple calcified lesions of low intensity were noted within the tumor and the coronary sinus was inferiorly displaced by the mass (Figure B,C). Surgery was performed via conventional median sternotomy. During cardiopulmonary bypass, IVC cannulation was performed through the left femoral vein instead of the lower right atrium because the inferior vena cava was almost totally obstructed and the distal embolization should be prevented. The tumor was resected and the interatrial septal defect was closed with pericardium.

From the patient's history, chronic constipation had achieved 20 points in the Wexner Constipation Scale (WCS) [] since his infancy. He had occasionally received treatment with laxatives and rectal enemas. His last surgery had been 10 years before and included sigmoidectomy. Histopathology analysis of the resected sigmoid colon showed a dilated bowel with no evidence of malignancy, and no other immunohistological analysis was done. The patient stated that the symptoms of constipation had never resolved, while during the last 6 months he had been admitted to hospital twice due to bowel obstruction and treated without surgery.\nDuring the last admission to our hospital, an abdominal X-ray showed a massively distended large bowel (fig. ), and an abdominal computed tomography scan did not reveal any mechanical obstruction (fig. ). Due to excess abdominal tenderness and radiological findings, it was decided that an exploratory laparotomy would be appropriate. During laparotomy (fig. ) no obvious mechanical cause was found and a subtotal colectomy and Hartmann's procedure was performed. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on the 12th postoperative day with a temporary ileostomy.\nIn the pathology department, gross examination showed that the colon and especially the cecum was distended and its mucosal surface appeared flattened, with a polypoid lesion measuring 2.5 cm found in the cecum. Microscopic examination and immunohistochemical study of the polypoid lesion proved that it was a villoglandular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia, and full-thickness analysis of the resected colon revealed enlarged myenteric and submucosal neurons as well as an increased number of giant cells.

Two-dimensional and color-flow Doppler echocardiography demonstrated a grossly hypokinetic and dilated left ventricle with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, in addition to reversal of flow from the anomalous left coronary artery into the pulmonary artery (PA) that constituted a left-to-right shunt. Cardiac catheterization and computed tomography coronary angiography showed the single right coronary arising from the aorta and retrograde filling of the left coronary artery with a very short main coronary trunk that originated from the rightward posterior sinus of the PA (Fig. ).\nCardiopulmonary bypass with bicaval and distal aortic cannulation and mild hypothermia were established. Both pulmonary arteries were dissected and looped. Cardioplegic spikes were inserted into both the ascending aorta and the pulmonary trunk (PT), and a left side vent was placed through the right upper pulmonary vein. The aortic crossclamp was placed high, and cardioplegic solution was delivered simultaneously into the aortic root and the PT using a bifurcated cardioplegia delivery system to maximize protection of the left ventricle, after bilateral pulmonary arteries were snared tightly to prevent perfusion steal into the pulmonary bed from the PA cannula. The ascending aorta was transected at a high level more than 10 mm above the sinotubular junction, and the main PA was transected just below the bifurcation. The left coronary artery originated from the rightward posterior sinus of the pulmonary sinus with a single orifice and a very short main trunk. The coronary button was harvested with a generous cuff of the pulmonary sinus wall, and the proximal portion of the coronary artery was mobilized with preservation of branches.
