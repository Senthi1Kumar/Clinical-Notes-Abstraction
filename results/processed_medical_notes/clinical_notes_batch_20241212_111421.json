His blood pressure was 250/100 mmHg, and his Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score was 12 - 13 in the emergency department. A diagnosis of aneurysm was obtained with computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head. The aneurysm was measured at 56.5 mm with the General Electric Healthcare PACS program (GE; Centricity Universal Viewer Zero Footprint, version 5.0 sp7.1) (). The aneurysm was seen to have settled in the middle fossa at the base, filled the inferior p ortion of the temporal lobe, and ruptured toward the posterior portion within the temporal lobe. At first, it had been observed on the CT at the orbital level, and the higher axial sections showed lobulation extending up to the third ventricular level.

    "original_text": "An 83-year-old man presented with a complaint of chest pain. He had undergone a right pulmonary lower lobectomy for lung cancer 3 years previously, and he was taking several drugs daily to treat hypertension and diabetes. Upon arrival at the emergency room in Ise Red Cross Hospital, the patient had a high fever reaching 39.6\u00b0C and hypoxia with saturation of percutaneous oxygen of 89% that necessitated oxygen inhalation. His blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg at the time of presentation but gradually deteriorated thereafter. Computed tomography (CT) showed a ruptured aortic aneurysm located at the proximal descending aorta with extensive mediastinal hematoma (). Laboratory testing revealed an increased peripheral leukocyte count of 11,500 cells/mm3 and an elevated C-reactive protein level of 7.7 mg/dL. A sustained high-grade fever and elevated inflammatory response in his laboratory testing pointed to underlying aortic infection. Because the patient\u2019s condition was too severe to undergo surgical debridement and reconstruction of the diseased aorta, we performed emergency TEVAR to salvage the patient upon arrival. Under general anesthesia, the left common femoral artery, exposed through an inguinal incision, was used as the remote access vessel. Preoperative CT showed that the aneurysm was present as a pseudoaneurysm with a 12 mm orifice and 62 mm maximal diameter. The proximal landing zone, i.e., the distance between the left subclavian artery and the orifice of the pseudoaneurysm, was estimated to be 27 mm, and the diameter of the proximal neck was 30 mm. Initial aortography confirmed the orifice of the aneurysm to be distal to the left subclavian artery, in agreement with the preoperative CT finding. Of the c-TAG (W. L.

He also admitted chronic constipation for the last 6 years, anorexia and 15 kg weight loss since his last admission (April 2004). He had no surgical or other medical history. On examination, he was in distress, but afebrile and haemodynamically stable. His abdomen was distended but non-tender, with increased bowel sounds in pitch and frequency. No palpable abdominal mass or organomegaly and no external hernias were present. Laboratory blood analyses were within normal limits. Plain abdominal X-ray showed few air-fluid levels centrally located, without free intraperitoneal gas. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not reveal any abnormalities. Contrast-enhanced abdomen computed tomography, performed on the same day, confirmed the diagnosis of small bowel ileus without providing any diagnostic clues.

Endoscopy of upper and lower gastrointestinal tract and biopsies from the duodenum and colon provided normal findings. Although symptoms of obstruction had abated, the history of multiple relapses, the patient's complaints for poor quality of life and multiple admissions, as well as the undefined origin of the underlying pathology led to an exploratory laparotomy on day 7. On surgery, a fibrous capsule covering all the abdominal viscera was revealed, in which small bowel loops were encased, with the presence of interloop adhesions.

No episodes of trauma and no previous knee problems were reported. The problem began as stiffness and pain and had worsened in the last 3 months to the extent that he had to stop playing. The patient described the pain as an intermittent deep ache. The pain was exacerbated by end of range flexion and extension.\nPhysical examination revealed right-sided posterior knee pain exacerbated by end range flexion and extension and mild effusion. Active range of movement was -15\u00b0\u201395\u00b0 and passive range of movement -10\u00b0\u2013100\u00b0 (Fig and ). Atrophy of the right quadriceps was present. There was no joint-line tenderness on palpation. Anterior and posterior drawer and Lachmann tests were negative whilst compression rotation test was positive.\nPhysiotherapy was initially undertaken in order to improve range of movement. At review no improvement at all was seen and compression rotation test was still positive. MRI scans showed an abnormal anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Its fibres were intact but displaced by material containing high signal on the fat sat sequence, reported as appearing mucoid in nature. There were also areas of focally high signal in relation to its tibial attachment. These areas had the appearance of tiny ganglia. The report presumed that these ganglia extended into and thickened the ACL. The findings were in keeping with mucinous degeneration. There was evidence of intra-osseous cyst formation as shown by high signal at the attachment sites of the ligament (Fig. \u2013 arrows). X-ray was unremarkable.

The patient consented to endotracheal intubation and possible tracheostomy in case intubation failed. The patient was successfully undergoing orotracheal intubation in the operating room.

Breast tumour cells in the primary cancer were positive for CAM 5.2, AE1, AE3 and EMA and negative for S100 and HMB45. Right axillary nodal clearance showed one out of nine lymph nodes contained metastatic cancer with a large area of necrosis and 2 distinct tumour types (Figure ). One morphological type was of epithelial origin with cells arranged in cohesive sheets. These areas were positive for CAM 5.2, AE1, AE3 and EMA (Figure ). Other areas were highly pleomorphic containing cells with prominent nucleoli arranged in loose dissociate clusters that were strongly positive for S100 protein and focally for HMB45; negative for EMA and CAM 5.2 (Figure ). The lymph node metastases therefore contained features of metastatic breast carcinoma and malignant melanoma in the same metastatic focus. Staging CT of her thorax, abdomen and pelvis as well as a bone scan were negative for distant spread. The patient was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer with 5 fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide for six cycles followed by radiotherapy to the breast.

On examination a firm, slightly mobile mass with skin thickening was palpated in the upper outer right quadrant, no enlarged lymph nodes were found in the right axillary region, no other significant physical examination findings were noted. A mammography revealed a solitary ill-defined mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. The lesion was surgically removed. At light microscopy, a tumoral growth which diffusely infiltrated the mammary gland consisting mainly of blasts with variably shaped nuclei, multiple evident nucleoli, a rather dense chromatin and a moderate amount of cytoplasm was demonstrated (). Surprisingly, immunohistochemistry showed that the neoplastic cells were strongly stained for CD34 () and myeloperoxidase, being negative for the remaining cell markers employed CD79a, CD20, CD10, CD3, and Glycophorin A. Based on morphologic and phenotypic findings a diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma was made.

His past medical history included a diagnosis of myocardial infarction 13 years previously, prolonged arterial hypertension (>10 years) and chronic hepatitis B infection. The patient was receiving tacrolimus, methylprednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil as immunosuppressive drugs. His blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, in both arms with no postural difference. His heart rate was 72/min and respiratory rate was 14 breaths per minute. The chest and heart examinations were unremarkable. Abdominal examination revealed a loud systolic\u2013diastolic murmur above the kidney transplant, suggesting a vascular abnormality, and was otherwise unremarkable. Arterial pulses in the lower extremities were preserved and equal. We suspected acute renal allograft rejection, and the patient was scheduled to undergo a kidney allograft biopsy. An ultrasound examination before the biopsy revealed a large convoluted vessel in the caudal part of the transplant kidney. We initially suspected progression of a traumatic AVF after a previous kidney biopsy in 2005. However, we were puzzled by the fact that colour Doppler measurement revealed no typical fistula flow pattern. Although we observed a relatively high flow (peak flow, 150 cm/s) in some of the convoluted arterial vessels, typical arterial turbulences were generally not present. Moreover, we observed a significant within-breath modulation of venous blood flow in some venous convolute vessels. We carried out an abdominal MRT and MR angiography (Figure ). Both examinations indicated AVM, but could not definitely exclude the presence of a highly vascularized renal cell tumour. Conventional contrast angiography suggested AVM, but demonstrated no possibility to perform an embolization of the malformation. There was no evidence of further AVMs in our patient.

He also had a history of intramuscular injections at a primary clinic for back pain related to a herniated lumbar disc for 2 years prior to presentation. Serum sodium and potassium concentrations were low (110 and 3.2 mmol/L, respectively), and the serum cortisol level was 4.22 \u00b5g/dL. A standard dose ACTH stimulation test was performed.

He had been taking a medication for hypertension. Considering his medical history of intramuscular injections, we assumed at the initial examination that his clinical presentation and laboratory abnormalities were related to the more common iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency, since glucocorticoid is often used for these injections. However, the patient did not show clinical features of any glucocorticoid excesses, such as easy bruising or cushingoid appearance, and his degree of hyponatremia was relatively severe. We performed brain MRI to rule out causes of central hypopituitarism, such as tumors. No abnormalities were detected on the MRI scan (). Prompt glucocorticoid replacement improved the patient's clinical symptoms and hyponatremia. He was maintained on a physiologic dose of glucocorticoid (prednisolone 2.5 to 5 mg). His general condition and electrolyte levels were well maintained during the replacement of physiologic doses of prednisolone. However, he exhibited no recovery regarding basal cortisol and ACTH levels during the long-term follow up period (>1 year), during which he received no glucocorticoid administration except for physiologic doses of prednisolone in the mornings.",

His case was complicated by a history of medication nonadherence resulting in multiple psychiatric admissions. Prior to this admission, he was seen in the mental health clinic where he was noted to be stable on lithium ER tablets 1800 mg daily aside from a hand tremor. A lithium concentration was obtained after this visit and resulted at 2.3 mEq/L; the basic metabolic panel was within normal limits with estimated glomerular filtration rate of 90.2 mL/min stable from baseline. The lithium dose was reduced to 1500 mg daily, and the patient was instructed to hold lithium for 3 days until returning to the clinic.

On neurological examination, the patient was found to be alert to person, but not to time or place. She was moving all 4 extremities without any apparent focal neurological deficit. Reflexes were normal in both upper and lower extremities. The rest of the neurological examination was limited as the patient was unable to follow commands. Cardiovascular examination showed normal S1 and S2 with no added sounds. Respiratory and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Skin examination showed chronic ulcers on the lower extremities in different stages of healing. She was also found to have scaly erythematous papules in her right axillary skin fold.\nHer family history was unremarkable. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and nonalcoholic and never used any illicit drugs. She was on levetiracetam for seizures, which she was taking as prescribed (according to the family).\nPatient was found to be in septic shock secondary to infected ureteral stents. She was admitted to the intensive care unit and her ureteral stents were removed.

    "original_text": "A 70-year-old male presented to his internal medicine primary care physician with a mass and swelling of his right testicle. Initial evaluation demonstrated a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) tests were within normal limits. He was treated empirically with antibiotics for epididymitis before the laboratory results returned. A screening testicular ultrasound demonstrated an extratesticular mass thought to be an inguinal hernia because of its reducibility on exam. Since it was reducible and he was not in pain, no further workup or surgical intervention was performed. On continued follow-up appointments with his primary care physician, he noted increasing swelling and pain at the site of the mass, prompting a repeat ultrasound. The ultrasound revealed a mild hydrocele with a large paratesticular mass of undescribed size superior to the right testicle, which was still believed to be consistent with an inguinal hernia.\nDue to the progressive testicular pain, general surgery was consulted for a right sided inguinal hernia. A preoperative CT scan demonstrated a large fat-containing inguinal hernia on the right side extending into the scrotal sac (). On physical exam the mass seemed to be reducible but was very tender to palpation. A urology consult was not obtained prior to surgery since the mass appeared to be composed of adipose tissue and was believed to be an inguinal hernia. He underwent surgery for an inguinal hernia repair, and a prolene hernia system mesh was placed in the preperitoneal space covering the entire myopectineal orifice for a small indirect inguinal hernia.

She was referred to the Department of Surgery of our hospital from a family practice because of suspected ileus.

In the preceding 2 months, she had had a history of paralytic ileus and had undergone ileo-ileo anastomosis. She did not have any tenderness but had lower abdominal pain during the physical examination. The patient's serum white blood cell count was 18,200/mm3. Other laboratory tests of the renal function, including serum blood urea nitrogen of 17.0 mg/dl and serum creatinine of 0.8 mg/dl, and urinalysis results were within normal limitations. There was no clear evidence of the presence of ureteral stones or ureteral tumors on abdominal CT imaging. The left lower part of the ureter was serpentine in shape and had been shifted to the outside of the cavum pelvis minor, with herniation into the greater sciatic foramen (fig. ). Using a cystoscope, we observed that the left ureteric orifice was pulled away from the bladder wall to the outside and seemed to form a diverticulum. The shadow of a mass was observed on retrograde pyelography. Constriction in the serpentine lower part of the ureter and the outside of the cavum pelvis minor was also observed; the distal ureter was straining the ureteric orifice (fig. ). The patient was diagnosed as having left ureterosciatic hernia on the basis of the symptoms mentioned above. Retrograde left ureteral stenting was performed, which linearized the ureter, eliminated the mass, and reduced the constriction of the left ureteric orifice (fig. ). It was confirmed that the hernia vesicle had been fixed by doing a CT and retrograde pyelography. There is, however, a risk of recurrence. Therefore",

At the time of presentation, she was primigravid at 18 weeks and six days of gestation according to her last menstrual period. The pregnancy was a planned conception occurring within three months of marriage. The pregnancy was confirmed with a positive urine pregnancy test. Further questioning about menstrual history revealed cycles of four to five days every 28 to 30 days. Past medical, surgical or family history was unremarkable. On physical examination, she was alert and pale with a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg and a pulse of 80 beats/minute. Her abdomen was soft, non-tender with a 32-week fundal height. A speculum examination revealed no active bleeding or discharge; the os was closed. Apart from the elicited anemic signs, the remainder of the physical examination findings were within normal limits. An ultrasound examination revealed a single live fetus of 18 weeks and two days in duration (Figures -). We also noted a partial mole indicated by mass resembling a bunch of grapes and measuring 19 cm by 8 cm. The molar vascularity was insignificant on the Doppler evaluation. We ordered additional investigations through our hospital\u2019s designated laboratory.\nAt 20 weeks of gestation, a repeat ultrasound revealed a single live fetus of 20 weeks duration with no gross fetal anomaly. A large mass with multiple short cysts was noted in the fundal region at the site of the placenta. We also noted evidence of a partial mole in the anterior fundal region of the uterus measuring 19.7 cm by 10.9 cm, bulging into the amniotic cavity and compressing the fetus.

He had undergone cardiac catheterization and stent placement 4 years ago and continued on anti-platelet therapy with aspirin and Plavix. Two years prior to current presentation, he underwent work-up for melanotic stools with upper, lower and capsule endoscopy. He was diagnosed at that time with duodenitis, attributed to Arcoxia, a COX-2 inhibitor he had been prescribed for treatment of gouty arthritis, with likely synergistic effect due to concomitant aspirin intake. Past surgical history was notable for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy earlier this year with resultant 35 kilogram weight loss.\nHis current presentation was marked by intermittent melanotic stools, fall in hemoglobin to a low of 7.3 g/dl and orthostatic symptoms. He was resuscitated and required a blood transfusion. Nasogastric tube placement did not reveal evidence of bleeding. Further work-up included upper and lower endoscopy which failed to reveal the source of bleeding. Capsule endoscopy, however, showed active bleeding localized to the jejunum, which prompted small bowel enteroscopy, which failed to show pathology to a depth of 160 cm. This was followed by double balloon enterosopy to a depth of 2m reaching the ileum. Again, this was negative for any responsible lesions. At this time, we elected to perform CTA of the abdomen both to exclude a mass lesion and attempt to localize a possible AVM. Of note, the patient was not experiencing any active bleeding at this time.\nIn the selected cut from his CTA (Figure \n), an ectatic, antimesenteric blood vessel was noted adjacent to a loop of jejunum in the left side of the abdomen. This appeared to be an anomalous AVM as evidenced by early filling of an associated vein on arterial phase. Also notable was the finding of replaced left and right hepatic arteries. Given the CTA findings, he was referred for angioembolization.",

PTCD is a rare brainstem malformation characterized by the pontine tegmentum projecting into the fourth ventricle, ventral pontine, and cerebellar vermal hypoplasia.[ To the best of our knowledge, <50 cases of PTCD have been reported in the literature so far.[ Patients with this condition suffer from several cranial and extracranial abnormalities, pyramidal and cerebellar malformations, and various cranial nerves dysfunctions (VIII cranial nerve is always involved, whereas V, VI and VII cranial nerves are variably involved). The main symptoms and signs include auditory deficits, cognitive impairment, ataxia, deglutition dysfunction, abnormalities of eye movements, variable deficiency of the trigeminal nerve, and other neurological dysfunctions. The treatment and prognosis depend on the range and severity of symptoms and aim to improve the quality of life of these patients.[\nThe patient was referred to our hospital for the first time in January 2014 for visual disturbances and redness of the left eye. He suffered from marked developmental delay, ataxia, bilateral hypoacusia, and bilateral corneal severe hypoaesthesia. At this visit, eye movements were normal. Facial expression was also normal and eyelid closure during sleep had been satisfactory. Visual acuity could not be determined due to the patient's mental state and lack of cooperation. Slit-lamp examination revealed a corneal epithelial defect with fluorescein staining in the right eye, and a corneal ulcer with stromal melting in the left eye. A cotton wisp that was used to qualitatively assess corneal sensitivity showed no blinking response in any eye. Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometry was impossible to perform due to the patient's lack of cooperation. Amniotic membrane transplantation was performed in the left eye 5 days after the first examination.

The physical exam of the ocular globe was not possible due to the large hematoma that hindered opening the eyelid. The exploration of right eye was normal. Therefore, the skin wound was initially sutured with a polypropylene 5/0 interrupted suture and an orbital computed tomography (CT scan) and skull X-ray were performed.

She had undergone Halsted surgery and postoperative radiation therapy with cobalt-60 (30 Gray) and megavoltage X-rays (30 Gray) 25 years earlier. Following the treatment, her left upper limb became completely paralyzed.\nSix years earlier, she had sustained a left clavicle fracture due to osteonecrosis, and she had subsequently developed a chronic cutaneous fistula measuring 1 cm in diameter. The fracture and cutaneous fistula failed to heal, and she experienced bleeding from the fistula since 1 year. Two months before visiting our hospital, she was hospitalized in the Department of Breast Surgery at another hospital for massive bleeding and local infection. She was treated with antibiotics and cleansing of the fistula and the infection subsided 2 months thereafter. She visited our hospital after discharge.\nAt initial examination, her height was 153 cm and weight was 34 kg. Necrosed clavicle was exposed through the 6-cm-wide skin defect in the left clavicular region, and air entered and exited the opening from deep within the chest while breathing (Fig. ). Computed tomography (CT) revealed the part of the first to third left ribs, part of the left clavicle, the subclavian artery, and the brachial plexus to be missing. Her upper left limb was nourished by retrograde blood flow from the thoracodorsal artery; however, blood flow was weak to the skin of the arm, the surface of which was cold, resulting in complete paralysis of the upper extremity. Several rounds of debridement eliminated the necrotic tissue, and the local infection was completely resolved.

After obtaining the patient's informed consent, a radical resection of left upper pulmonary carcinoma and mediastinal lymph node dissection by thoracotomy were performed. Histopathologic examination showed a 2.0 \u00d7 1.5 cm middle to well differentiated adenocarcinoma in left upper lobe (Fig. C). Eighteen resected lymph nodes were detected and were all negative. The patient did not undergo postoperative chemotherapy. However, in November 2012, B ultrasound revealed a left axillary lymph node enlargement and the chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple nodules on the left pleural, both were considered to be metastases at first. After obtaining the patient's informed consent, a resection of the enlarged left axillary lymph node was performed. Histopathologic examination showed a metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (Fig. D). The patient was initially treated with cisplatin, pemetrexed disodium, and bevacizumab with good response. In March 2013, molecular (EGFR/ALK) testing using FISH was carried out on tissue procured from the enlarged left axillary lymph node. The patient was found to be ALK-positive with EGFR wild-type and crizotinib was therefore administered orally at a dose of 250 mg twice a day. The treatment was well tolerated and CT of the thorax revealed a good response that the number and the size of all the lesions did not increase. After 2 years of crizotinib therapy, however, the patient got a headache and cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple lesions in the brain which were considered to be metastases at first (Fig. A and C). Considering the disease progressed, the treatment of crizotinib was eventually discontinued.

Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed no traumatic lesions such as skull fracture, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or brain contusion, but a 19 mm mass lesion was identified at the base of the right frontal lobe. CT angiography and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed a right anterior cerebral artery aneurysm with a dome measuring 19.0 \u00d7 14.7 mm and a neck 4.7 mm in diameter []. Neurological examination showed no signs of ocular symptoms. Three months later, she was readmitted to our hospital due to progressive right visual field defect and cognitive impairment. The right visual acuity had decreased significantly (from 0.3 to 0.01) compared to 3 months earlier, and only the paracentral region of the visual field was preserved. Contrast-enhanced CT, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and DSA revealed that the aneurysm had grown to 24.0 \u00d7 20.7 mm and was partially thrombosed, and also showed edema of the optic chiasm/ tract and frontal lobe, and ischemia of the perforator area. The aneurysmal wall was slightly enhanced [].\nThe aneurysm was approached under an interhemispheric approach. Since the aneurysm was hard and could not be directly clipped due to thrombosis, A3-A3 in situ bypass and trapping were performed. The anteroinferior part of the aneurysm was adherent to the anterior skull base, and multiple microvessels were seen bridging between the aneurysm wall and dura mater [].

A neurological examination revealed dysarthria and right-sided hemiplegia and hypesthesia. A blood test revealed chronic anemia (Hb level 9.0 g/dl; the total iron-binding capacity and red cell width were normal). His blood, sputum and stool cultures were negative; a rectal examination did not reveal melena or diarrhea; an electrocardiography demonstrated a normal sinus rhythm.

    "original_text": "The patient was an 11-year-old boy with no notable medical or family history. For about 3 months, he had occasional general malaise, headaches, and vomiting. The patient then began to complain of difficulty in turning his neck and was referred to an orthopedic clinic. No abnormalities were detected in the head and neck in the computed tomographic (CT) images and the magnetic resonance images (MRIs). In addition, all hematological tests were within the normal limits.\nAfter 1 month, the patient had a transient reduction in vision, and when his vision worsened in both eyes, the patient was brought to an ophthalmologist. At the initial examination, his visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye. The intraocular pressure of the right and left eyes was 19 and 20 mm Hg, respectively. No clear differences in the pupillary light reflexes of the right and left eyes were found. A relative afferent pupillary defect was not present. The anterior segment of the eye was normal, but ophthalmoscopy showed a marked swelling of the optic disc and severe retinal exudates in both eyes (fig. ).\nThe patient was admitted for comprehensive examinations on the same day. Physical and hematological abnormalities were not found. Head X-rays showed dehiscence of the coronal suture, which suggested intracranial hypertension. MRI showed no space-occupying lesions in the brain, but did show tortuous optic nerves, enlarged spinal fluid cavity, and flattened posterior sclera (fig. ). MR venography did not show clear signs of a sinus thrombosis. Cerebrospinal tap demonstrated a marked increase in the cerebrospinal pressure with an opening pressure of 350\u2013500 mm H2O, but the cerebrospinal fluid contents were normal.\nBased on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with IHH, and acetazolamide, concentrated glycerin, and steroid were injected intravenously. Initially, the intracranial pressure decreased after the treatment, but after 1 month, the intracranial hypertension and symptoms did not improved",

A karyotype revealed abnormal results, 46,XX,del (7)(q32-q34). The patient's mother had a normal karyotype and her father remains unavailable for testing but is not known to have any features similar to the patient; her deletion is presumed to be de novo based on its large size.

The patient has continued to experience multiple upper respiratory infections, recurrent otitis media, and urinary tract infections. Immunology work-up was normal; therefore the patient is not suspected of having a primary immunodeficiency.
