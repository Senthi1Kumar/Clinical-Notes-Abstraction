However, this did not ameliorate his respiratory status, so we switched to respiratory management with intratracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit.

After going through various intestinal rehabilitation surgical options, jejunal interposition was decidedly acceptable as the best procedure for the patient.\nA 10 cm segment of jejunum measuring ~20 cm distal to the stoma was identified.

She presented to us with lower abdominal pain, fever, loose stools, and intermittent rectal bleeding. Her blood picture revealed low hemoglobin of 8 gm/dl, increased white cell count of 14000 cells per cubic millimeter, normal platelet count, and normal prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen showed pelvic collection with an air pocket and thickened sigmoid colon (Figure ). Colonoscopy was performed as she had persistent bleeding per rectum with low hemoglobin and it showed multiple colonic mucosal hemorrhages and a fistulous opening in the sigmoid colon, probably an iatrogenic perforation which happened during prior laparoscopic cyst aspiration. She was planned for computed tomography (CT) guided drainage of the pelvic collection under platelet cover as she was hemodynamically stable and the CT showed only localised collection.

She was known to have mild gross motor developmental delay diagnosed several months before; caregivers stated that she pulled to stand but did not cruise or walk and babbled but did not have any words. She had no additional past medical history or previous surgeries and no known previous trauma. Upon presentation, the adoptive parents with whom she has lived since very early in her life provided the history. Adoptive parents reported about 2 weeks of fussiness and decreased ability to bear weight on her lower extremities. Parents denied any known trauma at that time. Her weight was <3rd percentile with a Z score of \u22123.36. She was thin appearing but without signs of dehydration or malnourishment. Examination was notable for 0/5 strength, hypotonia, and areflexia in the bilateral lower extremities as well as hypotonia of the trunk. In addition, she was found to have significant head lag and very severe thoracic kyphosis or gibbus deformity. The patient was first evaluated by outpatient urology after referral from the primary care office for urinary retention. A renal ultrasound was performed and was notable for bilateral moderate hydronephrosis and bladder distension. She was sent to the emergency department for further workup. Laboratory studies in the emergency department yielded normal creatinine for age at 0.3 mg/dl, and urine culture obtained by in and out bladder catheterization grew >100,000 CFU/mL of Enterococcus faecalis. Complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were unremarkable, and thyroid stimulating hormone was within normal range. The patient's creatinine kinase was >1200 U/L, six times the upper limit of normal. Spinal CT demonstrated complete retrospondylolisthesis of T12 vertebra (). MRI was also performed and showed marked compression of the spinal cord resulting in inability to visualize the cord at the level to T12",

The patient remained asymptomatic until he was diagnosed with a sigmoid cancer on the basis of surveillance colonoscopy 5 years after the primary event. Following histological confirmation and staging with contrast-enhanced computed tomography, he was scheduled for laparotomy with subtotal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis. During surgery, several loops of bowel were found to be tightly adherent to the anterior abdominal wall. On palpation, a hard, elongated mass was felt inside one of the bowel loops in the proximal ileum.

The visual acuity was 6/9 and counting fingers (two feet) in the right and left eyes, respectively. Intraocular pressure was 16 and 14 mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively. The right eye was normal. The left eye anterior segment showed corneal endothelial dusting, 3+ anterior chamber cells, moderate flare, and pigment on anterior lens surface. Fundus evaluation of the left eye showed dense vitritis with vitreous membranes and a submacular abscess []. There was no history of ocular trauma or surgery. There was history of hospitalization and intravenous infusion of normal saline for fever and dehydration 1 month ago. There were no features suggestive of any systemic illness. With a probable diagnosis of contaminated intravenous infusion-related EE of the left eye, the patient was admitted for systemic workup. Systemic examination by an internist did not reveal any focus of infection, and the patient was afebrile. Complete blood counts and liver and renal function tests were within normal limits, and blood and urine cultures were sterile. A diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) was performed in the left eye with intravitreal amphotericin B (5 \u03bcg/0.1 ml) + dexamethasone (400 \u03bcg/0.1 ml). The vitreous fluid samples were sent for bacterial and fungal smears and cultures. The potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount of vitreous sample revealed septate hyphae with branching at acute angles, and the panfungal polymerase chain reaction was positive [Fig. and ]. Oral itraconazole 200 mg BD was started.

He had no family history and had developed multiple neurofibromas and caf\u00e9-au-lait spots on his body (Figure ). He underwent surgical treatment for a growing tumor (details are unknown) on the posterior surface of his right thigh at another hospital in April 1982, and was referred to our institution because of regrowth of the tumor in October 1990. Wide resection was performed in November 1990 (Figure ). The histological diagnosis was MPNST developed on a background of NF1, and he received adjuvant chemotherapy. Since 1990, the patient has had repeated local recurrences (7 times, until May 2003) and has received surgical treatment for each recurrent tumor. In December 2003, the patient presented with a skin tumor of the head, and the lesion was resected. The histological diagnosis was MPNST that arose in a neurofibroma of the head skin. Two years later, the right leg was amputated at the hip joint because of local recurrence of the leg lesion, with aggressive growth and rupture. Computed tomography (CT) performed in August 2005 showed multiple lung lesions, suggestive of tumor metastases. Some of the lung lesions were resected surgically in January 2006 and diagnosed histologically as MPNST metastases. After the operation, he developed new lung metastases. In May 2007, he was admitted to our institution with sudden dyspnea and palpitations. Echocardiography revealed an enlarged heart and cardiac effusion, which did not suggest cardiac tamponade. Magnetic resonance imaging showed the presence of a large tumor (9 cm) in the inferior-posterior wall of the heart (Figure ). CT revealed an infarction of the inferior lobe of the left lung, which was derived from tumor emboli.

The patient's previous medical history revealed alcoholic liver cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus. Also, he had undergone transarterial chemoembolization with adriamycin three times in the past because of hepatocellular carcinoma in segment 8 with minimal portal vein thrombosis, as well as balloon occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration and/or endoscopic variceal band ligation six times, because of gastric and esophageal variceal bleeding. At the time of admission, his Child-Turcotte-Pugh score was 10 points (grade C), and his model for end-stage liver disease score was 9.0 points. Preoperative computed tomography revealed portomesenteric thrombosis from the portal vein to the proximal superior mesenteric vein with complete luminal obstruction, and venous collateral flow was not prominent (). The segment of portomesenteric thrombus was about 6.8 cm and the IMV had no thrombosis. The donor was a 56-year-old male who had brain death due to traumatic cerebral hemorrhage.\nDuring exploration for recipient hepatectomy, portal venous flow was not detected by intraoperative doppler ultrasound and venous collateral flow was not prominent. Mechanical thrombectomy and low dissection of the portal vein was performed, and the portal venous inflow was improved. After the liver graft was placed in the recipient's abdomen, the donor's inferior vena cava was anastomosed to the recipient's inferior vena cava by applying the piggy-back technique. Then, the portal vein of the recipient was anastomosed to the graft portal vein in an end_ to_ end fashion. Although the graft was recovered from ischemia after reperfusion, portal blood flow decreased gradually over a few minutes. Although repeated mechanical thrombectomy with portal venotomy was executed, the portal inflow did not improve.

An initial ultrasound scan of his urinary tract revealed right-sided hydronephrosis. A further computed tomography of kidneys, ureters, and bladder scan revealed dilatation of the ureter up to the vesicoureteric junction with an associated tight stricture (\n). He subsequently had a right rigid ureteroscopy, ureteric biopsy, and ureteric stent insertion. The initial histology was reported as transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter. No neuroendocrine markers were performed at the time, as the tumor did not show any classical signs of a carcinoid tumor or a well-differentiated small cell carcinoma. As demonstrated later, the histology revealed an atypical carcinoid pattern. Further imaging of his chest did not reveal distant metastases and this man underwent a right laparoscopic nephroureterectomy and open excision of bladder cuff.\nMacroscopically, the ureter showed a tumor obstructing the lumen toward its distal end, covering a length of \u223c18 mm and the resection margin was clear by at least 4 mm. Microscopy of the ureteric specimen revealed a positive immunohistochemical stain with CD56, a common neuroendocrine marker (\n). Staining with other neuroendocrine markers was weakly positive (\nand\n). The tumor was of intermediate to high grade, with a high Ki-67 proliferation index of 25 to 30% (\n). Associated carcinoma in situ (CIS) was not seen. There was no definite lymphovascular invasion. The tumor infiltrated through the muscle into the periureteric fat (T3). The background kidney displayed patchy lymphocytic infiltrates in keeping with mild interstitial nephritis. There was no tumor infiltration into the kidney.

Echocardiography showed global hypokinesia with LV ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45% and LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) of 57 mm. A coronary angiogram showed no significant coronary artery disease.

An epicardial scar at the posterolateral basal part of the LV also was identified. Subsequently, a single-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was implanted. A second electrophysiologic study was performed as described above and a posterolateral basal scar on the epicardium of the LV was identified, with evidence for E-DCs and two channels going through the scar tissue: one close and parallel to the mitral annulus and the other more apical (). The RF ablation of the first channel was successful and uneventful as there was no PN capture.

Following the surgical procedure, the pregnant woman underwent a gynaecological examination monitored by a team of obstetricians. The obstetric and ultrasound findings were normal. From the medical history, it was established that the pregnant woman had a congenital agenesis of her left kidney and her left Fallopian tube, and that she underwent a surgery for an inguinal hernia on the left side in her childhood. When the patient was 16, an adnexectomy on her right side was performed, and the diagnosis of unicornuate uterus was set during the surgical procedure.

On the day when the incision was made, the pregnant woman was brought by an ambulance to the emergency maternity outpatient clinic due to abdominal pain. Upon admission, laboratory workup was performed; from the findings: E 4.4; Hb 112, Hct 0.348; L 16.1; T 204; CRP 3.6. A foetal bradycardia 60/min and free fluid in the abdominal cavity were determined by an ultrasound. Given the above, it was decided to complete the pregnancy by an emergency Caesarean section, so an alive premature female infant weighting 2510 g and 45 cm in length, Apgar score 4/7, was born by a breech extraction. During the surgical procedure, a surgeon was called due to abundant fresh bleeding from the upper portion of the abdomen. Because of the necessary exploration of the complete abdomen, the incision was extended to the median portion up to the xiphoid. Abdominal and pelvic organs were exposed, and venous bleeding was found in the hilum of the spleen. Haemostasis was established by placing sutures on venae gastricae breves.

He initially presented with weakness and numbness of the lower extremities. He had been using intravenous heroin and was lying supine on a floor for approximately 24 hours.\nUpon presentation to our emergency department, the patient had pain in his bilateral lower extremities and no appreciable motor function below the level of the knee. He was in mild distress with a temperature of 37\u00b0C, pulse of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 146/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Examination of the lower extremities revealed erythema and tension in the bilateral posterior thigh compartments. In contrast, the medial thigh compartments bilaterally along with all four leg compartments were soft. Gluteal and buttock compartments were soft and compressible bilaterally. Motor strength testing revealed 1/5 strength bilaterally with manual testing of ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, and knee flexion and extension. The patient was found to have bilateral sciatic nerve palsies, with no sensation bilaterally in the tibial nerve, deep and superficial peroneal nerve distributions. Both legs were warm and pink with brisk capillary refill along with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. Provocative testing demonstrated pain with passive range of motion of the knees bilaterally and no pain with passive ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Lab work was significant for a creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) of 231,360 U/L.\nGiven the high suspicion for compartment syndrome, the patient underwent compartment pressure testing via Stryker pressure monitor system. Diastolic blood pressure recording measured 75 mmHg. The right posterior thigh compartment measured 75 mmHg and left posterior thigh compartment measured 30 mmHg. Based on the history and physical examination findings, the patient was diagnosed with bilateral thigh compartment syndrome likely secondary to his recent IVDA",

She presented to us with lower abdominal pain, fever, loose stools, and intermittent rectal bleeding. Her blood picture revealed low hemoglobin of 8 gm/dl, increased white cell count of 14000 cells per cubic millimeter, normal platelet count, and normal prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen showed pelvic collection with an air pocket and thickened sigmoid colon (Figure ).

At the end of few months of urinary diversion, he had undergone urethral repair using abdominoperineal approach. Ten years following surgery, he was able to pass urine but he continued to dribble all the time. He had been on several modalities of medical management with no benefit. On examination, he had an abdominal and perineal scar of previous operation and deformed and scarred penile skin due to chronic use of condom catheter, leading to some tourniquet effect.\nThe renal function tests, urine routine, microscopy, and culture were normal. Ultrasound of the urinary tract revealed normal upper tracts and no post void residue. The post-operative micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) done 10 years after repair, revealed a normal capacity bladder. There was urinary leak at 200 ml, no vesicoureteric reflux, absence of urethral stricture, and no post void residual urine. Voiding cystometry showed that he had normal capacity stable bladder with leak at 200 ml and detrusor pressures in normal range []. On cystoscopy, the anastomotic site at posterior urethra at the junction of bulbar and prostatic urethra was identified and admitted 9F resectoscope with ease. The bladder mucosa was normal and the bladder neck was not closing adequately on withdrawal of the cystoscope into urethra.\nAfter detailed evaluation, he was put on conservative management for incontinence with a trial of anticholinergics, clean intermittent catheterization, pelvic floor exercises, and timed voiding for 6 weeks. The urinary leak persisted without any improvement.

History revealed that the swelling started as a small lesion and gradually grew in size. There was no toothache or pain associated with it, but as the size increased there was trauma from the mandibular anterior teeth causing ulceration and pain in the swelling. There was no history of any discharge from the swelling. The patient had nasal stuffiness and seromucous discharge from the nose on the left side since 15 days, which did not respond to medications.\nOn examination, a single well-circumscribed swelling was seen on the anterior hard palate, ovoid in shape, measuring about 3 cm in greatest diameter, with the surface color resembling that of normal mucosa, margins were well defined and the swelling crossed the midline on the left side with surface ulceration []. On palpation there was slight tenderness, the swelling was firm in consistency, sessile, attached to the underlying bone, not yielding to pressure, non-fluctuant and non-reducible. Fine-needle aspiration cytology was done, but no aspirate was obtained. Correlating the history and clinical features, a provisional diagnosis of a malignant soft tissue neoplasm was made.\nAntral carcinoma, malignant neoplasm of the salivary glands, lymphoma, sarcoma and malignant melanoma were considered in the differential diagnosis. Because the site was anterior part of the hard palate where salivary glands are absent and due to the mucosal color of the swelling, salivary gland neoplasm and malignant melanoma were ruled out.

    "original_text": "A right-hand-dominant 29-year-old man was employed in a car repair shop and was assigned the work of tightening screws of tires using torque wrenches. Three months after starting this work, he felt right shoulder pain during shoulder motion. He changed his job to light labor in the next month and stopped all sports activities. Nevertheless, his shoulder pain lasted for a further 6 months during his daily activities. He visited our department complaining of right shoulder pain 10 months after his first episode. He had no relevant medical history and no history of trauma to the shoulder girdles.\nThe patient was 168 cm tall and weighed 100 kg. Physical examination showed the absence of swelling and tenderness in his right shoulder, and there was no restriction of range of shoulder motion. However, shoulder pain was induced during shoulder internal rotation in the abducted and flexed shoulder position. Because of the severe pain, he was restricted from sports activities and heavy labor. His American Shoulder and Elbow score was 63.3 points.\nPlain radiograms showed a radiolucent lesion on the medial aspect of the right humeral head []. Computerized tomography (CT) scans also showed the 2-cm lucent lesion in the humeral head surrounded by osteosclerotic changes, whereas its subchondral bone appeared to keep its continuity above the lucent lesion []. On T2-weighted images of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an osteochondral fragment at the medial aspect was separated from the humeral head with the continuation of the articular cartilage [].

Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a nodule with a diameter of 15 mm in the left upper lobe. Pathologic study of a specimen obtained by transbronchial biopsy showed small cell lung cancer. Positron emission tomography and brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a clinical stage of T1N0M0 as categorized by the 7th edition of the union for international cancer control (UICC) classification.\nThoracoscopic left upper lobectomy was performed. The common trunk of the left pulmonary vein was misidentified as a superior pulmonary vein until incidental transection with an endostapler during port access surgery. The caliber change between the common trunk and the inferior pulmonary vein was marked. Thoracoscopic surgery was converted to open thoracotomy. The left upper bronchus and pulmonary arteries to the left upper lobe were transected with endostaplers, and the common trunk of the pulmonary vein was left intact. The left main pulmonary artery was then clamped under intravenous heparin injection to achieve an activated coagulation time of 200 s. Annuloplasty of the inferior pulmonary vein was completed during intermittent declamping of the left pulmonary artery. The orifice of the inferior pulmonary vein was augmented by a cuff technique using an orifice of the superior pulmonary vein, as shown in Fig. . The staples on the stump of the left common pulmonary vein on the atrial side were removed to adjust the augmented orifice of the left inferior pulmonary vein under partial clamping of the left atrium following pericardiectomy. End-to-end anastomosis was completed using running sutures with a 4-0 polypropylene thread. The anticoagulant therapy was continued until 2 months after surgery. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 14.

The mass was first discovered during regular examination in a local hospital five years ago. Ultrasound showed a 4.24 \u00d7 2.63 cm hypoechoic nodule in the right lobe of the liver. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a well-circumscribed oval mass with low density in segment 6 of the liver. Enhanced CT indicated that the mass was heterogenous with obvious enhancement in the margin and a hemangioma was suspected. The patient underwent regular examination in the following four years and the mass was growing slowly. In January 2020, enhanced CT revealed a much larger mass with the maximum diameter of 7.8 cm in the space between segment 6 of the liver and right adrenal gland (Fig. ). The margin displayed apparent enhancement in arterial phase, but hypointensity in portal and delayed phase compared with the surrounding liver tissue. A primary liver malignancy was suspected by clinicians. During the follow-up time, the patient was asymptomatic. In blood tests, the patient was negative for serum hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus, and was positive for hepatitis B surface antibody.

On anamnesis, the patient reported rapid weight loss, drug use for more than 10 years, and the development of a hard palate lesion three years earlier, which was left untreated. In addition, the patient reported the development of a soft palate lesion one month earlier. Intraorally, an extensive mass of mucosa-like color was present in the palate region, which obstructed the oropharynx and consequently caused dyspnea.\nThe sagittal computed tomography (CT) image reveals a soft tissue mass in the nasal cavity extending to the posterior portion of the nasopharynx and the lower part of the sphenoid sinus, with lowering of the entire musculature of the soft palate (A). The coronal CT image shows density loss of the septum in the nasal cavity and nasal conchae, maxillary sinus opacification, and lesion extending to the sphenoid cavity floor (B). The axial CT image reveals the soft tissue mass observed in the nasal cavity with opacification of the maxillary sinuses (C).\nAfter the initial examinations, the patient was submitted to tracheostomy (A) and intraoral incisional biopsy under general anesthesia (B). Intraoperatively, the tumor had a fibrous consistency and showed normal bleeding. The specimen was sent for histopathological analysis (A). Microscopically, the presence of a densely collagenated connective tissue was observed, with numerous blood vessels that were usually of small caliber and sometimes congestive; also, foci of hemosiderosis were visible (B).

On clinical examination, she had abdominal distension and mild generalized tenderness without peritoneal signs. The rectal examination was unremarkable. Hemoccult blood was negative. A contrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed mild atelectasis in the lung bases, moderate distension of the gall bladder, and an apple core lesion in the distal descending colon measuring 3.4 cm long resulting in prominent dilation of the colon and small bowel proximal to this lesion. The colon distal to the lesion was not distended. There was also mild ascites. All laboratories including her basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, complete blood count, \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were within normal limits. She was started on pantoprazole and enoxaparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis after an active bleeding was ruled out. A nasogastric tube was placed, but there was no fluid obtained. A flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed which revealed an obstructive mass that made evaluation of the colon above the mass impossible. Multiple biopsies were taken and displayed features that resembled adenocarcinoma of the colon.\nShe underwent surgical exploration. Intraoperative findings revealed an indurated, thick, obstructive lesion in the descending colon which was edematous but without perforation. A partial colectomy with end to end anastomosis was done.\nThe surgery and postoperative course were uneventful. The histologic examination was consistent with colonic adenocarcinoma, with no perineural or vascular invasion noted.

Microscopic examination of the specimen revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the rectum with adequate resection margins and no metastases in the 16 resected lymph nodes. By World Health Organisation classification, this was a T3N0 M0 tumor.\nThe immediate postoperative course was uneventful. On the fourth postoperative day, the patient developed abdominal pain and dyspnea.
