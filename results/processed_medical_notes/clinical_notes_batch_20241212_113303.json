Apgar scores were 4, 5, 5, and 8 at one, five, ten and fifteen minutes respectively.

On these settings he had a tachypnoea of 90 breaths per minute with mildly increased respiratory effort and a pre-ductal oxygen saturation of \u226597%. A capillary blood gas excluded respiratory or metabolic acidosis. Empiric antibiotics benzylpenicillin and gentamicin were commenced to cover the risk of sepsis due to the prolonged rupture of membranes. Chest x-rays at 2 and 4 h of life showed crescent shaped homogeneous opacities in both upper lung fields (Fig. ). The Neonatal and Paediatric Emergency Transport Service (NETS) was consulted. Initial paediatric radiological advice via telemedicine was that this appearance could represent bilateral pleural effusions. Accordingly the PEEP was increased to 8cmH2O; lateral decubitus x-ray (not shown) was uninformative. Due to the uncertainty regarding the cause of the respiratory distress the baby was transferred to the local neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) by NETS at 10 h of postnatal life.\nA progress CXR at just under 13 h of age was still inconclusive. However a lateral decubitus film performed concurrently demonstrated air anterior to the mediastinum, consistent with a diagnosis of pneumomediastinum (Fig. ); all respiratory support was therefore ceased.

This sequence of exercises was performed repeatedly until fatigue was observed, at which point, a complete hamstring relaxation had occurred.

The patient had a history of seawater contact in August 2015, including underwater diving near the coast of the Yellow Sea near Qingdao City, Shandong Province. After a couple of days, the patient noticed a small volume of clear drainage from both ears, accompanied by mild discomfort and ear pruritus. As the condition progressed, drainage from the left ear gradually vanished within half a month, whereas the drainage from the right side increased and became a thick, purulent exudate containing debris, eventually turning a dark brown or chocolate color. As the ear canal became almost entirely obstructed by the thick excretion, the patient experienced mild hearing loss, coupled with intermittent tinnitus, and experienced a sensation of ear fullness. Without the use of any medications, he removed debris from the right ear using cotton swabs, resulting in a return to normal hearing and the relief of symptoms. Within a few days, new thick drainage would obstruct the ear canal, and the symptoms would reappear. The patient sought health care twice at local hospitals in Xi\u2019an City from Shaanxi Province; however, the underlying illness remained unidentified and did not improve. The discharge from the right ear gradually reduced and turned from brown to white until March 2018, when a low-concentration hydrogen peroxide solution was used to rinse the right ear canal at a local hospital. During the course of the illness, the patient denied any accompanying symptoms, such as fever, chills, headache, vertigo, diarrhea, or flatulence, and he did not have a history of infectious diseases, diabetes, or any immunocompromising condition.

When he tried to touch his ear with his left hand, he touched his cheek or mouth instead. After 1 hour, he went outside to see his sister. To avoid tilting to the left, he had to lean against the wall on his left side while he was standing, and his sister pulled his right arm rightward while he walked. These symptoms gradually improved but did not disappear, therefore he visited our hospital on the following day. He was neurologically well until the onset of the aforementioned symptoms, and neither vestibular nor cochlear symptoms had manifested during these 2 days.\nAt his initial visit (on day 2), he was neurologically normal except for body lateropulsion. Although he could walk and stand without assistance, he could not stand on one foot because of a tendency to tilt to the left. The forearm stepping test produced results in the normal range with a tendency to rotate toward the left. He reported numbness in his left fingers, especially the fingertips, but neither superficial nor deep sensory impairment was objectively detected. He was a current smoker and drank alcohol daily. Other than atopic dermatitis, his medical history was unremarkable. With the exception of his triglyceride level (209 mg/dL), his clinical laboratory values, including immunological test results, were in the normal range. No lesion was detected on 1.5-tesla diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI with a section thickness of 3 mm.

Cervical computed tomography (CT) showed a destructive and compressive lesion in the C4 vertebra corpus (Fig. ). The retropulsion caused by compression had narrowed the canal. The lesion was also seen to be completely wrapped around the vertebral foramen at the right C4 level and to extend to the lateral mass posteriorly in the axial sections on CT (Fig. ).

In this case, the tumor was located at the regions 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 and invaded all the layers except the dura mater. Corpectomy was performed to the C4 vertebra with an anterior approach together with discectomy to the upper and lower disc spaces during surgery.

He sustained an open right tibia-fibula fracture and then underwent right, above-knee, popliteal-to-posterior-tibial-artery bypass with reversed left great saphenous vein graft, right lower extremity four quadrant fasciotomies, and reduction/nailing of the tibia and femoral shaft. He developed a wound infection, and wound vacs were placed on the medial and lateral fasciotomy sites. He was sent home after a 45-day hospital stay. He was discharged home with a wound vac. When he followed up one week after discharge in the Hyperbaric Medicine Clinic, it was noted that he had necrotic tissue in the lateral fasciotomy site. He was taken to the operating room twice on October 16 and October 27 to debride the necrotic tissue and further extend the fasciotomy incision. At the surgery on October 27, the fasciotomy was extended, and debridement was to the level of the bone. There were 4 cms of exposed bone in the wound. The lateral compartment at that time measured 23 cm x 6 cm x 3 cm. The patient expressed considerable depression and frustration at another prolonged hospital stay; he was anxious to return home. In an effort to accelerate the granulation tissue and return the patient home as soon as possible, a VAC VeraFlo was applied on October 31. Forty milliliters of normal saline were used to irrigate the wound for ten minutes every four hours. This was the first time the VAC VeraFlo had ever been used in our hospital, and there were no established guidelines yet for instillation and dwell time. On November 5, 2014, there was 1 cm x 1.5 cms of exposed bone in the wound. On November 7, 2014, there was granulation tissue over bone.

An enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 27 mm lump on the right side of the upper mediastinum, stenosis of the superior vena cava, and dilation of surrounding collateral vessels (). We diagnosed the patient as presenting superior vena cava syndrome due to superior mediastinal tumor.\nPositron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) showed accumulation in the upper mediastinal tumor (SUVmax = 5.18), the left 1st and 4th ribs (SUVmax = 5.48), and lumbar vertebrae L1 and L2 (SUVmax = 7.64), but no hot spot in the thyroid ().

He was diagnosed with right side acoustic neuroma occupying the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). The patient's history is significant for three surgeries with the final outcome of total removal of the acoustic neuroma via CPA approaches by the neurosurgeon. The patient states that he has had pain for about 3 to 4 years and was aggravated after his last surgery. He denied having headaches.\nHe states that the pain started after the first surgery and it was initially controlled when he was started on gabapentin but has progressively worsened to what it is at this point. The pain is constant, electrical, and sharp in the distribution of the right mid face mostly at maxillary (V2) and partially at mandibular (V3).

There was 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities bilaterally. There was differential swelling of left upper extremity. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, low voltage and mild t wave inversion in V2\u2013V4 ().\nInitial CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed diffuse metastatic disease of the visualized lower chest, abdomen and pelvis including superficial soft tissues, left kidney, and probable right kidney. There was diffuse confluent adenopathy and massive right inguinal lymphadenopathy, along with pronounced diffuse anasarca. There are multiple renal masses.

Microscopically, the cyst lining consisted of various epithelial cells, mostly squamous epithelia, and the cyst wall displayed disorganized smooth muscle bundles without a neural plexus, thus confirming the diagnosis of tailgut cyst. She had been doing well after her surgery until the start of her aforementioned aggravating symptoms. Before the patient's presentation at our hospital, a percutaneous biopsy through a posterior approach yielded a poorly differenciated carcinoma specimen with focal squamous differentiation. On admission, the physical examination revealed a posterior extrinsic mass compressing the rectum, the stool was negative for blood and there were no other important findings. A barium enema study demonstrated the left-anterior displacement of the posterior wall of the rectum (). T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an irregular cystic mass measuring 6 cm in diameter within the retrorectal space and it was involving coccygeal bone and right gluteous muscle tendon (). There was no radiological evidence of extrapelvic metastasis and a whole body bone scan revealed increased bone uptake in the coccyx. The laboratory test values were normal except for a remarkable elevation in serum CEA level to 159 ng/mL (normal 0 - 5 ng/mL) and serum CA19 - 9 level to 2270 U/mL (normal 0 - 37 U/mL). The patient underwent enbloc resection of the mass and a Hartmann operation with coccygectomy and partial sacrectomy to the level of S4 through a combined abdominal/sacral approach. Upon gross examination, the specimen measured 10 \u00d7 7",

Histopathology revealed clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (cRCC), grade II, stage pT1a, with negative surgical margins. The patient was then followed up regularly.\nIn 1995, the patient had a malignant melanoma excised from the left arm. He also underwent Whipple operation in 1996 for a neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreatic head that recurred in February 2000 and partial resection of the pancreas with intraoperative irradiation of surgical bed was done.\nIn October 2000, lower cuts of the contrast-enhanced chest CT revealed a small 8 mm basolateral left pulmonary nodule and metastasectomy was performed. Histopathology revealed the first reported recurrence of the cRCC 13 years after the initial diagnosis with negative surgical margins.\nIn November 2001, the patient underwent right lobar thyroidectomy for asymmetrical thyroid enlargement revealing metastasis of the cRCC with negative surgical margins. Afterwards the patient started interferon-alpha (INF-\u03b1), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and 5-fluoruracil for 8 weeks as first- line adjuvant systemic therapy for mRCC.\nIn December 2003, brain CT for severe headache was performed, revealing a 3 \u00d7 2 cm focal metastasis in the brain, likely of cRCC type, with temporal lobe hemorrhage. The patient survived the incident and received palliative radiotherapy on this lesion in 2003, 2004, and 2005 (see ).\nIn November 2007, 20 years after the first renal tumor therapy, a 5 cm local tumor recurrence appeared at the left retroperitoneum in the contrast-enhanced CT scan.

The Babinski sign was positive on the left side. Preoperative CT/MRI showed hematoma with mixed density located at the right frontal lobe on the corona radiata level ().

Brain MRI revealed a soft tissue mass with expansion in the left Meckel\u2019s cave, measuring 22 x 16 x 12 mm (Figure ), raising concerns for a trigeminal schwannoma. She was evaluated by the neurosurgery and underwent an orbital zygomatic craniotomy and left trigeminal schwannoma resection. Pathology revealed deposition of abundant hypocellular eosinophilic material on light microscopy examination (Figure ). Congo red staining demonstrated characteristic 'apple-green birefringence' upon polarization (Figure ), consistent with diagnosis of trigeminal nerve amyloidoma. Unfortunately, no immune fluorescence or electron microscopy was done on the pathology specimen to determine the amyloid subtype. Postoperatively, the patient was referred to oncology to rule out systemic amyloid deposition.

She presented with a continuation of fever and chills, as well as tachycardia and episodic hypotension. She was noted to have mild epigastric tenderness. There was no surrounding erythema, discharge, or tenderness noted around the tunneled dialysis catheter on the right anterior chest. Initial workup showed elevated troponin and procalcitonin. Chest X-ray findings were suggestive for left lower lobe pneumonia.

Ultrasound study was performed and revealed a single fetus and adequate amniotic fluid with limited fetal measurements consistent with estimated gestational age of 17 weeks, that is, an age 2 weeks less than the estimated gestational age. Diffuse subcutaneous edema was seen, with possible multiloculated nuchal cystic hygroma. Fetal heart tones could not be detected and a three-vessel umbilical cord could not be documented.\nThe maternal history included 2 previous uncomplicated term vaginal births of children with no anomalies. Age at menarche was 13 years. The mother is a nonsmoker and she was taking supplemental vitamins. She reported no alcohol, caffeine, or illicit drug intake. She is sexually active with a single partner. Most recent cervical pap smear was approximately 4 years ago, with normal results. Prior to this pregnancy, her periods were regular and heavy. Her IgG for rubella was positive approximately at 8 weeks' gestation. The patient denied any significant family history for congenital conditions.\nBecause of fetal demise, labor was induced with misoprostol and resulted in a spontaneous vaginal delivery of a stillborn female fetus followed by spontaneous delivery of the placenta. The fetus and placenta were transferred to our institution for autopsy and placental examination.\nAt autopsy, a slightly growth-restricted previable, immature female fetus with grade 1-2 maceration and moderate-to-marked hydrops was examined. The posterior nuchal fluid accumulation was prominent. The ears were low-set and posteriorly rotated. The fingers were short bilaterally (), and the right foot showed absence of the second and third digits (). The pulmonary artery was slightly narrow, with no other cardiovascular findings.

There was no history of systemic diseases. On a regular examination at age 27 years, she was in the 8th month of pregnancy, and her obstetrician consulted us on the risk of hemorrhaging from the retinal AVMs at the time of parturition. Her BCVA was 20/12.5 in the right eye and light perception in the left eye. Exophthalmos was not found, and the ocular motility was normal. The intraocular pressures were 16 mmHg OD and 17 mmHg OS. The anterior segments and ocular media of both eyes and fundus of the right eye were within normal limits. However, severely dilated tortuous vascular loops consistent with retinal AVMs were distributed from the optic disc over all four quadrants of the left eye (Figure A). The arteries were directly connected to the veins without passing through any capillaries. The optic disc was obscured by the large vascular loops. Numerous anastomosing vessels made it difficult to separate the arterial and venous components. The vascular loops in some areas were more dilated and tortuous than 16 years earlier (Figure C). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed orbital and retro-orbital AVMs including canalicular segments of the optic nerve on the left side.

The patient was given treatment of traditional Chinese medicine at a local hospital which had no obvious effect, and then the symptoms were slowly alleviated without further treatment. And later, he noticed many instances of numbness in his both upper extremities while holding his arms long time on the table or head on his arms, which could last for several days.

The right leg weakness aggravated in the next months, which caused him to fall down the stairs once in December 2014. He was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy in his local hospital and was given therapy of Vitamin B1, cobamamide, and traditional Chinese medicine. His symptoms were slightly improved but not completely alleviated, and then he was referred to our department.\nIn neurological examination, there was weakness (2/5) in his foot back muscle groups of right lower extremity. The other muscle groups were normal (5/5). Tendon reflexes were decreased in all the extremities. Hypalgesia in his right lateral leg and 1.5 left ulnaral fingers were noted.

Thereafter, he received various antibiotics for bacterial infections, including pneumoniae and urinary-tract and catheter-related infections. Simultaneously, he had continuous watery and sometimes bloody diarrhea, the etiology of which was considered to be CDAD due to a positive stool test for CD toxins.

    "original_text": "An 81-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed with BD in 1981 on the basis of recurrent oral and genital ulcers, erythema nodosum, and uveitis, meeting the classification criteria for BD established by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare. He lost eyesight in his left eye in 1992, due to recurrent uveitis. He was referred to our hospital in 2007 with recurrent attacks of inflammation affecting the right eye. He had been treated with betamethasone eyedrops, but had never been treated with colchicine or cyclosporine A before the first visit to our hospital. As for initial ophthalmic presentation at our hospital, visual acuity in the right eye was at the level of recognizing hand motion, and keratic precipitate, anterior chamber cells (++), flare (++), and grade 3 vitreous haze were identified. The left eye showed no inflammation, and light perception on electroretinography was unrecordable.\nThe patient was initially treated with colchicine and betamethasone eyedrops, but attacks of ocular inflammation persisted, occurring six times in 8 months (equivalent to nine times/year). Immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporine A, were difficult to use because he had undergone removal of the left kidney due to cancer in 1998. In May 2008, administration of infliximab was started at a dose of 5 mg/kg, followed by a regular treatment schedule (initially in weeks 2 and 6, then every 8 weeks). This treatment reduced the frequency of ocular inflammatory attacks to seven times in 60 months (1.4 times/year). Right visual acuity improved to 1.0. However, the patient experienced exanthema after the ninth infusion of infliximab in May 2009 (54 weeks after starting infliximab treatment). That episode was considered to represent an infusion reaction to infliximab, so 5 mg of D-chlorpheniramine maleate and 20 mg of epinastine hydrochloride were administered before each infusion of infliximab thereafter.\nThe frequency of ocular attacks increased from December 2011 (3 years and 7 months after",
