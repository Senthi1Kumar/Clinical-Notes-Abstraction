    "original_text": "Patient 2 was a 38 years-old male diagnosed as left temporal glial neoplasia in May 2014 after a seizure. MRI showed an expansive infiltrative lesion predominantly in the subcortical region, with poorly defined contours located in the left temporal lobe, involvement of the upper, middle, and lower temporal gyrus, and an increase in the left temporal gyrus cortex. The lesion compromised a large part of the temporal lobe and extended to the temporal isthmus, the posterior aspect of the insula, and was deep in the trigeminal effigy of the left lateral ventricle. There was diffuse erasure of the regional cortical sulci and the Sylvian fissure, as well as a slight compression over the atrium of the left lateral ventricle. Stereotactic biopsy on April 2014 indicated a diagnosis of oligodendroglioma grade II. He received TMZ 1,875 mg with cycles every 23 days (during the 5 days of use he received a dose of 375 mg/day) from September 2014 to July 2015, with no tumor growth until the beginning of 2016. After checking the evolution of the tumor by MRI in February 2016, there was an increase in the dimensions of the remaining lesion, notably in the temporal isthmus, which had a similar expansive effect on the adjacent encephalic structures. The patient was submitted to a partial surgical resection followed by chemoradiation and lasting 6 cycles of PCV associated with CBD. The CBD dosage was ranging from 100 to 200 mg/day.\nDuring the chemoradiation he had an excellent clinical performance, practiced sports, and had few symptoms of fatigue and/or nausea.\nMRI control immediately after chemoradiation (Figure ) was used to characterize post-operative changes and showed a significant reduction of the infiltrative components of the tumor. The result of the pathological study after the first surgery (Figure ) was oligodendroglioma grade II.

The pain of the patient often occurred at night and it was not related with daily or sporting activities and most commonly felt at rest. Her symptoms started insidiously and she did not mention any trauma. She had been smoking 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, and she did not suffer from any medical condition. Furthermore, no hereditary disease was found in the patient's family history.\nPhysical examination revealed no abnormal findings. Her blood tests were all normal, including all the inflammatory markers. The patient underwent plain radiograph examination and a 21-millimeter-diameter cystic lesion was observed in the long axis of the calcaneus. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination was applied for the confirmation and it showed 22 \u00d7 20 mm intraosseous cystic lesion at the posterior part of the calcaneus which revealed hypointense signal on T1-weighted images and hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images (). The contrast-enhanced MRI was not available for this patient.\nAlthough the lesion was radiologically benign, extended curettage and iliac bone grafting were planned to exclude the malignancy risk that may be caused by smoking history. The operation was performed under spinal anesthesia. After bone grafting from the right ilium was completed, tourniquet was applied to the right thigh. A lateral approach to the calcaneus was used. After opening a 10 \u00d7 10 mm valve from the lateral aspect of the calcaneus, the cyst was excised and the cyst walls were debrided by burr. After preparation of the area, the cavity was filled with bone grafts.\nMicroscopic examination revealed compact hypercellular areas with spindle cells which show nuclear palisading around fibrillary process in some areas. There was no mitotic activity. Diffuse expression of S-100 protein was observed with immunohistochemical staining, and Ki-67 proliferation index was observed",

On arrival, the patient presented with hematemesis and mild epigastric pain. There was no sign of sepsis including fever, chills, rigors, and highly elevated inflammatory markers. Laboratory findings showed low hemoglobin level (8.3 g/dL), mildly elevated leukocyte count (11600/dL), and low C-reactive protein level (0.3 mg/dL). The patient's respiration was unstable and chest radiography revealed bilateral aspiration pneumonia; immediate endotracheal intubation was performed. The patient had a history of orchiectomy for seminoma followed by radiation therapy for para-aortic lymph node metastases approximately 30 years before the events described herein. Additionally, the patient had undergone several open surgeries for small bowel obstruction related to radiation-induced enteritis and adhesions. Although an ulcer and stenosis of the third portion of the duodenum had been revealed one month before admission, emergency gastroduodenal endoscopy on admission failed to reveal the source of bleeding due to the massive amount of fresh blood in the stomach and duodenum. Moreover, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) identified no extravasation around the duodenum, but it revealed mucosal thickening of the duodenal wall, duodenal stenosis at the level of the third and fourth portion of the duodenum, and soft-tissue density with fat stranding between the duodenum and the abdominal aorta (). Contrast CT on admission also revealed the presence of diffuse calcification and stenosis from the left common iliac artery to the abdominal aorta, which was confined to the radiation field ().

Her psychotic symptoms, which include delusions of persecution and thought broadcasting, first appeared at age 35 years. At the time, she underwent ambulatory treatment with 4-mg risperidone, and as a result did not experience another psychotic episode for about 10 years. Nevertheless, one year ago, her first recurrence of a psychotic episode was triggered by a trifling family problem, and her psychotic symptoms increased in severity to the point that she required hospitalization. On this occasion, an additional dose of risperidone and doses of other antipsychotics barely cured her symptoms, and she was discharged from the hospital after two months. Three months later, however, her psychotic symptoms relapsed without any apparent trigger, and this time, neither the maximum dose of risperidone nor other antipsychotics were able to control her psychotic episodes. Therefore, she was admitted to Chiba University Hospital for specialized treatment.\nAfter admission, she was mainly treated with a high dose (24 mg or more) of aripiprazole, together with a variable dose of olanzapine (5\u201310 mg) or quetiapine (200\u2013700 mg) for a short period of time. Over approximately two months, similar episodes of acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms were repeated and continued for about a week each time.

He reported immediate onset of pain after a fist strike on a metallic door 3 days ago, for which he sought medical advice in another health institution in proximity to his residency. Initial radiographs of his wrist were interpreted as normal by the attending physician and the patient was discharged with painkillers and elastic bandage.\nUpon admission to our department, physical examination revealed massive swelling of the right hand and tenderness over the ulnar side of his right wrist, both palmar and dorsal. He had limited motion at the wrist, ring and little finger with pain during passive motion. The extremity was neurovascularly intact. Radiographic evaluation included x-rays (anteroposterior, lateral and oblique views) and computed tomography scan, which clearly demonstrated a coronal fracture of the body of the hamate associated with fourth and fifth CMC dorsal dislocation (Figs. -). The patient underwent operative treatment at the day of presentation, consisting of ORIF of the hamate fracture and reduction of CMC dislocation with KW under image intensifier. Through a dorsal incision the hamate fracture was reduced and fixed with two small interfragmentary screws. The ring and little finger CMC dislocation was reduced applying longitudinal traction with a volar displacing force to the fourth and fifth metacarpals and 2 KW were driven to the third metacarpal and capitate bone (Fig. ).\nPost-operatively, the wrist was immobilized with a volar splint for 4 weeks with the hand elevated in a sling and no neurovascular deficit was recorded.

It began as a faint erythema that slowly developed into a ring-like plaque lesion. It was non-pruritic in nature and the plaque did not respond to topical antifungal treatment. He had this skin lesion prior to arriving in Singapore but decided to seek medical attention as the lesion progressed with new erythematous papules developing over the face, trunk and upper limbs in the past 2 months. There was no prior trauma or irritants applied to the skin and the patient did not complain of any systemic symptoms of fever, loss of weight and night sweat. There was no numbness or weakness and he did not have another co-existing medical condition. He denied ingestion of medication and sexual contact with a commercial sexual worker. The patient came to Singapore 7 years ago to work as nursing personnel and travelled back to the Philippines once to twice a year to visit his family. His housemate and family members did not have any skin complaint.\nOn physical examination, there was a large well demarcated annular plaque of 10 by 7.5 cm over the right upper back, which extended to the axilla (). It was erythematous, infiltrated and not scaly. There were also multiple monomorphic papules of 0.5 to 1 cm in size over the upper limbs (), face, proximal aspect of lower limbs and the gluteal region. Punch biopsies of the skin lesions were taken from the plaque at the back and one of the papules at the upper limb.

Drug induced coma was implemented and maintained for eight days prior to left parietooccipital craniotomy and excision of the causative left occipital arteriovenous malformation (Figures and ). At surgery small arterial feeders were evident 5cm from the midline. The hematoma cavity was evacuated. The arteriovenous malformation extended into the lateral horn of the left lateral ventricle and across the surface of the tentorium, draining into the transverse sinus.

The aggravating swelling and pain of the left calf impelled her to seek medical advice. After admission to our hospital, the patient developed septic shock symptoms characterized with diminished consciousness, pale skin, hypothermia, lack of urine output, and undetectable blood pressure.

She was admitted to the intensive care unit, receiving intravenous fluids and broad spectrum antibiotics treatments. Besides, she denied any history of diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, liver diseases, or trauma.\nIn the intensive care unit, the swelling increased and extended proximally to left knee and foot, complicated with blisters (Fig. A). Additionally, the patient developed cutaneous necrosis in the left ankle and popliteal space. Clinical examination showed her entire left calf was tensely swollen both medially and laterally, and the most obvious pain was localized to the bit area of the left calf.

There was no palpable lymphadenopathy over the bilateral neck area during the physical examination. The patient had a history of NPC one year previously, and had received a complete radiation therapy course (total dose of 6500 Gy), without chemotherapy. A tentative diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the mandible was made. In order to eliminate the possibility of NPC metastasis, a chest radiograph, conventional bone scanning and liver scanning were arranged. The results were negative. CT scanning did not reveal any cervical lymph node involvement in the neck area. Under general anaesthesia, tooth extraction, sequestrectomy and marginal bone resection were performed with a 2 mm safe zone (Fig. ). The tissue specimen was whitish in colour and soft with a granular texture. The wound was marsupialized and an iodoform gauze dressing was placed for 2 weeks. The histopathology report showed an undifferentiated carcinoma with frequent mitoses. In-situ hybridization revealed that the specimen contained Epstein-Barr virus RNA. The ENT department performed a nasopharyngeal examination for the possibility of recurrent NPC and the result was negative. The case was classified as Ho\u2019s stage II, T1N1M1.\nA CT scan was taken one month after the operation. The mandible had healed in the upper border region, but no healing was evident over the lower margin after surgery (Fig. ). The patient was referred for radiotherapy. After the supplemental dose of 50 Gy, further lesion expansion was stopped and early bone formation in the inferior lingual aspect of the lesion was noted in the following CT scan (Fig. ). The remaining apparent discontinuity of the bone in the grafted area most probably represents incomplete healing. 6 months",

The malignancy was initially detected as a new unexpected liver finding on surveillance imaging for her cervical cancer history. MRI with MR cholangiopancreatography and pathology via CT-guided percutaneous core biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. The patient also had a medical history of hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, asthma, morbid obesity, hypothyroidism, neuropathy and arthritis, as well as a 62 pack-years smoking history. The patient underwent systemic palliative chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine for 5 months, and 6 days after her eighth cycle of chemotherapy, she presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, sudden onset of left upper and lower extremities\u2019 weakness and slurred speech for 1 day. The patient also described having mild shortness of breath for a few days and diffuse bilateral wheezing was noted during examination. The patient was not in acute respiratory distress; vital signs and oxygen saturation on room air were within normal limits during this admission. The patient had a medical history of asthma and received a combination of beta-adrenergic and anticholinergic bronchodilator (DuoNeb) which improved her symptoms. With regard to the neurological symptoms, the last known normal (LKN) time was determined as 7 hours prior to admission. A non-contrast head CT scan was unremarkable; however, brain MRI findings were consistent with acute multiple non-haemorrhagic strokes. These infarcts involved the right frontal and temporoparietal areas, in the vascular territory of the right middle cerebral artery bilaterally ().

    "original_text": "A 38-year-old male underwent a tissue-matched renal allograft transplant for end-stage renal failure secondary to hypertension and primary antiphospholipid syndrome. Primary antiphospholipid syndrome was diagnosed 2 years prior to renal transplantation when he developed recurrent episodes of thrombosis of the arteriovenous fistula and neck veins, for which he was started on warfarin. Anticoagulation was optimized prior to surgery by withholding warfarin 5 days before surgery while bridging with heparin. During the early postoperative period (first postoperative week), he developed a peri-renal hematoma (ultrasonography 13 cm \u00d7 7 cm). Noncontrast computed tomography scan detected a homogenous fluid collection posterior to the transplanted kidney which extended superiorly up to the right subhepatic area and inferiorly into the pelvis, displacing the bladder to the left (Figure ). Anticoagulation was then withheld and he recovered over the next few days with normalization of serum creatinine and urine output. Prior to discharge, his urethral catheter and ureteric stent were removed and warfarin was restarted.\nThree weeks after the surgery, he presented with reduced urine output and progressive abdominal distension associated with pain and fever. Ultrasound scan revealed a large perigraft collection. Resuscitation and urgent exploration revealed a viable graft with a large urinoma posterior to the kidney. A possible anastomotic leak was suspected and a passive external drain was placed to allow adequate drainage of urine and healing of the anastomotic site. However, the conservative approach failed and there was no reduction in the drain output. Therefore, surgical exploration and definitive reconstruction were planned.\nSurgical exploration revealed an allograft vascular pedicle in the inferolateral aspect of the graft with a completely sloughed off allograft ureter (Figure ).

At the onset of symptoms, she experienced sudden nonpositional vertigo with severe nausea as well as decreased hearing in the left ear. She also noted nystagmus when looking in the mirror. Her symptoms improved mildly over the course of the day, so she did not seek immediate medical advice.\nTwo days following the initial onset, her symptoms returned, at which point she was evaluated at an outside emergency department. She was diagnosed with vertigo and discharged with prescriptions for meclizine and metoclopramide. Her symptoms then progressed to involve peripheral vision loss bilaterally, for which she was examined by an ophthalmologist. On dilated ophthalmic exam, she was found to have multiple areas of retinal ischemia and she was referred to our emergency department for further evaluation.\nOn magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain without contrast, nonspecific diffuse white matter signal abnormality was observed (Figures and ), which was considered markedly abnormal for the patient's age. A bedside lumbar puncture was performed, and cerebral spinal fluid analysis showed glucose 58 mg/dL, protein 48 mg/dL, nucleated count 2 per uL, oligoclonal bands negative, and myelin basic protein 8.92 ng/mL. In addition, the patient had an MRI brain with and without contrast performed a year earlier that mentioned white matter lesions in the corpus callosum (). She also had with her an audiogram from a year earlier showing low frequency sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear ().

To control her voiding symptoms, she took anticholinergic medication for several months but her voiding symptoms did not improve. She therefore kept a Foley catheter to relieve the uncontrolled voiding symptoms and had changed the urethral Foley catheter once a month for 10 years at a local clinic. To identify the cause of this recurrent acute pyelonephritis, she underwent voiding cystoureterography and was diagnosed as having grade II vesicoureteral reflux. After that, she had taken prophylactic antibiotic medication.\nPhysical examination showed mild tenderness of the lower abdomen.

She became pregnant and had no complications other than a 4-cm diameter fibroid in the anterior wall of the uterus. Her pregnancy progressed uneventfully though posterior wall low-lying placentation, but not placenta previa was noted. She underwent routine examinations at 33 weeks of gestation, and transvaginal ultrasonography revealed abnormal blood flow at the cervical region. She underwent MRI (Figure ), which also revealed abnormal findings. She was estimated to have a high risk of massive obstetric hemorrhage though a precise diagnosis could not be obtained. She was transferred to the maternal-fetal intensive care unit in our hospital.\nRadiologists in our hospital interpreted the MRI as either invasive placentation into the cervix or cervical vascular anomalies, though they had never seen images like these.

In 2012, the patient had reported left calf pain when running, forcing him to stop. He described a calf swelling sensation that gradually increased with the intensity of running. While in the past he could easily run 15\u201320 km, the patient reported at that date that he could not run more than 2 km before having to stop. After stopping, the pain was deep and persisted for several minutes; it was also associated with swelling of the calf. This pain had led him to change his occupation to a less physically demanding job (military officer in the past, and now security officer). The consequences were a weight gain of 8 kg, and a cessation of all physical activity (running, fight sports). The patient also reported a loss of self-esteem.\nOver a period of 4 years, the patient was seen by two general physicians, a rheumatologist, a neurologist, a sports physician and a vascular physician. Many explorations were carried out (spinal and pelvic x-ray, pelvic and lumbar spine scan, venous duplex scan, arterial duplex scan, and electromyography), all of which revealed no sign of dysfunction.

An ultrasound examination showed papillary neoplasms arising from the posterior-lateral left wall of the bladder.\nThe patient had suffered lower urinary tract symptoms over the preceding 1 year and seemed cachectic, but had not previously reported weight loss or any other specific complaints. He did have a family history of malignancy though, as his father had developed rectal cancer and his sister had a kidney neoplasm.\nHe had no signs or symptoms until his physician noticed a hard lump with skin retraction on his left nipple. The patient also had an erythematous nodular skin lesion developing on his forehead. For these lesions, the patient underwent left modified radical mastectomy (based on the Madden technique) with axillary lymph node dissection. Histopathological examination revealed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma (grade III, score 8 according to Nottingham) with metastasis to one of the 11 axillary lymph nodes examined. Approximately 90% of the neoplastic cells stained positive with antibody to the oestrogen receptor, and 20% stained positive with antibody to the progesterone receptor. The proliferative index using a Ki-67 monoclonal antibody was 10%. HER-2/neu was not over-expressed (Figure ). The nodular skin lesion was completely resected, and histopathological examination revealed it to be a SCC (grade II), infiltrating the hypodermis (Figure ). Immediately after these surgical procedures, the patient was hospitalised in our institution where a cystoscopy was performed confirming ultrasound findings of multiple bladder papillary lesions arising from the posterior-lateral left wall, with a large base plant and active bleeding. A trans-urethral resection of the bladder lesion (TURB) was performed at the same time in which the neoplasm was completely excised. Subsequent histopathological examination showed a grade 3 papillary TCC that was in the process",

He had received a craniotomy to excise a brain tumor one month previously. His height was 177 cm and his weight was 73 kg. His current chief complaint was a two-month history of severe back pain, accompanied by a tingling sensation, with radiation of the pain into both inguinal regions, especially the right. The patient's knee jerk reflexes were normal without neurologic deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the patient's lumbar spine, at L1, L2, L4, and L5. The main cause of the patient's symptoms was a lesion in L1, which had metastasized to the posterior vertebral body wall and right pedicle, resulting in spinal cord compression (). The patient had received radiation therapy before visiting the pain clinic, and he was taking oxycodone 40 mg and gabapentin 300 mg three times a day with no complications. Despite these interventions, he continued to experience significant pain. The pain was aggravated by changes in position from lying to sitting and relieved when he was lying. He rated his pain as 6\u201310 on the numeric 0\u201310 rating scale (NRS).The patient's average pain score with respect to the NRS was 8/10. However, he did not wish to undergo open surgery because of his poor general condition and short life expectancy. We initially planned to reduce the patient's pain using an epidural block prior to secondary interventional management, but he was not able to tolerate the prone position required to receive the epidural block due to the severe radiating pain he experienced in that position. Therefore, it was necessary to treat the patient's pain maximally in a single therapeutic session. Thus, we proposed to perform BRFD with PVP and the patient agreed to undergo the procedure.\nWe proceeded under conscious sedation administered by an experienced anesthesiologist,",

Within a week, the patient lost all vision in her right eye as well as extraocular muscle movement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a 2.3-cm right parasellar mass and the patient was referred to neurosurgery with a presumed diagnosis of a meningioma. A repeat MRI the following week showed a 4 \u00d7 3-cm extra-axial mass involving the right cavernous sinus with extension to the optic canal, frontotemporal base, and posterior ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses (Figures , ). The mass encased the cavernous right internal carotid artery abutting the right superior rectus muscle. Physical examination was significant for right extraocular muscle plegia, dilated and non-reactive right pupil, right afferent pupillary defect, right periorbital paresthesia, and cranial nerve II to VI palsy. The patient was diagnosed with cavernous sinus syndrome secondary to meningioma versus malignancy.\nNeurointerventional radiology was consulted, and a CT-guided biopsy of the lesion was scheduled to identify the nature of the mass, that is, squamous cell carcinoma metastasis versus meningioma versus plasmacytoma, as treatment of a plasmacytoma would involve radiation and medical therapy as opposed to a craniotomy for tumor resection. The patient was taken to the radiology suite and positioned supine on the CT table. General anesthesia was used for the duration of the procedure. A CT of the base of the skull was conducted with intravenous contrast to identify the right internal carotid and right ophthalmic arteries and their branches. The images demonstrated an expansive enhancing mass in the right cavernous sinus, extending into the right middle cranial fossa, right orbit, and right sphenoid sinus (Fig",

The lateral wall of the mass was focally disrupted and consolidation with the fat component in the adjacent left upper lobe was noted, thus suggesting that the tumor had ruptured (). An inhomogeneously enhanced solid portion was noted in the medial aspect of the mass and extended to the upper mediastinum, obliterating the fat plane between the mass and the mediastinal vessels ().\nThoracotomy demonstrated that the mass was rubbery, with hard components, and invaded the right brachiocephalic artery, the innominate vein, the ascending aorta, and the pericardium. The mass had ruptured into the left upper lobe, but due to extensive invasion by vessels, was incompletely resected. Decompression and plication of the left upper lobe was performed, and pathologic examination showed that the excised mass was a 10\u00d78 cm cystic tumor with a rugged, pale brown external surface. It contained yellowish brown material with a few hair like structures, and cut section revealed a round, pale gray solid area in the wall that was firmly attached to the mediastinal structures. Microscopically, while most of the mass was mature teratoma with hemorrhage and necrosis (), the solid portion of the wall was found to be poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (). The final histologic diagnosis was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma arising from a mature teratoma. One month after surgery, the tumor recurred at the resected site, despite chemotherapy and subsequently metastasized. Six months after surgery",

    "original_text": "A 4-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital because of abdominal discomfort. On further examination, he had a history of cerebral palsy and difficulty of walking. He also underwent several VP shunt operations when he was younger. The first operation was undertaken when he was 2 months old because of his congenital hydrocephalus.\nThe patient went back to the hospital when he was 1 year old because of severe headache. Computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a large right porencephaly. An additional shunt was inserted on the right side. Postoperatively, the patient's condition was remarkable and he was discharged uneventfully.\nThree months later, the patient had complained of abdominal pain. On hospitalization, further physical examination revealed an exposure of shunt on his anus which extruded spontaneously. Revision of shunt catheter was undertaken.\nThe patient presented again complaining of abdominal discomfort 2 months later. During hospitalization, there was a shunt extruded through his urethra []. His abdominal X-ray revealed that the extruded shunt was the right peritoneal catheter []. Urinary bladder was strongly suspected as the site of migration. The patient underwent emergency surgery. The shunt was removed by a team comprising neurosurgeons and urologists. The shunt was cut at the abdomen site and exteriorized. The peritoneal end was gently pulled through the urethral opening. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed an infection. The result was showing 200 cells found with protein 100 mg/dl, glucose 13 mg/dl, and the culture showed Micrococcus sp. growth. Urological procedure was performed endoscopically through the urethra to explore the site of migration and potential of leakage. It was found that the shunt was penetrated through the bladder wall just above the trigonal area []. We decided to treat conservatively by inserting an urethral catheter to keep the bladder decompressed for optimal healing process.\nThereafter, intraventricular antibiotic was administered according to the culture results. One month later, culture of CSF was performed and it showed a sterile result",
