The patient\u2019s right ankle was grossly deformed and locked in supination but skin was intact (Fig. ). The right lower extremity was neurovascularly intact. Initial X-rays (Fig. ) of the right ankle demonstrated a medial subtalar dislocation without associated fractures.

Therefore, risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed and the patient elected to proceed with urgent closed vs open reduction of the right subtalar joint and any other indicated procedures.\nOnce general anesthesia was induced, closed reduction was attempted using axial traction with the knee in flexion. Closed reduction was unsuccessful once again (Fig. ) so the decision was made to attempt open reduction. An anteromedial approach was used dissect down to the talonavicular joint. Retractors were placed with care to avoid injury to tibialis anterior tendon or superficial peroneal nerve. The joint capsule was seen to be disrupted and further exposure revealed a thin, coronal fracture of the anteromedial aspect of the talar head measuring roughly 2 cm in length and 6 mm in thickness (Fig. ). Once this fragment was removed, the subtalar and talonavicular joints were easily reduced. It was thought that this incarcerated fragment was the likely cause for the unsuccessful closed reduction. The talar head fragment was unamendable for stabilization due to its small size with poor healing potential, thus it was removed.

Plain X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) () showed acute extension-distraction fracture of the T12 body with the intravertebral cleft and segmental lordotic change of the thoracolumbar spine. There were also multiple planar vertebral bodies as a result of previous osteoporotic thoracolumbar fractures. The condition of the thoracolumbar spine was highly unstable, and the aggravation of extension-distraction of the fractured vertebral body was likely to lead to neurological deficits. We decided to perform surgical treatment with instrumentation and fusion for the long segments above and below the fractured T12. However, it was predicted that stable fixation of pedicle screws would not be easy and that postoperative pseudoarthrosis and instability were likely to recur, considering the deformed vertebral bodies around the fractured T12 and the bone mineral densitometry (BMD) findings (\u22126.7, lumbar spine). Most importantly, the patient was judged as inoperable due to her weak physical condition caused by greatly reduced cardiopulmonary function (originating from heart failure and restrictive lung disease), in addition to a weak constitution (a height of 140 cm and weight of 38 kg). After deep consideration, the patient and her family refused surgical treatment and decided that she should be treated conservatively. As conservative treatment, bedrest in the lateral decubitus posture and pain control were performed for the initial three weeks along with the use of teriparatide (subcutaneous injection, 20 \u03bcg/day) with calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Afterwards, sitting and standing with wearable orthoses were carried out gradually depending on back pain. On the follow-up radiological examinations (), the collapse of fractured vertebral body proceeds with reducing intravertebral cleft at 3- and 6-month follow-up CT scans.

A chest x-ray revealed an opaque left hemithorax that was likely rapid accumulation of pleural fluid (Fig. ). A follow-up contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest performed during the arterial phase revealed a left intercostal pseudoaneurysm with hemothorax and adjacent compressive atelectasis (Fig. ).

Her medical history reported a deep venous thrombosis with lung embolism in 1999, gallbladder lithiasis, uterus myomatosus and a psychiatric disorder (anxiety and depression). Gastroscopy revealed esophageal varices that were successfully ligated. In addition, a CT scan of the abdomen showed a large tumor (diameter approximately 10 cm) in the left hypochondriac region, located cranial to the tail of the pancreas and expanding into the spleen area (fig. ). The tumor contained multiple calcifications in the spleen area and around the fundus of the stomach. A pancreatic tail tumor extending into the spleen or a primary splenic tumor was suspected. There was no invasion of the kidneys or adrenal glands, no retroperitoneal adenopathy, no parenchymal metastasis in the liver and no bone lesions. A diagnostic laparoscopy was performed. Anatomopathological examination of limited biopsy material showed the presence of a tumor with morphological and immunohistochemical features suggesting metastasis or extension of a clear cell renal cell carcinoma in the pancreas, although the possibility of an adrenocortical carcinoma could not be excluded. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed a lesion with a solid and nested growth pattern containing cells with clear cytoplasm, well-defined cell borders and small, slightly pleomorphic nuclei (fig. ). The tumor showed a strong positive reaction to staining for vimentin (fig. ) and focal positivity for CD10 (fig. ). It also showed strong staining with pancytokeratin (CK AE1/AE3) and focal positivity for synaptophysin; there was no immunoreactivity for CD45 (LCA).\nDue to the widespread nature of the tumor in the upper abdomen and the inconclusive anatomopathological examination, the patient underwent surgery in a university center (UZ Leuven).

Moreover, this awareness from our Genetic Services Division led to the initial investigations whereby the patient\u2019s system-wide pathologies were brought to light.\nThe purpose of the patient\u2019s present follow-up was to monitor the remission status of thyroid cancer; however, she was found to have three incidental meningiomata. The patient denied any headaches, seizures, or other problems that could be attributable to the meningiomata. She did not have any visual problems and was neurologically intact.\nAn MRI brain scan in October 2018 revealed a small left frontal contrast-enhancing dural based lesion consistent with a meningioma of just over 3 cm x 1.5 cm, a left temporal convexity tiny meningioma, and a small left-sided sphenoid wing meningioma (Figures , , ). The left frontal convexity meningioma was associated with a small amount of edema but there were no other concerning features. Her case was discussed at the NeuroOncology multidisciplinary team meeting, as is our practice for all newly diagnosed tumors. Owing to the multiplicity of lesions, the small individual volume size, and the small collective volume, she was considered a candidate for stereotactic radiosurgery.

It was initially suspected that the patient was experiencing pulmonary embolism based on her clinical presentation and elevated D-dimer, but further testing revealed that she was experiencing cardiac tamponade with mild pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. Pericardiocentesis was performed without definitive diagnosis. In February 2017, the patient exhibited worsening respiratory symptoms without fever, hemoptysis, sputum production, B symptoms, or extremity edema. Baseline chest PET-CT images were reviewed by radiologists at both UCLA Oncology and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, demonstrating a large middle mediastinal mass encasing the main pulmonary artery, with pericardial and left pleural effusion (Figure & Figure ). Scattered pulmonary nodules and hypodense lesions were identified in the right lobe of the liver, consistent with a diagnosis of metastatic disease (Figure ). Biopsy of the mediastinal mass revealed a high grade undifferentiated malignant neoplasm composed of highly proliferative (ki67 staining ~50%) pleomorphic anaplastic epithelioid malignant cells with large areas of necrosis and fibrosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong antigenicity for CD31 and CD34, and weak antigenicity for D2-40 and Factor VIII indicating a diagnosis of angiosarcoma that was corroborated at both UC San Diego Health and MD Anderson.\nConventional treatment options were recommended, however the patient declined these based on low reported survival rates, and instead, requested the non-selective beta blocker propranolol as a single agent therapy. In May 2017, 40 mg/kg propranolol was administered daily and PET-CT scans were performed at regular intervals to assess the response of the tumor to propranolol.

    "cleaned_text": "in late 2016, a 61 year old non-smoking female presented with exertional shortness of breath, mild pedal edema, distended neck veins, and a recent weight gain of 15 lbs over the prior 2 weeks. it was initially suspected that the patient was experiencing pulmonary embolism based on her clinical presentation and elevated d-dimer, but further testing revealed that she was experiencing cardiac tamponade with mild pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. pericardiocentesis was performed without definitive diagnosis. in february 2017, the patient exhibited worsening respiratory symptoms without fever, hemoptysis, sputum production, b symptoms, or extremity edema. baseline chest pet-ct images were reviewed by radiologists at both ucla oncology and texas tech university health sciences center, demonstrating a large middle mediastinal mass encasing the main pulmonary artery, with pericardial and left pleural effusion (figure & figure ). scattered pulmonary nodules and hypodense lesions were identified in the right lobe of the liver, consistent with a diagnosis of metastatic disease (figure ). biopsy of the mediastinal mass revealed a high grade undifferentiated malignant neoplasm composed of highly proliferative (ki67 staining ~50%) pleomorphic anaplastic epithelioid malignant cells with large areas of necrosis and fibrosis. immunohistochemistry revealed strong antigenicity for cd31 and cd34, and weak antigenicity for d2-40 and factor viii indicating a diagnosis of angiosarcoma that was corroborated at both uc san diego health and md anderson.\nconventional treatment options were recommended, however the patient declined these based on low reported survival rates, and instead, requested the non-selective beta blocker propranolol as a single agent therapy. in may 2017, 40 mg/kg propranolol was administered daily and pet-ct scans were performed at regular intervals to assess the response of the tumor to propranolol. assessment of tumor response was based on 18f-fluorodeoxyglucose (fdg) tracer uptake and measurements/assessments of the primary tumor and distant metastases. after 12 months of propranolol as a single agent therapy, significant",

Enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a hypervascular mass of 35 mm in diameter in the descending portion of the duodenum (Fig. ), and the left three sections of the liver were occupied by multiple cystic tumors with contrast enhancement of the cystic wall, 13 cm in diameter (Fig. ). A duodenal tumor was identified on gastrointestinal endoscopy (Fig. ), and a biopsy revealed a NET. The serum levels of insulin, gastrin, and glucagon were within normal ranges. CT did not initially reveal evidence of pancreatic invasion between the tumor and the pancreas; however, irregularities of the duodenal wall and swelling of the lymph nodes around the pancreatic parenchyma were observed. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with non-functional duodenal NET with multiple liver metastases, T2N1M1 stage IV (UICC 8th). In addition, CT revealed the anatomical variation of the CHA, which branched from the SMA and ran fully through the head of the pancreatic parenchyma (Fig. , Additional file Figure S1). The CHA branches into the left hepatic artery (LHA), the middle hepatic artery (MHA), and the right hepatic artery (RHA) (Fig. a, b). Furthermore, a developed gastric arterial arcade, 4 mm in diameter, was found between the left gastric artery (LGA) and the right gastric artery (RGA).

He was a known case of interstitial lung disease and was dependant on continuous oxygen support (5 L/min) for more than 20 h a day, to maintain a saturation of 90%. He was assessed for lung transplant. Cardiac catheterisation study revealed high pulmonary artery (PA) pressures. The pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was high (3.7 wood units). The coronary angiogram showed insignificant coronary artery disease. Dobutamine stress echocardiography confirmed good left ventricular function without any ischaemia. A High-resolution computed tomography scan of the lungs revealed bilateral interlobular interstitial thickening with honeycombing pattern of bronchiectasis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Lung perfusion scan revealed relatively reduced perfusion in the left lung contributing to 30% of the total pulmonary function. Pulmonary function tests revealed a significant restrictive pathology with a forced expiratory volume in 1 s of 1.26 L (27% of predicted). He underwent right single-lung transplantation under cardiopulmonary bypass. In view of high PA pressures, cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated after heparinisation with an arterial cannula in aorta and direct right atrial cannulation for venous access. He had a total bypass time of 198 min and total ischaemic time of the graft was 180 min. He was shifted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with stable haemodynamics and minimal ionotropic support. He was extubated on the same day of surgery and had an uneventful post-operative period. The post-operative bronchoscopy showed healthy bronchial stump.

Diplopia was binocular and noticed after she banged her head against the shower screen. She was healthy and had no symptoms suggestive of giant cell arteritis (GCA). A clinical examination showed right fourth cranial nerve palsy. Her magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was normal. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 77mm/hour and C-reactive protein 68mg/L. She was commenced on oral steroids while awaiting temporal artery biopsy (TAB) to rule out GCA. TAB revealed normal histology. As there was no clinical suspicion of GCA, her steroids were stopped. The medics investigated her further for raised inflammatory parameters and no cause was identified.\nShe then sought medical attention for a breast lump that she had noticed for the past few months. This was clinically diagnosed as breast cancer. She subsequently underwent right wide local excision of the mass and axillary clearance. Histology revealed 28mm grade 3 oestrogen receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative ductal carcinoma involving 12 of 14 axillary nodes. An oncology referral was made.\nMeanwhile, she complained of a droopy right eyelid. Orthoptic examination showed pupil-sparing third nerve paresis and mild sixth nerve involvement. The fourth nerve paresis had resolved. Neuroimaging to rule out cavernous sinus pathology was requested. A MRI scan with contrast showed meningeal thickening in frontal, parietal and occipital lobes and no abnormality in the cavernous sinus territory. This was consistent with carcinomatous meningitis (Figure ).\nBy the time of her oncology appointment, she had developed numbness in the ophthalmic division of her right trigeminal nerve. A bone scan showed bone metastases; computed tomography revealed bone spread and abnormal mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology was negative but protein was slightly raised. Palliative hormone therapy was commenced for metastatic breast cancer. She responded quickly with complete resolution of diplopia",

However, after the operation, the patient had become hemodynamically unstable. At presentation, his systolic blood pressure was 90 mmHg and the pulse rate was 135 beats/min. Although there was no gross rectal bleeding, the digital rectal examination revealed a penny-sized anterior rectal wall defect 6 cm from the anal verge (AV). Computed tomography (CT) revealed a hematoma (12 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 15 cm) with active bleeding in the pelvic cavity and a pseudoaneurysm in the anterior wall of the rectum (). Since the patient was hemodynamically unstable, an emergency operation was performed. During the operation, a massive subperitoneal hematoma in the rectovesical pouch and large amount of blood in the peritoneal cavity were found. After evacuation of the hematoma and blood, oozing continued in the rectovesical pouch (). Thus, compression with gauze was performed for 30 min until the oozing stopped.

No obvious change in size and internal density of uterine fibrosis had been observed during these 5 years (Fig. b). She had no previous history of alcohol or drug abuse. Ultrasound revealed a well-defined, non-calcified tumor between the gallbladder and liver (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a hypointense tumor that compressed the gallbladder and liver on precontrast T1 mapping (Fig. a). T2-weighted images revealed hyperintense tumor with delayed enhancement on arterial phase and portal venous phase (Fig. b) followed by a delayed washout on the hepatocyte phase. Clinical evaluation and laboratory results were nonspecific, and serum tumor markers including carcinoembryonic antigen, cancer antigen (CA) 19-9, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen were within their normal ranges. The findings were consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) or another benign tumor originating from the liver or gallbladder. Accordingly, we planned firstly laparoscopic partial hepatectomy concomitant with gallbladder resection. Lymphadenectomy among the hepatoduodenal ligament were also planned under the situations where malignant tumor was suspected intraoperatively. Under the laparoscopic view, a soft tumor had expansively progressed behind the gallbladder, with dorsal compression of the liver (Fig. ). The tumor was easily separated from Laennec\u2019s capsule of the liver at the gallbladder neck and body without adhesion, which indicates the tumor is benign. Therefore, operative policy changed to tumor enucleation with cholecystectomy. Frozen sections including the surgical margin of the cystic duct were negative for tumor cells.

Blood cultures were drawn and intravenous Cefuroxime and Clindamycin were started for suspected bacterial soft tissue infection. Growth of GAS from the blood culture was reported with a time to positivity of 2.6 h by the microbiology laboratory. Ultrasound showed signs of soft tissue inflammation around the painful area at the buttock. On the second day of hospitalization the patient had progressively worsening pain of the left thigh. A CT scan revealed inflammation and swelling of the gluteal muscle. Urgent surgical debridement was performed and intraoperatively necrotising fasciitis was confirmed. Tissue swabs grew GAS. Although antimicrobial treatment was started promptly, GAS was still detected in the tissue samples 48 h after initiating betalactam and lincosamide antibiotics at the first debridement. Further blood cultures were not taken at this time.

After a trial of physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medication, he still experienced persistent pain and instability and elected to undergo arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with a peroneus allograft. The graft was fixed to the femur using a suture button and the tibial side was fixed with a tenodesis implant. No complications were noted intraoperatively.\nHis immediate postoperative course was uneventful. He experienced intermittent knee swelling that was activity related, but this was not associated with inability to bear weight or other signs concerning for infection. However, 4.5 months postoperatively, he developed acute anterior tibial swelling with associated warmth and erythema at the tibial tunnel site. This was lanced at an outside facility after they suspected it to be an abscess, and he was placed on oral clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). He presented to our clinic 5 days later with persistent drainage from the wound and exposed tenodesis implant in the wound.\nHe then underwent formal debridement and irrigation with tenodesis implant removal and primary wound closure in the operating room. Gram stain from intraoperative specimens demonstrated few neutrophils, but no organisms. Infectious disease was consulted, and empiric intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam were started. However, by postoperative day 4, cultures grew N nova. Empiric antibiotics were stopped, and he was transitioned to oral TMP-SMX and intravenous meropenem.\nHe was doing well until 4 weeks after the debridement when he developed erythema, drainage, and wound dehiscence.

Prenatal ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no anatomical abnormality, and amniotic fluid volume was normal. Fetal karyotyping was not performed. At birth the weight was 934 g (\u22123 SD), length 34.5 cm (\u22122 SD), and head circumference 25.5 cm (\u22121.5 SD). Apgar scores were 5 at 1 min and 6 at 5 min. In spite of antenatal corticosteroid administration, the infant was intubated after birth and placed on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. The placenta (weight 240 g) was delivered intact, and macro- and microscopic examinations revealed no pathology such as malformations, infarction, or chorioamnionitis. Chest radiographs confirmed the initial diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome, and surfactant treatment was administered.

Both the patient and the horse were up to date on their required vaccinations at the time of the incident. The patient was transferred to an emergency department and was admitted six hours after the incident. He was conscious, in good general condition, and apyretic. An examination revealed a crush injury of the fourth finger with tendons and bone exposed ().\nCopious irrigation with normal saline (2 liters) at the injury site was performed along with injection of 0.5 ml tetanus toxoid and 500 IU of human tetanus immunoglobulin. Postexposure rabies prophylaxis (rabies immune globulin human 20 IU/kg) with the first-dose rabies vaccine was injected into the depth of the wound as well as around the wound.

    "original_text": "A 12-year-old female with tuberous sclerosis and associated psychiatric symptoms was admitted on February 6th, 2011 to the Kangning Psychiatric Hospital. The history of the development of her condition was as follows.\nBorn by normal delivery at full-term, her early childhood development was unremarkable. Facial erythema appeared when she was 3 years of age and subsequently expanded to cover the skin on her head and neck in elevated stripes; but it had never been painful so it was not treated. At the age of six she starting having frequent 30 to 60-second episodes (usually more than 12 times a day) during which her hands twitched, her head and neck were askew, she was non-responsive and she foamed at the mouth. After detailed assessments at several hospitals, a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis was made. She was treated with 100 mg/d topiramate and 0.5g/d clonazepam for her seizures; these medications decreased the frequency of the seizures but did not eliminate them completely. She continued to have very brief seizures twice daily during which her eyes looked to one side and her hands twitched.\nShe completed the first two years of elementary school without trouble, but in the third year her scores in math and Chinese dropped significantly and she was no longer able to complete math problems that she had been able to complete in grades 1 and 2. At the same time she became introverted.

According to the original operative record, the prosthesis was a 58-mm Harris-Galante II acetabular cup (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN, USA) fixed with two screws. An elevated polyethylene liner with a thickness of 10 mm and an Osteonics femoral stem No. 7 (Stryker Howmedica Osteonics, Mahwah, NJ, USA) with a 28-mm plus 10 prosthetic metal femoral head and neck completed the prosthesis. The postoperative course was uneventful and she had a good clinical result with only slight pain after long walks. Seven years after the operation, her hip prosthesis dislocated during severe rotation when she was practicing tai-chi. It was managed by closed reduction and radiographic examination indicated slight wear of the polyethylene in the cup. Osteolysis around the cup was also suspected on conventional radiographic examination. A discussion about revision of the cup due to wear and osteolysis started and resulted in a referral to our department 17 years ago. At that time, we had started to assess wear and osteolysis around the cup with CT and she had her first examination in October 2004. We found no osteolysis around the cup. Liner wear defined as maximal femoral head penetration into the polyethylene liner was 2.6 mm measured on the CT scan. This meant that there was 7.4 mm polyethylene left in the most worn part of the cup. Since her hip was pain free and her hip function was excellent, we decided to not revise the hip prosthesis but instead follow her with CT examinations of the operated hip. In 2005, the polyethylene wear had progressed to 3 mm. In 2007, the wear was 3.2 mm and in 2011 it was 3.9 mm. Her clinical function was excellent on all",

Haemodialysis was initiated in 2000 and a deceased donor kidney transplant was performed in 2005. Immunosuppression was by cyclosporin, azathioprine and prednisone, without induction therapy. The post-transplant course was stable with good renal function. The patient developed diabetes mellitus in 2010 and was placed on insulin. Parathyroidectomy was performed in 2011 for hyperparathyroidism. She was treated in hospital once in 2012 for a urinary tract infection.\nRenal function deteriorated over a period of 6 months in 2014, serum creatinine increasing from a baseline of less than 100 to more than 300 \u03bcmol/l. This prompted the performance of a transplant biopsy. Chronic allograft nephropathy was diagnosed and immunosuppression changed to tacrolimus (target serum trough level 5-7 ng/ml), mycophenolate mofetil (1 g twice daily) and prednisone (10 mg/day). Renal function remained stable until rapid deterioration occurred early in 2015 due to suspected non-adherence to immune suppressants during a foreign visit. Three steroid pulses (methylprednisolone 250 mg daily) were administered, and a repeat transplant biopsy was performed. The histological appearance was essentially unchanged. Renal function improved somewhat with serum creatine decreasing from an initial value of 640 \u03bcmol/l to 395 \u03bcmol/l, and then stabilising at a new baseline of about 380 \u03bcmol/l after one further dose of methylprednisone 500 mg. Subsequently viral infection due to cytomegalo-, and BK-virus occurred at different times. The virus infections were diagnosed by quantitative serum PCR for CMV and by urine PCR for BK virus. CMV infection, which presented as a febrile illness, was treated because of a sustained viral load of 250\u2013671 copies/ml. Treatment was by induction with intravenous gancyclovir and maintenance with oral valgancyclovir. The BK viral load in the urine was 269,000 copies/ml.

At the age of 32, bilateral cataracts were diagnosed and at 44 he was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, currently on oral hypoglycemic agents. Additionally, he has hypothyroidism and hypertriglyceridemia in management and calcification of the Achilles tendon. Patient endorses lack of an early adolescent growth spurt; however, final stature is similar to his other 3 siblings (164 cm). Patient reports he had no child by choice.\nPatient is product of the union of consanguineous parents (second cousins) and has a 49-year-old brother with similar clinical characteristics, including voice changes since the age of 28, bilateral cataracts at age 29 (subsequently presents complications from corneal ulceration and is currently legally blind), and premature graying since age 33, moreover, scleroderma-like skin changes since his 30s and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus at age 35.

He had a mild cough and exertional dyspnea at presentation; however, the seizure frequency had progressively worsened over two years. Examination showed a lean, afebrile child with pallor. Chest examination revealed vesicular breath sounds with reduced intensity of breath sounds and dull percussion on left side. Review of blood work showed microcytic hypochromic anemia, elevated RBC sed rate levels (ESR) of 140 mm/ hr and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 142 mg/ dL.\nChest radiograph (Figure ) and computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a large [9 x 11 cm] lobulated soft tissue density solid mass in the left lung with large chunks of scattered popcorn like calcifications causing severe narrowing of left pulmonary vessels and occlusion of left mainstem bronchus. Multiple smaller partially calcified lesions were also seen in the right lung. Few of the lesions were also abutting the pleural surface. Bilateral pleural and pericardial effusion was also seen (Figure ). Computed tomography scan of the brain showed multiple circumscribed calcified and non-calcified lesions with gyriform calcifications diffusely involving bilateral cerebral hemispheres (Figure ). Largest lesion in left posterior parietal lobe measured 2 x 3 cm. Some of the lesions showed post contrast enhancement (Figure ). Associated cortical atrophy and mild hydrocephalus were also present.

There was no history of epistaxis or any other ENT complaints, and the patient\u2019s past medical history and family history were insignificant.\nOn anterior rhinoscopy, a single polypoidal mass was seen filling the left nasal cavity extending up to the vestibule. The mass was firm in consistency, insensitive to touch and pain, and did not bleed upon touch. General and systemic examinations and an examination of the rest of the ENT were all within normal limits. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a homogenous soft tissue lesion measuring 44\u00d768\u00d712 mm in the left nasal cavity, extending posteriorly into the nasopharynx ().\nThe mass extended superiorly into the left ethmoid air cells up to the cribriform plate with its thinning and breach. The rest of the sinuses was clear. On contrast study, there was heterogeneous enhancement. Based on the CT findings of the anterior skull base breach, gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to rule out intracranial extension, and revealed small sub-centimeter focus posteriorly without any significant intracranial extension ().\nRigid endoscopy was carried out and the mass was seen attached to the anterior part of the nasal septum. A punch biopsy was taken, which presented as an inflammatory polyp.\nThe patient was referred for standard endoscopic sinus surgery under general anesthetic after providing informed consent. The mass was removed endoscopically, and was seen to be extending intracranially but extradurally.

There was no history of trauma and a physical examination revealed an elastic soft tumor measuring ~12\u00d77 cm in size.\nRadiography showed an expansion of the soft tissue on the medial aspect of the thigh, but no bony changes or calcifications. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the tumor mass was isointense compared with the muscle on T1-weighted images (). On T2-weighted images, the tumor was of heterogeneous high signal intensity (). The tumor enhanced homogeneously following intravenous administration of gadolinium with gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentacetate (Gd-DTPA). The surrounding tissue was of high intensity on T1 and T2-weighted images, but was not enhanced following administration of Gd-DTPA (). An angiogram showed that the tumor was fed by a femoral artery and was markedly stained. 67Gallium scintigraphy showed significantly abnormal uptake in the tumor. Furthermore, chest radiography and computed tomography found no evidence of lung metastasis, and the laboratory findings were normal.\nBased on a presumed diagnosis of a benign fibrous tumor or schwannoma, tumor excision was performed. The surgical findings concluded that the tumor was located in the femoral abductor muscle, with the femoral artery penetrating into the tumor. As a benign tumor was suspected according to the intraoperative frozen section examination, the majority of the mass was excised and the remaining portion was left attached to the artery. The gross appearance revealed two layers of structures: An internal lesion with a hard, white-tan colored tumor and an outer lesion composed of lipomatous tumor tissue (). A wide resection was performed for the internal lesion, whereas an intralesional resection was performed for the outer lesion.
