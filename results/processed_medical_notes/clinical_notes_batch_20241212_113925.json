The patient had history of ulcer in the left breast for past 2\u20133 weeks which developed over the underlying huge breast lump. The lump was present for past 5 months but rapidly grew over the last 3 months to current size. There was no history of coagulopathy, trauma, chronic liver disease or history of similar illness in first degree relatives. The patient attained menarche at the age of 15 years. She is a non-smoker and denies history of contraceptive use or alcohol intake.\nOn examination in our emergency there was severe pallor with tachycardia. However the blood pressure was maintained. There was an oozing ulceration in upper outer quadrant of the left breast with underlying huge lump measuring 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202fcm occupying the upper outer, lower outer and upper inner quadrants with deformed shape of the breast (a). The skin surrounding the ulcer was erythematous and edematous. Axilla did not show lymphadenopathy.\nBefore the development of breast lump, the patient had itchy lesion at the same site. The patient unfortunately attributed all these events to that itchy lesion and sought help late. There was no history of headache, shortness of breath, abdominal distension or bone pain.\nOn investigating the patient, she was severely anemic with hemoglobin of 5\u202fgm% with normal total and differential counts.

Her pertinent initial labs showed a hemoglobin of 6.7 g/dl (baseline 9.6 g/dl) with a hematocrit of 23%. Patient did not have any fever or leukocytosis. A CT abdomen with contrast done in the ED for abdominal pain showed nonspecific findings, i.e, irregularity of the \u201caneurysmal sac\u201d with a small amount of fluid around the sac (see ) which was read by the radiologist as early postsurgical changes. She was admitted and was started on proton pump inhibitors. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed that revealed mild duodenitis. Her hemoglobin remained stable the next couple of days, and she was discharged home with a 6-8-week course of proton pump inhibitors. Two months later, she presented again with similar complaints with a drop of hemoglobin. A repeat EGD was performed that did not reveal any obvious source of bleeding, and she was discharged home after stabilization.\nA month later, she came for the third time into the ED with abdominal pain, hematochezia, and profound hypotension. Her pertinent laboratory findings include leukocytosis, low hemoglobin and hematocrit, thrombocytopenia, and transaminitis. She was resuscitated with IV fluids and blood transfusions. She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics after blood cultures were drawn. A CT abdomen and pelvis was performed which showed tiny foci of air at the anterior aspect of the native aneurysm wrap just inferior to the location where duodenum crosses (see ).

Due to squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus 17 month ago, he had undergone esophageal resection and interposition of a gastric tube with cervical anastomosis. This treatment was followed by adjuvant radio-chemotherapy (50 Gy with 5-FU and Cisplatin). The first signs of dysphagia developed 8 weeks before admission to our hospital. Initial endoscopic therapy revealed local tumor recurrence beginning at 21 cm from front incisors, but failed to provide palliation of dysphagia. The distal end of the stenosis could not be measured precisely due to high grade stenosis which could not be passed endoscopically. Though intravenous hyperalimentation was administered, the patient kept on losing weight. Furthermore recurrent pulmonary infections occurred and swallowing of salvia, without coughing became impossible. For palliative surgical treatment the patient was transferred to our institution. Unfortunately we found the esophageal lumen to be completely obstructed by recurrent tumor. Moreover the tumor had invaded the trachea and had caused an esophago-tracheal fistula. The fistula itself could not be seen endoscopically, but was found by gastrographin swallow and CT-scan (Figure , Figure ).

The patient also suffered a right intertrochanteric and a peri-implant femur fracture as well as a nondisplaced ulnar styloid process fracture. The patient was transferred from an outside hospital for further care. Upon arrival the patient was remarkably asymptomatic, in normal sinus rhythm, hemodynamically and respiratory stable, maintaining an O2 saturation between 95% and 100% with minimal supplemental O2 via nasal cannula. The patient denied significant chest pain or shortness of breath despite his significant injury burden. ECG findings showed some ST wave abnormalities suggestive of early repolarization. An initial troponin level of 0.15 normalized within 24h of admission. Given the patient's injury pattern and troponin leak in the absence of known coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) pulmonary embolism (PE), or shock, a formal TTE was obtained. TTE revealed severe tricuspid regurgitation secondary to flail anterior tricuspid valve leaflet with preserved right ventricular geometry and systolic function. The cardiac surgery team recommended outpatient follow-up for elective repair in two months with repeat TTE.\nThe femur fracture was repaired on hospital day two under general anesthesia and the patient recovered well. The chest tubes could be sequentially removed without recurrence of pneumothoraces over the course of the admission. On hospital day three the patient experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response that responded well to a single 5 mg intravenous bolus of metoprolol.

On the first medical examination at our hospital, we evaluated the skull base tumor with MRI (Figure ) and lung metastasis with chest-CT. Because lung metastasis remained stable, we performed Choline-PET and compared findings to those of FDG-PET. Choline accumulated in the tip of the right temporal lobe (SUV max 4.0) but FDG-PET could not detect in the tumor because it accumulated strongly throughout the whole brain without demonstrating the tumor (Figure ).

    "original_text": "A 51 year-old man was admitted on the surgical ward in November 2003 for a right-sided abdominal pain which had been present for three days. Clinically, he was jaundiced with a high temperature. Blood tests showed white cell count (20.8 \u00d7 103/mm3), bilirubin (103 mg/dl) and ESR (75 mm/h). All other blood tests were normal. Ultrasound and CT scans of the abdomen revealed fluid collection/mass measuring 14 cm in the right hepato-renal space. The mass was separated from the liver, pancreas and the right kidney, but there was lack of definition of the right suprarenal gland. Because the patient was jaundiced, we thought that draining the cyst would relieve the pressure on the biliary system and resolve jaundice. About 150 ml brown-coloured fluid was aspirated from the mass under CT guidance and a sample was sent for histology. Cytological examination of the sample reported presence of amorphous material with occasional histiocytic cells. There was no evidence of malignancy. The patient was discharged in December 2003 after making good recovery.\nIn January 2004, the patient was readmitted for an abdominal pain and pyrexia. A repeat CT scan confirmed recollection of fluids at the same site (Figure ). He underwent a laparotomy for excision of the mass and right adrenalectomy in February 2004. The specimen was sent for histopathology.\nMacroscopical examination of the specimen reported an open cyst measuring 190 mm \u00d7 110 mm \u00d7 0.5 mm.

There was no positive sign, except for tenderness in the epigastric region. The results of the laboratory tests, including determination of blood glucose levels, were almost within the normal range. Computed tomography of the upper abdomen revealed an atrophic pancreas with a dilated pancreatic duct containing a single stone located at the pancreatic neck; no mass in the pancreatic gland head or biliary dilatation was detected (Figure ). The size of the stone was approximately 1.0 cm \u00d7 0.6 cm. Based on the clinical signs and test result, a diagnosis of pancreatic duct stone with CP was established.\nGiven the presence of only one stone in the pancreatic main duct, we elected to perform laparoscopic pancreatic duct incision and stone removal, followed by T-type tube drainage, under general anesthesia after obtaining informed consent from the patient.\nDuring the operation, the patient received prophylactic antibiotics intravenously, and intermittent pneumatic compression therapy and graduated compression stockings were applied to the lower limbs. After catheterization of patient, he was installed in a flat Lloyd-Davies position. The patient was tilted in a 30-degrees reverse Trendelenberg position during the operation by the use of two 5-mm ports, two 10-mm ports, and one 12 mm port (Figure ).\nBy an ultrasonically activated scalpel, the lesser sac was opened via the gastrocolic omentum. Then, mobilization of the gastric antrum was performed, followed by upward retraction of the stomach to expose the front surface of the pancreatic head to the gland body.

The lump had been present for almost 1 year and had started to become painful, hard, and increasing in size in the last couple of months. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which showed evidence of tumor depicted on the dorsal subcutaneous aspect of the hand at the level of the 3rd and 4th metacarpal head digits measuring 2.4 \u00d7 2.1 cm in axial dimension and 3.7 cm in craniocaudal dimension, with volar extension to invade the muscles surrounding the 4th metacarpophalangeal joint, in close relation with the cortex of the 4th metacarpal bone and the proximal phalanx without definite invasion (Fig. ). It was reported that no signs of metastatic disease were found. A biopsy was done, which showed clear cell sarcoma, melanoma of the soft part, grade 2. The patient underwent incomplete excision outside our center, and the tumor was removed using a double incision (volar and dorsal approach).\nUpon his initial visit to our facility, the anterior and posterior incisions were completely healed and a drop in the ring finger was noted due to loss of extensor tendon, which was involved by the tumor as well. The specimen was reviewed and showed multiple peripheral and volar margins involved by the tumor. MRI of the right hand showed evidence of an ill-defined infiltrative soft tissue enhancement between the 3rd and 4th metacarpal bones extending through the metacarpophalangeal joint distally, but no definable well-defined nodules or masses. The enhancement was reaching the surrounding major tendons. Whole body positron emission tomography-computed tomography and brain MRI showed no evidence of metastatic disease.

A digital rectal examination was negative for bleeding. The laboratory workup demonstrated normocytic normochromic anemia, slightly elevated lactate dehydrogenase, a prolonged aPTT with a normal prothrombin time, and fibrinogen with absence of schistocytes on a blood film. An ultrasound was performed due to enlargement of the right shin, which excluded thrombosis and confirmed the presence of hematoma. Differential diagnoses included an adverse reaction due to heparin use, antiphospholipid syndrome, and bleeding disorder due to the presence of an acquired inhibitor in the clotting cascade.\nHeparin was discontinued and mixing studies were performed. Mixing with normal plasma did not correct the aPTT and the lupus anticoagulant test was negative. The presence of an acquired inhibitor of factor VIII was then suspected. Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform a Bethesda assay at the hematology laboratory of our hospital at that time due to lack of reagent. An investigation with immunological studies excluded other autoimmune diseases. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen was performed, exhibiting two peritoneal nodules compatible with metastasis. Therefore, his clinical condition was indirectly attributed to tumor recurrence.\nUpon establishing a diagnosis of acquired hemophilia, immunosuppressive treatment was initiated (Fig. ).

She had documented a history of persistent hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia since the last 8 years associated with intermittent fatigue and muscle weakness. Past medical history was significant for severe symptomatic hypomagnesemia after an episode of viral gastroenteritis in her early 20s although no detailed work up was done then. She has 3 children none of whom have congenital defects. She is a product of nonconsanguineous marriage. Her brother was diagnosed with \u201cBartter's syndrome\u201d in adolescence although details of the circumstances leading to either his diagnosis nor genetic testing were available. Her only medications were potassium chloride 20 meq p.o. BID and magnesium oxide 400 mg p.o. BID. She was an occasional drinker, ex-smoker quit 20 years prior, and denied using recreational drugs. Biochemical panel supporting a diagnosis of GS is presented in . Patient refused genetic testing. Subsequent to our first clinic evaluation, oral potassium and magnesium supplementation was increased and her electrolyte abnormalities remained in normal range till the event of interest.\nThe patient was lost to follow-up in the renal clinic for 4 years till she returned back in July 2008. Interval history was notable for a brief period of hospitalization in January 2008 from lumbar vertebral compression fracture due to a fall. As per records, preoperative biochemistry panel showed a serum Na of 128 mEq/L (last recorded value was normal in 2007).

The medical histories of the patient and his family were normal. Panoramic radiography and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) revealed that less than one-fourth of the root was formed, and it was shorter than that of the corresponding left maxillary molar; additionally, the crown was covered by a radiopaque lesion (Figure ). The differential diagnosis included odontoma, retention of the right maxillary first molar, and delayed root formation. The treatment plan involved the removal of the lesion to facilitate the eruption of the molar. During the first surgical procedure, which was performed under local anesthesia, the hard tissue covering the tooth was exposed to the oral cavity; however, the lesion could not be separated from the tooth. In due course, the tooth gradually emerged along with the lesion attached to it. A step lesion excavation was planned using an ultrasonic bone scalpel (Varios G95 and 970; Nakanishi Inc, Tochigi, Japan) and diamond bur. The procedure was painless and repeated five times over a period of 9 months from the age of 7 years and 3 months. At 7 years and 8 months of age, the occlusal surface of the molar located beneath the gingiva demonstrated a chalky-white appearance and was filled with carboxylate cement to prevent pulp infection.

He was the first child in his family and came from low socioeconomic status. No history of birth defect, head injury, trauma, central nervous system infections, malignancy and related conditions, except that a year prior, he had been admitted in the private hospital intensive care unit, for more than a month; a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed for treating hydrocephalus but there was no recorded history of infections and complications. He presented in our hospital with high-grade global type of headache, poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, decreased vision, and drowsiness. These are typical signs and symptoms for medulloblastoma. However, at admission he had no fever, cough, or chest pain. He was also conscious, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15/15, with no motor deficit or sensory disorder. On admission, his blood pressure (BP) was 140/85 mmHg, with a regular heartbeat of 60 beats per minute, heart sounds were clearly auscultated with no murmur, there was no murmur of mitral insufficiency or ventricular defect, no signs of heart failure, and he was without edema of his lower limbs. His peripheral pulses were perceived symmetrically. The rest of the physical examination was also normal.\nOn admission, a brain computed tomography (CT) scan and brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) was performed and indicated the presence of medulloblastoma (a mass that was involved the posterior fossa, Fig. ). An immediate craniotomy procedure was performed for the removal of the mass. A biopsy was also performed and revealed no malignancy or spread of brain tumor. The radiologist and neurologist team suggested that no further treatment was needed, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. However, following the craniotomy procedure, the neurological findings progressively deteriorated. This showed he had developed obstructive hydrocephalus as he presented with gait disturbance,",

The patient had bilateral papilledema and was complaining of frontal headache behind both eyes, sensitive to coughing, persistent nausea and vomiting, general lethargy, imbalance, poor concentration, and visual blurring. On examination, hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, space-occupying lesions, and venous sinus thrombosis were ruled out by imaging of the brain. Her neurological examination was normal with regard to limbs and cranial nerves. Assessment of the optic system showed normal color vision and visual acuity but infranasal field loss on the right and bilateral papilledema. A lumbar puncture (LP) was performed with an opening pressure was 33 mm H2O, and her symptoms improved significantly.\nIn her past medical history, the patient had been suffering from headaches since her first pregnancy in 2000 and since 2006 had been managed by a neurologist. In 2007, she had already been referred to a neurosurgeon since a left posterior frontal arachnoid cyst had been found on imaging of the brain. Although it was thought at the time that the cyst would be unlikely to be the cause of her headaches, a burr hole marsupialization was undertaken in 2008 which resulted in several months of good pain relief. Following on from this, the patient underwent a mini-craniotomy with further marsupialization of the cyst and obtained good symptom relief for further 6 months. Then, however, the symptoms reoccurred over the course of the next 2 years. With the cyst having been treated, the diagnosis of cluster headaches (responding well- to high-flow oxygen therapy) was made, and the patient attended a residential pain management programme in 2010 with good response.\nFurthermore, in 2012, the patient was involved in a camping gas",
