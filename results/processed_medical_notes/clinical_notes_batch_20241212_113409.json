The patient was hemodynamically stable but had clinical signs of acute peritonitis (involuntary guarding and rebound tenderness). Laparotomy was indicated and two minor small intestine perforations were found, without major vascular injuries. The patient recovered well, without need for abdominal reoperation.\nAfter trying to walk without aid, he complained of pain in the right groin extending to the medial aspect of the ipsilateral thigh. He noted that the pain worsened with full weight-bearing and movement of the hip joint. He also experienced some crepitation with hip joint movement.\nA pelvis radiograph was done, and a bullet was identified in the right hip joint. Part of the projectile was in an intra-articular position, confirmed by oblique views and computed tomography ( and ). We presumed that the bullet entered the left flank, perforated the peritoneum and intestine, and then struck the right acetabulum from the inside, losing speed and stopping inside the right hip joint.\nRemoval of the projectile was indicated, using an arthroscopic approach.

A gadolinium-enhanced head MRI at an outside hospital showed a cystic enhancing mass in the left temporal lobe of the brain. She underwent a neurosurgical resection, and the pathology demonstrated glioblastoma. She then received 6 weeks of external beam fractionated radiotherapy to 6,000 cGy (200 cGy in 30 fractions) with concomitant daily temozolomide at 75 mg/m2, followed by adjuvant temozolomide 200 mg/m2 for 5 days on a monthly basis. After 5 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide, new cystic enhancement was discovered while performing a head MRI (fig. ), and she was placed on 4 mg of dexamethasone 4 times/day. Bevacizumab was subsequently started at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. After 2 cycles of bevacizumab, there was only a partial decrease in the gadolinium enhancement and the size of the cystic tumor (fig. ). She then came to our institution and her original histological diagnosis was confirmed. Additional pathology testing revealed a negative IDH1 immunohistochemical labeling but a positive OLIG2, EGFR amplification and methylated MGMT promotor status. Because TTFields interrupt tumor cells during mitosis and have no appreciable overlapping toxicity with bevacizumab, we proceeded to add to her bevacizumab treatment TTFields therapy using the NovoTTF-100A device.

CT angiography (CTA) was attempted to locate a possible ruptured brain aneurysm; however, the contrast media was unable to penetrate the brain due to severe brain swelling, so it was impossible to evaluate the intracranial vessels. To reduce the intracranial pressure, an emergency decompressive craniectomy was performed. In addition to the severe brain swelling, a saccular aneurysm in the left middle cerebral artery was identified that was still actively bleeding. Thus, aneurysm neck clipping was performed. The surgery lasted for 3.5 hours, with norepinephrine administered because the patient's blood pressure could not be maintained. The patient's status worsened postoperatively, and she entered a coma, with pupils fixed at 7 mm. There were no notable changes other than a slightly changing pupil size, and her vital signs remained stable.

His physical and neurological examinations were normal on admission. He had taken several medications due to his PD. A lateral cervical X-ray image revealed subluxation at the C5-6 level and a cervical osteophyte at the anterior-inferior corner of C5 vertebrae. Cervical CT revealed a left-side C5 inferior articular process fracture and displacement. There was no cervical spinal cord compression on magnetic resonance imaging. We assessed the cervical facet fracture and subluxation and planned an elective surgery for the next day.\nThe surgery was performed with open reduction and pedicle screw fixation through the posterior approach. No abnormal events occurred during the perioperative period. However, a foreign body was incidentally found on a cervical spinal CT that was performed as a routine examination on postoperative day 3. The foreign body was located in front of the C6 vertebral body an appeared as a metal cervical interbody cage. The foreign body seemed to be located inside the esophagus and its Hounsfield unit value as 3,000. A cervical X-ray performed after three hours also showed the same foreign body in front of the C6 vertebrae (). We believed that it was a metal foreign body that the patient had carelessly eaten. Therefore, we planned to remove it with gastrofiberscopy (GFS). During the GFS that was performed three hours after the X-ray, we were unable to find anything in the esophagus. After removing the GFS, we again checked cervical spine and abdomen X-rays and found that there was no abnormal foreign body. Thus, we checked X-ray of the neck with the skin attached in relation to all of the patient's medications. We find that a Sinemet CR\u00ae (composite of levodopa and carbidopa) pill attached to the neck appeared as a radiopaque density and looked like a cage ().",

She also had no known allergies and no previous surgeries. Her mother had a history of breast cancer, and her father had a history of ischemic heart disease. A review of systems was otherwise negative. After workup in the emergency department and consultation by neurology, she was referred to neurosurgery for management of a high-grade brainstem tumor.\nExamination\nOn initial presentation, the patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15. Her pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. Cranial nerves II-XII were grossly intact. Motor testing revealed that strength was 5/5 in both upper and lower extremities. Pronator drift was noted in the right upper extremity. Dysmetria was noted in the right upper extremity during finger-to-nose testing, and discrimination of fine touch was subjectively diminished on the entire right side from the zygomatic process to the foot. Patellar reflexes were 3+ bilaterally. Over the course of her initial admission, the patient demonstrated a progressive decline, to include mild left facial droop, dysarthria, and a worsening dysphagia. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was placed because the patient was unable to swallow without effort. These findings continued until her initial discharge. Upon readmission, the patient displayed similar findings. Left lower quadrant abdominal pain radiating to the shoulder and acute numbness of the left chest and shoulder were also noted.

He was diagnosed with stage II esophageal cancer by endoscopy, computed tomography (CT) and fluorodeoxyglucose-enhanced positron emission tomography. Because his oral intake was insufficient due to the obstruction of the tumor, he underwent a laparoscopic jejunostomy prior to NAC []. At Day 10 after the initiation of the first course of NAC with CF, he experienced slight nausea and abdominal distention, which were treated with antiemetics. At Day 14 after the initiation of NAC, he had severe abdominal pain with lower abdominal tenderness. His body temperature was 37.7 \u00b0C and heart rate was 119 beats/min. Blood tests revealed an elevation in the C-reactive protein level (3.7 mg/dL) and renal dysfunction. CT scan revealed the presence of gas within the wall of the entire colon and a small amount of free air in the mesentery (Fig. A). Thus, he was diagnosed with PI. A colonoscopy revealed an edema of the mucosa with a white coat, which was not observed before NAC (Fig. ). Because there were no signs of intestinal ischemia and peritoneal irritation, we treated him conservatively; treatments included cessation of enteral nutrition, administration of meropenem hydrate and selective decontamination of the digestive tract, and oxygenation. The day after the initiation of these therapies, his abdominal pain improved. CT at Day 7 after the PI diagnosis showed that the gas within the wall had disappeared (Fig. B). Because NAC with CF was highly suspected to have caused PI, we abandoned the second course of CF therapy. The therapeutic effect of NAC resulted in a stable disease. We carried out video-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy on Day 14 after the initiation of NAC. An intraoperative laparoscopy showed no significant findings in the serosa of the colon and no intra-abdominal abnormal adhesions. He was discharged from our hospital without any complications, including PI recurrence.",

The patient had regular menses and a history of cesarean delivery 3 years prior with no other significant medical history, or history of sexually transmitted infections.\nThe patient\u2019s transvaginal ultrasound was notable for a uterus anteflexed with a gestational sac of 12 mm and embryo of 4 mm with positive cardiac activity located on the anterior aspect of the lower uterine segment. The anterior aspect of the myometrium measured 5.2 mm and the lower uterine segment measured 1.5 mm.

The patient\u2019s serum quantitative beta human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) was 3600 UI/L. At presentation, her vitals were within normal limits and stable.\nThese ultrasound findings raised the suspicion of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy. Following appropriate counseling, the patient confirmed her desire for future fertility and, understanding the risks and benefits, she agreed to medical treatment. An initial dose of intramuscular methotrexate at one milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) was administered. At one week follow-up, she received a three multi-dose regimen over a period of five days. Three doses of folinic acid were added to the treatment. After a systemic treatment of multiple doses for one week, the patient was asymptomatic and the betahCG serum level was 5809 UI/L. An aspiration curettage was thus performed in the ultrasound operating room, affording possible transvaginal access by imprinting the sac at the cervical level. During the curettage, access to the gestational sac area was achieved by obtaining decidual material. The pathological report showed decidual remains. On follow-up the next day, the patient\u2019s serum quantitative beta-hCG was 1371 UI/L. The following week, a transvaginal ultrasound confirmed an empty uterine cavity and endometrium measuring 5",

The latissimus dorsi muscle and incision were closed without leaving a chest drain.\nBiopsy results were compatible with angio-lymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia and in this case, EH (Fig. ). The surgical margins could not be assessed, as the specimen was in fragments. Therefore, excision of the lesion was recommended.\nFollowing the surgery, the patient was readmitted to the hospital several times with severe right chest pain under maximum analgesic treatment. After other chest pain pathologies were excluded, the decision was made to perform a rib resection.\nIn January 2020, the rib resection was performed through a small incision on the previous surgical scar with two additional incisions for thoracoscopy control and instrument insertion.

He had previously undergone partial resection of a soft-tissue mass in the right thigh during early childhood and his thirties at another hospital. However, the residual mass had gradually increased in size, eventually causing discomfort and pain. The details of the previous surgical treatment were not available. The patient had no other significant medical or family history except laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones 16 years ago. A physical examination revealed a diffuse, compressible swelling extending from the right proximal thigh to the back of the knee (). The swelling was massive, especially in the frontal aspect of the thigh, and a blue discoloration of the skin suggested an invasion of vascular lesions into the skin. No limb-length discrepancy was observed. Laboratory data revealed elevated D-dimer (7.52 \u00b5g/mL) and fibrin degradation product (FDP; 15.3 \u00b5g/mL) levels. Other laboratory data were within the normal ranges. Short inversion time inversion recovery (STIR) T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an area of high signal intensity in the subcutaneous tissue of the right lower extremity, indicating a large VM (). The lesion was well-circumscribed, and the structures below the muscle fascia were normal. Right femoropopliteal arteriography revealed no evidence of abnormal hypervascular lesions or rapid arteriovenous shunting (). Based on these findings, a clinical diagnosis of a slow-flow VM was made. After discussing the case among the relevant departments, complete surgical resection was indicated because the lesion was located in the subcutaneous tissue and was well-circumscribed. The operation was performed under general anesthesia. A skin incision was made over the lesion in a zig-zag manner to prevent scar contracture.

    "original_text": "A 55-year-old female came to dermatology outpatient department with a single ulcerated mass measuring 5 \u00d7 4 cm, involving left nasolabial fold and cheek. The lesion had developed 3 years back. Base of the ulcer was covered with granulation tissue. She also had multiple asymptomatic, small, firm, skin-colored papules and nodules all over the face and neck since 25 years []. General physical and systemic examination revealed no abnormality. Routine laboratory investigations were within normal limits. There was no history of consanguinity in the family. A skin biopsy was performed from both the ulcerated mass and one of the papules present on the neck.\nHistopathological examination of the ulcerated mass showed focal ulceration of epidermis with underlying tumor composed of basaloid cells in nests, cords and solid sheets in a myxoid background []. Focal peripheral palisading and retraction artifact was also seen []. The cells were small, monomorphic with round to oval hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Squamous differentiation was seen within some of the cell nests []. Frequent mitosis was present with focal areas of necrosis []. Intervening stroma showed acute and chronic inflammatory cells. On immunohistochemistry (IHC), basaloid cells were positive for Bcl2 (diffuse, ) and CD10 []. CD34 was negative in the stromal as well as the epithelial cells [] while an epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) was positive in the squamous cells [].

Diaphragmatic plication was performed with a 10-cm low lateral thoracotomy incision at the ninth intercostal space. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient presented 1 year later, complaining of pain in the left lateral chest wall and left abdominal upper quadrant along with a sensation of fullness in the epigastric region which started 4 weeks after the surgery. The pain was described as sharp and stabbing exacerbated by movement and local touch, which was rated as 7/10 on visual analogue scale (VAS) on the lateral chest wall. The sensation of fullness in the epigastric region was aggravated by the upright posture, food intake and bending forwards rather than coughing or deep breathing.

The patient had been previously diagnosed with a right-sided aortic arch with ALSA originating from KD. On physical examination, we found that her blood pressure was 112/60 mmHg in both arms, and her heart rate was regular at 90 beats per minute. Furthermore, no carotid bruits or any other abnormal findings were observed. Concomitantly, the laboratory examinations were unremarkable. Chest X-ray revealed a tortuous aorta with the absence of the left first aortic arch. While transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated no congenital anomaly, computed tomography (CT) revealed the right-sided aortic arch and KD with the maximal diameter 33 mm (). Three-dimensional CT scanning showed the proximal-to-distal order of the branches of the aortic arch to be as follows: the left common carotid artery, right common carotid artery, right subclavian artery, and ALSA originating from the KD (). Moreover, a right common iliac artery aneurysm with a maximal diameter of 48 mm could be recognized.\nOn the day before the scheduled surgery for iliac aneurysm, the subject complained of sudden back pain and numbness of the left arm. CT analysis revealed a retrograde type A aortic dissection and occlusion of ALSA. The false lumen had thrombosed, and an intimal tear was found in the KD (). The ascending aorta was 39 mm in maximal diameter, and the thrombosed false lumen was 10 mm thick (). ALSA originating from the KD was obstructed due to compression of the false lumen.

Shortly after delivery she was found to have an ectopic 3rd kidney and a patent ductus arteriosus which required surgical closure at 18 months of age. Her development was normal with no history of seizures, meningitis, encephalitis or major head trauma. She was noted to have thrombocytopenia at age 23 years after complaints of unexplained weight loss. Bone marrow aspiration did not reveal any abnormalities. She continues to have easy bruising and prolonged bleeding time. She had her first seizure at 24 years with no evidence of any precipitating factors. Her neurologic examination was normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral multiple and diffuse PNH (Figure \n). She has episodic headache with photophobia and phonophobia. An echocardiography at age 32 years revealed a mildly dilated aortic root and ascending aorta with mild aortic regurgitation.The second patient, a younger sister of the index case, is now 36 years of age. Her medical history is relevant for migraine headaches with visual aura. Her neurologic examination was normal and her EEG did not show any interictal abnormalities.

    "original_text": "A 48-year-old heterosexual African man presented as an emergency with a progressive disabling anal pain for three days on a background one-year history of a chronic anal ulcer. He has not been on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) since being diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 2)-positive 11 years ago. The exquisite anal pain was constant, exacerbated by bowel motions and not relieved by opiate analgesia. There was no altered bowel habit but the fear of defaecation made him constipated and exacerbated the symptoms. There was no anal discharge or rectal bleeding on defaecation. He had no fever, night sweats, or anorexia but had lost weight significantly. He has a long history of severe anal pruritus which he believes precipitated the anal ulcer. Physical examination revealed a wasted man in great anal distress but with normal vital signs. Chest, cardiovascular and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. There was no soilage on inspection of the perineum and underclothes but perianal examination revealed excoriation and ichthycosis indicating long-standing pruritus. There was superficial scarring with macular patches from probable chronic herpetic simplex lesions. There was no characteristic visible posterior anal fissure or reactive perianal skin tag. A digital rectal examination was not done because of severe anal pain and spasm. He consented to examination under anaesthesia and appropriate surgical treatment. His haemoglobin level was 9 g/L but white blood cell and CD4 counts were not available. Under general anaesthesia, in the lithotomy position a digital rectal examination revealed a posterior broad based anal ulcer. Proctoscopy showed the ulcer commencing above the dentate line in the lower rectum and ending below at the anoderm just distal to the internal anal sphincter.

An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Laboratory investigations were within normal limits except for a low TSH and elevated free T3 and T4. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a large echogenic mobile mass with central constriction attached to the interventricular septum (IVS), occupying the entire right atrium and right ventricle (RV) and obstructing the flow of the tricuspid valve. There were two other masses of the same echogenicity: one was occupying the left ventricle (LV) and the other was in the left atrium attached to the interatrial septum at the site of fossa ovalis (, Videos ). The left ventricular dimensions and function were normal. Cardiac magnetic resonance showed similar findings with no septal invasion and tissue characterization suggestive of multiple myxomas (). Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed the same findings () in addition to an enlarged thyroid nodule and a left adrenal cyst that measures 65 \u00d7 57 mm (). Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland revealed a markedly enlarged right lobe of the thyroid with normal vascularity. Serum aldosterone, dexamethasone suppression test, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and 24-hour urine metanephrines were within normal limits.\nThe patient underwent surgery where all three masses were excised. However, the tricuspid valve was inseparable from the RV mass; hence, it was replaced with a tissue prosthesis. The masses were grossly reddish grey in color, fleshy, and gelatinous in consistency (). The histopathological examination of the excised masses revealed myxomatous cellular proliferations with sparse collagen fibers consistent with multiple myxomas (Figures and ). The patient was followed up on 6-month intervals. After 2 years of follow-up, the adrenal cyst was stable in size",

The pain was so incapacitating that she was not able to sit or stand. There was no history of any recent or previous injury or fall, and no history of a fever or constitutional symptoms. She was of short stature, thinly built, and kyphotic posture. There was tenderness on palpation of lower dorsal and lumbar vertebrae and movements were painfully restricted. There was no sensory or motor deficit. There was difficulty in carrying out routine activities, which compelled the patient to seek advice.\nRadiographs () showed kyphoscoliosis and multiple vertebral fractures. An MRI of the spine () showed vertebral compression fractures of D8, D9, D11, L2, and L3 vertebral bodies. Intervertebral discs and the spinal cord appeared to be normal. A detailed history was taken rule out cause of multiple pathological fractures. She was a multigravida (second delivery), having had her first child eight years ago.

History revealed that about 10 days back, she had an abrupt onset of blurring of vision, with tingling sensation on the left half of her body. This subsequently improved within 12 h after being given benzodiazepines. Prominent behavioral changes followed this. She became exceedingly talkative, started repeating the same phrases many times, and would often ask for food after eating. She was unable to remember the particulars of her son like which class he was studying in. Reportedly, she was unaware of date and day, which started improving after about 7 days of onset of her illness. Biological functions were within physiological limit. She was unable to perform her household activities during the period, though she was taking care of her basic personal care under supervision. There was no history of psychoactive substance use. History of past medical or surgical or psychiatric illness revealed hypertension and occasional headache but without any psychiatric illness. Her medication history revealed she was on oral contraceptive pills and antihypertensive. There was no past history of any mental illness. Family history revealed dementia in her paternal grandfather. On physical examination, no focal neurodeficit was observed. She was cooperative toward the examiner, yet appeared anxious, restless and had stereotyped repetition of certain phrases. Speech output was increased in volume, and she was answering the queries of the examiner in an occasional irrelevant manner. No psychotic symptom was elicited. Judgment and insight was maintained. Her hematological and biochemical profile on the day of visit was unremarkable []. She was started on divalproex sodium 500 mg at night.

However, leg weakness and swelling developed one week prior, and the patient was consequently transferred to the oncology department of our hospital with a suspected spinal or vertebral metastasis.

There was no specific finding showing an acute infarct on brain MRI. The overall imaging findings were suggestive of preseptal and septal cellulitis. Therefore, teicoplanin and ceftriaxone were administered because of concern about the potential for clinical complications of orbital cellulitis including visual disturbances and central nervous system manifestations.\nUpon physical examination at our clinic, the patient presented with localized relatively ill-demarcated erythematous swelling and indurations at the left upper and lower eyelid ().

The patient had a history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Physical examination upon admission revealed no anemia (via conjunctival pallor examination), jaundice or pulmonary abnormalities. On palpation, the abdomen of the patient was soft and flat, with no areas of tenderness. Furthermore, pretibial edema was not observed and superficial lymph nodes were not palpable. Serum concentrations of the tumor markers, carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, were within the normal ranges (<5 ng/ml and 0\u201337 U/ml, respectively). However, X-ray examination indicated reduced gastric distension, as well as deformation of the stomach, which exhibited a leather bottle-like appearance (). In addition, the lower gastric body demonstrated luminal narrowing and increased rigidity, with a depressed lesion (longest diameter, 20 mm) at the posterior wall of the gastric antrum and abdominal computed tomography revealed thickening of the antrum. No lymphadenopathy was observed. Additionally, endoscopy revealed an ulcerative lesion covered by a white necrotic substance on the posterior wall of the antrum () and severe luminal narrowing, with poor distension of the lower gastric body. The upper gastric body, however, demonstrated good extension when compared with the middle and lower gastric bodies. The folds of the gastric antrum were flexible, stretched smoothly, and crossed one another, resulting in a waffle-like appearance on the greater curvature of the upper gastric body (). Analysis of biopsy specimens from the ulcerative lesion revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma containing signet ring cells, however, adenocarinoma was absent from biopsy specimens obtained from the abnormally crossed folds.

The enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans showed the well-enhanced mass, sized 6.2\u00d72.6\u00d75.1 cm in the right frontal scalp, and diffuse growth of intracranial tumor accompanying the hyperostotic change of the skull bone (). Brain magnetic resonance images revealed the well-enhanced tumors with bony infiltration in the right frontal region, diffuse meningeal thickening with multiple cystic changes in the right hemisphere (). Main feeder of tumor was the right external carotid artery, and anterior part of the superior sagittal sinus was compressed by tumor. She underwent a total removal of the scalp tumor and bifrontal craniectomy under impression of extracranial extension of intracranial meningioma. In consideration of the patient's age and tumor location adjacent to the eloquent area, intracranial tumor with thickened dura mater was partially removed, and followed by duroplasty with cranioplasty. The outer table of skull was rough, and tumor was firm and tan-gray color intraoperatively. The tumor was diffusely adhere to the brain surface was observed and it was not possible to undergo total resection without cortical injury.\nHistopathological examination of the tumor specimen demonstrated a mass composed of geographic necrosis, increased cellularity, patternless or sheet like pattern and invasion, mild to moderate pleomorphism. Four or more mitotic cells per 10 high-power fields were seen, but mitotic numbers were not over twenty ().

He had degloving soft tissue injury over the right heel for which debridement was done at the hospital where he was referred from.\nPelvis x-ray and CT scan was taken and showed right side overlapping symphysis pubis associated with ipsilateral transverse acetabular fracture type (). The x-ray of the right leg showed a closed tibial shaft fracture.\nThe patient was unable to maintain his O2 saturation with atmospheric breathing at the emergency room. He was put on intranasal O2 support for a lung contusion injury he had. He had no urinary complaint or blood at the urethral meatus, therefore a Foley catheter was inserted with no need for cystourethrography. He was taken to the operating theater 10 days after the injury. Closed reduction of the locked symphysis was not attempted inorder to avoid further displacment of the ipsilateral acetabular fracture.
