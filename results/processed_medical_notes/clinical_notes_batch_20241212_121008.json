Her serum creatinine was 1444 \u03bcmol/L, and her blood urea nitrogen was 48.7 mmol/L. Her serum potassium was 6.2 mmol/L. She was mentally retarded with aggressive behavior. She had had dialysis catheter placed many times which she had pulled out during her bursts of aggressive behavior. Arteriovenous fistula was done one time which also failed. This time she presented without a dialysis catheter. We decided to place a permacath in the operation theater. She was given light general anesthesia. We chose the internal jugular as the vein of choice for the procedure. With the ultrasound, we assessed her internal jugulars. Her previous tunneled catheter which she had pulled out before was in the right internal jugular. This time the right internal jugular could not be visualized at all with ultrasound. It was presumed that either it was thrombosed or hidden in the fibrosis of the surrounding soft tissues. The left internal jugular was visible clearly. Under sterile precautions, it was punctured under ultrasound guidance, and the guide wire was passed. There was a slight difficulty in passing the guide wire but after some manipulation it passed. There were no ectopics in the electrocardiogram when the guide wire was passed. Ultrasound was used and guide wire was identified as a bright speck inside the internal jugular vein (IJV) in short axis. Fluoroscope was not used as it was engaged in some other case.

    "original_text": "A 41-year-old male with a past medical history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) presented to our emergency department as a transfer following two days of medical management of rhabdomyolysis at an outside community hospital. He initially presented with weakness and numbness of the lower extremities. He had been using intravenous heroin and was lying supine on a floor for approximately 24 hours.\nUpon presentation to our emergency department, the patient had pain in his bilateral lower extremities and no appreciable motor function below the level of the knee. He was in mild distress with a temperature of 37\u00b0C, pulse of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 146/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Examination of the lower extremities revealed erythema and tension in the bilateral posterior thigh compartments. In contrast, the medial thigh compartments bilaterally along with all four leg compartments were soft. Gluteal and buttock compartments were soft and compressible bilaterally. Motor strength testing revealed 1/5 strength bilaterally with manual testing of ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, and knee flexion and extension. The patient was found to have bilateral sciatic nerve palsies, with no sensation bilaterally in the tibial nerve, deep and superficial peroneal nerve distributions. Both legs were warm and pink with brisk capillary refill along with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. Provocative testing demonstrated pain with passive range of motion of the knees bilaterally and no pain with passive ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion.

    "original_text": "A 16-year-old female diagnosed with a left atrial (LA) tumor, suggestive of myxoma, was referred to our hospital. Electrocardiography conducted at high school enrollment revealed premature ventricular contraction. She was diagnosed with a LA tumor by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and was referred to us from a peripheral hospital. TTE showed a 16 \u00d7 20 mm mass arising from the anterior wall of the left atrium extending to the anterior mitral annulus. We diagnosed the patient with myxoma. Further assessment by enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a large low-density mass (25 mm) in the left atrium. She underwent surgery 2 months later. TTE showed that the mass had increased to 19 \u00d7 28 mm.\nTumor resection was performed. During surgery, the tumor was found to have an irregular LA surface of 30 \u00d7 30 mm, which invaded the left inferior pulmonary vein from the atrial septum (a). We suspected a malignant tumor and requested intraoperative evaluation. The diagnosis suggested sarcoma, resulting in incomplete resection. The histopathological diagnosis was high-grade spindle cell sarcoma. Postoperative 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) initially showed localized FDG hyperaccumulation near the left pulmonary vein junction in the left atrium but no indication of distant metastasis. The patient then underwent CIRT, at a total dose of 64 Gy/16 fractions over 4 weeks, for residual lesions in the heart. PET following CIRT did not indicate any previous accumulation in the residual tumor. These findings suggested that tumor cell activity had stopped.\nAt 1 year after surgery, PET showed FDG accumulation in the left atrium and right clavicle outside the irradiation field, and she was diagnosed with recurrence and metastasis.

The well-enhanced tumor was located at the ventral portion of the cord and the linear syrinx was located from the cervicomedullary junction to C7. For tumor removal, a suboccipital decompression and removal of the tumor was performed at the local hospital. The pathologic finding was an ependymoma at that time.

The follow-up MRI 6 months later after the first surgery revealed an enlarged enhancing tumor and syrinx compared with initial MRI (). The patient was referred to our institution and the initial neurologic examination demonstrated that she had grade 4 motor weakness of her right arm with tingling sensations.

Her past social history was negative for alcoholism or smoking. Work up of the patient including physical examination and laboratory indices were all normal. A multi-detector CT of the abdomen and pelvis utilizing a pancreatic mass protocol (arterial, portal venous and delayed phases) was performed which revealed a diffusely enlarged pancreas with extensive parenchymal calcifications (). No discrete mass was identified in the pancreas. Minimal pancreatic ductal dilatation was noted on the CT examination. The patient was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis and followed clinically for several years. In 2015, the patient presented with recurrent abdominal pain. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis with pancreatic mass protocol was repeated (), which revealed new hypoattenuating masses in the pancreatic neck and tail. Some of the smaller tumours were hypervascular on the arterial phase imaging. There was redemonstration of extensive parenchymal calcifications. No pancreatic atrophy was identified. The pancreatic duct remained minimally dilated. Given the new masses many of which were arterially enhancing, the possibility of neuroendocrine tumour was raised. A MRI of the abdomen with pancreatic mass protocol (T2 with fat saturation, MRCP, in and out of phase T1 and unenhanced T1/arterial/portal/ 5 min delayed post-contrast T1) was performed (). The MRI confirmed multiple well-circumscribed masses throughout the pancreas, many of which had increased T2 signal with cystic change. The pancreatic duct was at most mildly prominent, and no lesions were identified outside of the pancreas. The largest pancreatic mass in the tail measured approximately 3.5 cm, with peripheral enhancement and central hypointense signal ().

Her height was 152 cm, weight was 40.8 kg, and body mass index (BMI) was 17.7 kg/m2. Her blood pressure and heart rate were 110/60 mmHg and 88/minute, respectively. Her age at menarche was 13 years, her menstrual cycle was 30 days, and her periods lasted 5 days. The patient had undergone surgery for choledochal dilation at 2 years of age and had no significant family history. She was diagnosed with a complete hydatidiform mole at 9 weeks, 0 days of gestation from the last menstruation.\nA small amount of dark red genital bleeding was observed during the medical examination, and the uterus was the size of a neonatal head, which was larger than the size corresponding to 9 weeks, 0 days of gestation. Transvaginal ultrasonography did not show a gestational sac and embryo, but it revealed many small cysts in the uterus. No bilateral ovarian swelling was observed. The blood human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level was markedly increased and was as high as 980,823 IU (normal limit < 5 IU). On the basis of these findings, we diagnosed her pregnancy as a complete hydatidiform mole, and legally induced abortion was performed at 9 weeks, 5 days of gestation using an aspiration instrument. We explained the necessity of the procedure to the patient and her parents and obtained written informed consent from them.\nMacroscopically, the uterine content was only cystic villi without obvious fetal components. Histopathological examination also revealed a complete hydatidiform mole.

This lesion has been regularly examined in follow-up for the last 14 years. On clinical examination, the left maxilla was enlarged and the bone was hard on palpation. The mucosa overlying the lesion seemed to be intact (). In 2002, she visited our dental hospital for treatment of a periodontal condition on the entire dentition. She had already recognized bony swelling on the left maxilla decades ago, but recalled no experience of pain or fever. Her medical history did not contain anything of significance. Computed tomography in 2002 showed a ground-glass appearance of the left maxilla, which was compatible with FD (). Bucco-lingual cortical expansion, but no cortical destruction, was observed. This lesion extended from the midline to the left maxillary tuberosity. We tentatively diagnosed FD. We recommended removal surgery if pain or discomfort persisted. She refused surgical treatment due to a fear of surgery and felt no need for it, since there was no pain and the lesion was not increasing in size. She preferred watchful waiting. She was advised to visit the dental hospital regularly to check changes in growth. Panoramic radiography in 2007 () showed a diffuse, widespread, radiopaque lesion in the left maxilla and maxillary sinus. A periapical view in 2007 showed a ground-glass appearance and indistinct anterior border of the lesion. There was no root resorption or displacement of surrounding teeth. The loss of alveolar lamina dura was also observed ().\nIn 2008, we performed bone scintigraphy using 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) for detecting the distribution of the lesion.

    "original_text": "A 40-year-old woman, gravida 0, was admitted to Seoul National University Bundang Hospital in August 2011 for elective Cesarean section and prophylactic intraoperative UAE at 36 weeks and 6 days gestational age. Two thirds of the placenta was located in the posterior wall of the uterus and the remaining placenta was located in the anterior lower segment of the uterus resulting in complete covering of the internal os of cervix. Under spinal anesthesia, a low transverse uterine incision was made and after gently penetrating part of the placenta directly behind the incision site, a live 2,815 g baby was delivered. The upper and lower cut edges and each lateral angle of the uterine incision were clamped using Allis forceps. The torn placental margin was also clamped using Allis forceps. An interventional radiologist, who had been already stood by, stepped into the operation field and then inserted an angiographic catheter into the right femoral artery and approached both uterine arteries using portable fluoroscopy. Insertion of the catheter took five minutes. During that time, the surgeon had observed the uterus carefully for detection of bleeding. Embolization was performed with gelfoam under fluoroscopic guidance for bilateral enlarged tortuous uterine arteries and it took 20 minutes (). After confirming via angiography that there was markedly decreased blood flow, the surgeon removed the placenta. However, bleeding from the implantation site was profuse even though both uterine arteries had been embolized. Bleeding was ultimately controlled by over-sewing the implantation site with 0-monofilament absorbable suture and the rest of the surgery was uneventful.

    "cleaned_text": "a 40-year-old woman, gravida 0, was admitted to seoul national university bundang hospital in august 2011 for elective cesarean section and prophylactic intraoperative uae at 36 weeks and 6 days gestational age. two thirds of the placenta was located in the posterior wall of the uterus and the remaining placenta was located in the anterior lower segment of the uterus resulting in complete covering of the internal os of cervix. under spinal anesthesia, a low transverse uterine incision was made and after gently penetrating part of the placenta directly behind the incision site, a live 2,815 g baby was delivered. the upper and lower cut edges and each lateral angle of the uterine incision were clamped using allis forceps. the torn placental margin was also clamped using allis forceps. an interventional radiologist, who had been already stood by, stepped into the operation field and then inserted an angiographic catheter into the right femoral artery and approached both uterine arteries using portable fluoroscopy. insertion of the catheter took five minutes. during that time, the surgeon had observed the uterus carefully for detection of bleeding. embolization was performed with gelfoam under fluoroscopic guidance for bilateral enlarged tortuous uterine arteries and it took 20 minutes (). after confirming via angiography that there was markedly decreased blood flow, the surgeon removed the placenta. however, bleeding from the implantation site was profuse even though both uterine arteries had been embolized. bleeding was ultimately controlled by over-sewing the implantation site with 0-monofilament absorbable suture and the rest of the surgery was uneventful. estimated blood loss for this surgery was 2,500 ml. the patient received five units of packed red blood cells and three units of fresh frozen plasma during the operation. the next day, the patient's hemoglobin was 10.1 g/dl and the sheaths were removed. routine postoperative care was performed and the patient was discharged from the hospital four days after surgery with no complications.",

    "original_text": "A 56-year-old woman presented to our hospital with acute congestive heart failure. She needed dobutamine support and bilevel positive airway pressure for NYHA class IV dyspnea. Chest radiography revealed congestive heart failure. Echocardiography revealed severe aortic stenosis with heavily calcific bicuspid valve; the LVEF was significantly reduced at 15%. The aortic valve area measured 0.52 cm2. Mean pressure gradient was 49 mmHg. A peak aortic jet velocity was 4.4 m/s. Right-heart catheterization revealed a cardiac index of 1.6 L/min/m2 and pulmonary hypertension with the mean pulmonary artery pressure of 55 mmHg. Coronary angiography showed normal coronary vasculature without signs of significant stenosis. The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 37 mmHg. Computed tomography demonstrated a mildly dilated ascending aorta with a diameter of 42 mm. She was diagnosed as heart failure reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) due to severe aortic stenosis. The society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted mortality score was 12.4%.\nOur heart team discussed her treatment. Our patient was a younger AS patient with severe LV contractile dysfunction and with bicuspid valve. Considering the severe LV contractile dysfunction, the patient seemed suitable for TAVI as the lack of ischemic cardiac arrest and extracorporeal circulation helps avoid ischemia, as well as ischemic reperfusion injury, inflammatory reaction, and oxidative stress. However, we hesitated to perform TAVI for this patient because extension of TAVI to such a younger patient with longer life-expectancy raises the issue of durability. Leaflet asymmetry of the implanted transcatheter heart valve which might occur after deployment into bicuspid valve may have an impact on long-term valve durability. While, conventional SAVR is possible while the heart is arrested with cardioplegic arrest, which is effective in majority of AS patients with acceptable morbidity and mortality.

    "original_text": "A 30-year-old male visited a local doctor due to the onset of coughing with sputum. He had not previously had any health problems. A chest roentgenogram revealed a tumor in the right hilum. A tumor measuring approximately 60 mm in length was detected in the middle mediastinum by plain chest computed tomography (CT), with a small amount of pleural effusion inside the right thoracic cavity (Fig ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cystic mass. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with a middle mediastinal tumor and was referred to our hospital. Although he had a mild fever with coughing with sputum, no other symptoms were observed at the initial visit to our hospital. Laboratory tests showed a mildly elevated inflammatory response. Sputum cultures were negative for tuberculosis, fungi, and other bacteria, and the results of cytological studies were unremarkable.\nA chest-enhanced CT scan taken at our hospital showed spontaneous regression in the tumor size and right intrapulmonary consolidation, which came in contact with the tumor (Fig ). Therefore, we commenced the administration of antibiotics. The radiographic intrapulmonary consolidation subsequently disappeared, C-reactive protein (CRP) became negative, and pyrexia improved.

Her past social history was negative for alcoholism or smoking. Work up of the patient including physical examination and laboratory indices were all normal. A multi-detector CT of the abdomen and pelvis utilizing a pancreatic mass protocol (arterial, portal venous and delayed phases) was performed which revealed a diffusely enlarged pancreas with extensive parenchymal calcifications (). No discrete mass was identified in the pancreas. Minimal pancreatic ductal dilatation was noted on the CT examination. The patient was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis and followed clinically for several years. In 2015, the patient presented with recurrent abdominal pain. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis with pancreatic mass protocol was repeated (), which revealed new hypoattenuating masses in the pancreatic neck and tail. Some of the smaller tumours were hypervascular on the arterial phase imaging. There was redemonstration of extensive parenchymal calcifications. No pancreatic atrophy was identified. The pancreatic duct remained minimally dilated. Given the new masses many of which were arterially enhancing, the possibility of neuroendocrine tumour was raised. A MRI of the abdomen with pancreatic mass protocol (T2 with fat saturation, MRCP, in and out of phase T1 and unenhanced T1/arterial/portal/ 5 min delayed post-contrast T1) was performed (). The MRI confirmed multiple well-circumscribed masses throughout the pancreas, many of which had increased T2 signal with cystic change. The pancreatic duct was at most mildly prominent, and no lesions were identified outside of the pancreas. The largest pancreatic mass in the tail measured approximately 3.5 cm, with peripheral enhancement and central hypointense signal ().

Both parents did not report any previous history of tooth abnormalities or genetic anomalies on either maternal or paternal family part of the case. There was negative history concerning the delayed eruption of the maxillary left teeth compared to their counterparts. Based on her mother\u2019s report, the abscess existed from six month ago and its size was reduced after administration of antibiotics.\nThe extra-oral examination revealed no swelling, no facial asymmetry and the lymph nodes were not palpable.\nThe intra-oral examination showed the occlusion type was mesial step on both sides and the oral hygiene was excellent. Oral mucosa was normal, except for an abscess on the gingiva above the maxillary left primary molar; which was fluctuant and about 0.5 x o.5 cm2 in size.\nAll the primary teeth on the left quadrant of the maxilla had abnormal crown, with a yellowish discoloration and hypoplastic enamel. The right maxillary central and lateral incisors as well as the canine had minor caries. The first primary molar was considerably hypoplastic with an obvious carious lesion. The abscess was considered to be related to the maxillary left first primary molar. The right maxillary and mandibular teeth were normal and caries-free ().\nThe periapical () and the panoramic radiographs were taken and the radiological images showed that the mandibular and the right maxillary teeth were normal.

He was diagnosed with ADHD at 15 years of age and was prescribed mixed amphetamine salts. His starting dose of mixed amphetamine salts was 7.5 mg and he took it for 5 years after the diagnosis. He restarted taking it 6 months prior to presentation as his symptoms were interfering with his daily activities. He had been prescribed 20 mg of mixed amphetamine salts twice daily but three months back had cut back on his dose to 20 mg once a day, on account of intermittent self-limiting episodes of palpitations lasting 5\u201310 minutes. He did not seek medical attention for these symptoms. On the day of presentation, he had taken mixed amphetamine salts 20 mg in the morning and later took 10 mg in the afternoon. However, that evening he also consumed four 16-ounce beers but denied any smoking or use of illicit drugs. After about 1-2 hours, he developed significant palpitations that were different in nature and lasted longer along with shortness of breath and lightheadedness without any chest pain, nausea, or diaphoresis.\nHis past medical history was unremarkable except for ADHD. He did not have other symptoms or signs suggestive of pheochromocytoma or hyperthyroidism. There was no family history of cardiovascular diseases. He admitted occasional use of alcohol and marijuana (once a month) but denied the use of energy drinks or other illicit drugs. He had no known drug allergies and took no other medications other than mixed amphetamine salts.

She complained of ear discharge from the right ear 2 weeks back and subsequently developed tingling and numbness on right side of forehead and scalp. She also complained of occasional attacks of excruciating pain in the same area for which she took analgesics without much relief. She consulted a physician who advised a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head which was normal. There was no history of seizures. She denied application of any topical medications at the site. While eliciting clinical history, she appeared disinterested and kept her eyes closed. On further inquiry, her sister disclosed that her husband was an alcoholic, and they had some financial problems. There was no history of any injury or assault before the onset of the skin lesions.\nOn general examination, the patient was conscious but appeared uncooperative and disinterested. An area of 15 cm \u00d7 10 cm on the right side of forehead extending to involve the right eyelid and right pinna showed areas of bruising, scalding, edema, and discoloration. There was complete loss of hair involving the lateral half of right eyebrow and anterior part of right frontal and temporal areas []. There were no broken off hairs or burnt or charred hairs seen on the affected area or on the periphery of the lesion. The conjunctival mucosa of the right eye was congested. Hair pull test and hair microscopy of hairs from the margin of the lesion and eyebrows were normal. No bubble hairs were seen on hair microscopy.

He also gave history of nasal obstruction with occasional epistaxis. His past medical and surgical history is non-contributory. He had the habit of tobacco, betel nut chewing for the past eight years. He had also undergone uneventful extractions.\nExtra oral examination revealed a diffuse swelling on the left side of the face, in the maxillary region. The left infraorbital region was tender on palpation. Intraorally an ulcerated proliferative growth was seen on the left alveolar maxillary region in 24-27 region along with obliteration of buccal vestibule. The surface of the growth was covered with necrotic tissue with pus discharge and bleeding []. Limitation of mouth opening along with bilateral ulceration, bleeding and crust formation at angle of mouth was also observed. Generalized mobility of the teeth was also seen.\nThe OPG revealed a radiolucent area with bone destruction and obliteration of antrum on the left side. The CT scan revealed a huge enhancing lesion involving the entire left maxillary sinus causing erosion of its superior, medial, and postero-lateral walls, extending up to the nasal cavity, left ethmoid sinus and retro maxillary space [].\nMicroscopic examination of the biopsy specimen revealed pleomorphic undifferentiated epithelial cells in the form of nests and trabeculae separated by thin fibrous connective tissue septa [].

He had no exposure to epoxy in the period from 1992 to 1998 and had since then worked for 15 years as an industrial flooring specialist constructing epoxy floors. He had daily contact with polyepoxides, which he first would use as a coating on concrete floors. After hardening, he would use a primer over the first layer and add a final layer of epoxy compound. The patient blended the compounds together directly before he applied the mixture to the floor with a mason\u2019s trowel. He reported sporadic use of gloves and a filter mask while working with epoxy compounds.\nIn August 2013, he accidentally cut himself on the second digit of the right hand with the mason\u2019s trowel contaminated with unhardened epoxy. During the following 10 days, he developed swelling with redness and pain of the digit, which spread to his palm. Because of the increasing symptoms, the patient contacted his general practitioner, 20 days after the accident. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was then < 5 mg/L. The wound was cleaned but the patient reported that some of the hardened compound remained in the depth of the wound. The patient was given dicloxacillin (500 mg \u00d7 4). The wound swabs did not show any growth of aerobic or anaerobic pathogens. In the following days, after another visit to the emergency ward because of an increase of the swelling, he was given erythromycin (250 mg \u00d7 2). At this point, the level of CRP was still < 5 mg/L. Thereafter",

She subsequently developed systolic heart failure with a left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction of 20\u201325%. Additional co-morbidities included chronic atrial fibrillation, nonsustained ventricular tachycardias with implantation of an automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator and chronic renal insufficiency. Her heart failure symptoms progressed over the course of 10 years leading to a consultation at our institution's heart failure clinic. A cardiac transplant was recommended given her refractory heart failure symptoms and young age. She then received an LV assist device as a bridge to cardiac transplant. A year later, she underwent cardiac transplant surgery. Implantation of the donor heart was uncomplicated, and she was successfully weaned off cardiac bypass. Protamine was then administered to reverse heparin anticoagulation and facilitate disconnection from the cardiac bypass circuit. Upon administration of protamine, the patient developed a sudden elevation of pulmonary artery pressures with profound systemic hypotension consistent with an acute protamine reaction []. The RV appeared acutely dilated and poorly functional on trans-esophageal echocardiography. Frantic attempts were made to reverse the situation with the use of nitric oxide (NO) (to reverse pulmonary vasoconstriction) and multiple vasoactive agents including milrinone, epinephrine, and vasopressin. However, she remained severely hypotensive in-spite of full pharmacological and mechanical support including an intra-aortic balloon pump. An RV assist device was then placed with some improvement in RV filling pressures and cardiac index. She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) where she developed continuous bloody output from her chest tube.

    "original_text": "A 56-year-old man was referred to our hospital with a 6-month history of abdominal distension and discomfort (A). He had a medical history of schizophrenia. His abdomen was markedly distended, and severe edema was present in both lower limbs. He had no symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction. Neurological examination findings were normal. He had slight anemia (hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dl), and other laboratory data were within normal limits. A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a 30- \u00d7 18- \u00d7 30-cm giant mass located between the stomach and transverse colon. It included a large cyst and solid component that showed enhancement (B). The main feeder artery for the tumor seemed to be the right gastric artery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also showed a huge heterogeneous soft tissue mass. The solid component showed high signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging (C, D). Upper and lower endoscopy was not performed because the patient declined. CT-guided biopsy was not performed to avoid dissemination. Our preoperative differential diagnoses were sarcoma with a mucinous component, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, lymphangioma, and mesenteric cyst. A histological diagnosis was not obtained preoperatively, and the tumor was too large to identify its boundary with the surrounding organs by radiological examination.

During laparotomy, we identified a huge encapsulated tumor. The tumor occupied most of the pelvic cavity, but the caudal side of the tumor had no adhesions with pelvic organs. We gradually dissected along the capsule and moved the tumor outside the body (A). Finally, we found that the tumor was adhered to the stomach and transverse colon.
