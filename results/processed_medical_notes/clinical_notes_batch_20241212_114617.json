She reported no other symptoms, such as constipation or diarrhea. There was no significant family history of genetic disease or cancer. Her antenatal history was unremarkable. Physical examination showed abdominal distension, tenderness, and rigidity. Routine laboratory values were unremarkable.

She had missed her menstrual period without any other symptom and visited a private obstetrical clinic to confirm the pregnancy. However, she was diagnosed as having an abnormal pregnancy such as cervical or CSP by USG.\nAt our institution, she reported that her last menstrual period was just 5 to 6 weeks prior. However, USG revealed a gestational sac in the anterior lower uterine segment with a fetus measuring 4.83 cm crown-rump length (CRL) with positive cardiac activity, corresponding to 11 weeks and 6 days of gestation. Color/power Doppler images depicted a hyperechoic rim of a choriodecidual reaction with excessive vascularity (Fig. ). Although we could observe a definitive abnormally located gestational sac, our patient did not have any pain during the physical examination. She admitted that her last menstrual period was different from her usual menstrual periods. Because CSP or cervical pregnancy was suspected, we performed computed tomography (CT) for a definitive diagnosis. The CT scan showed an intrauterine gestational sac in the lower uterine segment bulging through the anterior uterine wall at the site of the cesarean scar.

The product had an HFA concentration of 10%.\nThe patient was hemodynamically stable on presentation, including initial vitals of heart rate of 86 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a blood pressure of 138/78 mmHg. On physical examination, the patient had bilateral tenderness to both hands, but did not demonstrate any external findings such as erythema, necrosis, ulcerations, or discoloration. No significant neurological or vascular deficiencies were found for either extremity. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nThe patient\u2019s medical workup included an ECG, basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and magnesium and calcium concentrations. The local poison control center was contacted, who agreed with the workup and recommended applying calcium gluconate (CaG) gel to the affected areas until the patient had complete relief of his pain.\nECG was negative for significant findings, including interval prolongations and arrhythmias. All lab results were within normal limits, including calcium and magnesium concentrations. The patient was treated with CaG gel, made in the ED by taking one gram of CaG and mixing it with standard lubricating gel in the ED.

Laboratory tests showed slight elevation of the carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 level at 57 U/ml; however, most of the other results were normal. Enhanced abdominal CT scans obtained on the first admission showed a large mass lesion located in the gallbladder that had invaded the anterior and medial segments of the liver.

There was history of waxing and waning in the size of the mass. There was a recent increase in the size of the mass and the surgeon referred the patient for a mammogram and FNA. On examination, the lump measured 3.5 cm, which was very firm to hard in consistency and had restricted mobility. The nipple was mildly retracted. No lymph nodes were palpable in the axilla. Mammography of left breast showed a high-density mass in the central region suspicious of malignancy; however, there was no evidence of microcalcifications. The lesion was classified as BI-RADS 4.\nFNAC was performed using a 23-gauge needle and smears were air-dried and stained using May Gr\u00fcnwald-Giemsa method as well as fixed in 95% ethanol and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Lump was gritty on FNA and yielded particulate material. The smears were highly cellular and showed predominantly three-dimensional cohesive clusters and few scattered cells [Figure and ]. At places, the clusters showed acinar formation []. Occasional clusters of apocrine cells and singly scattered large cells with moderate nuclear pleomorphism and conspicuous nucleolus were also found []. Admixed benign cell clusters, few bipolar cells and hyalinized eosinophilic stroma were found in the background []. Considering the overall picture, a cytological diagnosis of ductal carcinoma was made, and she was advised surgical excision and histopathological examination to rule out invasion.

His prostate volume was normal with a soft consistency.\nThe initial biological assessment revealed an inflammatory syndrome corresponding to a sedimentation speed of 80 associated with a urinary tract infection with Escherichia coli susceptible to fluoroquinolones. First, the patient received antibiotherapy based on ciprofloxacin and benefited from urinary drainage by suprapubic catheter. A retrograde and voiding urethrocystography (UCG) was then performed and revealed an extended narrowing of the whole anterior urethra associated with multiple fistulous portions toward the scrotum and perineum.

The patient reported that recently she had been developing keloids along the scar of the right breast with some areas having a blue hue; her left breast was unremarkable. She noticed that after wearing a sports bra there was increased pressure and abrasions to the keloid, leading to cellulitis and edema.

There was gross edema of right foot and thigh with inguinal adenitis []. Hematological investigations showed anemia and thrombocytopenia. A diagnosis of KMP was made and a biopsy was carried out after controlling the sepsis, which showed features of KHE. Immunohistochemistry was positive for Vimentin, CD31 and CD34, negative for Cytokeratin and GLUT 1 and Ki67 was 5-10% suggestive of KHE. X-ray of right lower limb did not show any bony involvement or osteomyelitis. MRI showed T2 hyperintense ill-defined circumferential mass involving the entire right leg and lower thigh. Underlying bones and joints were normal []. Doppler correlation of the lesion showed increased vascularity. Arterial feeders were from arteries around the knee joint and the venous drainage was into the tibial vein. The arteries from the external iliac to popliteal artery showed high resistance flow. Distal tibial vessels showed reduced but high resistance flow due to severe external compression.

He had a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and a surgical history of the right inguinal hernia. The patient's laboratory findings were within normal limits. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a well-demarcated oval isodensity mass of 25 mm at the tip of his appendix. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed a lesion with gradual homogeneous contrast enhancement from the arterial phase to the equilibrium phase (). No abnormal findings were found in the root to the middle of the appendix. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) revealed a well-demarcated hypoechoic tumor. The tumor size was 22 mm \u00d7 18 mm \u00d7 18 mm, with some cystic area and blood flow (). Colonoscopy findings were normal. The patient's symptoms naturally alleviated during examination period.\nPreoperative diagnosis indicated appendiceal neuroendocrine tumor (NET) G1 or gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumors, such as GIST. Malignancy could not be ruled out; therefore, laparoscopic ileocecal resection with D3 lymph node dissection was recommended.

Ductal carcinoma in situ of the opposite left breast also had been treated in the past with lumpectomy. Given the patient history and the recurrence of disease in the right breast, bilateral skin- and nipple-sparing mastectomies with right axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy were planned. These would be followed by immediate bilateral autologous DIEP flap-based breast reconstructions.\nPreoperatively, a computerized tomography angiogram was obtained to evaluate the perforator vascular anatomy of the anterior abdominal wall. This study showed a 2.5\u20133.0-cm left adrenal mass. Subsequent work-up diagnosed a pheochromocytoma. The patient was offered a laparoscopic adrenalectomy after alpha-blockade in addition to a genetic evaluation for hereditary causes of pheochromocytoma. She was advised to undergo an adrenalectomy first before moving forward with oncologic and reconstructive breast surgery. However, given her concern for breast cancer progression, the patient preferred to proceed first with the breast cancer surgery and reconstruction to be followed with later surgery to address the adrenal tumor.\nUnder consultation with the patient\u2019s Endocrinologist, alpha-blockade (phenoxybenzamine) was initiated 2 weeks before surgery to prevent pheochromocytoma crisis and beta blockage (propanolol) was started 1 week later for heart rate control. Subsequently, bilateral skin- and nipple-sparing mastectomies were initiated with simultaneous abdominal tissue harvest for the reconstruction. Figure a Doppler probe was used to identify the dominant perforators of the abdominal wall on each side of the midline.

Chest X-ray revealed no remarkable finding. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated decreased contractility of dilated right ventricle (RV) with D-shaped left ventricle on parasternal short axis view (). Also it showed a huge echogenic mass in dilated pulmonary trunk and a whip-like moving mass in right atrium (RA) (). The right atrial mass moved through tricuspid valve to right ventricle. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was about 70 mmHg. Computed tomography (CT) finding also showed heavy thrombus in main pulmonary artery which extended into lobar branches of pulmonary system and deep vein thrombosis of left external iliac vein ().We diagnosed PTE with huge thrombus on RA clinically. Because the patient had stable vital sign, we selected thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) infusion (100 mg over 2 hr). After one hour from t-PA infusion, the patient suddenly became unconscious. Her peripheral oxygen saturation was 76%, systolic BP 50 mmHg, and heart rate decreased to 33 bpm. Shortly afterward, the patient arrested and we started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). During CPR, our team made a critical decision to apply percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS) system for hemodynamic stabilization before surgical embolectomy. PCPS was inserted via right femoral artery and left femoral vein under fluoroscopic guidance and local anesthesia. The Capiox (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) emergent bypass system was used. Thereafter, hemodynamic state of patient was stabilized at the PCPS flow rate of 3-3.5 L/min. We revised our plan to continue thrombolytic therapy and anticoagulation with PCPS support in consideration of stable vital sign and high bleeding risk of surgery during thrombolytic therapy.

    "original_text": "A 54-year-old Caucasian man presented with epigastric pain associated with nausea without fever or respiratory symptoms. He had a known history of Bochdalek hernia diagnosed two years prior. Medical records indicated that our patient was seen previously by a thoracic surgeon who recommended nonoperative treatment. It was not known if the extent of herniated viscera had worsened in the interim as imaging studies were not available. A physical examination was significant for diminished breath sounds over his right thorax; his abdominal examination was benign. Laboratory data revealed mild leukocytosis with normal serum chemistry and liver-associated enzymes. Radiographic evaluation with axial CT confirmed a massive hernia of Bochdalek with multiple displaced organs into his right thorax (Figure and Figure ). Initial management included nasogastric decompression and intravenous fluid resuscitation with the presumptive diagnosis of bowel incarceration. After 24 hours, our patient was then taken to the operating theater for repair of the hernia. Given the size of the defect, the surgical approach was a thoracoabdominal incision to allow simultaneous access to both his abdominal and thoracic cavities. At surgery, near complete agenesis of his right hemidiaphragm was noted. Following reduction of his stomach, omentum and bowel, the liver was noted to be grossly abnormal with a macronodular appearance. Further examinationination confirmed acute cholecystitis of the displaced gallbladder (Figure ). Nearly his entire liver was situated in his lower thorax with its bilio-vascular pedicle stretched as it was pulled into his chest.

At the end of September 2016, the patient performed farm work in contact with sheep when he had an ocular traumatism caused by a fly. Three hours after the ocular traumatism, the patient complained of a painful right eye discomfort, with sensation of moving foreign. Upon arrival at the department of ophthalmic emergency of the University Hospital Center of Dijon within hours of the onset of the first symptoms, the clinical examination showed a red and irritated conjunctiva in the right eye with the observation of mobile and translucent larvae in the conjunctival fornix. The rest of the ophthalmologic examination was normal. Eight larvae were extracted using Bonn hook forceps under local anesthesia. All larvae were sent to the Parasitology-Mycology Laboratory of the University Hospital Center of Dijon for identification.\nThe parasitological diagnosis allowed the identification of stage 1 Oestrus ovis larvae (L1). Indeed, the macroscopic examination revealed larvae of white color and about 1 mm length. Microscopically, these larvae were composed of eleven metameres, each of these displaying 4 rows of spines (Fig. a). The cephalic segment had two large black buccal hooks (Fig. b), while the posterior segment consisted of two tubercles, each containing about ten curved spines (Fig. c) which is concordant with the morphological description of L1 Oestrus ovis larvae in the literature [].\nAt the first visit, the patient received a local treatment based on the administration of oxybuprocaine and antiseptics (Biocidan\u00ae) as eye drops.

He had no habit of drinking alcohol or smoking tobacco. He was diagnosed as having a right renal tumor and underwent right nephrectomy laparoscopically. The pathological diagnosis was right renal cell carcinoma (RCC), clear cell carcinoma, pT1bN0M0, v1 (Fig. ). One and half years later, lymph node swelling was detected at hepatic portal region and he underwent lymphadenectomy. The pathological diagnosis was a metastasis from RCC. Two years after diagnosis, he was suspected of lung metastases and started treatment with interferon \u03b1. Three years later, the multiple lung metastases grew larger and were determined as progression despite interferon \u03b1 therapy. At this point, he was referred to our hospital in October 2016. There were no abnormalities on physical examination and his vital signs were normal. He started treatment with sunitinib 50 mg/day on a schedule of 4 weeks on treatment and 2 weeks off; however, adverse events including grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 49,000/\u03bcL), gum swelling, and hoarseness became intolerable 2 weeks after starting sunitinib. Four weeks after cessation of sunitinib 50 mg/day, he was started on a dose of sunitinib 25 mg/day on a schedule of 2 weeks on and 1 week off. Computed tomography (CT) findings in January 2017 revealed that his lung metastases had shrunk; however, he continued to experience the same adverse events. Therefore, the dose of sunitinib was further reduced to 12.5 mg/day on a schedule of 2 weeks on and 1 week off. CT findings in May 2017 revealed new metastases in the pleura, diaphragm, and the right paracolic gutter (Fig. a, b). As a result, the treatment was changed from sunitinib to axitinib and he started treatment with axitinib at 10 mg/day; however, adverse events including gum swelling",

Contrast-enhancement computerized tomography confirmed a giant well-defined mass without cystic changes in her right submandibular region (Figure ). No lymph node swelling or other tumorous lesions were detected. Submandibular tumor extirpation was performed under general anesthesia.\nImmediately after removal, samples were obtained in the surgery room following a topographic scheme (Figure ). Group 1 comprised six samples from the periphery of the tumor, adjacent to the subcutaneous tissue; group 2 comprised six samples from the periphery of the tumor, adjacent to the floor of the mouth; and for group 3, the tumor was opened along the midline, and six deep samples were extracted from the center of the tumor.\nHalf of the samples in each group were fixed in 4% buffered formalin, processed and embedded in paraffin according to routine procedures, for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. The remainder of the samples of fresh material for each group were immediately submitted for DNA flow cytometry. The rest of the surgical specimen was routinely studied in the Department of Pathology and diagnosed as a benign PA.\nSamples of each group were minced with a scalpel in phosphate-buffered saline solution. Single nuclear suspensions were prepared by filtering through a 50-\u03bcm nylon mesh. The DNA contents were measured in a Cytomics FC500 (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA) flow cytometer.

Two months prior to presentation, he had a sinus surgery and within few days after this surgery, he developed cough and dyspnea, so he was admitted to outside hospital for possible pneumonia. He was treated with cefuroxime, Tamiflu, and oral prednisone. He improved momentarily with steroids. Two weeks later, he returned to the outside hospital complaining of right foot plantar numbness and dyspnea, he was discharged home on Levaquin as they thought he may have some residual sinus disease left. One week later he was seen by a pulmonologist at outside hospital and they noticed that one of the cultures grew staph, hence started on Bactrim. He took Bactrim for three days and his mother noticed that he developed some mental status changes, hence Bactrim was stopped. After this, no more symptom of mental status change was noticed. Over the next few weeks, the patient noticed tachypalpitations, continued to have fatigue, shortness of air, and fatigue so the family decided to come to our hospital's emergency department for further workup. While in the emergency room, he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with the rapid ventricular response and elevated troponins.

Enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a hypervascular mass of 35 mm in diameter in the descending portion of the duodenum (Fig. ), and the left three sections of the liver were occupied by multiple cystic tumors with contrast enhancement of the cystic wall, 13 cm in diameter (Fig. ). A duodenal tumor was identified on gastrointestinal endoscopy (Fig. ), and a biopsy revealed a NET. The serum levels of insulin, gastrin, and glucagon were within normal ranges. CT did not initially reveal evidence of pancreatic invasion between the tumor and the pancreas; however, irregularities of the duodenal wall and swelling of the lymph nodes around the pancreatic parenchyma were observed. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with non-functional duodenal NET with multiple liver metastases, T2N1M1 stage IV (UICC 8th). In addition, CT revealed the anatomical variation of the CHA, which branched from the SMA and ran fully through the head of the pancreatic parenchyma (Fig. , Additional file Figure S1). The CHA branches into the left hepatic artery (LHA), the middle hepatic artery (MHA), and the right hepatic artery (RHA) (Fig. a, b). Furthermore, a developed gastric arterial arcade, 4 mm in diameter, was found between the left gastric artery (LGA) and the right gastric artery (RGA). The RGA was branched from a distal portion at a distance of 10 mm from the root of the LHA (Fig. ).

The patient was started on intravenous (iv) dexamethasone and acyclovir under a high suspicion of viral encephalitis.\nShe was transferred to our institution 4 days later due to persistent headache despite treatment. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) brain scan taken at our institution showed a hemorrhagic transformation of the right temporal lobe, which was not observed on the initial MRI (Fig. ). Follow-up lumbar puncture showed 510 white cells per mm3 (82% lymphocytes), 144 mg/dL protein and 61 mg/dL glucose. CSF culture studies were negative for bacteria, fungi and tuberculosis. PCR of the CSF confirmed the presence of HSV1. The patient was free of neurological symptoms, with a Glasgow Coma Scale of E4M6V5, and was admitted for close observation and continuation of iv acyclovir. Corticosteroid treatment was discontinued upon her admission. On day 3 of hospitalization, the patient presented with a sudden onset of vomiting and severe headache. Brain CT showed an increased amount of temporal lobe hemorrhage and a leftward shift in the midline (Fig. ). Mannitol was administered but did not seem to have a significant effect. The patient became increasingly drowsy, and her right pupil became dilated. She underwent emergency right decompressive craniectomy, expansile duraplasty and ICP monitor insertion. Postoperative brain CT showed alleviation of midline shifting (Fig. ). The patient recovered fully 5 days after the surgery.

There were no significant neurologic deficits upon neurological examinations performed by the attending neurosurgeon and neurologist. The patient",
