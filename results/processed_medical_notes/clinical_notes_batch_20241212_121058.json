The lesion was 55 \u00d7 40 mm in size with a 15 mm-diameter nonulcerated nodule in the center when first diagnosed (). The findings of dermoscopy confirmed the presence of malignant melanoma. Neither inguinal nor popliteal lymph node was palpable, and no distant metastasis or lymph node enlargement was found by contrast computerized tomography scanning and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. The depth of tumor invasion was evaluated to be the superficial layer of subcutaneous fatty tissue by magnetic resonance imaging.\nThe patient was referred to the department of plastic and reconstructive surgery for surgical treatment. The day before surgery, lymph nodes were detected in inguinal and popliteal lesions by lymphoscintigraphy (). Prior to excision, 1 mL of patent blue was injected intradermally around the primary tumor. A wide local excision with 1.5 cm margin including plantar fascia was performed, along with sentinel lymph node biopsy of the inguinal and popliteal lesions using a combination of a gamma probe and the highlighted lymphatics obtained from the patent blue dye. After excision of the malignant melanoma from the left heel, the defect was covered with medial plantar flap and split-thickness skin grafting from the left femur.\nThe specimen was confirmed to be a 4.2 mm-thick, acral lentiginous melanoma, Clark's level IV, on pathologic examination. The primary site was clear of tumor at all margins; the inguinal nodes were negative (0/3), but the popliteal node was positive (1/1) for metastatic melanoma. Therefore, radical popliteal lymph node dissection was performed [].

The lesion was compressing the rectum, bladder and left ureter, which caused severe, ipsilateral hydronephrosis. The patient's medical history was significant for a supracervical hysterectomy in 2008 to address uterine fibroids; her most recent Pap smear and pelvic exam, both of which were negative for malignancy, coincided with the aforesaid hysterectomy.\nIn January 2013, the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, biopsy and lysis of adhesions, which revealed a 10 \u00d7 8 cm necrotic, vaginal mass with a 5 \u00d7 5 cm pedicle at the vaginal apex. Subsequently, the mass and lysis of adhesions were biopsied.

    "original_text": "A 62-year-old man with a 40-pack-year smoking history was referred to the urologic oncology clinic for workup of an incidentally discovered renal mass. After undergoing chest imaging for lung cancer screening, a right renal mass was found. Follow-up computed tomography (CT) imaging demonstrated a 7.5 \u00d7 7.4 \u00d7 7.5 cm well-circumscribed mass arising from the mid right kidney that enhanced homogenously with few calcifications (Fig. a, b). He did not have any recent surgeries or traumas. He was instructed to complete imaging work-up by obtaining a doppler ultrasound study. The ultrasound was completed on the same day and demonstrated a large vascular lesion with pulsatile flow concerning for a renal pseudoaneurysm (Fig. c). The patient was informed of the results and told to return promptly to the hospital for admission. After arriving, Interventional Radiology (IR) performed a renal angiogram which demonstrated a large aneurysm arising near the bifurcation of the right upper pole artery. IR attempted placement of a covered stent, but there was no good landing zone. A coil embolization was also considered, but it was ultimately deferred given the risk for infarction of a large portion of the right kidney.\nGiven the possible need for vascular reconstruction, the patient was transferred to the vascular surgery service at a neighboring hospital.

The patient presented to the Prosthodontics Department of Tehran University of Medical Sciences with a chief complaint of moderate sharp pain in the respective tooth. The patient recalled that the pain started two weeks earlier following accidental biting on a hard object when eating, which resulted in fracture of a part of his tooth. The patient's medical history was unremarkable. The patient's dental history revealed self-reported bruxism and use of night-guard for the past 7 months. Wear of incisal edges of the anterior teeth and the posterior cusp tips due to bruxism was evident. The patient's oral hygiene status was moderate, and dental plaque and calculus were found in lower amounts on the lingual surfaces of his mandibular anterior teeth. Extraoral examination confirmed symmetry of the face, and no specific problem was detected. The patient had strong masticatory muscles, which along with bruxism, could have increased the risk of cracking of teeth. After clinical examination, a periapical (PA) radiograph was obtained of the respective tooth (Figure A), which did not reveal any sign of crack. The respective tooth had previously undergone endodontic treatment and had an amalgam restoration. However, the restoration had a poor quality. We decided to remove the restoration and then decide on the treatment plan. After removal of secondary caries, the crack line appeared in the pulp chamber floor under the amalgam restoration (Figure B). Carious tissue was removed with a round bur and low-speed hand-piece to better reveal the crack line.

In the following month he developed a progressive right-sided slowness, which limited his ability to work. On admission to hospital in 1988 he was diagnosed with strictly right sided parkinsonism, however, the symptoms were only partially responsive to levodopa. CT scans revealed multiple cystic lesions within the brainstem as well as a posterior cerebral artery aneurysm. Due to the severity of the motor symptoms as well as the indication of surgical treatment for the aneurysm, the patient underwent neurosurgical intervention with partial resection of the cystic lesions and aneurysm clipping at an outside institution. Subsequently, the patient was asymptomatic for 20 years and able to pursue his former work without any physical limitations. In 2009 the patient presented again with chronically progressive unilateral tremor and thalamic pain affecting the right arm. DAT-SPECT revealed severe strictly unilateral dopaminergic denervation on the left side. Despite symptomatic treatment with escalating dosages of levodopa and pramipexole, symptoms worsened over time (Fig. ).\nClinical examination in August 2014 revealed further progression with increasing right-sided hemiparkinsonism, hemidystonia, hemithalamic pain as well as pyramidal signs. The patient was severely impaired in his activities of daily living and was suffering from mild depression. Repeated CT scanning showed progressive temporo-mesial and basal ganglia cysts as well as the development of a secondary hydrocephalus. As posterior cerebral artery aneurysm clipping was performed in the 90ies, magnetic resonance imaging to determine the exact configuration of the intracerebral cysts was contraindicated. Digital subtraction angiography revealed an aneurysm recurrence. In an open microsurgical procedure, fenestration of cystic membranes was performed, whereas full exploration of the aneurysm was abolished because of the limited access and the potential morbidity associated with a dissection within the severely scarred tissue.

The patient noticed decayed teeth in the same region, which was not associated with pain. He had visited a private dental clinic, where decayed tooth had been extracted and medications had been given for about 5 days.\nOn general physical examination, the patient was well built, 182 cm tall with normal gait and satisfactory vital signs. The extraoral examination revealed hypertelorism, strabismus, and a cystic swelling on the left eyelid as well as his neck (). Intraoral examination revealed missing teeth of the right mandibular first and second molars and pus discharge from the same region. No other skeletal abnormalities were detected.\nPanoramic radiograph revealed well defined multiple unilocular radiolucencies with sclerotic borders in the mandibular body, ramus, and symphysis areas. The unilocular radiolucencies varied in diameter from minimum 3 cm to around 7 cm in diameter. The largest one was located in the body of the mandible on the right side extending superiorly from the edentulous area to the lower border of the mandible inferiorly. Three smaller radiolucencies measuring around 3 cm in size were located in the posterior part of the right mandibular body and ramus as well in the left symphysis region. A smaller radiolucency measuring around 1 cm in size was observed in the periapical region of the right maxillary third molar. There was no radiographic evidence of tooth displacement and root resorption (). Cross sectional mandibular occlusal radiograph revealed a radiolucent area with minimum cortical plate expansion ().

Approximately 18 months prior to admission, the patient started to have difficulty sleeping characterized by frequent nighttime awakenings and daytime somnolence. After seeing a sleep specialist, he was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and periodic limb movements of sleep. Despite treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and sleep aids, he continued to have poor sleep and his abnormal movements worsened. Six months prior to admission, the patient began having spells that were characterized by video electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring as frontal lobe seizures and was started on topiramate.\nOver the ensuing months leading up to admission, he experienced a cognitive decline with impaired short-term memory, disinhibition, and visual hallucinations. His gait gradually became unstable with a stooped posture which led to frequent falls. At the time of admission, he was no longer able to stand without assistance. He had also developed multifocal jerking movements of all of his extremities as well as dysphagia with a 100 pound weight loss over 6 months despite absence of abdominal pain or diarrhea.\nHis initial examination revealed a chronically ill appearing male who required assistance for all of his activities of daily living. He was afebrile with an unremarkable general physical examination. He was fully oriented; however, his speech was extremely dysarthric. There was no evidence of aphasia. His pupils were equal but minimally reactive. He had a complete vertical gaze palsy and partial horizontal gaze impairment to both smooth pursuit and saccades. These could be overcome by oculovestibular maneuvers. Visual fields were intact to confrontation.

She had a term vaginal delivery 5 weeks earlier of a baby girl who weighed 3000 g. She had known intramural uterine fibroids confirmed by ultrasound scan 3 years earlier. On physical examination, her lower abdomen was distended. On speculum and digital vaginal examinations, a foul-smelling mass of approximately 10 cm in diameter was present in her vagina. The diagnosis of urinary retention due to a superinfected prolapsed pedunculated uterine fibroid was made. An indwelling plastic urinary catheter was easily placed. Antibiotic therapy was then started intravenously with ceftriaxone (1 g twice daily) and metronidazole (500 mg thrice daily). Two days later, under general anesthesia, the almost necrotic fibroid was held with two big toothed forceps and easily twisted off per vaginal route, without any significant bleeding. A speculum examination found a normal cervix, which was 4 cm dilated and the base of the fibroid\u2019s pedicle was located in the posterior uterine wall at 3 cm from the external cervical os. The fibroid was sent for pathology, which later confirmed uterine leiomyoma. Antibiotics were continued for another 6 days.

Progression occurred within fourteen month after the start of the initial treatment. Consequently, second-line nivolumab was initiated at a dose of 3 mg/kg every two weeks.\nAfter thirteen doses of nivolumab, the patient complained of irritated red eyes without visual impairment. He did not exhibit skin involvement, arthralgia or urinary tract or digestive symptoms. The conjunctiva swab test was negative, and no improvement was observed with antibiotic ocular drops. The ophthalmologist\u2019s examination revealed bilateral sterile conjunctivitis with no signs of uveitis or retinal lesions (Fig. a). The patient was treated with topical steroids with partial improvement.\nA few days later, he developed fatigue and progressive dysphagia which became severe after two months followed by rapid 10-kg weight loss without symptoms of associated colitis or gastritis. At that point, the main differential diagnosis was esophageal infection, tumor progression with gastrointestinal (GI) upper tract involvement, paraneoplastic syndrome [] or an atypical checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse event. Of note, the patient had no history of personal or familial autoimmune disease, conjunctivitis or upper digestive tract abnormality prior to nivolumab treatment. The oral examination initially revealed evidence for oral candidiasis, but treatment with a 7-day course of fluconazole did not improve dysphagia despite the resolution of the stomatitis. Bacterial culture of the oropharyngeal swab was negative, and PCR results for herpes simplex 1 and 2 infection were also negative. A blood sample revealed a discrete increase in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) with no eosinophilia or leukocytosis. Liver and kidney function panel tests were normal. Thoracoabdominal CT scan reported no evidence of disease recurrence.

For the management of the abdominal contusion and genital amputation, the patient underwent hematoma evacuation and primary repair in the Department of General Surgery and penis replantation in the Department of Urology. While monitoring the clinical course, the patient presented with a necrotic change in the penis (corpus carvenosum and urethra). The patient was therefore transferred to the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. Following the transfer to us, the patient underwent a necrotic tissue debridement. In this patient, the length of the residual corpus carvernosum was 1.5 cm and that of the corpus spongiosum and urethra was 1 cm.

    "original_text": "A seven-year-old boy presented to an outside facility after sustaining a hip injury while playing organized football. He reported that he was struggling at the bottom of a pile when he developed severe hip pain. At the outside hospital, he was diagnosed with a posterolateral hip dislocation. No attempt at reduction was made at the referring hospital. After consultation with a local orthopedist, the patient was transferred to our tertiary care facility via helicopter, and he arrived approximately 5.5 hours after initial injury. Prior to his arrival, preparations were made by ED staff for a rapid, comprehensive trauma evaluation and emergent sedation and reduction measures.\nThe patient complained of right leg pain and tingling upon arrival, with no reported pain elsewhere. Physical exam revealed that he was moderately distressed from pain and slightly tachycardic. The right lower extremity was internally rotated with flexion at the knee. He had normal distal pulses, good capillary refill, and was able to move his toes. Pelvic radiograph confirmed posterolateral right femoral head dislocation without evidence of fracture, as seen in . Point-of-care focused assessment with sonography for trauma exam and chest radiograph were also completed and both were negative.\nA complete trauma evaluation confirmed an isolated right hip dislocation with no contraindications to procedural sedation to facilitate dislocation reduction. Given his stable hemodynamics, he was sedated with intravenous propofol. Once sedated, the pelvis was stabilized by providing posteriorly directed countertraction to the pelvic girdle preparing for reduction via Allis technique.

    "original_text": "A 75-year-old male patient who had undergone above-knee amputation 50 years before visited the institution with a chief complaint of pain in the right leg stump, which had been exacerbated in the past 30 years. The underlying diseases of the patient were hypertension, atrial fibrillation, bronchial asthma, and lumbar spinal stenosis. At the time of the visit, the patient scored 8-9/10 on the visual analogue scale (VAS). Even though his orthosis had been re-adjusted many times, the incidence of a breakthrough pain had increased and the patient had therefore become unable to wear it. The physical examination did not reveal any infection or ulcer at the stump, but a palpable mass was found. The Tinel's sign test proved positive. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the first neuroma measuring 8 \u00d7 2.4 \u00d7 2.2 cm at the proximal part of the sciatic nerve and the second one of about 0.6 cm at the proximal part of the tibial nerve, 2.8 cm below the first neuroma (). 1% lidocaine 5 cc was injected under ultrasound guidance around the neuroma [], following which the pain was decreased (VAS 2-3/10) and the symptoms evidenced by the Tinel's sign test disappeared. The plain radiograph did not permit any particular findings. In order to differentiate stump pain caused by neuroma from radiating pain caused by lumbar spinal stenosis, an electromyography (EMG) and a nerve conduction velocity (NCV) test were performed. The results showed that bilateral radiculopathy was mainly confined to the left side, while the right leg pain was localized to the stump, and the decrease of the stump pain from the ultrasound-guided injection of the local anesthetic was significant.

    "original_text": "A case of 23-year-old non ambulatory female patient was referred to the department of oral and maxillofacial prosthodontics with loss of cranium on left side. The defect was due to trauma which had occurred one month back. It had resulted in substantial loss of neurological tissue [Figure \u2013]. General examination revealed that, the patient was non ambulatory, had loss of motor control (hemiplegia of right side was noted) and loss of speech. Severe brain injury with Glasgow coma scale value less than 9 was noted (GCS 7 = E2V2M3). Local examination revealed a large ovoid defect of about 10 \u00d7 15 cm on left side. In anterior-posterior direction, the defect involved loss of posterior part of frontal bone, temporal bone, parietal bone and anterior portion of the occipital bone. Superiorly, the defect extended 2 cm lateral to the midline till 1.5 cm superior to the left ear.\nAn involuntary lip biting activity (neuropathological chewing) had developed, due to which the lower lip showed an ulcer of about 1 \u00d7 1.5 cm. On observation, the activity repeated almost once in every three minutes causing frequent bleeding and an unhealed ulcer on the left side of lower lip. The probable reason for this activity was adduction of lower lip which was subsequently trapped between upper and lower teeth.

She underwent a left radical nephrectomy and post-operative histology showed presence of typical clear cell carcinoma of kidney (Fuhrman grade 3) with involvement of renal vein with pathological staging of T3aN0 (TNM version-7) completely excised RCC. She did not receive any adjuvant therapy. She relapsed in February 2010 when a routine surveillance CT scan demonstrated metastatic lesion in the upper lobe of right lung with associated mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. She was asymptomatic with WHO performance status of one and the hematological and biochemical profile was normal. She was classified as favorable risk based on the Memorian Sloan Kettering Cancer Center prognostic stratification model. She commenced TKI therapy sunitinib at dose of 50 mg/day based on 4 weeks \u201con\u201d and 2 weeks \u201coff\u201d schedule. She underwent staging CT scan in September 2010 that demonstrated complete response in hilar lymphadenopathy and more than 50% reduction in size of lung metastasis (). She continued on sunitinib but presented in January 2011 with expressive dysphasia, right-sided weakness and generalized seizures and contrast-enhanced CT and MRI scan of brain demonstrated evidence of small multiple ring-enhancing lesions suggestive of multiple brain metastases. The staging CT showed no evidence of relapse outside the brain. At that stage sunitinib was discontinued and she was commenced on dexamethasone with improvement in neurological symptoms. Her case was discussed with neurosurgical colleagues who excluded any local therapy (surgery; SRS) in view of multiple nature of the lesion.

Echography showed hydronephrosis (grade I) at the left kidney. We then decided to use more detailed radiological investigations to have a clearer view of the visceral organs. Computed tomography showed a small intestine loop completely herniated through the left obturator foramen and an entrapment of the homolateral ureter (fig. ); in this way the ureter presented a altered course to the foramen.

The pain mainly occurred around the umbilicus, presenting in the manner of colic pain. The patient also complained about generalized fatigue and low-grade fever.\nAt admission, the body temperature was 38.2 \u00b0C, with the pulse 116 beats/min and blood pressure 105/64 mmHg. Physical examination revealed that breath sounds of both lungs were thick and the abdomen was flat with tenderness around the umbilicus, without rebound tenderness or other positive sign.\nIn history taking, a colonoscopy which revealed ulcer in ascending colon and rectum polyp was performed in the Shantou Central Hospital before admission. Pathological examination revealed chronic inflammation of ascending colonic mucosa accompanied by erosion, and rectal tubular adenoma.\nAfter admission, the patient experienced the pain worsening than before. The pain gradually disseminated to the whole abdomen, presenting persistent colic. Physical examination found tabular abdomen, obvious tenderness and rebound tenderness in the whole abdomen, with reduced bowel sounds.

The protuberance grew rapidly, the pain had increased without any inciting factors over the past 1 month, and it restricted his shoulder joint movement. Prior to the development of his discomfort, he had no history of injury to his shoulder.\nFirst, we completed the patient\u2019s physical examination. He had a marked ridge at his left scapula that was approximately 4 \u00d7 6 cm. The surrounding skin had a low temperature and no redness or ulceration. He complained of mild pain in the bump. The mass was hard to the touch and was relatively immobile. The findings did not indicate metastasis to the superficial lymph nodes of the axillary cavity, neck, or left upper limb. Approximately 45\u00b0 abduction, 5\u00b0 adduction, 40\u00b0 flexion, and 25\u00b0 external and internal rotation of the left shoulder joint were observed. The patient had good sensation, movement, and blood circulation of the left upper extremity.\nRadiographs of the left shoulder showed an irregular shadow with a bone lesion on the scapula (), located in the S1 region according to Malawer\u2019s classification. Neither the acromion nor the glenoid cavity were involved. A computed tomography (CT) scan of his left scapula indicated a moderate low-density bony lesion of approximately 31 \u00d7 72 \u00d7 78 mm with calcification (. The superior border of the mass extended to 2 cm below the upper margin of the scapula, the left border extended to 4.5 cm from the spinal column, and the inferior border extended to 2 cm above the subscapular angle. No metastases of the lung, mediastinum, upper limb vessels, or abdomen were detected by CT and ultrasonography. A CT scan showed no metastasis to other bone tissues. The needle biopsy suggested grade I chondrosarcoma (). In view of the radiologic and histologic findings, the diagnosis was confirmed: left scapular",

    "original_text": "A 33-year-old woman reported to the Department of Periodontology, Sri Ramachandra Dental College, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education & Research (DU), with the chief complaint of a missing tooth and the inability to masticate. She had no relevant medical history and had a history of undergoing orthodontic treatment, extraction of the lower left first molar, and endodontic treatment done three years back in relation to the left lower second molar. The patient had presented with fair oral hygiene.\nOn clinical examination, a gingival growth was present on the floor of the endodontically treated tooth (#37), as seen in Figure .\nThe tooth had no pain, probing pocket depth, and mobility associated with it. A provisional diagnosis of a gingival polyp was given. An intraoral periapical radiograph was taken, and it revealed no crestal bone loss or bone loss involving the furcation. However, radiolucency was seen on the distal surface of the tooth near the cementoenamel junction (Figure ).\nTo substantiate the radiographic and clinical features and to establish the pathway of the polyp, a periodontal probe was inserted horizontally from the lingual aspect of the tooth and a small perforation was noticed on the distolingual aspect of 37.

His investigation at the time showed platelets count of only 1 \u00d7 10 9/L (normal range 150\u2013450 \u00d7 109/L). The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and steroids (Prednisone 25 mg/day), responding for 4 months with a rise in platelet count to 62 \u00d7 10 9/L. After which he relapsed developing epistaxis, purpura and a platelet count of 2 \u00d7 10 9/L. Again, the patient was treated with higher dose of steroid (30 mg/day) and IVIG and a surgical team was consulted for possible splenectomy. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy was preformed which showed increased megakaryocytes consistent with ITP and was otherwise normal. Laparoscopic splenectomy was done in October 2012, the surgery went well and the patient was discharged in good condition. Three years later in December 2015, he presented again with bleeding and ulcer in the oral cavity and minimal episodes of fresh blood per rectum. He was admitted as a case of chronic relapsing ITP with platelets of 6 \u00d7 10 9/L, which increased to 96 \u00d7 10 9/L after a short course of steroid (Prednisone 25 mg/day), and IVIG. About 3 months later in March, he relapsed with platelets of 3 \u00d7 10 9/L.

A metastatic workup including a thoracic, abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) 1 year later revealed retroperitoneal recurrence, which was completely resected. The surgical specimen was routinely processed for histology. The tumor was composed predominantly of spindle-shaped cells arranged in fascicles. These spindled cells, with eosinophilic cytoplasm, resembled smooth muscle cells.\nThe comparison with the tumor resected in 2009 described as angiomyolipoma showed the same morphology as the recurrent tumor. Immunohistochemistry showed the neoplastic cells positive for HMB 45, Melan-A, vimentin and CD 117 (focally). The neoplastic cells were negative for SMA, Pan CK, CD 34 and S-100.The pathological characteristics in combination with immunophenotypes are consistent with the diagnosis of PEComa.\nThe patient had remained disease free for 4 months when the follow-up CT scans revealed new lesions in the lungs and recurrence in the abdomen (Figures\n and\n).\nSurgery was initially considered, but the curability was estimated to be quite low considering the presence of lung metastases. Based on the immunohistochemical findings, which showed tumor cells positive for CD 117, she was placed on targeted therapy with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate. Treatment with imatinib was stopped with evidence of disease progression after 5 months. On the basis of published studies that showed activation of the mTOR pathway in PEComas, the institutional board approved everolimus as an off-label treatment for this patient\n[]. This treatment option was discussed with the patient, who provided informed consent for treatment with everolimus as well as retrospective review of the medical records and evaluation of archival tumor specimens according to institutional review board\u2013approved protocols.

Physical examination revealed a well-nourished young male with a palpable mass on the right iliac fossa and the absence of the right testicle. The left spermatic cord and testis were palpable and normal on clinical examination. An incisional scar on the right groin was observed.
