Computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed an intimal flap and expanded false lumen with slight enhancement (). Digital subtraction angiography showed mild stenosis in the thoracic aortic lesion without an obvious intimal flap (). Based on both the clinical symptoms and diagnostic test results, only thoracic IMH was considered by both radiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons; hence, thoracic endovascular aortic repair and not surgery was considered at that time. Then, an endovascular stent (30 mm \u00d7 200 mm, Medtronic) was implanted into the patient.

She was the first child of a non-consanguineous family with no family history of neurological disease. She was delivered vaginally at term with a birth weight of 3450 g and no remarkable antenatal abnormalities or birth history. The Apgar scores for the infant were 10, 10, and 10 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes after birth, respectively. After a course of antibiotics, gastric lavage, and other supportive treatments, she continued to be hypertonic and was discharged home. On the 11th day of her life, the symptoms occurred again at a local hospital. Her convulsive seizures were characterized by cyanosis of the lips, salivation, and hypertonicity of the limbs and lasted about 2 minutes before spontaneous resolution. Because no improvement occurred after treatment with phenobarbital for about 4 months, she was sent to our hospital, where we found hypertonicity in response to sudden auditory stimulus. The patient's clinical diagnosis was subsequently revised to hyperekplexia.\nThe findings on cranial magnetic resonance imaging, full blood count evaluation, C-reactive protein measurement, as well as blood gas and electrolyte analyses were normal. Pulmonary computed tomography suggested left inferior lobe pneumonia. Electroencephalography showed abnormalities with an \u03b1-like rhythm in the midline and bilateral frontal areas during both sleep and wakefulness. Several paroxysmal abnormal movements were detected with enhancement of the aforementioned \u03b1-like rhythm. In Xiamen Children\u02bcs Hospital, physical examination showed a positive result on the nose-tapping test (head-retraction reflex). To exclude epilepsy, video electroencephalography was performed.

Her medical history consisted of sigmoid adenocarcinoma with a Hartmann\u2019s procedure the month before and subsequently commencing chemotherapy a week before. She was a non-smoker and had no familial history of coagulation disorders.\nThe PICC line was inserted into the right arm under ultrasound guidance, without any immediate concerns noted during the procedure. An X-ray revealed the PICC tip to be in a satisfactory position, but potentially a little too deep (). There were no symptoms of chest discomfort or palpitations.\nApproximately an hour later, she developed symptoms of pain and weakness to her left arm (the opposite side). Her arm was clinically assessed as cool to touch with a delayed capillary refill with pulses absent. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of her left arm was arranged which revealed an abrupt stop in the left axillary artery ( and ) with reconstitution of the vessels in the antecubital fossa. She was taken to theatre for a brachial embolectomy to re-establish blood flow to her acutely ischaemic arm.\nBrachial access was obtained over the antecubital fossa, the brachial artery was controlled and incised. Proximal embolectomy with balloon catheter retrieved a long segment of thrombus, with resulting good inflow and back bleeding. Post-operatively she was commenced on therapeutic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).\nShe was subsequently worked up for a cause for this limb threatening pathology. Echocardiogram revealed unremarkable cardiac valves without evidence of an embolic source. A bubble study was also performed which showed no evidence of right to left shunt or patent foramen ovale. Histology confirmed recent blood clot without organization.

The parents did not complain any symptom suggestive of pain in the swelling, but the child used to cry on touching it. There was no other associated complaint. On examination, a firm to hard, circumscribed, mildly tender swelling measuring 4 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm was found over the body of the left side of the mandible. Computed tomography scan of the head and neck region showed a soft tissue mass eroding bone over the body of the left side of mandible []. The report was suggestive of neoplastic soft tissue lesion involving underlying bone. The patient's blood count along with other hematological and biochemical parameters was normal. He underwent tru-cut biopsy from the lesion. Histological examination of the specimen showed mononuclear blast-like cells arranged in sheets with thin intervening fibrous septa [Figures and ]. The cells were of intermediate size and composed of round to oval nuclei with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and prominent nucleoli and scanty basophilic cytoplasm [Figures and ]. Immunohistochemical stain of the paraffin-embedded tissue sections showed that the blast cells were positive for CD45, CD68 and lysozyme [Figures \u2013] and negative for CD3, CD20, CD99, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and CD138. The histological and immunohistochemical findings confirmed the diagnosis of MS with monocytic differentiation. Then, bone marrow biopsy of the patient was done to detect whether bone marrow involvement was present or not but no abnormality was detected at that point of time.

Her pain was retropatellar pain that often radiated medially or laterally from the patella, exacerbated by climbing stairs, running and squatting. She was unable to perform any sports activities. Examination revealed peripatellar tenderness and crepitus, full range of motion and the knee was stable. Radiological examination included both MRI and computed tomography of the knee were performed at the beginning. MRI showed osteochondritis dissecans at the area at the superolateral facet of the patella in the deep subchondral area as shown in . This was appropriately treated conservatively with 6 months of reduced load and protected weight bearing without relief of symptoms. She quit sport activity for 2 years and then another MRI was performed . After 2 years we opted for adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AD-MSCs) intra-articular therapy according to the procedure described by Tremolada et al. []. The patient\u2019s parents were given written information regarding the use of AD-MSCs therapy, including relative risks of this therapy and also relevant treatment alternatives that could otherwise be explored. Postoperative radiological evaluation was performed at 6 months and 12 months after AD-MSCs procedure as shown in and .

The pain was mild to moderate intensity, radiating from the groin to involve the whole left leg. She had no previous history of DVT. She was married for five years but had no children. A right ovarian cyst was discovered during workup for primary infertility. She was scheduled to undergo cystectomy and received a two-week course of norethisterone 5 mg twice daily. She received a shot of intra-articular steroid in her left knee for osteoarthritis three months ago, but was well and active and was not taking any regular medications. There was no family history of DVT.\nShe was an average-built woman with normal vitals. Her left leg was grossly swollen but not erythematous, hot or tender, with intact distal pulses. The circumference of the calf, 15 cm below the tibial tuberosity, was 42 cm on the left compared to 34 cm on the right. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable, apart from mild tenderness and a vague feeling of a small soft mass in the right lower abdomen.\nHer routine investigations and chest X-ray were normal. The venous Doppler revealed extensive DVT of left common and superficial femoral veins (a misnomer, actually a deep vein). Abdomino-pelvic ultrasound showed a 4.5 \u00d7 4.0 cm right ovarian cyst.

At the bedside, she complained of mild headaches but denied visual disturbances or upper abdominal pain. She was alert and well oriented with a pulse of 80 bpm. There was no hyperreflexia, clonus, papilledema, peripheral edema or signs of pulmonary edema. Her examination was otherwise unremarkable including the absence of renal bruits. Apart from an elevated random urine protein to creatinine ratio of 0.7, the laboratory investigations were within normal limits including serum creatinine, electrolytes, platelet count, liver function and coagulation studies. There were no laboratory features of hemolysis. She was treated with multiple anti-hypertensives over the next 72 h including oral nifedipine, labetalol and clonidine as well as intravenous infusions of labetalol, nicardipine, hydralazine. Magnesium was used for eclampsia prophylaxis. Of note, a single dose of intravenous enalapril was given with a subsequent 60% increase in serum creatinine that returned to baseline within 24 h of discontinuation. Renal artery dopplers (Fig. ) were performed which revealed greater than 60% stenosis of the proximal left renal artery and at least 60% stenosis of the distal right renal artery.

The OD fundus examination indicated similar ghost retinal vessels and retinal pigment clumping; however, the difference was that several spared retinal arterioles which supplied the posterior pole of the retina, and a yellow-white optic disk were observed (shown in Fig. ). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) examination of the OD indicated a relatively normal thickness of each layer in the macular region and the full thickness of macular lutea was 227 \u03bcm, yet the atrophic retinal neurosensory layer and retinal pigment epithelium were detected in the peripheral area. In addition, epiretinal membrane existed. Nevertheless, the OCT image of the fellow eye showed atrophy of the entire retina, and the full thickness of macular lutea was only 114 \u03bcm (shown in Fig. ). To further identify the spared vessels in the OD, we performed an examination of OCT angiography (OCTA), which revealed that the spared vessels might come from the posterior ciliary artery system but not the central retinal artery. But in the fellow eye, the vascular structure is normal (shown in Fig. ). The visual field measurement exhibited a tubular visual field in the OD eye as well as full blindness in the contralateral eye (shown in Fig. ).\nThe patient was diagnosed with binocular advanced RP based on the examination results above. Considering her stage of RP and available therapies, she was eventually treated with neurotrophic agents, by which we hoped to slow the disease progression.",

She went to local hospital. Full blood count, serum biochemical tests, gastroscopy and head CT examination showed no obvious abnormalities. She felt that her nausea and dizziness did not improve after symptomatic therapy and even followed by dysphagia, limb weakness, blurred vision, ghosting in the right eye, and fatigue. Two weeks later, she went to another local hospital. A blood test was positive for AQP4 antibodies and brain MRI found high-signal lesions (). She was diagnosed with NMO and treated with high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone. Two days later, she felt shortness of breath, hard to swallow and difficulty in walking.

Histopathological examination revealed a polypoid tumor occupying lamina propria and submucosa of the anal canal with intraepithelial lentiginous component in the center of the lesion. The tumor cells were epithelioid and showed clear cell change. Immunohistochemical studies showed the tumor cells to be positive for S100 and Melan-A. A diagnosis of a 15-mm thick mucosal melanoma with ulceration, 6 mitotic figures per mm2 and perineural invasion in the anal canal was made (Figures , and ). Molecular analysis showed the melanoma harbored a GNAQ mutation with wild-type BRAF, KIT and NRAS genes. The GNAQ gene mutation of the patient was the substitution of glutamine to proline in codon 209 (Q209P) which has been reported in uveal melanoma at a frequency of 20.8% but not in cutaneous melanoma or other subtypes of the disease [,].\nThe patient underwent a wide local excision of the primary melanoma with subsequent adjuvant radiation therapy.

The patient was diagnosed with painful facial swelling localized over the left condylar region, and lateral deviation of the mandible to the left side resulting in a facial asymmetry. His medical history was found to be non-significant. Intraoral examination revealed an anterior crossbite and excessive crowding. Limited mouth opening and mandibular deviation during opening and closure were observed, and mastication and speech were both affected. The clinical diagnosis was supported by panoramic radiography and 3D computed tomography (CT) views. Panoramic radiograph and CT views confirmed the green-stick (incomplete) fracture on the left condyle in which one side of the bone was fractured and the other was bent (Fig. ).\nClosed reduction was chosen as a treatment method to allow to initial fibrous union of the fracture segments and obtain remodeling with normal functional stimulus. Alginate impressions of both jaws were taken and stone working models poured. A 3 mm thick removable acrylic mandibular splint was made by our laboratory technician. Then, a non-rigid mandibular splint was applied in order to remove the direct pressure on the fracture side (left) of the mandible for one month with functional repositioning of the mandible (Fig. ). Soft diet and rest were suggested. Instructions were given to his parents as for the cleaning of the mandibular splint with a soft toothbrush.\nClinical and radiologic examination at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 27 months revealed uneventful healing with reduction of the condylar head and remodeling of the condylar process following conservative treatment (Fig. ).

Initially, she was given proton pump inhibitors, but her pain was not relieved. She had no other symptoms. Her past medical and family histories were not significant. The result of her clinical examination was normal. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy showed globular swelling at the medial wall of D2 (Fig. ). The ampulla was situated at the summit of swelling.\nComputed tomography (CT) with oral contrast agent showed dilation of the intramural part of the common bile duct (CBD). A cyst of size 2.4 \u00d7 2.3 cm was noted in the second part of the duodenum (Fig. ). On the basis of the above findings, it was reported as type 3 choledochal cyst. The patient was further investigated with magnetic resonance imaging, which showed dilation of the intramural part of the distal CBD. A 2.4 \u00d7 2.3 cm cyst was noted in the ampullary region, again consistent with a type 3 choledochal cyst (Fig. ). Then the patient was planned for endotherapy, but owing to difficulty, it could not be negotiated into the ampulla. Finally, the patient was referred to the surgical gastroenterology department for operative management. After multidisciplinary team discussion, an abdominal ultrasonogram (USG) was done, which showed a clear thick wall cyst measuring 4.6 \u00d7 2.6 cm between the second part of the duodenum and the head of the pancreas with gut signature (Fig. ). Opening of the CBD into the duodenum was seen just distal to the cystic lesion.

    "original_text": "A 64-year-old male presented to our outpatient clinic for additional care after having undergone surgery for a distal femur fracture elsewhere. He had sustained a Hoffa fracture (Letenneur type II) of his right medial femur condyle after a motor vehicle accident 4 months ago. In this case, the medial approach was used during surgery, and the fragment was reduced and stabilized with two screws and plates. Unfortunately, 4 months later, the patient continued to have pain, and the computed tomography (CT) scan showed nonunion with implant loosening (Fig. ). The range of motion was (flexion/extension) 60\u00b0/0\u00b0/0\u00b0. A revision procedure was planned to provide stable fixation and promote the healing of this intra-articular fracture.\nThe patient was positioned as described above for case 1. The prior medial approach was used for exposure of the nonunion. The nonunion site was debrided after the old fixation instrumentation was removed. Again, at this time, the ununited condylar fragment was noted to be \u201cfree-floating\u201d in the knee. The overlying articular cartilage on the fragment was not intact (Fig. ). The fragment was repositioned as described above, and stabilization was achieved with two compression screws placed from the posterior to anterior direction. However, a small gap persisted at the nonunion site, probably due to bone loss; for this reason, two 3.5 mm reconstruction plates were placed as buttress plates for additional stability. The fixation procedure did not cause damage to the articular cartilage. Again, the gap was filled with a cancellous bone graft from the patient's iliac crest.\nThe postoperative radiographs showed the restoration of the femoral condyle surface (Fig. ).

The patient was a known IVDU, with a history of hepatitis C. He previously underwent multiple incision and drainage procedures for left groin abscesses and on one occasion required an emergency fasciectomy for suspected necrotizing fasciitis. The patient subsequently developed chronic osteomyelitis in the left proximal femur with avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Whilst under the care of a specialist bone infection unit he underwent a left Girdlestone resection arthroplasty 1 year prior to this presentation.\nOn admission, the patient was afebrile, but tachycardic. He had epigastric tenderness without guarding. Scrotal oedema and a necrotic patch of skin in the perineum were noted. Digital rectal examination demonstrated an empty rectum with no blood. Examination of the left hip revealed indurated tender skin to the upper outer thigh without discharging sinus. All passive and active movements of the left hip were irritable and reduced. He was unable to weight bear on that side.\nBlood investigations showed elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 213 mg/l and WCC 13.5 \u00d7 109/l). The rest of his blood profile and urinalysis were normal. He was commenced on intravenous antibiotic therapy (pipperacillin and tazobactam) for sepsis and proton pump inhibitors for a presumed upper gastro-intestinal bleed and admitted under the care of the physicians.\nThe patient's condition deteriorated and complained of increasing left sided lower abdominal and hip pain.

She had received her first treatment from November 1999 to March 2001, which was incomplete surgical resection of the tumor, histologically reported as a benign HPC. Surgery was followed by RT, 60.0 Gy in 30 Fx.\nIn 2009 the tumor recurred in the same place, and the patient was treated with Cyberknife SRT, 24 Gy in 3 Fx. After 6 months, the patient lost the vision in her left eye, though it was a complete response. In 2013 another recurrence occurred. The patient again received SRT with 30 Gy in 6 Fx.\nIn April 2016, the patient came to our hospital with a local unresectable 3rd tumor relapse (shown in Fig. ).\nThe treatment options were limited due to the unresectability and benign nature of the tumor. Because no MRI indications of radiation brain tissue necrosis were reported and there was high conformity with previous stereotactic RT, long-term disease history, and gaps between RT courses, we decided to irradiate the patient again. The case was discussed at the Tumor Board, and the Institutional Ethical Committee approved the treatment strategy.\nThe 4th course of irradiation was done in May to June 2016. A dose of 60 Gy with 2.0 Gy/Fx was delivered via fixed horizontal spot-scanning proton therapy (PT) in a seated position supported with image guidance with built-in CBCT [].

    "original_text": "A 68-year-old Japanese man with a history of distal partial gastrectomy for gastric cancer 10 years earlier was admitted for surgical treatment of intrathoracic esophageal cancer (T3, N2, M0, stage III). He underwent subtotal esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection and removal of the remnant stomach with the abdominal lymph nodes. The alimentary continuity was reconstructed with a pedicled jejunal limb through the antethoracic route. When we separated the diaphragm from the esophagus and removed xiphoid surgically to prevent a pedicled jejunal limb injury, the pericardium was opened. Anastomosis of the esophagus and jejunum was carried out instrumentally with a circular stapler. A postoperative enteral contrast examination showed smooth passage and no deformity of the reconstructed jejunum. The patient was discharged about 4 weeks postoperatively. About 6 months after the esophagectomy, the patient was readmitted to our hospital because of abdominal discomfort and vomiting. His vital signs were stable and unremarkable. He was thin, with a body mass index of 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed that the pedicled jejunum through the antethoracic space was markedly dilated and the abdomen was soft and flat (Fig. ). Laboratory data showed only leukocytosis with no other remarkable findings. A chest roentgenogram revealed an increased cardiothoracic ratio of 70%, and an enteral contrast study showed a bird\u2019s beak deformity. The swallowed barium remained static in the reconstructed jejunum. Computed tomography of the thoracoabdominal region showed the reconstructed jejunum within the pericardium anterior to the heart (Fig. ). We diagnosed the patient with IPDH after esophagectomy and performed an emergency laparotomy.

The computed tomography (CT) showed a cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail of 5.7 \u00d7 9 cm in size and significant splenomegaly with hypodense areas consistent with a pseudocyst with splenic extension and rupture ().\nDue to patient stability, conservative management was decided. This included analgesics, antibiotics and nutritional optimization. During the first 48 h, the patient was stable, with little pain and without fever. On the fourth day of hospitalization, he developed tachycardia and severe pain. The abdominal examination showed signs of peritoneal irritation and laboratory tests with a white cell count of 41 \u00d7 109/L. Ultrasound assessment showed diffuse abdominal free fluid. An emergency laparotomy was performed, finding 1.5 L of dark serohematic and purulent fluid in the peritoneal cavity. The amylase level of this fluid was 3000 U/L. A large pancreatic tail pseudocyst was identified in addition to abundant clots in the left subphrenic space because of a ruptured spleen (). Due to extensive peripancreatic inflammation, dissection was difficult. Splenectomy was performed, extracting the shattered splenic parenchyma (). The amylase level of pancreatic cystic fluid was 13 000 U/L, confirming the diagnosis of a pseudocyst. We performed a double layer hand-sewn gastrocystic anastomosis with silk 2.0. One drain was located close to the anastomosis and two in the splenic bed. The patient had a satisfactory recovery, with drains",

The MRI revealed a left parotid space mass with ill-defined borders which had decreased T1 and increased T2 signal and homogeneous contrast enhancement with ill-defined margins (Figure ). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) demonstrated significantly restricted diffusion with very low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values (Figure ).
