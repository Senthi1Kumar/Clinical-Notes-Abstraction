On clinical evaluation, it was a large abdominal mass arising from the pelvic region, not moving with respiration. There were no ascites. There was a family history of carcinoma rectum (the patient\u2019s sister).\nContrast-enhanced computer tomography (CECT) of the abdomen reported ovarian mass (28 cm \u00d7 21 cm \u00d7 27 cm) with multiple polypoidal lesions within the bowel and omental deposits. Colonoscopy showed rectal ulcer with multiple polyps until the sigmoid colon, and the endoscope could not be negotiated further. Biopsy of the rectal ulcer was reported as adenocarcinoma. The multi-disciplinary tumor board discussed the case. We determined a working diagnosis of primary rectal malignancy in the background of FAP with bilateral ovarian neoplasm. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on the rectal ulcer specimen showed positive CK 20 (4+), CDX2 (4+), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (4+), and negative CK 7 (0), confirming the mass was originating from the large bowel and not an ovarian mass eroding into the rectum. The plan was that if IHC of the rectal ulcer showed an ovarian origin, the patient was to be started on anterior chemotherapy. Given rectal malignancy with possible FAP and synchronous bilateral ovarian masses with omental metastasis, the patient was given the option of exploratory laparotomy with a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, on table colonoscopy, and total colectomy with omentectomy. After obtaining informed consent, exploratory laparotomy was carried out. Frozen sections of both ovarian mass and omental deposits were suggestive of mucinous neoplasm; however, further characterization was not possible on the frozen section. On table colonoscopy showed > 200 polyps in the transverse and descending colon. Total proctocolectomy with end ileostomy was done. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was not done in view of the patient\u2019s poor nutrition status",

Surgical treatment consisted of diagnostic arthroscopy, open reduction of the fracture, and internal fixation with three 40-mm headless compression screws (Figure ). The screws were placed in posterior to anterior and caudal to cranial directions. The anterior horn of the lateral meniscus was fixed to the joint capsule using FiberWire 2-0, and the ruptured retinaculum was fixed to the medial patellar margin with two Mitek anchors.

Fracture healing was regular. In <4 months after the accident, the patient returned to work without any orthopaedic therapeutic appliances. In this case, the occurrence of a femoral fracture after a low-velocity trauma was probably influenced by reduced bone quality because of an underlying NF1, but NF1 did not influence fracture healing.

The fever did not subside after 1 month and she was admitted to another hospital.\nThe patient had been generally well despite her fever and chills. Her blood pressure and pulse were normal. No bacteria were cultured from blood. Extended spectrum beta lactamase-negative Escherichia coli was isolated from the initial urine culture, but the fever did not subside after administration of appropriate antibiotics and conversion of urine culture status to negative. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen revealed that the abdomen was normal, but diffuse thickening of the aortic wall, without significant narrowing or occlusion of vessels, was evident. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and transesophageal echocardiography yielded normal results. No symptomatic improvement was evident and she was transferred to our hospital for further evaluation of the origin of fever.\nOn admission, she had a febrile sense, chills, and anorexia, but no change in body weight.

Initial CT of the head showed a 3.2 cm right frontal mass with edema that was suspicious for meningioma, and the patient was admitted for further investigation and treatment. A metastatic workup was delayed by the urgent craniotomy due to mass effect at presentation. Preoperative workup showed anemia with hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dl, alkaline phosphatase of 144 IU/L, and elevated PSA of 66.7 ng/ml. Digital rectal exam revealed asymmetry of the prostate with an elevation of the left side of the gland but no discrete nodules. MRI of the brain showed a 2.8 cm right anterior frontal extra-axial mass with enhancing dural tail, likely representing meningioma. Additionally, MRI showed moderate vasogenic edema, raising suspicion for other histology such as oligodendroglioma (Figure ). Craniotomy was performed with an intraoperative frozen section initially reported as meningioma but subsequently diagnosed as metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate on permanent pathology. Bone scan postoperatively showed increased uptake in multiple thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies, sacrum, left humerus, right femur, and several bilateral ribs, suspicious for metastatic disease (Figure ).

The chest x-ray, which is amongst the routine pro-operating exams preceding a surgery, revealed an asymptomatic left paramediastinal mass in the left hemithorax (Figure ). After a chest CT scan, there was revealed a large, 5.5 cm in diameter, multilobar mass attached to the upper lobe of the left lung, extending into the left lung, touching the cardiac wall and invading the pericardial fatty tissue, without infiltrating the parenchyma of neither the lung nor the heart (Figure ). The CT imaging of the abdomen showed no signs of lymph node enlargement or any metastatic disease. Subsequently, a biopsy of the tumour was conducted, through an FNA CT-scan. The histological results revealed a hyperplasia of the lymphoid tissue.\nFollowing these, the patient was scheduled for surgery. She was operated on through a posterolateral thoracotomy in the 5th left intercostal space. A 5 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 4.5 cm tumour was found with a pedicle stemming from the visceral pleura of the upper lobe of the left lung anteriorly. It was \"touching\" the wall of the left lung and heart, obscuring the pericardia fatty tissue. There were no signs of the tumour infiltrating the lung or any of the adjacent structures. Note that the only connection of the tumor with the lung was its pedicle and that there was no connection of the tumour with the mediastinum and the thymus. Consequently, the pedicle was sutureligated, divided and removed (Figure ).\nThe postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was released from the hospital on the 5th post-operative day.

A D&C with vacuum aspiration was performed and the presence of chorionic villi was confirmed by histology. She returned to the same hospital 4 weeks later, complaining of persistent vaginal bleeding. Transvaginal ultrasonography revealed placental remnants and a second suction-assisted D&C was performed together with diagnostic hysteroscopy. This showed the retained placental tissue to be located in the left lateral angle of the uterine cavity with mild adhesions. The evacuation failed because the metal D&C catheter could not reach the retained tissue. Two weeks later, she was referred to our hospital for further treatment. Another transvaginal ultrasound scan was done, which showed a 2.07 \u2019 1.18 cm mass of mixed echogenic material suggestive of placental remnants extending to the left angle of the uterus. The left angular myometrial mantle was thinned to approximately 6 mm (Fig. A). Her serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) test was negative.\nThe hysteroscopic MyoSure morcellation device was introduced and the angular pregnancy was confirmed by a 2 cm area of yellowish-white placental remnants within the left cornual aspect of the uterus.

The general practitioner examined the patient finally and asked questions regarding traumatic experiences. The woman revealed that she had been imprisoned and tortured. She has been beaten on the soles of the feet (falanga), hung by her arms for several hours, and given electricity to her nipples in order to give information to the military regarding her brother, who was a political dissident against the Saddam Hussein regime. She was referred to Dignity, a former RCT in Copenhagen (a Center for Rehabilitation of Traumatized and Tortured Patients) and assessed by a multi-professional team with knowledge of trauma and torture.

The swelling had been growing slowly over the period and was associated with no pain or discharge. The overall general physical health of the patient was good with nonspecific general medical history, without any contraindication to dental treatment.\nThe extraoral examination revealed a symmetrical orthognathic facial profile with no signs of neurological deficit in the lower half of the face. There was no sign of any regional lymphadenopathy. Intraoral examination revealed a mixed stage of dentition, bilateral Class I molar relationships and Class I incisors. A hard, non-tender, non-fluctuant swelling of 2.5 \u00d7 2 cm was evident in the lower left vestibule, extending from the distal surface of the left permanent canine to the distal surface of ipsilateral first permanent molar. The swelling was associated with expansion of buccal and lingual cortical plates and covered by healthy-appearing and freely-moving mucosa. The teeth adjacent to the swelling were quite firm and not associated with any decay. A panoramic radiographic examination (OPG) revealed the presence of all the permanent teeth without any decayed or supernumerary teeth. There was a well-circumscribed unilocular radiolucent lesion in the body of the mandible on the left side, which was associated with the crown of a vertically impacted second premolar. The root of the impacted second bicuspid was developed approximately up to half of its usual length and the apex was quite wide open.

A few months later, she developed numbness in all five fingers on the left side. Furthermore, the patient mentioned that she had had a burning sensation in both feet for a few years. Another few months later she complained of weakness in all four limbs and was sent for a neurological consultation with electromyography. Clinical examination revealed a Hoffmann-Tr\u00f6mner reflex on the left side, mild loss of strength in both hands, loss of vibratory sense and hypoesthesia in the distal end of all four limbs and loss of proprioception in both legs.

No abnormal findings were revealed during the physical examination or laboratory tests. Diagnostic mammography showed an asymmetric, dense shadow in the inner, upper quadrant of the left breast, and no obvious nodules were identified in the oblique view. Breast ultrasonography (US) of the left breast (Fig. ) revealed a solid hypo-echoic nodule of approximately 10 mm \u00d7 6 mm in size with an oval shape, smooth edges and a well-defined boundary. Color Doppler flow imaging showed abnormal blood flow. The resistive index (RI) was 0.62\u20130.67. Elastography showed a completely soft lesion, which was classified as E2. We paid close attention to the extensive vascularity accompanying the nodule.

Movement of the cervical spine was almost free but painful at the end of the motion range. X-ray showed osteolysis of C7.

Physical examination revealed a palpable hard mass on the anterior and posteromedial sides of his left ankle. He had a full ankle range of motion of 15\u00b0 in dorsiflexion and 40\u00b0 in plantar flexion with his knee flexed. Instability and apprehension were evoked by an anterior drawer test on his left ankle. Left ankle plain radiography revealed multiple oval free bodies 10\u201315 mm in size at the anterior and posterior ankle joint spaces (Figures and ). Computed tomography images showed intra-articular multiple ossified oval mass lesions and some protrusions arising from the talus (Figures \u2013).

A left orbital mass biopsy was performed in another hospital, revealing highly suspected IPT, so he underwent steroid pulse therapy, radiation therapy (RT; 30 Gy/15 fx), and chemotherapy (Cyclophosphamide), though the patient did not respond well to such medical procedures. In April 2013, when he visited our hospital, he has lost his vision and light reflex in the left eye, suggesting that the 3rd, 4th, and 6th nerves were affected. The computerized tomography (CT) scan showed that a spindle shaped, slightly high density mass was noted in the left anterior cavernous sinus and in the orbital apex with pressure erosion of the adjacent bones (). A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain showed enhanced lesion in the cavernous sinus bilaterally with sphenoid sinus fullness, left pituitary fossa, left orbital apex, a mass in the left temporal lobe measuring about 4.9\u00d74.3\u00d74.3 cm, left distal internal carotid artery, left proximal anterior cerebral artery A1, and left middle cerebral artery M1 segment involvement (). The positron emission tomography-CT scan showed no high metabolism lesion except in the brain (). Lab findings showed an infective state with elevated white blood cell, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein in the blood and in the cerebrospinal fluid, but did not detect bacteria or fungi.\nWe thought it might be an IPT or metastatic cancer, and applied dexamethasone and amphotericin B.

There was no history of urethral discharge or any urinary complaints. The patient was a chronic smoker and had undergone angiography for coronary artery disease 1 month back. However, there was no history of any local trauma or other comorbidities.\nLocal examination of the penile lesion revealed a lesion arising out of the meatus, at the tip of the glans, measuring 3 cm \u00d7 2 cm []. The meatus was visualized and partially obliterated and bled on touch. There was no induration beyond the lesion. The penile shaft was normal. Multiple bilateral inguinal lymph nodes were palpable each measuring <1 cm in size, firm in consistency, and mobile. The provisional diagnosis of carcinoma penis was made.\nComplete blood count and biochemical investigations were within the normal limits, except for eosinophilia (13%). The patient's serum was nonreactive for HIV and hepatitis B surface antigen. The routine urine examination showed field full of red blood cells and 2\u20134 pus cells. On contrast-enhanced computed tomography abdomen, a simple cortical cyst in the right kidney was noted; otherwise, no renal or bladder mass was seen.\nWedge biopsy of the penile lesion was taken under aseptic conditions. Histopathology showed partly ulcerated keratinized stratified squamous epithelium covered by dense fibrinous exudates and subepithelium showed a proliferation of endothelial cells with mild-to-moderate nuclear enlargement and having a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm [Figure and ]. Occasional mitotic figure (<1/10 high power field) was noted; however, no atypical mitosis was found.

In a cystoscopic examination, gross hematuria from the left ureteral orifice was found, although no apparent abnormalities were observed in bladder mucosa.

Abdominal enhanced magnetic resonance imaging identified a low signal intensity of tumor at T1 as well as T2-weighted images with a slight enhancement and an almost normal intensity in diffusion weighted image suggesting a benign tumor.

After careful haemostasis, the anterior chamber was entered obliquely with a diamond knife and the sclera was cut with Castroviejo's corneal scissors.

An ultrasound examination showed that the well-defined oval mass was 31 \u00d7 23 \u00d7 17 mm in size and exhibited heterogeneity. Furthermore, a non-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck revealed that the distinct neck mass in the subcutaneous tissue had a mixture of soft tissue and fatty components (Fig. ). Based on these findings, the cervical tumor was clinically diagnosed to be an unusual lipoma with degeneration; however, we could not exclude the possibility of it being a malignant tumor such as liposarcoma. Thus, fine-needle aspiration cytology of the tumor was performed, but no diagnosis of malignant cells was obtained. Further examinations were conducted to address concerns related to her menstrual pain, and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral ovarian cysts in the lower abdomen. Under general anesthesia, the patient underwent neck mass extirpation and bilateral ovarian cystectomy; pathological examination of the cysts resulted in a diagnosis of ovarian endometriotic cysts.

Based on ECG and elevated troponin T, acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation was diagnosed. He had no significant past medical history. Using the right radial approach and a Judkins diagnostic catheter, the very short LMCA was visualized with almost independent take-off of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and left circumflex coronary artery (LCX). First selective contrast injection into the LCX did not show any significant lesions. In order to selectively engage the LAD, excessively deep catheter intubation was performed, which caused iatrogenic LMCA dissection, propagating to the LAD and proximal LCX. Acute LAD closure and contrast extravasation was visualized (). Immediate, percutaneous attempts to open the LAD were undertaken. However, despite support with inflated 1.25 mm and 2.0 mm balloons, it was impossible to insert any of the different guidewires into the true lumen of the LAD or diagonal branch. Thus no contrast flow in the mid/distal LAD segments was restored. The patient developed CS, requiring continuous infusion of inotropes, intubation and mechanical ventilation. Thus, he was immediately transferred to a tertiary hospital with the department of cardiac surgery, where rescue off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was performed just a few hours after dissection. Entering the operating room the patient had a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 120 beats/min and blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg. The LAD dissection extended to the mid segment, distal to which the vein graft was sewn. The second vein graft was sewn to the obtuse marginal artery.

She developed bone, adrenal gland and splenic metastases, as well as worsening of existing lymph node metastases (M1c pattern). We continued the last 2 cycles of ipilimumab and began concurrent vemurafenib at 960 mg twice daily, given the massive symptomatic disease progression, along with radiation therapy (RT) to the larger masses in the cervical and inguinal regions (30 Gy in 10 fractions). The RT was done both for palliation and for synergism with ipilimumab, as it could theoretically render the tumor more immunogenic.

In the same year, he was diagnosed with prostatic carcinoma (Gleason score 3 + 3) which was treated with radiation therapy for a final total dose of 64 Gy. Since then, he has been controlled regularly on a 6-month basis. His family history was negative for cancer, but he suffered from mild hypertension that has been treated with a sartan drug for 17 years, and he also suffered from mild dyslipidemia without any medication besides dietary control.\nIn January 2014, he was admitted at the dermatologic unit of our institution for a pigmented cutaneous lesion at the occipital region of the scalp and an ulcerated lesion in the left temporal region, which were both radically excised. The pathologist reported a BRAF, c-KIT, and N-RAS wild-type lentigo maligna melanoma in the occipital scalp, while the ulcerated lesion at the temporal region was classified as an actinic keratosis. Full skin and ocular examinations, chest X-rays, and abdominal sonogram excluded the presence of clinical detectable neoplastic deposits. Due to his medical history, the patient was admitted to a three-month follow-up program. In January 2015, for the appearance of a swelling in the left parotid gland, he received an MRI and a subsequent biopsy, which led to a diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma.\nIn May 2014, he was diagnosed with hypochromic, iron-deficiency anemia in the absence of overt clinical signs of bleeding and normal urine analysis. Fecal occult blood test was strongly positive.

Prior to presenting to our facility, he underwent left radical orchiectomy, and hernia repair due to enlarging left testicle, had a transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) due to hematuria, and underwent PSA screening. Pathology determined the testicular mass to be a pT1 teratoma without lymphovascular invasion, PSA was found to be elevated (was 4.2 in 2014, now 4.39), and the 40 g of bladder tumor resected during the TURBT was found to be a leiomyoma of the bladder showing no sarcomatoid differentiation. A CT scan was performed which was notable for bilateral pelvic adenopathy with lymph nodes greater than 2 cm and an interaortocaval lymph node of approximately 1.2 cm. Additionally, outside CT scan with IV contrast of abdomen pelvis showed large 6 cm heterogeneous soft tissue mass within the posterior left aspect of the bladder (). The mass was causing complete obstruction of the left ureterovesical junction (UVJ), which resulted in severe left sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter. Although the CT findings were highly concerning for metastatic process, the TURBT specimen did not support the diagnosis of metastatic disease from a bladder primary as it had returned leiomyoma of bladder without sarcomatoid elements. The disparity between imaging findings and pathology results prompted confirmatory testing on both the initial testicular mass and the TURBT specimens. After discussion at multidisciplinary GU tumor board, the consensus recommendation was for CT-guided lymph node biopsy, repeat transurethral resection of bladder tumor, and decompression of the left upper tract via ureteral stent, or nephrostomy. The patient underwent rigid cystourethroscopy, monopolar transurethral resection of bladder tumor (large >5 cm) and monopolar transurethral resection of prostate. During this surgery, a large tumor located on the left wall extending",

He had no known diseases other than hypertension. There were no alarming symptoms in his systemic examination, such as weight loss, abdominal pain, hematemesis, and night sweats. He had no history of alcohol consumption and abstained from smoking for last 20 years, after smoking for 20 years. The patient was found to have chronic reflux symptoms, which did not regress with proton pump inhibitors. The patient had undergone a gastrectomy and a billroth 1 anastomosis long time ago. No pathological findings were observed in the initial laboratory tests; both biochemical parameters and total blood counts were normal, including hemoglobin, which was found to be 16.6 gm/dL. The tumor marker tests were renewed and CA 19-9 was 193 U/mL, carcinoembryonic antigen was 2 ng/mL, alpha-fetoprotein was 4 ng/mL, and CA 72-4 was 1.1 U/mL, which showed that the patient had an isolated CA 19-9 elevation. To rule out a possible malignity concerning the gastrointestinal system, a gastrointestinal system endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed. Endoscopic and colonoscopic examinations had no findings pointing to a malignity. A former gastric operation scar was observed at the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and the lower esophageal sphincter was found to be relaxed, explaining the reflux symptoms. To rule out a possible pancreatobiliary system malignity, abdominal computerized tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography were performed, but no findings related to a malignity that can be at the pancreas or the biliary system were observed in the radiological imaging. As the patient had persistent CA 19-9 elevation with no pathological findings to explain this situation, a follow-up was initiated. As the patient had severe reflux symptoms, during the next 5 years, three gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed. In the endoscopic examination, similar findings were observed with the prior",
