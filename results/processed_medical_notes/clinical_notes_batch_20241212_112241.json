The oncologic treatment included an en bloc resection of the heart, portions of the great vessels, several ribs and a portion of pectoralis major muscle (Fig ). The plastic surgery department evaluated the patient intraoperatively for chest wall reconstruction. It was noted that the sternum was divided in the midline and a large portion of the left sternal body, along with 4 ribs to the anterior axillary line, had been resected en bloc with the specimen. This resulted in a 10 \u00d7 10 cm2 chest wall defect (Fig ), and a decision was made to proceed with Strattice for chest wall reconstruction. Multiple interrupted 0 polydioxanone suture (PDS) sutures were placed in horizontal mattress fashion 270\u00b0 around the defect through the ribs and intercostal musculature. The Strattice was trimmed to fit the chest wall defect and was parachuted underneath the rib edges to minimize contact between the bony edges and the heart.

Her diabetes medication regimen was basal insulin glargine (Lantus) 18 units at 2 pm and rapid-acting premeal insulin glulisine (Apidra).

She also reported frequent early morning hypoglycemia (4-7 am), some of which were followed by an episode of hyperglycemia that she would then treat with 2 units of insulin glulisine if glucose was >300 mg/dL.

    "original_text": "A 75-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of left chest pain and dyspnea. A chest X-ray showed a left pneumothorax (Fig. ), and a previous chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a subpleural pulmonary nodule with cavitation in the left upper lobe (Fig. ). The patient had been on prednisolone and methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis. He also had a past history of acute coronary syndrome 5 years previously; this was treated with coronary stent implantation followed by anticoagulant therapy. He additionally had a past history of a right pneumothorax 3 years previously that was presumptively caused by rupture of a subpleural rheumatoid nodule and successfully treated with conservative thoracic drainage. Regarding his present admission, the left pneumothorax did not resolve after 1 week of chest tube drainage. There were no bacterial pathogens present in the pleural effusion.

Thus, we decided to perform thoracoscopic surgery to resect the subpleural lesion that caused intractable pneumothorax 2 months after the first admission. The surgery was performed through the fourth intercostal space along the midaxillary line, sixth intercostal space along the anteroaxillary line, and seventh intercostal space along the posteroaxillary line. There were rigid adhesions on the apex, mediastinum, and diaphragm due to repetitive pleurodesis.

Forty-eight hours later, he developed bilateral lower extremity compartment syndrome requiring decompressive, four-compartment fasciotomies of the right and lower extremities. A wound vac was placed in the operating room. Amputation due to poor motor control was discussed with the patient and his mother. They requested that we \u201cdo everything\u201d to save his legs. He had a prolonged and very complicated hospitalization with resulting end-stage-renal disease on hemodialysis at discharge, blindness due to posterior ischemic optic neuropathy or central retinal artery occlusion. He required hand grafts for upper extremity fasciotomies. He developed a pseudomonas infection of his G-tube site. He developed a Stage 2 pressure ulcer on his occiput.

Mild bilateral ptosis with a complex ophthalmoplegia most marked on upgaze, a typical finding in recessive RYR1-related myopathies, was noted. There was bilateral facial and sternocleidomastoid weakness with additional proximal upper and lower limb weakness. Reflexes were 1+, and there were no sensory abnormalities. Cardiac examination demonstrated atrial fibrillation for which he underwent cardioversion. Because of the change in symptoms, a muscle biopsy was performed. Although core-like structures were seen, they were not felt to be typical of central core disease, a common RYR1-related myopathy, and no definitive diagnosis was reached ().\nFrom this point, he continued to complain of episodes of temporary worsening of limb weakness 2 to 3 times a year lasting for several days. He could identify no specific triggers. At the age of 38 years, he presented with an episode of severe neck flexor and bulbar weakness. Over the course of 9 days, his neck flexor weakness improved to baseline. Bulbar function remained impaired, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube",

There was no history of vomiting, weight loss or alteration in the bowel habits. She was a known case of diabetes mellitus well controlled on insulin, and had undergone tubal ligation 15 years back. There was no significant family history. Her general physical examination was unremarkable. On per abdominal examination, there was tenderness in the right iliac fossa with a mobile palpable mass measuring 5 \u00d7 3 cm in size. There was no regional lymphadenopathy. Her routine biochemical and hematological investigations were within normal limits, but she was found to be HBsAg positive. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a well-defined heterogeneous, mildly enhancing, predominantly hypodense lesion measuring 5.8 \u00d7 3.6 cm lying anterosuperior to the bladder on the right side and in close proximity to the right rectus muscle []. It was thought to be an extraluminal GIST arising from the terminal ileum. The patient was undertaken for diagnostic laparotomy. A lower midline abdominal incision was given. The abdomen was opened in layers. A fibrous band was seen extending between the anterior dome of the urinary bladder and the anterior abdominal wall at the umbilicus, which in its central portion showed a 5 \u00d7 3 cm well-circumscribed lesion. It was thought to be an urachal remnant and was excised by ligating both its ends and was sent for histopathological examination.\nThe specimen consisted of a well-encapsulated nodular mass measuring 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3.5 cm. The external surface was smooth with few congested blood vessels. The cut surface was solid homogeneous with gray-white appearance [].

She was given intravenous methyl prednisolone, resulting in a complete clinical recovery. At age 67, she started to complain of numbness on the left side of her face and developed an ataxic gait. MRI of the brain and the spinal cord revealed a focal lesion in the pontine tegmentum on the right, a cystic lesion in the subcortical white matter lateral to the basal ganglia on the right (Fig. a, b), and a longitudinally extending cavitary lesion affecting the C2-C6 cervical cord (Fig. c). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed normal protein content (43 mg/dl) with increased myelin basic protein (MBP) (253 pg/ml, normal < 120). Oligoclonal bands were negative. Steroid therapy resulted in a good recovery. At age 69, she developed optic neuritis bilaterally. Serum antibodies to AQP4 was positive, and she was diagnosed as having NMOSD. After intravenous steroid therapy, she was started on a low maintenance dose of oral prednisone of 15 mg. At age 70, she was unable to walk and was admitted to our hospital. The neurologic examination revealed the patient had normal mental status, bilaterally decreased vision, mild dysarthria, weakness and sensory loss in the right upper extremity, and spastic paraplegia. Steroid administration was not effective in reversing her condition and she became wheelchair bound. At age 72, she developed acute myocardial infarction which was successfully treated with a stent placement. She was incidentally found to have aplastic anemia and received blood transfusions.

He was then admitted, and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain showed cystic astrocytoma in the right parietal lobe without midline shifting. A craniotomy was performed, and the pathology showed astrocytoma (World Health Organization (WHO) grade III).

The morphology of the tumor featured basaloid cells which extended into the dermis with elongated nuclei and little cytoplasm. The peripheral cell layer of the tumor masses showed a palisade arrangement of the nuclei (Fig. ). No skin tumor recurrence has been noted to date.\nTwo years later, the patient developed headache, left side weakness with unsteady gait at the age of 44. His brain MRI revealed a huge cystic lesion with fluid-fluid level in the patient's right frontal lobe. There were hemorrhage, perifocal edema, mass effect causing mild midline shift.

His medical history detailed a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome (membranous nephropathy), which had been treated with prednisone for a period of four months. Drug-induced diabetes was subsequently detected one month after the onset of corticosteroid treatment. The patient developed productive cough, pyrexia, and night sweats, and was further diagnosed with pneumonia three weeks before the admission. His medications at the time included prednisone 20 mg daily, insulin and oral cefdinir. He had no history of ocular trauma or surgery.\nAn ophthalmic examination revealed visual acuities of 20/20 in the right eye and counting fingers at 2 ft in the left. Pupils were 3 mm and reactive in each eye without relative afferent pupillary defect. The right eye was normal. Slit lamp examination of the left eye was unremarkable. Fundus examination showed clear media and a creamy-white and raised subretinal lesion located at the posterior pole, with the lesion being five disc diameters in size. Additionally, multiple retinal hemorrhages were seen in the overlying retina (Fig. ). The intraocular pressures were normal in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated a hyperreflective substance located in the subretinal space, between the outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium (Fig. ). Although a further diagnostic workup was requested on the follow day of presentation, the patient was lost to follow-up and presented five days later with reduced vision in the affected eye.

Two months after the accident, he was misdiagnosed with a simple ulnar fracture and another operation called ulnar ORIF was performed without treatment of the dislocation of the radial head. Radiography demonstrated dislocation of the radial head with a concomitant fracture of the third proximal ulna upon initial presentation at the local hospital (Fig. A and B). In view of the extreme dissatisfaction with the recovery effect, the patient came to our hospital for further treatment. Upon examination, the patient was right-hand dominant with pain and deformity of the left elbow and the ulnar side of the wrist. Two old scars were visible on the left forearm, but no distal neurovascular deficits were noted. However, the piano-key test and the table-top test were positive according to the physical examination.

    "original_text": "A 72-year-old woman with a past medical history of sarcoidosis underwent an endoscopic examination owing to dysphagia. The endoscopic examination revealed a circumferential tumor with ulceration in the cervical esophagus. Biopsies obtained during the endoscopy indicated squamous cell carcinoma. Contrast-enhanced CT showed extensive tumor growth with suspected tracheal invasion and enlarged lymph nodes extending from the cervical region to the upper mediastinum. FDG-PET/CT revealed abnormal FDG accumulation in the primary lesion (SUV max: 23.1) and lymph nodes (SUV max: 5.45) from the cervical to upper mediastinal region (Fig. ). However, it was difficult to determine whether the multiple lymphadenopathy was benign or metastatic because of her past medical history of sarcoidosis. Therefore, and also for the purpose of preserving the larynx, we initiated definitive chemoradiotherapy. The patient was administered 2 cycles of 45 mg cisplatin and 700 mg 5-fluorouracil with 60 Gy/30 fr radiation therapy over 2 months. In each cycle, 8 mg dexamethasone was administered to prevent side effects of chemotherapy. After completing the chemoradiotherapy, we observed complete disappearance of FDG uptake in the primary cancer in the esophagus, and only a slight reduction in FDG uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes (SUV max: 3.26; Fig. ), which indicated that the lymph nodes were affected by sarcoidosis. The primary lesion of the esophagus relapsed 3 months later. Then, the patient underwent thoracoscopic and laparoscopic total laryngopharyngoesophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction via the posterior mediastinal route. The pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the cervical esophagus. The resected lymph nodes demonstrated no tumor metastasis. However, some lymph nodes showed granulomatous reactions and contained several small epithelioid cell granulomas (Fig. ), suggesting the presence of sarcoidosis.

    "cleaned_text": "a 72-year-old woman with a past medical history of sarcoidosis underwent an endoscopic examination owing to dysphagia. the endoscopic examination revealed a circumferential tumor with ulceration in the cervical esophagus. biopsies obtained during the endoscopy indicated squamous cell carcinoma. contrast-enhanced ct showed extensive tumor growth with suspected tracheal invasion and enlarged lymph nodes extending from the cervical region to the upper mediastinum. fdg-pet/ct revealed abnormal fdg accumulation in the primary lesion (suv max: 23.1) and lymph nodes (suv max: 5.45) from the cervical to upper mediastinal region (fig. ). however, it was difficult to determine whether the multiple lymphadenopathy was benign or metastatic because of her past medical history of sarcoidosis. therefore, and also for the purpose of preserving the larynx, we initiated definitive chemoradiotherapy. the patient was administered 2 cycles of 45 mg cisplatin and 700 mg 5-fluorouracil with 60 gy/30 fr radiation therapy over 2 months. in each cycle, 8 mg dexamethasone was administered to prevent side effects of chemotherapy. after completing the chemoradiotherapy, we observed complete disappearance of fdg uptake in the primary cancer in the esophagus, and only a slight reduction in fdg uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes (suv max: 3.26; fig. ), which indicated that the lymph nodes were affected by sarcoidosis. the primary lesion of the esophagus relapsed 3 months later. then, the patient underwent thoracoscopic and laparoscopic total laryngopharyngoesophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction via the posterior mediastinal route. the pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the cervical esophagus. the resected lymph nodes demonstrated no tumor metastasis. however, some lymph nodes showed granulomatous reactions and contained several small epithelioid cell granulomas (fig. ), suggesting the presence of sarcoidosis. the final stage was determined as pt2n0m0, pstage ib (uicc 7th). the patient was discharged 27 days after surgery. contrast-enhanced ct performed 6 months after surgery showed no tumor recurrence. however, the patient died of myocardial infarction",

This was also confirmed with fine needle aspiration under ultrasound guidance.\nA multidisciplinary meeting has taken place and decision has been made to proceed with wide local excision of his melanoma scar and left axillary lymph node dissection.\nA total of 18 lymph nodes were identified in the dissection specimen, with the two largest totally replaced by tumour with extensive necrosis.\nPost operatively two closed suction drains have been inserted in the axilla and stayed a total duration of 3 weeks.

The discharge had the appearance of \u2018frank blood\u2019. He had not noticed any other changes to the breast or nipple and had no history of trauma. His previous history included a mild inflammatory arthritis for which he no longer required medication and a microprolactinoma, diagnosed 13 years previously, for which he required testosterone supplementation due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, but no other treatment. At the time of the presentation with blood stained nipple discharge, prolactin levels were within normal ranges as were other hormone assays related to his pituitary function. Cabergoline had been discontinued four years prior to presentation. There was no family history of breast cancer, he did not smoke or take alcohol in excess.\nClinical assessment found no visible or palpable abnormality in the breast disc but demonstrated the bloody discharge. Ultrasonography demonstrated subareolar ducts but no focal mass. Mammography was normal on the right but indeterminate on the left with a 16-mm asymmetry in the 9-o-clock position within the retroareolar tissue and with associated flecks of benign appearing calcification (Figure ). Cytology of a smear of discharge showed plentiful red blood cells and histiocytes with no epithelial cells present. As duct excision was planned, core biopsy was not performed.\nThe case was discussed in a multi-disciplinary team meeting and a left total duct excision was recommended. This was performed under general anaesthetic, with an anterior shave of tissue taken from behind the nipple. Pathological findings were unusual in the context of a male patient, showing a few scattered benign intraductal papillomas measuring up to 2 mm (Figure ).

    "cleaned_text": "we present a 62-year-old male patient, who presented with a few months of left-sided, episodic, blood-stained nipple discharge, occurring spontaneously and without warning. the discharge had the appearance of 'frank blood'. he had not noticed any other changes to the breast or nipple and had no history of trauma. his previous history included a mild inflammatory arthritis for which he no longer required medication and a microprolactinoma, diagnosed 13 years previously, for which he required testosterone supplementation due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, but no other treatment. at the time of the presentation with blood stained nipple discharge, prolactin levels were within normal ranges as were other hormone assays related to his pituitary function. cabergoline had been discontinued four years prior to presentation. there was no family history of breast cancer, he did not smoke or take alcohol in excess.\nclinical assessment found no visible or palpable abnormality in the breast disc but demonstrated the bloody discharge. ultrasonography demonstrated subareolar ducts but no focal mass. mammography was normal on the right but indeterminate on the left with a 16-mm asymmetry in the 9-o-clock position within the retroareolar tissue and with associated flecks of benign appearing calcification (figure ). cytology of a smear of discharge showed plentiful red blood cells and histiocytes with no epithelial cells present. as duct excision was planned, core biopsy was not performed.\nthe case was discussed in a multi-disciplinary team meeting and a left total duct excision was recommended. this was performed under general anaesthetic, with an anterior shave of tissue taken from behind the nipple. pathological findings were unusual in the context of a male patient, showing a few scattered benign intraductal papillomas measuring up to 2 mm (figure ). immunohistochemistry showed heterogenous positivity with cytokeratin (ck) 5/6. no atypia was noted. the patient made an uneventful recovery with no further reported nipple discharge and preservation of his nipple and chest wall",

Physical examination revealed the presence of one BB in his forehead, as well as nystagmus and hypopigmentation over his entire body.

An inquiry into family history was made, and it was noted that the patient has a paternal female cousin with albinism (with no current signs of schizophrenia) and maternal grandmother with schizophrenia. As for his immediate family, there were no other cases of either schizophrenia or albinism among his biological parents or three siblings.

He was started on insulin therapy the year following diagnosis () with 1 unit of rapid acting insulin analogue, insulin aspart, per 20 g of carbohydrates, and no basal insulin. Eight years after being diagnosed with CFRD, he was approved to start a new therapy, ivacaftor 150 mg orally twice daily for treatment of his CF based on his G551D mutation. Pre-ivacaftor, his insulin regimen was unchanged as he generally averaged between 4 and 6 units of insulin aspart per meal consistent with a carbohydrate content of 100 to 120 g per meal. This dose was consistent with what he received as an inpatient during admissions with stable postprandial levels not requiring additional correction. Within 6 months of starting ivacaftor, he reported recurrent hypoglycemic episodes and stopped insulin therapy. Between starting ivacaftor and the 3 subsequent years, the patient had been hospitalized for CF exacerbations 8 times at our institution. On these admissions, he rarely required insulin with only low-dose sliding scale insulin aspart as needed for elevated blood sugars.

Tooth #48, which was horizontally embedded, was extracted in August 2010, but the pain continued. In August 2015, she presented at the Department of Oral Surgery of another hospital with a purulent discharge from the pocket of tooth #47. Intraoral radiography showed insufficient root canal filling in the distal root and a foreign body, suspected to be extruded gutta-percha, outside the apex of the mesial root of tooth #47, accompanied by bone absorption around both roots (Fig. ). Two months later, she underwent extraction of tooth #47, removal of the foreign body, and curettage of the periapical lesion, resulting in the disappearance of the pain. However, she noted expansion of the right posterior mandibular bone in March 2016 and was thus referred in May 2016 to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan. Her health and nutritional status were good in spite of a low body mass index (17.0). Both a blood test and a chest X-ray showed normal findings. She had neither lymphadenopathy nor paralysis of the mental/lingual nerve. The right inferior border of the mandibular bone slightly bulged. The socket of tooth #47 was epithelialized, and tooth #46 was vital, with a pocket depth of 3 mm. There was no sinus tract. Panoramic radiography revealed new bone formation at the equivalent sites of teeth #48 and #47 and a radiolucent region around the distal root of tooth #46 (Fig. ). Computed tomography showed continuous absorption from the alveolar bone of the distal root of tooth #46 to the lingual cortical bone at the equivalent of tooth #47 and six granulated hard tissues (Fig. , ).

He had been diagnosed by his primary ophthalmologist, on day one, as right sixth nerve palsy of presumed ischemic origin and had been advised prism glasses. On examination, both eyes had visual acuities of 6/6 N6. Intraocular pressures, pupillary reactions, and dilated fundus examination of both eyes were normal. Ocular motility evaluation showed that the patient had an isolated right-sided abduction deficit [Fig. \u2013]. There was no proptosis or enophthalmos. All other cranial nerves were normal. Systemically, the patient had no vasculopathic risk factors or other illnesses. On eliciting a detailed systemic history with pointed questions, the patient disclosed that he had been suffering from a dull toothache in the region of his right upper molars and had difficulty in chewing for the last one month; for which, he had not sought any treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed. A mass measuring 4.2 cm \u00d7 3 cm \u00d7 2.2 cm was seen arising from the right half of the hard palate with solid contents eroding into the right maxillary sinus through the floor along with destruction of the right maxillary-alveolar ridge in the region of the molar teeth [].

In the operating room, the bowel was found to be diffusely dilated without any areas of apparent ischemia. A portion of small bowel was found to be adhered to the anterior abdominal wall in the left upper quadrant. Upon further exploration, a retained LVAD driveline was found to be tunneled into the peritoneal cavity, strangulating a loop of small bowel in the left upper quadrant (Figs. and ). The driveline was freed from the abdominal wall and removed, and the affected loop of bowel was released (Fig. ). It was found to be viable after a few minutes of reperfusion.

When her symptoms increased, with the onset of sciatica radiating from the fifth lumbar nerve root on the right side, an MRI scan of her spine was performed and an intensification of conservative therapeutic methods under stationary conditions was planned. The MRI results (0.5T) were interpreted as a prolapse of the L4/L5 lumbar intervertebral disc, abutting the L5 thecal sac and nerve root, causing the pain in her leg.\nConservative treatment with a series of periradicular infiltrations (including bupivacaine and triamcinolone) in combination with physical therapy resulted in a decrease in her symptoms and our patient was discharged. Subsequently, she underwent an elective hysterectomy due to endometriosis. During this surgery, unusually pronounced varicosis was found in her lesser pelvis that had not previously been detected. Postoperatively, our patient developed a symptomatic pulmonary embolism. Consequently, further evaluation of adjacent structures and diagnostic tests for thrombophilia were initiated. The pulmonary embolism was found to be caused by hypoplasia of her inferior vena cava, with a bilateral occlusion of her vena iliaca communis. A diagnostic evaluation showed that a collateral pathway with ectatic enlargement of the veins of her lesser pelvis had also developed. Anticoagulant medication in combination with compression therapy was recommended because a surgical correction of this malformation was not possible.\nSubsequently, our patient was again admitted to our hospital because of an exacerbation of the nerve root irritation. She had classic root tension signs (straight leg raise and bow string tests). In addition, a greater level of pain was experienced with increased intra-abdominal pressure (when, for example, coughing, sneezing or pushing). More severe neurological deficiencies, in the form of paresis or bladder and rectal dysfunction, were not found. She was by this time severely incapacitated",

She presented at age 17 with inability to abduct her legs against any resistance on an exercise machine; other muscle groups were strong. Following her first pregnancy at age 20, she noticed weakness, difficulty climbing stairs, and tripping and falling that progressed in frequency over the next 3 years from once a month to once a week. A muscle biopsy and genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of HIBM with homozygous M712T mutations in GNE. At age 25, she noted difficulty fastening snaps and could not raise her arms to pull back her hair. Progression was gradual, with more significant decline following illnesses. Treatments included solumederol, 1 g intravenously for 3 days, which resulted in improved strength but was followed by relapse. On one occasion, IVIG (dose unknown) was given over 3 days, providing no improvement but complicated by aseptic meningitis requiring hospitalization. For the 6 months prior to admission, the patient used a wheelchair and required assistance walking and with transfers. Medications included sertraline for depression and anxiety, and vitamins.\nAt the NIH Clinical Center, the patient was wheelchair dependent, but could go from sit to stand and ambulate a few feet with support. She had bilateral foot drop and significant weakness of upper and lower extremities, with some sparing of the quadriceps. Muscle atrophy was universally apparent. Cranial nerves and sensation were intact. MRI of the calf showed pronounced fatty involution of the musculature bilaterally, worse proximally. The lateral soleus and posterior tibial muscles were somewhat spared distally. A quadriceps muscle biopsy revealed moderate type II fiber predominance.

Two years after initiation of symptoms without clinical progress, the patient became pregnant and noted a local growth of the mass. After giving birth to a healthy child, the patient consulted an orthopedic surgeon. A radiographic image of the pelvis revealed a large osteolytic lesion in the left iliac wing, sharply contoured with sclerotic margins, indicating a slow growth pattern (Figure ). MR-imaging of the pelvis showed a mass originating from the os ilium with a large extra- and intrapelvic soft-tissue component (Figure ). Open biopsy was performed that lead to the diagnosis of BFH.\nAfter reference to the literature on BFH, surgical en bloc resection was considered to be the appropriate treatment modality [,,,].

Two years after her surgery, a 6-month follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan revealed enlargement of the thyroid tumor, but she remained asymptomatic. Blood tests revealed a small increase in CA 19-9 (from 3.5 ng/ml 6 months earlier to 8.9 ng/ml) and in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (from 1.7 ng/ml to 4.6 ng/ml). Her thyroid function tests were normal. Physical examination and laryngoscopy revealed a firm elastic nodule in the thyroid gland and left vocal fold paralyzed in the midline position.

    "original_text": "A 17-year-old Caucasian woman was referred by her own general practitioner to the department of adolescent psychiatry and addiction prevention for binge drinking and daily use of marijuana. The intake together with her parents showed that the patient already had a history of moderate depression and an eating disorder, anorectic of the purging type with moderate severity. No abnormalities were reported regarding appearance, behavior, eye contact, and rapport orientation and cognition [intelligence quotient (IQ) of 127]. However, she regularly suffered from suicidal thoughts and a low ability to experience pleasure. Though she had no concrete suicide plans, in gloomy periods she showed risky behavior, like crossing a busy road without looking. She usually performed well in school, despite occasional lags in attendance, which were compensated with short periods of active study. Her mother had a history of MDD.\nAt the department of adolescent psychiatry and addiction prevention, we classified the addiction behavior as mild. But we also established a comorbid psychiatric and substance-use disorder profile. Thus, we chose for an integrated treatment for comorbidity that has been found to be consistently superior (). Effective treatment for comorbid conditions combines different therapeutic modalities, i.e. psychotherapy [e.g. motivational interviewing (MI), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)], pharmacotherapy (e.g. antidepressants), and family therapy.

She was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C in 2002 and received splenectomy due to portal hypertension in 2006. Interferon therapy was administered several times, and she achieved a sustained virological response in 2011.\nIn 2014, she was administered CIRT with a total of 60 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) given in four fractions because of rapidly enlarged tumor with segmental portal vein invasion, as shown on contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Before admission, CT revealed a new recurrence tumor in the lateral segment of the left lobe (Fig. A). The irregular surface and unsmooth liver edge also showed LC. Furthermore, severe atrophy was obvious at the CIRT area (Fig. A). Because of the new lesion in the left lobe located close to the heart and the underlying liver failure with C-P grade B (9 points), LDLT was performed with an extended left lobe graft from her son in 2015. During surgery, strong adhesion between the thoracic diaphragm and the irradiated lesion in Segment 7 was observed, which resulted in difficulty with adhesiolysis (Fig. B). If we preserve the diaphragm, it might be injured irradiated liver during adhesiolysis. We intensively choose a part of diaphragm resection with liver, also protected inferior vena cava (IVC) from injury during resection of diaphragm. We checked where the IVC existed in the thoracic cavity and preserved the IVC above the liver, encircling the right hepatic vein (RHV) after mobilization of the liver. The diaphragm was then repaired directly by suturing. After reconstruction of the hepatic vein (HV), portal vein (PV), hepatic artery and bile duct, we successfully finished the operation. The surgery took over 11 h to complete, and the total amount of blood lost was 2500 g with 10 units of fresh-frozen plasma transfusion (FFP).",

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the lungs revealed a thin-walled, bilobulated, homogenous cystic mass extending from the second to eighth thoracic segments (). The right neural foramens of the fourth and fifth thoracic vertebrae were dilated, likely due to protrusion of the meninges via these foramens. There was also significant spinal cord compression at the fourth and fifth thoracic levels. A postero-laterally oriented intrathoracic meningocele was thus diagnosed. Scoliotic angle was calculated to be approximately 42 degrees by Cobb's method. Upper extremity weakness could not be explained by the thoracic mass, and so electromyography analysis was performed, revealing left brachial plexus injury.
