Clinically, the overlying mucosa of the lesion was intact and there was pain and tenderness. Except for three of the teeth, no reaction was obtained with an electrical pulp tester in the involved teeth within the lesion, but the teeth turned to be vital at follow-up.\nAccording to the statement of the patient\u2019s parents, the swelling started developing from approximately 4 months ago and in the last 2 months its growth caused asymmetry in the left side of the chin. In the panoramic radiograph (ProMax; (Courtesy Planmeca Inc., Roselle, lL)), a well-defined radiolucent lesion extending from posterior to the mandibular right first molar to the distal aspect of the left first premolar was evident.\nThe scallop outline in the superior border of the lesion and displacement of the right lateral and second premolar were evident. Lamina dura of some of the teeth was totally or partly destroyed. The internal structure of the lesion on panoramic view was as multilocular appearance that included wispy, ill-defined trabeculae and in some areas of the lesion there was evidence of fine, straight septa making a tennis racket-like or step-ladder like pattern (). On occlusal projection, some of the trabeculae were at right angles to the periphery. In addition, the occlusal view revealed a considerable expansion of the buccal and especially lingual cortical plates (). The differential diagnosis included central giant cell granuloma, aneurysmal bone cyst and odontogenic tumors (probably mural or unicystic ameloblastoma and odontogenic myxoma). The patient was operated after 30 days. During the operation an empty cavity without epithelial lining was exposed. Simple bone cyst was the diagnosis in surgical observation",

He was seen at a local hospital after the injury and was placed in a coaptation splint. On initial examination, gross motor and sensation were intact. To rule out malignancy, an magnetic resonance imaging was obtained which did not demonstrate any pathological lesions. In an effort to speed recovery and maintain maximal function, he underwent ORIF. An anterolateral approach to the humerus was made, and the fracture was reduced and compressed using a large fragment plate and screw construct().\nSix weeks following the surgery, the patient began to jog and lightly throw a baseball. He began light weight lifting and continued home PT to strengthen the elbow and shoulder. By 3months\u2019 post-operative, the fracture had united. The patient returned to college baseball 6 months postoperatively. Eleven months following the fracture repair and 5months following return to baseball, the patient felt a \u201cpop\u201d with immediate pain in the posterolateral aspect of his right arm following a throw. Radiographs of the right humerus revealed two new fracture lines. A computed tomography scan confirmed anew spiral fracture of the midshaft of the humerus extending from the second proximal screw to the lag screw. The hardware remains intact, and there is no evidence of hardware failure or loosening (). Vitamin D levels were obtained and were found to be low.

Computed tomography showed an intramural cystic tumor having a maximum diameter of 70 mm in the antrum of the stomach (Fig. a). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed an elevated lesion covered with normal mucosa in the gastric antrum (Fig. b), and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) biopsy and incisional biopsy were performed for the lesion. A large amount of mucinous or pus-like material was discharged from the biopsy site. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen only revealed abscess-like inflammatory granulation with mucus (data not shown). Both upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and computed tomography two weeks after the biopsy showed that the lesion decreased in size but remained. There was a possibility that the lesion was intramural gastric abscess of unknown etiology. However, the patient was decided to be underwent tumor resection because it could not be ruled out that the lesion was GIST with cystic change. Laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with Roux-en Y anastomosis was done. During the procedure, gastric antral wall thickening with adhesion to the omentum and transverse mesocolon was observed, but the tumor resection was completely accomplished. Lymph node dissection was not carried out. The patient has no recurrent lesion for 8 months after the surgery.\nResected tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. A slightly elevated lesion (45 \u00d7 40 mm) was observed in the gastric antrum (Fig. a). Cut surface of the lesion did not appear clearly cystic but did rather solid, and the lesion seemed to be present mainly in the proper muscular and subserosal layers (Fig. b). Tissues were embedded in paraffin and 3-\u03bcm-thick sections were cut.

Physical examination revealed extensive bullous ulcerating and hemorrhagic skin lesions involving posterior aspects of both breasts and upper abdominal skin bilaterally (Figure ). An initial diagnostic skin biopsy of the skin lesion revealed abundant amyloid deposits with positive congo red stain and positive apple-green birefringence under polarized light microscopy. These findings were consistent with pathologic diagnosis of bullous amyloidosis of skin (Figure ). A direct immunofluorescence study of the specimen with a panel of four immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, and C3) was negative. No circulating antibody against basement membrane zone antibody was detected by indirect immunofluorescence study. Initial hematologic workup included serum protein electrophoresis, which had a normal pattern without any M-spike in the gamma region; serum immunofixation was negative for any monoclonal gammopathy, and quantitative immunoglobulin assay was consistent with mild panhypogammaglobulinemia.

Five years later, left ankle pain developed and the range of ankle motion became limited, so he underwent resection of bone hyperplasia. Thereafter, the left ankle became intermittently painful, which persisted for about one year.\nThe initial examination at our hospital (18 years after the ankle fracture and 43 years old at this time) revealed tenderness along the posterior tibial tendon and a left ankle range of motion from 10\u00b0 of dorsiflexion to 60\u00b0 of plantarflexion. He was overweight at that time (his body mass index was 35.6 kg/m2). The left foot was relatively flat, but too much toe sign was not visible and he could perform left single-leg heel raises. X-rays revealed bone hyperplasia between the distal tibia and fibula (). Three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) revealed tibial bone hyperplasia along the posterior tibial tendon (). The posterior tibial tendon had spotted isointensity in regions of low intensity on T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and spotted high intensity in low-intensity T2-weighted images ().

Her right breast had undergone rapid enlargement 3 months previously after she had fallen from a motorcycle.

A physical examination revealed a hypervascular skin lesion measuring 5 \u00d7 5 cm on the right breast near the areolar and the large mass was also detected (Fig. ). The right axillary lymph node was found to measure 1 cm after palpation. A mammogram revealed a large circumscribed hyperechoic mass occupying nearly entire right breast and exhibited multiple internal cystic areas, hypoechoic masses and internal vascularity (Fig. ). A chest CT showed a hypervascular mass in the right breast measuring 13.7 cm that abutted the pectoralis muscle as well as cystic changes measuring 5.3 cm within the mass (Fig. ).

The patient was treated with prednisolone at 1 mg/kg, chloroquine 250 mg per day, and azathioprine 50 mg every 12 hours. She initially presented with a history of one week of burning pain in the back of the lumbar region, radiating to the flank of the same side, which increased with changes in position associated with intermittent claudication. Abdominal ultrasound done as an outpatient (prior to the presentation) revealed left renal hypoplasia and splenomegaly. As an initial study, a renal artery doppler was performed showing post-stenotic left renal intraparenchymal arterial flow, which suggested the possibility of thrombosis. Subsequently, angiography showed an infrarenal aortic occlusion with distal reconstitution of the iliac arteries and a left para-aortic retroperitoneal lesion that suggested a lymph node conglomerate as the first possibility. Left renal atrophic changes were also identified with images suggestive of vascular infarcts. The possibility of an infectious process was not ruled out; consequently, a PET scan was indicated, identifying a hypometabolic left para-aortic oval image that corresponded to a hematoma with contained rupture of the abdominal aorta (Figures -).\nNo hypermetabolic alterations consistent with an active infectious process were observed. Vascular surgery and hemodynamics were consulted, and she underwent performing a thoracoabdominal aortic reconstruction together with an aortorenal bypass and left nephrectomy. Renal arteriography revealed a 99% subocclusive thrombotic lesion, for which balloon angioplasty was done along with the deployment of a stent to normalize the lumen",

As part of pre-operative monitoring, a subclavian vein central venous cannulation by infraclavicular route was planned. A central venous catheter (16-18-18Ga, 7 Fr, 20 cm, triple lumen; certofix, B Braun) was inserted via right subclavian vein by Seldinger technique under aseptic precautions by the anaesthesia registrar in the operating theatre with HR, NIBP, SPO2 and ECG monitoring. Passage of the catheter was smooth and unimpeded. There was a good central venous pressure (CVP) waveform and good back flow of blood on aspiration from all the three lumens. The rest of the general anaesthesia and surgery were uneventful. CVP readings were taken 30 min apart and each time a good waveform was noted. As part of routine protocol, a portable chest X-ray was performed before shifting the patient to the neuro-intensive care unit for further monitoring and observation. On reviewing the chest X-ray by the anaesthesiologist, the CVP catheter was found to be internally rotated inside the right proximal internal jugular vein. However, it followed the normal path of right brachiocephalic vein to superior vena cava.\nSince blood could be aspirated from all the three lumen ports, central venous pressure was measured with a normal CVP waveform and IV fluids/drugs could be infused via the same catheter, we intended to continue with the same central line for the further management of patient.

One year earlier, he was involved in a head-on car collision, which resulted in acute pain in the upper half of the body when moving his left arm forward. He was seated in the front right (driver's) seat and wearing a three-point seatbelt at the time of the accident. Cervical spine sprain and left shoulder contusion were diagnosed at an emergency hospital, and although he was treated with medication and rehabilitation, his symptoms did not improve. Physical examination of the left glenohumeral joint revealed no limited range of motion, muscle weakness, or signs of instability, but tenderness was noted around the sternoclavicular joint. Crepitus and severe pain in the left upper thorax occurred during moving the left shoulder downward from 80 to 70 degrees in flexion. A lower brachial plexus injury was also suspected because of a sensory disturbance in the C8 cervical root area and weak grip (10 kg; measured using a squeeze dynamometer). Although initial examination of the sternoclavicular joint on plain radiography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no obvious abnormalities, injection of corticosteroid and local anesthetic into the sternoclavicular joint temporally reduced the pain. As we assumed that his symptoms were caused by injury to the sternoclavicular joint disc accompanied by synovitis, we performed arthroscopic surgery of the left sternoclavicular joint. Because arthroscopic findings demonstrated synovitis and partial tear of the intra-articular disc of the left sternoclavicular joint (), synovectomy and partial disc excision were performed. Postoperatively, the patient's symptoms decreased by half, but another pain and crepitus at the inferior lateral portion of the sternoclavicular joint developed a few days after the initial surgery.

Adjuvant radiotherapy of the genital and groin regions was performed. Nine months later, she presented with recurrent metastatic BRAF-wildtype melanoma with nodal and pulmonary involvement. She was treated with nivolumab as part of the CheckMate-067 trial and had stable disease for 17 months. After a second local recurrence in August 2018 with only incomplete resection, follow-up treatment with imiquimod was performed. One month later pulmonary metastases reappeared, and ICI with ipilimumab and nivolumab was initiated. After two cycles of ICI, therapy was paused because of grade 2 hepatitis. Initially, systemic steroids were not commenced, and detailed laboratory examinations were performed. Grade 4 neutropenia was diagnosed, and the patient was hospitalized. Detailed medical history revealed that the patient had taken metamizole two days before the onset of neutropenia due to a headache ().

She was diagnosed with ESRD following blood tests and renal biopsy and was referred to the dialysis access assessment clinic. She elected for PD and had her catheter inserted surgically. She briefly underwent a period of haemodialysis via a tunnelled Tesio line (in her internal jugular vein) due to an episode of PD peritonitis, before reverting to PD. She continued with PD until her transplant procedure in February 2020.\nThe patient has an extensive past medical history, for which she takes numerous medications including alfacalcidol (a vitamin D analogue) following the development of ESRD, and pravastatin and ramipril for cholesterol and hypertension management. She was diagnosed with Graves\u2019 disease in 2015, but her elective thyroidectomy was cancelled as it clashed with her transplant procedure. She also carries the sickle cell trait. Most importantly with regards to her renal transplant is her history of hepatitis B and HIV, having been HIV-positive since 2003. She attends check-ups every two months, and her antiretroviral therapy (ART) consists of 600 mg abacavir and 300 mg lamivudine (both nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or NRTIs) daily. At the time of transplant assessment, her plasma viral load was undetectable. It is thought that her ESRD was secondary to HIV nephropathy and hypertension.\nThe patient received a right kidney from a donor after brain death (DBD), with a 1/1/1 HLA mismatch. The donor was CMV antibody negative and HIV negative. The kidney was implanted extraperitoneally into the right iliac fossa in a standard fashion via a Gibson incision.

The patient reported landing directly on his left shoulder after being tackled. He noted immediate pain and inability to move his left shoulder. On-site athletic training staff removed him from play and placed him into a sling. This was an injury to his non-throwing arm. At his initial evaluation 5 days after his injury, he continued to have severe pain and limited motion. He denied any previous shoulder injury. Examination was limited due to guarding. Clinically, he had significant ecchymosis about the upper arm and tenderness to palpation throughout the proximal shoulder. Active forward elevation was limited to 60\u00b0. He had weakness with posterior rotator cuff testing. There were no appreciable signs of instability on examination. Plain radiographs including anteroposterior, axillary lateral, and outlet views of the shoulder were obtained in office and demonstrated no evidence of acute fracture or dislocation. There was no evidence of Hill-Sachs deformity. The patient was sent for magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA) to further evaluate his injury. MRA (Figs. and ) demonstrated a full-thickness tear of the infraspinatus with minimal retraction. The supraspinatus and subscapularis were intact. No biceps or labral pathology was identified.

Anterior segment examination was unremarkable with intraocular pressure 19 mmHg in the right eye and 9 mmHg in the left eye. Fundus examination revealed myopic tessellated fundus with macular degeneration with the presence of an oval greyish lesion inferior to the macula within the deep posterior staphyloma symmetrically in both eyes [Fig. and ]. The right eye also showed macular hole with retinal detachment. The left eye showed macular hole with Bullous Retinal Detachment extending from 11 to 7\u2019o clock hr with choroidal detachment as evident on Bscan [Fig. , , and ].\nA spectral domain OCT was performed and confirmed the presence of macular hole with retinal detachment in both eyes along with the presence of deep macular staphyloma []. Interestingly, deep within the base of the staphyloma on SD\u2013OCT, there was further deep excavation within the staphyloma with thin RPE and choroid which was bilaterally symmetrical suggestive of choroidal coloboma [Figs. , , and ]. This coloboma was corresponding to the oval dark grey excavation seen clinically inferior to the macula and was found to be symmetrical in both eyes. She underwent Encirclage with Pars Plana Vitrectomy with Silicon oil injection.

However, recent follow-up MRI had not shown any new MS-related demyelinated brain lesions.

In addition to metabolic work up for her weakness, hypokalemic periodic paralysis and MS flare were also on the differential for this presentation.\nThe patient\u2019s potassium was aggressively repleted at the outside hospital both orally and intravenously. She had also received 3 L of intravenous normal saline for hypotension.

The diagnosis of flare of gout of the left ankle was made. He had already been admitted twice within the past 2 months for the same diagnosis. The current flare of gout happened while he was still taking prednisolone 20 mg once daily and colchicine 500 microgram twice daily. Due to his underlying conditions of IHD and CKD, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were not used. His prednisolone dose was increased to 30 mg daily. The rheumatologist injected 20 mg of intra-articular triamcinolone into his ankle on day 2 of admission. Left ankle joint fluid aspiration under ultrasound guidance was simultaneously performed, but this was unsuccessful as only minimal fluid was present. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the left foot was performed as his gouty arthritis was frequent and recalcitrant. The MRI showed changes consistent with gout (Table ).\nThe ankle pain did not improve much; however, the C-reactive protein (CRP) showed significant improvement (Table ).

There was no evidence of lung metastasis. A follow-up CT scan taken after postoperative 6 years demonstrated the presence of two nodules in both the lower lobes of lungs. Both the nodules were 0.6 cm in the longest diameter. At the 2 years follow-up CT scan after detection of the pulmonary nodules, there was a slight increase in the size of right lobe nodule from 0.6 to 0.8 cm (). Consequently, the patient underwent wedge resections of both lobes. The resected right lower lobe measured 5.8\u00d73.3 cm in dimension and it contained a small nodule measuring 0.8\u00d70.5 cm in dimension. Microscopically, the main part of the nodule showed typical histologic features of nonmucinous AIS. Single layer of cuboidal cells grew along the thick-ened alveolar walls in a lepidic pattern. There was no stromal or vascular invasion. Within the AIS area, there was a 0.2\u00d70.1 cm sized lesion, which exhibited papillary structures with typical nuclear features of PTC. The papillary carcinoma was composed of enlarged cells with clear nuclei and occasional intranuclear inclusions (). In addition, multiple microscopic foci of metastatic PTC were also observed in the surrounding normal lung tissue. Immunohistochemical staining for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and thyroglobulin was performed on both thyroid and lung tumor. Immunohistochemically, PTC of the thyroid gland was positive for both thyroglobulin and TTF-1",

A first kidney transplantation had been performed in 1993 (HLA of the first donor ) and the kidney had functioned for 10 years. Graft failure was caused by chronic vascular rejection. The nonfunctioning kidney was removed shortly after its failure and the patient was treated again with hemodialysis. Blood group of the recipient was 0+, HLA type is shown in , and the most recent PRA level was 34%. The past medical history included hypertension, coronary heart disease, deep venous thrombosis, prolonged reversible ischemic neurologic deficit, and a central venous thrombosis of the right eye. Currently the patient was under anticoagulation with phenprocoumon. Pretransplant evaluation included negative studies for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, HIV antibody, hepatitis C antibody, CMV IgG, and CMV IgM. Induction and immunosuppression were started before surgery with basiliximab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate-mofetil, and prednisone. The patient received a living unrelated kidney graft from his wife. Pretransplant T lymphocyte crossmatch was negative, whereas the B-cell crossmatch was positive.\nA 53-year-old nonrelative female, blood type 0+, HLA shown in . There was no medical history or regular medication. Both kidneys had a normal anatomy with each a single artery and vein (). The creatinine clearance calculated by Cockroft and Gault was 80 mL/h.

At the time of admission, the patient was in a stable haemodynamic condition, but suffered from progressive dyspnoea on exertion (New York Heart Association Class III).\nLung auscultation on admission revealed diminished breath sounds and dull percussion sounds of the basal right lung. The rest of the physical examination, especially cardiac auscultation was inconspicuous with a regular rate and rhythm, normal heart sounds, and no murmurs. Initial vital parameters and laboratory testing were also normal. Bedside echocardiography demonstrated a large pericardial effusion up to 35 mm with \u2018swinging heart\u2019 phenomenon (Figure ). Left and right ventricular systolic function as well as valvular function was normal. End-diastolic collapse of the right atrium and increased respiratory variation of mitral and tricuspid valve flow velocities have been noticed as indicators of a beginning haemodynamic relevance of the pericardial effusion, but diastolic right ventricle relaxation and vital parameters were not compromised. Because of the chronic setting of the large symptomatic pericardial effusion, pericardiocentesis was performed demonstrating a serous pericardial effusion with low cell count and no evidence of purulence or malignity. Besides the known pericardial effusion, computed tomography (CT) revealed an unclear mass in the pericardial space (Figure ). The mass was attached to the anterior wall of the left ventricle, measuring 20 \u00d7 22 \u00d7 8 mm, and demonstrated pronounced peripheral uptake of contrast media.

Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head demonstrated a trajectory entering the right inferior temporal bone, entering the anterior portion of the middle cranial fossa, traversing the anterior right temporal lobe, entering the right orbital cavity, and exiting through the ethmoid sinus and ultimately the left orbital cavity. There was a right temporal tip contusion along the ballistics path, with associated extra-axial and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The Sylvian fissures were not involved in the ballistic trajectory [].\nThe patient was taken emergently to the operating room for a right-sided decompressive craniectomy and debridement of the right temporal region. The patient started to follow commands, was moving in all extremities, and was extubated by hospital day 3. He underwent repair of his ruptured left globe and persisted with complete vision loss in the right eye.\nInitial CT angiogram (CTA) within 24 h of his admission showed no vascular injury; however, a repeat CTA was performed 5 days later for vascular surveillance for TICA, which showed interval development of a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation aneurysm. The same scanner produced both CTAs with 420 slices at 0.6 mm thickness, including three dimensional reconstructions. A subsequent diagnostic cerebral angiogram (DCA) confirmed the presence of a 4 \u00d7 3 mm right MCA bifurcation aneurysm, and also identified a 2 mm right internal carotid artery (ICA) terminus aneurysm, as well as severe vasospasm of the proximal ICA and MCA vessels [].\nThe patient was taken to surgery for clipping of the right MCA and right ICA terminus TICAs.

She was taking TPM 50 mg HS for at least 16 months, to control her weight gain due to binge eating problem. She explained that the eyelid twitching started from lower right eyelid which was not so much disturbing at first but was aggravating with stress and fatigue and diminishing by rest, but in the previous month, there was no response to rest. She had searched through the Internet and found out that this was a benign, periodic, and self-limiting condition, but less response to resting made her get worried more and more in the last month.\nPhysical examination was normal except previously diagnosed mild hypertension, controlled with 25 mg/day losartan over a period of 2 years. MRI and laboratory tests revealed no abnormal findings. An ophthalmological consultation was carried out but reported no significant visual disturbance. The patient was reassured and asked to continue her medications and also advised to decrease work time and to rest more.\nOne month later, she came back with worsening of her eyelid twitching which was expanded to her upper eyelid and occasionally the same side eyebrow. Her self-esteem and social communication were severely affected because she believed that twitching can be observed by others. Physical examination was again normal and no new sign was detected. She was advised not to use TPM anymore, with possible diagnosis of TPM-induced myokymia.\nInitially because of its favorable effects on weight loss, she resisted discontinuing TPM, but actually worsening of symptoms made her respect the physician's decision. The patient's symptoms decreased gradually and disappeared completely two weeks after TPM discontinuation. TPM discontinuation resulted in increasing appetite and body weight over two months; consequently she became depressed and started using TPM again. Eyelid myokymia reappeared two weeks later.",

Her best corrected VA was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/400 for the left eye. Biomicroscopic examination of both eyes and fundus examination of right eye were completely normal. Fundoscopy of the left eye revealed a 2.0 \u00d7 1.5 mm sized, elevated and round circumscribed, orange tumoral mass which was located in the inferotemporal juxtapapillary region. The tumor was covering more than half of the optic nerve head and protruding mainly to the vitreous and a thick ERM obscuring the foveal zone was also noted []. No additional pathology was observed within the peripheral retina.\nFundus fluorescein angiography of the lesion showed signs of early filling with late leakage implying the presence of a vascularized lesion. Optical coherence tomography showed an elevated hyperreflective mass shadowing the inner structures. The ERM extended to the fovea causing diffuse retinal thickening and subretinal elevation adjacent to the optic disc []. Systemic workup of the patient and the ophthalmological screening did not reveal any relevant finding of VHL or any other disease. A diagnosis of isolated JRCH was made.\nA combined approach was adopted for treatment. In the initial step of treatment, 532 nm argon laser photocoagulation (ALP) was performed with a long exposure time (0.5\u20131 second) for a deeper penetration. Sufficient energy (150\u2013300 mjoules) to obtain the paleness of the lesion was applied using small spot sizes (50\u2013200 microns). Three consecutive sessions of ALP were applied 5 days apart. An injection of intravitreal bevacizumab was given within 5 days following the last laser session. Apparent regression of the tumor was observed within a few days [Fig. \u2013].

He was recently discharged from medical ICU after being managed for episodes of vomiting and decreased food intake associated with confusion, lethargy, disorientation to time and place. Also he developed two episodes of generalized tonic clonic seizures. His serum Na+ was found to be very low (102 mEq/ml). He was also put on tab levetiracetam 1000 mg for seizure prophylaxis. At the time of discharge after 6 days of hospitalization his serum Na+ was 131 mEq/ml. His hyponatremia had been corrected rapidly (by 13 mEq/ml in initial 8 h). He had undergone neurosurgery for non-functional pituitary macroadenoma 10 years back. He was not taking any hormone supplements. It was hypothesized that he might have been having chronic hyponatremia due to hypopituitarism. Patient developed rigidity and associated symptoms after 6 days of sodium correction. He also underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain which did not reveal any abnormality except for chronic ischemic changes in the bilateral centrum semiovale.\nDetailed assessment did not reveal psychiatric symptoms or any previous psychiatric illness nor was there any history of substance abuse. There was no family history of any psychiatric illness as well. From the history and review of medical records, a provisional diagnosis of CPEM was made.

The headaches that appeared after the trauma were neglected by the patient. On the other hand, the family was alerted by the installation of intermittent confusion and weakness of the limbs.\nOn physical examination, the Glasgow coma score was 13 points of 15, and the patient had analgesic attitude of the head with neck pain to the gentle mobilization. The neurological examination showed spastic tetraparesis more pronounced in the lower limbs without achieving sensitivity or reflexes. The examination of the perineum was without abnormalities.\nBlood tests were also without anomalies.\nA radiograph of the cervical spine showed an abnormal gap between the vertebral spinous of the atlas and axis associated with a significant anterolisthesis [].\nA computed tomography scan eliminated a brain damage and showed a fracture at the junction of the body and the odontoid process corresponding to the type 2 of Anderson and D\u2019Alonzo classification.[] This fracture was associated with anterior atlantoaxial dislocation of more than 5 mm corresponding to the type III of Fielding classification[] [].\nA progressive reduction of the dislocation with a cranial traction was initiated.

The genetic sonogram showed a fetus without signs of malformation, except for increased gallbladder volume (appropriate for gestational age) and polyhydramnios. Genetic analysis of the amniotic fluid extracted by amniocentesis showed the resulting karyotype was 46 XX.\nThe patient's symptoms exacerbated rapidly: her fever increased to 40\u00b0C and she presented general malaise, facial paresis, cardiac arrhythmia, respiratory distress, joint pain, and stiff neck. Laboratory tests showed slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and mild leukocytosis as well as lymphocytic pleocytosis with increased IgG and specific oligoclonal bands. Lumbar puncture was performed as the woman had retronucal pain and stiffness. Lymphocytic pleocytosis was detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a high concentration of protein and glucose and specific oligoclonal bands. These results and the geographical origin of the patient suggested severe sepsis. Cell cultures such as BSK-Hrevealed infection by Borrelia spp., confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\nThe patient was diagnosed with Lyme disease, stages 2 and 3.
