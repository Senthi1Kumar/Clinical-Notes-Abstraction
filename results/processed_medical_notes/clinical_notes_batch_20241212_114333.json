The pain was associated with subjective fever, nausea, and nonbloody emesis and was exacerbated by oral intake. The patient denied additional gastrointestinal or genitourinary disturbances, sick contacts, travel, or consumption of unusual food.\nTwo months prior to presentation, she had an episode of pancreatitis complicated by pseudocyst formation along the greater curvature of the stomach, measuring 13 \u00d7 9.5 \u00d7 5.5 cm. She underwent ultrasound-guided drainage of approximately 100 mL of cloudy fluid with subsequent placement of a 12-French pigtail catheter. External bag drainage was continued for 2 weeks and removed once the drainage was minimal.\nOne day after catheter removal, the patient developed progressive abdominal discomfort, which prompted repeat evaluation. Laboratory studies were only significant for an alkaline urine pH of 8.0.

His clinical picture was further complicated by constant, debilitating headaches, generalized fatigue, and significant cognitive delay. Surveillance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the progressive dilation of serpiginous venous varices within the cervical spine (Figure ).\nMost of these findings were felt to be attributable to a known, partially treated torcular dAVF. This boy had undergone multiple prior embolizations, the last of which was complicated by a total loss of vision in the right eye. A cerebral angiogram revealed a persistent, torcular dAVF with multiple feeders from the bilateral external carotid arteries as well as the meningeal branches of the left internal carotid artery (Figure , Figure )\nThere was also noted to be complete occlusion of the transverse and sigmoid sinuses, as well as the internal jugular veins, bilaterally, and the superior sagittal sinus filled in a retrograde fashion before refluxing into numerous cortical veins (Figure ).\nOperation\nAfter registering the head with neuronavigational technology, we planned a small craniotomy over the posterior third of the superior sagittal sinus. We then directly punctured the sinus with a 5French (5F) needle and upon seeing the flow of bright red blood, advanced a wire under fluoroscopic guidance that appeared to follow the convexity of the skull along the course of the sinus before entering the massively dilated torcula. The needle was then withdrawn, and a 5F dilator was inserted over the wire and stitched in place to the adjacent dura. Contrast was manually injected, and we obtained confirmation that the tip of the dilator was located in the venous sac.

He had a history of arterial hypertension, left internal carotid artery stenosis treated with endarterectomy 3 years ago, and CABG 1 year prior to the current consultation (LIMA to the LAD and RIMA to a marginal artery). The patient was asymptomatic. He was taking ASA, atorvastatin, omeprazole, and bisoprolol. Physical examination during follow-up medical consultation revealed the absence of pulses in the left arm and normal pulses in the other limbs. A systolic blood pressure difference was found in the upper extremities (right arm: 170 mmHg, left arm: 132 mmHg; index: 0.78). A Doppler ultrasound was performed to assess the aortic arch branches detecting a retrograde flow in the left vertebral artery. Chest CT angiogram documented an 80% left SA stenosis (). Renal function was normal (creatinine level was 0.78 mg/dL). Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm without signs of acute ischaemia. Considering the high probability of developing future symptomatic myocardial ischaemia, we decided to perform an endovascular treatment. In this patient, a left brachial and right femoral artery approach was chosen. Retrograde subclavian injection confirmed a severe left SA stenosis (). Pre dilatation with a Mustang balloon (6 \u00d7 40 mm) was performed, and a balloon-expandable stent (Visipro 8 \u00d7 37 mm) was implanted in the SA at the site of the stenosis. Post-procedure angiographic result was optimal () with no complications The blood pressure index between the upper limbs after the procedure was 0.98. The patient was discharged 24 h after the procedure on treatment with ASA and clopidogrel. Clopidogrel was withdrawn 6 weeks later.

Physical examination showed tenderness in the proximal right tibia. Radiography and computed tomography (CT) revealed eccentric, well-defined osteolytic destruction in the proximal metaphysis of the right tibia, suggesting the imaging diagnosis of GCTB (Campanacci grade II) (\u2013). Chest CT scan () and single-photon emission CT () did not reveal any metastatic lesions.An open biopsy from a lateral incision was performed thereafter, and pathological results showed multinucleated osteoclast giant cells with a large number of nuclei scattered among mononuclear tumor cells, which confirmed the diagnosis of a benign GCTB (). Subsequently, the patient underwent intralesional curettage following the biopsy tract. Utilizing high-speed drilling and ethyl alcohol, 1 cm of spongy bone and 1 mm of cortical bone were removed. The remaining cavity was then packed with cement ( and ). After the procedures, immobilization was recommended to prevent pathological fracture. However, nine months later, a palpable mass was detected in the right popliteal fossa. Radiography, CT, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed local cortical bone destruction with soft tissue extension (\u2013) which indicated Campanacci grade III. Chest CT showed no evidence of metastases. Because of the extensive recurrence and stage III rating, the patient underwent wide resection of the lesion with prosthetic reconstruction. Postoperative pathologic features and presence of multinucleated giant cells were detected by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with a monoclonal antibody against CD68 (PG-M1) and were similar to that of the pre-surgical specimens, revealing the recurrence of GCTB without malignant transformation ( and ).

She is a diagnosed patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years and hypertension for 5 years. Her diabetes was well controlled with HbA1c of 6 and without significant micro or macrovascular complications. She is a nonalcoholic. Following admission she complained of retrosternal tightening type of a chest pain suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. Pain was sudden onset, lasted for 20 min in moderate intensity and responded to the medications given in hospital. Physical examination revealed severe epigastric tenderness. There was no rebound tenderness. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were normal. She was haemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 130/90 mmHg and pulse rate of 96 bpm. 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed T wave inversions in lateral leads including I, aVL, V5 and V6 (Fig. ). Her serum troponin I titer was 14 ng/mL (normal less than 0.8 ng/mL). 2D echo revealed lateral wall hypokinesia with preserved left ventricular function. Her serum amylase level on admission was 1741 U/L (20\u2013115 U/L). Contrast computerized tomography (CT) abdomen revealed acute severe necrotizing pancreatitis without pseudocyst formation (Fig. ). Serum calcium, creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) and triglyceride levels were normal. Therefore she belongs to the moderately severe acute pancreatitis according to revised Atalanta criteria (2013). She was free of chest pain and haemodynamically stable following starting treatment with aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin and nitroglycerin. Therefore she was given unfractionated heparin for 72 h and a coronary angiogram planned to be done later. Her serial ECGs showed minor dynamic T wave changes. She was given intensive care and improved during next few days with standard management protocol of acute pancreatitis. Three days later her repeat serum troponin level remained at 9.2 ng/mL and amylase level was 504 U/L. A coronary angiogram was done",

He was diagnosed five months ago with a case of ENKTCL, nasal type, stage IV-B with testicular and central nervous system involvement with 23% natural killer (NK) cells on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow cytometry. He was on an active therapeutic plan consisting of cycles of chemotherapy (i.e., SMILE protocol: dexamethasone, methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase, etoposide), to which there was a complete response in the form of negative flow cytometry and computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Five months after the initial diagnosis, prior to the fourth cycle of treatment, a complaint of blurriness of right eye vision was made. Brain CT was done aiming to rule out ocular involvement, which turned out to be unremarkable. At the time of the complaint, visual acuity was 20/30 -2 in the right eye as opposed to 20/20 in the left eye. The right eye showed relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular muscle movements were competent in both eyes. On examination of the anterior chamber, +1 cells were visualized in the right eye only. On dilated fundus examination, there was vitritis in the right eye which obscured the vision. Left eye examination was insignificant. B scan ocular ultrasonography revealed retinal detachment in the right eye. An optic CT revealed vitritis in the right eye; an impression of disease infiltration of the eye was made.

An X-ray revealed a large mass in the left hemithorax adjacent to the heart silhouette. A chest CT demonstrated the presence of a mass with smooth edges, in middle mediastinum next to the heart and partially intrapericardial (Fig. ). The mass was of heterogeneous density and of 11 cm size. Presence of atelectasis at the left lower lobe abating the mass was clearly seen. Based on clinical and radiologic evidence, we did proceed with CT guided FNA of the mass. The cytology findings revealed inflammatory lesion. Laboratory tests were normal. Based on patient symptoms, history and the presence of a mass potentially compressing the cardiopulmonary structures in vicinity, we decided to offer exploratory surgery for diagnosis and treatment.\nStandard hemodynamic monitoring and general anesthesia were followed by positioning, prepping and draping patient in left lateral decubitus position. An anterolateral left thoracotomy was carried out and entrance in the hemithorax was made without any challenge. The mass was assessed and found to be leaning medially on the surface of the lateral wall of the left ventricle, including the pericardial layer and had smooth edges which didn\u2019t infiltrate the lung (Fig. ). We started dissecting the mass from its smooth capsule, making it through all its layers. An old and degraded piece of surgical swap was visualized (Fig. ). The surgical swap was removed along with the capsular layer of this mass. Patient tolerated the procedure very well and blood loss was minimal.

Nine months before presentation she suffered a major ankle sprain, at which point X-ray imaging revealed no evidence of any fractures; consequently, the leg was immobilized in a cast for 14 days followed by a gradual return to daily routine activities. Nonetheless, the patient continued to experience persistent pain and reduced her participation in sports. The patient, otherwise, had no other significant previous medical or surgical history. At the time of presentation, the ankle was stable, but accompanied by pain at the tip of the right lateral malleolus. An MRI was then performed (Fig. ) and revealed a single alteration at the apex of the fibula, as well as the delayed union of a 1 cm fragment at the tip of the lateral malleolus. In an effort to promote union non-invasively, conservative treatment was repeated, postulating that the initial return to daily activities was premature. The leg was immobilized in a cast for 35 days, followed by physiotherapy.\nAn x-ray of the ankle (Fig. ) performed 30 days after cast removal, and during the physiotherapy program, revealed the persistence of the non-healed fracture and the non-united fragment at the tip of the fibula.

In one analysis, patients \u2265 80 years old who had VT or VF had better survival to discharge than younger patients who had suffered a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.[\nICDs are highly effective in preventing arrhythmic SCD and are widely used, particularly in the HF population. Eligible patients are described in major society guidelines, and the indications regarding implanted device therapies including ICDs, pacemakers and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) are similar in older as they are for younger adults.[ This is despite the fact that patients > 80 years of age have been poorly represented in most of the trials the recommendations are based on. Nonetheless, these devices are commonly placed even in that age group.

The patient\u2019s previous medical/dental history was unremarkable. No history of parafunction was present, and the patient had not experienced any TMJ pain prior to the presently reported experience. An examination revealed no deviation in the opening path and no noise in the TMJ.\nThe maximum unassisted opening distance was 40 mm. The patient reported pain upon palpation of the right TMJ (lateral pole, inside ear), but had no extraoral or intraoral muscle tenderness. Twenty-eight teeth were present, and the occlusion was anatomically normal. TMJ tomography showed no evidence of degeneration (Fig. ), and a diagnosis of temporomandibular arthralgia was made based on the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD) []. Since an anterior flat plane bite plate has been recommended as a provisional appliance to decrease painful symptoms [], an anterior flat plane bite plate covering the upper six anterior teeth and the first premolar teeth on both sides was fabricated for short term use using self-curing acrylic resin (GC, Tokyo, Japan). The occlusal surface of the plate was made flat and perpendicular to the mandibular incisors to allow free movement in all directions (Fig. ). Medication was not prescribed.\nThe patient was instructed to wear the plate during the day, except when eating or speaking.

He was initially diagnosed with pericardial effusion, approximately 4 months before the current presentation, and pericardial drainage (2.5 L) was subsequently carried out. Following drainage and a month of ibuprofen, no pericardial effusion was observed on echocardiography. He stated that he had no history of fever or hemoptysis or any other extrapulmonary symptoms or diseases. He was hypertensive and had a history of coronary artery stent. General physical examination was unremarkable. Examination of the respiratory system revealed diminished breath sounds in the right hemithorax, and initial laboratory evaluations were all normal except D-dimer, which was 3640 ng/ml.

The chief complaint was a limitation of severe mouth opening []. The patient claimed that he had been operated before from both sides. Radiographic assessment was carried out using CT scan and panoramic radiography. CT scan and panoramic radiograph revealed the massive heterotopic bone development and bony ankylosis surrounding the right TMJ. Panoramic radiograph also demonstrated the area of previous surgery on the left side [Figures and ]. A preoperative model which was maintained from the CBCT of the patient was also used to observe properly the extension of the ankylotic mass [].\nOn clinical examination, 11 mm mouth opening with facial asymmetry and bird face-like appearance was observed. On the left side, a scar at preauricular region was seen, but on the right side, there was no sign of a previous operation. Clinical findings demonstrated slight mandibular retrognathia and deviation of the mandible to the affected (right) side.\nGeneral anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation and total muscle relaxation was administered. A single intravenous dose of steroid was given at the beginning of the case. The TMJ is approached through a modified preauricular incision with temporal extension to expose the temporalis fascia and muscle, zygomatic arch, ankylotic mass, and sigmoid notch. The ankylosed TMJ was palpable, and an incision was made directly onto the bone, exposing the ankylosed TMJ.

As part of the routine postoperative follow-up management, the recipient underwent DUS to assess the patency of the graft on postoperative day 1. The DUS finding was suspicious for an acute arterial thrombosis but did not reveal any focal irregularities. Consequently, a computed tomography (CT) scan was urgently obtained but it did not show any arterial complications. However, it serendipitously revealed a 2.4-cm lesion on the upper pole of the renal allograft which was not detected during the back-table or ultrasonography monitoring. A biopsy of the lesion was performed, and its histology revealed an epithelial proliferation of large cells with finely granular cytoplasm and medium round nucleus vesicular acidophilus, arranged tubules, and alveoli and cords immersed in a connective tissue stroma. This picture was consistent with oncocytoma. However, because the eosinophilic variant of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (RCC) may morphologically resemble renal oncocytoma, immunohistochemical staining was performed using Ki-67 antibodies and RCC antigens. The results were negative, ruling out chromophobe RCC. The therapeutic options and potential related outcomes were clearly discussed with the patient. Given the low risk of malignant transformation in an oncocytoma [], we found no reason for resection of the lesion or an allograft nephrectomy. Consequently, we opted for active surveillance of the benign tumor with ultrasonography, every 2 months, for the first year and, then, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), every year (Fig. ).

The brachial artery bifurcated into the radial artery medially and the ulnar artery laterally at 21 cm cranial of the cubital fossa (), whereas normally it divides at the cubital fossa itself with a different disposition. After descending 5.5 cm below the lower border of the teres major muscle, and at 21 cm above the cubital fossa, the brachial artery terminated anomalously, giving rise to the radial artery medially and the ulnar artery laterally. The radial artery remained medial to the median nerve in the arm (). At the elbow, the radial artery continued along the medial aspect and then crossed to the lateral side at the level of the upper third of the forearm, superficial to the flexor muscles (). The radial artery was found to be tortuous from the beginning to around the medial epicondyle. Thereafter it ran straight along its oblique course, before once again becoming highly tortuous. The total length of the radial artery was 55 cm. The ulnar artery remained on the lateral side of the arm, then entered the forearm by passing between two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle and remained on the medial aspect of the forearm. These anomalies were associated with abnormal formation and course of the median nerve.

Review of images from a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed seven months earlier for abdominal pain at an outside institution also showed the gastric diverticulum (Figure ). However, this finding was not mentioned in the outside report for that CT scan. The patient had a yearlong history of intermittent abdominal pain and nausea without emesis. She denied any changes to her bowel habits during this time. Her father had a history of diabetes. Physical exam revealed a healthy, alert adolescent female in no acute distress. On palpation, her abdomen was soft, non-tender, and non-distended. A very small fascial defect was noted at the umbilicus, but no other masses or organomegaly were evident. She had normoactive bowel sounds on auscultation. A fluoroscopic upper gastrointestinal (UGI) exam showed a wide-mouth diverticulum arising from the posteromedial aspect of the gastric fundus (Figure ). No extension of the diverticulum into the thoracic cavity was noted.\nThe patient began omeprazole for her intermittent abdominal pain prior to the procedure and was instructed to continue the medication after surgery. In the operating room, a 2 cm infraumbilical incision was made, and electrocautery was used to progress through the subcutaneous tissue. The stalk of the umbilical hernia was isolated, opened, and a 5 mm port was inserted in the fascial defect. Carbon dioxide was infused into the abdominal cavity to a pressure of 15 mmHg.

    "original_text": "A 22-year-old man who was involved in a car accident sustained a hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident. His hospital stay extended for several months and was remarkable for prolonged intubation (2.5 months),tracheostomy tube placement, jejunostomy tube placement, and recurrent chest infections. During his hospital stay, the patient did not receive any lower limb physical therapy. Upon discharge, he had right-sided spastic hemiparesis with aphasia and was started on private physiotherapy and rehabilitation. He presented to our outpatient clinic after 1.5 years of physiotherapy with significant resistance and progressive limitation in the range of movement around the right hip joint. At this stage, the patient was bed ridden with the inability to ambulate independently. On physical examination, the patient was continent, the right hip joint was absolutely stiff with flexion deformity and fixed external rotation, and power was 4/5 all over the right lower extremity with intact sensation. His left hip joint had a completely normal range of motion and the rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nRadiographs of the right hip joint revealed evident ossification(). On 3D-CT, HO surrounding the right hip joint was seen associated with atrophied muscles and partial fusion of the proximal femur and dorsal acetabulum/ischium, causing fixed external rotation of the right femur (). SAP level at presentation was within normal limit.

She had ovulatory cycles; tubal factor was not investigated because of no apparent risk factor. She had undergone four failed intrauterine inseminations with husband semen.\nAssessment revealed that uterus was retroverted, and day 3 FSH value is affirmed to be 9.9 I.U/L. Semen volume was 2.2 mLs, highly viscous with sperm concentration of 5 million/mL, total sperm number per ejaculate being 11 million, progressive motile sperm of 28%, and normal sperm forms of 11%. Based on duration of infertility with severe male factor couple was counseled for IVF-ICSI (in vitro fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycle). She had a long protocol agonist cycle using daily buserelin injection and highly purified FSH/LH (Menopur). Four grade 1 embryos (three 6-cell and one 4-cell) were transferred into the uterus on day 2 of embryo life using Wallace soft embryo transfer catheter. Introducer was used and embryo transfer time was approximately 4 minutes.\nUrine pregnancy test was positive on day 20 of embryo life. TVS done on day 33 of embryo life revealed uterus devoid of gestational sac with thickness of 20 mm endometrial lining () with double gestational sacs with viable fetal poles () in right adnexum and normal right ovary. Couple was counseled on possible modes of treatment. The woman initially refused any modality that would threaten continuity of pregnancy though ectopic in location despite possible risk to her life.
