The patient was then referred for a thyroid ultrasound which showed a 2.1 cm, left-sided thyroid nodule. The patient underwent an ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy which revealed a papillary thyroid carcinoma. The patient was referred to ENT and subsequently had a total thyroidectomy. She was referred to our endocrine clinic for postsurgical management of her T1b N1a MX stage 3 papillary thyroid carcinoma 4 weeks after total thyroidectomy. The tumor size was 1.7 cm in maximum diameter and was unifocal. At the time of surgery, the surgical margins were positive and focal lymphovascular invasion was observed with 1 out of 6 dissected lymph nodes positive for metastatic disease. The patient was prepared for radioactive iodine remnant ablation with a low iodine diet and thyrotropin alfa injections. An initial diagnostic SPECT/CT (Philips Precedence 16P) scan was performed 24 hours after administration of 5.3 mCi of Iodine-123 (I-123). The scan showed uptake in the left posterior thyroid bed and anteriorly at the level of the hyoid bone, both likely representing residual thyroid tissue. Physiologic uptake was also noted in the salivary glands, nasopharyngeal mucosa, and gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, a large (8 cm \u00d7 9 cm \u00d7 8 cm) heterogeneous left anterior mediastinal mass with mixed solid and cystic architecture was noted.

Fetal growth was within the normal process and the alpha fetal protein was 23.91 U/ml (the normal reference value:0\u201325 U/ml).\nAt 30 gestational weeks, the B-mode ultrasound revealed that the liver of the fetus was enlarged with a heterogeneous solid mass located in the right quadrant of the fetal abdominal cavity, with a close relationship to the liver. The mass measured 5.8cmx4.7cmx5.2 cm and pushed the portal vein and gall bladder. The lesion seemed to have an ill-defined margin, irregular shape, partial capsule with multiple cystic cavities inside, and maximal diameter of 2.1 cm. The portal and hepatic veins were not dilated. In the color Doppler ultrasound, the mass appeared to be highly vascularized (Fig. ) and RI was 0.67. The three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound showed the feeding vessels were mainly around the lesion but there were less vessels inside it (Fig. ). Due to the rapid enlargement of this mass and the imaging features of ultrasound, the diagnosis of HBL was highly considered.

Family history and medical history was non-contributory. Patient was unmarried, well qualified medical student and there was no history of similar condition in the family. Her parents and siblings were fine and no other family member presented with similar dental findings. Her past dental history disclosed that she underwent root canal treatment of 36 due to caries involvement. Extra-oral examination disclosed normal mouth opening and no temporomandibular joint problems. The patient was healthy with no co-morbidities.\nOn intraoral examination, the enamel thickness was highly thinned down and partially flaked off from few surfaces of teeth. Teeth revealed well defined pitted surfaces along with yellowish brown discoloration. Surfaces of teeth were rough with minimal enamel present.

    "original_text": "A 50-year-old woman was referred by her dentist for the evaluation of mandibular swelling. The patient had osteoporosis treated with risedronate. Physical examination revealed swelling of the mandibular symphysis with chin deformation. The tumor did not seem to adhere to the skin but extended from the mandibular left first premolar to the mandibular right canine. The anterior buccal floor was deformed, and the inferior alveolar nerve was preserved. An excisional biopsy of the buccal mass was performed, confirming an initial diagnosis of chondrosarcoma. The histological plates were reinterpreted, leading to a final diagnosis of chondroblastic osteosarcoma. Cartilaginous tissue with chondroid matrix was observed in which chondrocytes with cytonuclear abnormalities were found (Figure ). Immunohistochemistry was not contributory, because it did not detect any IDH1 and IDH2 variants. Craniofacial computed tomography scan (Figure ) revealed a 32-mm-long axis lesion in the symphyseal region responsible for an osteolysis on both sides of the mandible. This scan did not reveal any suspicious lesions elsewhere.

An ultrasound performed at her initial presentation noted a large left upper abdominal mass. She was referred for a whole body positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan that demonstrated a large 24 \u00d7 12 cm left upper abdominal tumor coming off the tail of the pancreas and abutting the greater curvature of the stomach. The patient also had hypermetabolic metastases within the liver.\nThe patient underwent an image-guided biopsy of the large lesion. Pathology demonstrated a bland spindle cell neoplasm consistent with GIST. Immunohistochemistry was positive for CD117 and CD34. One-two mitoses were identified on the entire core tissue, and Ki-67 showed 1-2% proliferative index. The patient was started on imatinib (Gleevec) and demonstrated a metabolic response to therapy with a slight decrease in the size of the tumor.\nFour months after the initiation of imatinib therapy, a follow-up CT demonstrated the prior GIST, which had decreased in size to 13.2 \u00d7 8.9 \u00d7 12.9 cm ().

The physical examination, laboratory and histological findings, including serum thyroxine, TSH level and needle biopsy of the thyroid, were compatible with hyperthyroidism and congestive heart failure. He was initially treated with propylthiouracil (300 mg daily), and the heart failure symptoms improved with appropriate care. On admission, serum HBsAg was tested as a part of routine clinical tests and was found to be positive. The patient denied any history of hepatitis exposure or any family history of hepatitis B or exposure to blood products. Serum aminotransferase activities were within normal limits. HBeAg and HBV\u2013DNA were not detected in the serum. The patient was discharged on the 21st hospital day with markedly improved general condition. Two months later, propylthiouracil was substituted with methimazole (30 mg daily) for better compliance. Seven months later, the patient was readmitted to the hospital because of nausea, general malaise and jaundice of two weeks\u2019 duration and transferred to the Hepatology Section. He denied any use of illicit drugs, herb medication or alcohol during the period. On examination the patient appeared acutely ill and icteric, although he was clinically euthyroid. No Spider angiomata, skin rash or palmar erythema was noted. The pulse was irregular with a rate of about 80 due to atrial fibrillation. The edge of the liver was palpable 5 cm below the right costal margin with a vertical span of 13 cm. The liver was diffusely tender.\nNo evidence of ascites was found.

She had four uneventful vaginal deliveries. Her first visit to a gynecologist was in 2012 for itching, burning of the vulvovaginal area, and repeated urinary tract infections. Local examination of the genitalia showed a fissure at the fourchette, decreased vaginal rugae, and increased friability with petechiae. The vaginal pH was 7, and the pap test reported an atrophic smear. Transvaginal ultrasound was consistent with postmenopausal status. She was started on daily conjugated equine estrogen 0.625 mg cream for 15 days, followed by twice weekly for 6 months. The fissure was not healing at day 15, and biopsy from the fissure site showed nonspecific inflammation. She was to continue local estrogen therapy. Two years later, she returned with complete fusion of labia minora from clitoris to the posterior fourchette with a tiny opening at the anterior one-third of the introitus through which she was voiding and had stopped estrogen therapy. This time, the labia were manually separated under local lignocaine cream. She was lost for follow-up and returned 3 years later with dribbling of urine. She was not on any medication. A routine urogynecological evaluation was performed with history and detailed examination. Local examination of the genitalia had signs of atrophy with a CLF of the genitalia []. Introitus was not identified due to labial fusion. The cough test was negative, and postvoid residual volume was 40 ml on abdominal ultrasound.\nUnder short general anesthesia, patient is positioned in lithotomy.

About 5 minutes later, the patient complained of severe colicky abdominal pain, which recurred every 5 minutes and was accompanied by diaphoresis.\nOn physical examination, blood pressure was 110/80 mmHg, heart rate was 80/min and the patient had no fever.

Also, the abdomen was tympanic on percussion, but there was no tenderness or guarding.\nPlain abdominal radiography showed multiple colonic air-fluid levels and distention of the colon, especially in the right side ().\nSince there was no subdiaphragmatic free air and no free air between intestinal loops, the probability of perforation was ruled out. Immediately, the patient underwent second colonoscopy, but the scope could hardly pass through sigmoid colon because of spasm and edema at the site of previous polyp biopsies. The scope was gently advanced toward cecum and simultaneously decompressed the entire colon by suctioning the entrapped air. After performing the second colonoscopy, the colicky abdominal pain was relieved and abdominal distention was significantly decreased. The patient remained in hospital for close observation.

    "original_text": "A previously healthy 25-year-old White man presented with a 1-year history of blurred vision in the right eye, headache, and weight loss of about 30 kg. On physical examination, he had a body mass index of 28 kg/m2 and visual field defects in the right eye. Initial MRI showed a lightly spotted heterogeneous 19 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 19 mm tumor located suprasellarly, close to the pituitary gland with no ingrowth or association with the pituitary gland (Fig. A). Endocrine evaluation revealed secondary hypogonadism with low follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone but intact thyrotroph and lactotroph axes. An ACTH test was performed with a subnormal cortisol response (30-minute cortisol 248 nmol/L, reference > 420 nmol/L) and low plasma ACTH concentration, indicating secondary adrenal insufficiency, and the patient started treatment with hydrocortisone. The somatotroph axis was not evaluated. Visual field measured by perimetry revealed visual field defects in the right eye.\nThe tumor was initially diagnosed based on MRI as a craniopharyngioma for which reason the patient was referred to craniotomy as standard treatment.

Since his childhood he suffered from easy fatigue and was informed that he had had a palpable enlarged spleen from birth. His younger brother had been previously diagnosed at private clinic 3 years ago with congenital spherocytosis due to splenomegaly, pancytopenia, and increased peripheral ovalocytes. Therefore, this 33-year-old patient was also evaluated and received splenectomy several months later under the impression of congenital spherocytosis (At that time, his RBC fragility test was negative, but peripheral ovalocytes was 26%). According to operative findings at the clinic, his liver was grossly nodular and enlarged, so a liver biopsy was done. Following the biopsy, he was diagnosed at the private clinic as having liver cirrhosis.\nSeven months before entering our hospital, diarrhea with fever and chills developed. At that time, he was diagnosed with amebic colitis and treated with antibiotics. Four months before admission to our hospital, right upper quadrant abdominal pain with fever developed, so he was checked and managed as a cholecystitis patient. However, the fever and abdominal pain continued to fluctuate in severity thereafter. Two days prior to his admission to our hospital, severe abdominal pain and fever were aggravated.\nOn admission to our hospital, the patient\u2019s temperature was 39.3\u00b0C, the pulse 92, and the respiration 24. The blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg. On examination, the patient was relatively well-nourished but appeared acutely ill. No rash, lymphadenopathy, or jaundice was evident. The liver was 3 finger-breadth\u2019s palpable on the epigastrium, which was hard and tender. The kidney was not palpable.

Fetal examination revealed a diamniotic MC twin pregnancy. The recipient twin was diagnosed as having polyhydramnios and the donor twin had oligohydramnios. The diagnosis of stage 3 TTTS was made on the basis of Quintero Staging system. A negative ductus venosus A-wave was observed in the recipient twin. The deepest vertical pocket was 140 mm for the recipient and 5 mm for the donor twin. The complications and prognosis of TTTS and risks of placental laser surgery were discussed with the family and the patient opted for placental laser surgery. The patient underwent placental laser surgery under local anaesthesia in operating room. On the day of the operation, 100 mg indomethacin was administered due to regular uterine contractions as rectal suppository once a day. Indomethacin administration was continued until postoperative day 2 and the contractions disappeared. On postoperative day 3, an ultrasound examination revealed pleural effusion, ascites, increased nuchal thickness, oligohydramnios, tricuspid regurgitation, and negative ductus venosus A-wave in the donor twin and normal Doppler findings in the recipient twin. A detailed examination of the ductus arteriosus showed ductal narrowing with a transverse diameter of 1.49 mm (<5th percentile) ()(. There was no turbulent flow or aliasing in the ductus arteriosus region and systolic and diastolic velocities were 69 and 6 cm/s, respectively. Although Doppler criteria of ductal constriction were not observed, hydrops was prominent. The indomethacin treatment was stopped.

Endoscopic evaluation of the larynx revealed a right vocal fold paralysis. Results from other physical examinations and past medication history were unremarkable. We studied the CT scan for another cause of vocal fold palsy. However, the patient's lungs were clear and no signs of a heart problem ().\nAfter careful examination of her vocal folds, a Radiesse injection was performed on the right vocal fold through cricothyroid membrane under local anesthesia. The procedure did not go as planned since the patient suddenly coughed and moved during the injection laryngoplasty, thereby causing an accidental injection around the vocal fold (). The inadvertently injected CaHA around vocal fold was seen CT scan of inferior larynx area ().\nThe total volume of injected Radiesse was 1.4 mL. After the procedure, the patient suffered from dyspnea. A chest embolism computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a high-density lesion at the pulmonary vasculature in the right upper lobe ().\nIt revealed the right lung and right vocal fold corresponding to the Radiesse injection done previously. The CaHA PE was suspected, and the patient was treated with warfarin for 12 months. During the follow up, the patient consistently had mild dyspnea.\nAfter 6 months on warfarin, the chest embolism CT revealed that the calcified embolus still existed. At 12 months, the patient's dyspnea symptoms had nearly disappeared and she was able to climb the stairs without stress.

Past medical history and social history were unremarkable, with no smoking or alcohol use. Her physical exam was unremarkable with vital signs, laboratory workup, and lung function test within normal limits. The follow-up diagnostic imaging included computerized tomography (CT) (Figure , ) and full-body positron emission tomography (PET) (Figure , ) that showed an incidental 2 cm hypermetabolic right adrenal mass without any other pathological lesions or concerning regional or distant lymphadenopathy.\nA review of a CT scan performed six months prior revealed no right adrenal mass or other suspicious findings. The patient was otherwise healthy with no signs or symptoms concerning a functional adrenal mass or advanced malignancy. She denied abdominal or right flank pain. Biochemical studies for hormonal overproduction, including aldosterone/renin ratio, late-night salivary cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone, and plasma catecholamines with urine metanephrines) were within the physiological ranges. Given the patient\u2019s history, the hypermetabolic activity of the mass, and the likelihood of rapid growth of the mass to 2.5 cm within six months, metastatic disease was high on the differential. Other options considered due to the fast growth rate included adrenocortical carcinoma and less likely adrenal adenoma. Because this was an isolated, quickly growing adrenal mass with no lymphadenopathy, a decision was made to proceed with the right adrenalectomy as the treatment of choice for a definitive resection and histological diagnosis.

She had one previous cesarean section delivery. Her preoperative hemoglobin was 10.8 g/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 10.5 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 29 seconds, international normalized ratio 2.3, and platelet count 385x109/L. Transabdominal sonography and magnetic resonance imaging displayed total placenta previa, with myometrial invasion to the urinary bladder at the anterior wall of uterus (, ). The patient stated preoperatively that she preferred a conservative approach rather than hysterectomy in case of massive bleeding. After cesarean delivery of a transverse baby through a Pfannenstiel incision and removal of the placenta, a 5-6 cm area of tissue loss was detected at the anterior wall of the uterus and bleeding occurred from the cervix and posterior wall of the bladder. Pelvic packing was applied on the pelvic vessels for 20 minutes, the bleeding sites were sutured with 1.0 polyglactine sutures, and Sengstaken-Blakemore balloon catheter was placed in the uterus before suturing. A stomach balloon was filled with 250 mL saline and an esophageal balloon was filled with 400 mL saline to provide compression on the lower uterine isthmic and cervical bleeds, nevertheless, bleeding continued. Bilateral uterine and hypogastric artery ligations were planned due to hemorrhage. The left external iliac artery was accidentally held and bonded as the left hypogastric artery, which was released within a minute after distinguishing the vessels. Following this mistake, the uterine and hypogastric arteries were ligated on both sides.

In addition, the patient had a history of type II diabetes mellitus for 14 years and hypertension for 25 years. The patient was diagnosed as diabetic peripheral neuropathy before he came to our hospital and the diagnosis on admission was (1) autonomic dysfunction; (2) type II diabetes mellitus; and (3) hypertension. Gradually, he suffered from aggravated dizziness when standing up from a squatting position. He also suffered from alternating bouts of diarrhea and constipation. We performed a physical examination, laboratory tests, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET\u2013CT), lumbar puncture, marrow puncture, and biopsy of the sural nerve and rectal membrane. The study protocol was approved by the local committee on human research, and the patient provided his informed consent.\nOn examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg in the supine position and 60/40 mmHg in the standing position. He had normal consciousness and orientation. Muscle strength, tone of the extremities, and coordinate movement were all normal. There was an absence of sensation, bilaterally below the knee.

She also developed night sweats and fever, with little improvement in symptoms. On September 30, she had acute severe abdominal pain and was taken to the emergency room in the previous hospital. On examination, the patient presented with a fever of 38 degrees, rebound pain in the lower abdomen, and muscular defenses. CT scans showed jejunum and ileum wall thickening. It showed fatty deposits around the small intestinal tract and thickening of the nearby intestinal wall, and gastrointestinal perforation could not be ruled out. CT scans also showed adhesions due to inflammation of the sigmoid colon and small intestine (part of the ileum) (Fig. ). She was guided to our hospital for further investigation. The laboratory tests revealed a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 6.80 mg/dL (normal range: 0\u20130.14 mg/dL) and an interleukin 2 receptor (IL2R) level of 3,652 (normal range: 121\u2013613 U/mL) (Table ). Transanal small bowel balloon endoscopy revealed mild edema with petechial erythema, which was thought to be lymphatic follicular hyperplasia around 100 cm the oral side from the Bauhin valve. There were no abnormal findings in the colon. Biopsies were taken from the site of the suspected lymphatic follicle hyperplasia (Fig. ). Transoral small bowel balloon endoscopy revealed shallow erosions and edematous mucosa which were detected around 200 cm from the anal side at the vicinity of the Trites ligament. We found ulcers with surrounded disrupted villous structures around the anal side where erosion with edematous mucosa were noticed. We obtained one specimen from the erosion site and the other from the ulcer site (Fig. ).

    "original_text": "A 44-year-old female was admitted to our hospital due to epigastric pain with a duration of 6 months. There was no obvious cause of the paroxysmal dull abdominal pain when the pain was intense, radiating to the back. There was no history of loss of appetite, postprandial vomiting or gastrointestinal bleeding. Proton pump inhibitors were started but did not relieve the symptoms. Physical examination and her routine laboratory investigations were unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) identified a 5.8 * 3.9 cm epigastric mass that appeared to be a heterogeneous cystic and solid submucosal tumor arising from the thick posterior wall of the antrum proximal to the pylorus (Fig. a). Enhanced CT displayed irregular mixed cystic and solid lesions with thick walls and intracystic fluid. In the arterial phase, the solid part was unevenly enhanced, and the thick wall of cystic cavity was obviously enhanced until the venous phase (Fig. b, c). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a lesion elevated from the submucosa that was located from the posterior wall of the gastric antrum to the gastric angle with normal overlying mucosa (Fig. a).

The patient was a nonsmoker and had no significant medical history or known allergies.\nThe clinical examination revealed erythematous and ulcerative gingiva localized at the buccal side from teeth 15 to 17 and 24 to 27 (Federation Dentaire Internationale tooth numbering system), and oral hygiene was good (Fig. a, b). X-ray examination showed marginal alveolar bone loss in the involved teeth, and periodontal resorption of alveolar bone in teeth 15, 16, 25, and 26 was obvious (Fig. c, d). The laboratory tests performed included a complete blood count, autoantibody detection, syphilis serology and anti-HIV antibody detection, and the results were all normal. The diagnosis of necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (NUP) was made.\nTen volumes of diluted hydrogen peroxide were administered to the necrotic lesions with a sterile cotton roll in conjunction with topical administration of metronidazole every other day. The patient was prescribed an oral mouth rinse (0.2% chlorhexidine twice daily for 5 days). Five days later, the clinical examination showed an improvement in symptoms, with resolution of the ulcerated pseudomembranous area, and then scaling and root planing with local anesthesia was performed. The patient showed obvious relief of pain. However, 10 days later, the condition relapsed. In addition to the therapy above, the patient received 500 mg of amoxicillin twice per day for 5 days, but the lesions did not completely heal, and she made no further visits.\nFive months later, the patient presented to the department with a complaint of aggravated pain of the gingiva and movable teeth.

He had no relevant medical history except a tobacco-related obstructive broncho-pneumopathy; he did not describe any surgical history. Abdominal CT confirmed locally advanced PC with seminal vesicles and bladder invasion but without any evidence of lymph node or intra-abdominal anomaly (A). Biopsy showed a moderately differentiated Gleason 7 (4 + 3) score with perineural infiltration (A). Bone scan, thoracic CT and axial skeletal MRI did not show any secondary lesion (). No pelvic MRI was performed at this time due to the fact that bladder invasion was clearly demonstrated on CT scan and that local treatment was not proposed first. The tumor was thus classified as T4 N0 M0 based on these imaging modalities. Due to the high value of PSA and the high risk of occult metastatic lesions, we first started androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (leuproreline) that rapidly decreased PSA value after 1 month (25 ng/l); PSA continued to decrease and reached a value of 7 ng/l after 12 months. At this time, the thoraco-abdominal CT showed a regression of the primary tumor and of the bladder infiltration (B). The pelvic MRI further did not show any any suspect lymph node (); bone scan did not demonstrate any suspect distant lesion, as well as axial skeletal MRI. Radiotherapy (78 Gy on prostate area including the bladder infiltration location) was then performed; lymph nodes were also involved in the irradiated area (46 Gy) due to the high PSA level and the important local infiltration. This treatment, combined with ADT, resulted in PSA normalization (<0.2 ng/l) 6 months later. Leuproreline was stopped in March 2012.\nIn 2014, PSA level raised progressively to 2.2 ng/ml with a PSA doubling time of 3 months. Bone scan and thoraco-abdominal CT did not reveal",
