After hospital discharge, he was exclusively breast-fed. He experienced occasional vomiting until 19 days of age, when he developed frequent vomiting. When he was 20 days old, he was taken to the doctor for several days of watery stools, a single episode of bilious vomiting, and feeding intolerance. He was admitted to a local hospital at a weight of 2685 g. Abdominal radiography showed partially dilated loops of bowel with intestinal gas (Fig. a), and a gastric tube was inserted for frequent vomiting. At the age of 21 days, he was transferred to our hospital for further examination. A gastrointestinal X-ray series and an enema revealed gastric volvulus and gastroesophageal reflux, without intestinal malrotation or a change in intestinal caliber. We admitted the patient for observation. The following day, an abdominal radiograph showed complete passage of contrast, which indicated the absence of intestinal atresia or obstruction. However, the volume of bile discharged through the gastric tube was gradually increasing, and he had little passage of feces, even with a glycerin enema. We decided to re-evaluate for intestinal obstruction and injected contrast into the gastric tube. Follow-up abdominal radiography showed obvious intestinal dilation with gas and retention of the contrast medium (Fig. b and c). Based on his clinical course and radiological findings, we suspected distal intestinal obstruction. When the patient was 24 days of age, we performed laparotomy, which revealed a caliber change in the ileum with a stricture ~10 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve (Fig. a).

On admission, his blood pressure was 135/85 mmHg and heart rate was 66 beats/min; and neurological examination revealed nystagmus on horizontal gaze. His pupillary reflexes and extraocular movements were intact, no limb weakness and sensory deficits were found; and bilateral finger--to-nose and heel-to-shin tests were normal.

However, Romberg sign was impossible to evaluate as the patient could not be able to cooperate with further examination.\nSimilarly, laboratory tests were within normal limits. Brain MRI performed 10 h after admission demonstrated two areas of restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the left hemisphere (Fig. b). However, no acute infarction was seen in the posterior cerebral artery territories. Considering the location of infarction area could not well explain his clinical symptoms, a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was done which revealed that the left ICA was occluded (Fig. a). Meanwhile, it showed that the left middle cerebral artery and bilateral anterior cerebral artery were supplied by the basilar artery via a PTA (Fig. b + c). Based on that we presumed that in the setting of acute left ICA occlusion, a cerebral blood flow steal phenomena occurred from posterior circulation to anterior circulation which caused the patient to have acute onset of dizziness and difficulty in walking. We also speculated that the PTA may play a protective role in preventing the patient from having severe anterior circulation ischemic stroke. Furthermore, CT perfusion showed no remarkable difference between the two hemispheres (Fig. a), which was consistent with the above conclusion. Therefore, the patient was given 100 mg",

The first suspicion of placenta accreta or percreta based on pathological 'storm flow' on Doppler ultrasound was raised at 29 gestational weeks (Figure ). Severe placenta accreta was confirmed at 35 gestational weeks both by ultrasonography and MRI. As a premature elective delivery was anticipated, she underwent amniocentesis during the same examination. Her amniotic fluid erythropoietin level was normal and her amniotic fluid lamellar body count was 3, consistent with an immature fetal lung maturity profile. Intra-muscular betamethasone was administered using two standard doses of 12 mg 24 hours apart. An elective Caesarean section was performed 10 days later (Figure ) with simultaneous tubal ligation. The weight of the healthy newborn boy was 3.1 kg. The Caesarean section was performed under general anesthesia due to mild thrombocytopenia. A classical uterine incision was used for extraction of the fetus in order to avoid the morbidly adherent low placenta. The internal iliac arteries were catheterized pre-operatively via insertion of balloons to decease peri-operative bleeding. The placenta was left in situ because of placenta previa with severe placenta percreta. Bilateral uterine artery embolization was performed. The total amount of blood loss during the Caesarean section was 300 mL. Our patient then received a single 100 mg dose of intra-muscular methotrexate.

In addition, she had no travel history and there were no pets at her home. Initial assessment of vital signs showed a blood pressure of 116/70 mmHg, a heart rate of 86 beats per minute, body temperature of 36 \u00b0C, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 99%, all of which were within normal range for her age. On physical examination, she had tenderness in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen without rebound tenderness. The spleen and liver were not palpable. Laboratory examinations yielded normal results with a leukocyte count of 6,050 cells/\u03bcL, hemoglobin concentration of 13.7 g/dL, platelet count of 318,000 platelets/\u03bcL, prothrombin time of 12.3 s, and activated partial thromboplastin time of 30.6 s. Initially, she was diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis, and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was performed to rule out acute appendicitis. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed an enhancing mass, 61 \u00d7 54 \u00d7 65 mm in size and several subcentimeter enhancing nodules in the spleen, suggesting possible hemangioma, as well as diffuse edematous wall thickening in the colon (Fig. ). She was diagnosed with acute colitis and a giant splenic hemangioma that was found incidentally, and treated with intravenous hydration and medication for acute colitis. After the symptoms of acute colitis resolved, she received vaccinations for encapsulated bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis.\nTwo weeks after completion of the vaccinations, the patient underwent splenic embolization at the interventional center by a clinically experienced interventional radiologist. The procedure was performed with the patient under general anesthesia and the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry were continuously monitored during the procedure.\nThe right common femoral artery was accessed",

She was diagnosed with right eye dry eye and glaucoma and received treatment including an NSAID, immunosuppressive therapy, a prostaglandin analogue and \u03b2-blocker combination medication for eye pressure reduction, and even embolization of the lacrimal punctum. However, all the treatments only slightly decreased the intraocular pressure with no improvement in eye redness and headache. On examination, the visual acuity and intraocular pressure in the right eye of the patient were 20/40 and 20 mmHg after the aforementioned treatment, while these variables in the other eye were 20/25 and 14 mmHg, respectively. Physical examination revealed exophthalmos and severe corkscrew hyperaemia with dilated vessels in the right eye. The results of fundoscopic examination of both eyes were normal. No obvious lesions were found in the optic disc and fundus vessels of either eye (Fig. ).\nAfter we considered that the symptoms may be related to abnormal intracranial vessels, computed tomography angiography and venography (CTA + CTV) were performed, and the results showed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the right parietal-occipital area in the brain. The AVM was definitively located by further examination with digital subtraction angiography (DSA). DSA revealed that the AVM is fed by the posterior cerebral artery and pericallosal artery and is drained by the medial atrial vein.

Her right thigh was tender and swollen. Her past medical history was significant for a TOT procedure 5 years ago at a local clinic.

She had also undergone removal of the suburethral polypropylene mesh 5 months earlier in our hospital. However, at that time, complete removal of the mesh was impossible because pulling the right part resulted in snapping of the mesh because it had adhered to the tissue.\nOn the physical examination, the right medial thigh area was painful and tender on palpation. There was a 2\u00d72 cm sized area of swelling that protruded approximately 0.5 cm. The patient's vital signs were normal, but urinalysis showed pyuria, and her C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated. Computed tomography (CT) of the thigh was performed to determine an accurate size of the abscess. The CT showed an abscess located in between the adductor magnus and gracilis muscles, approximately 2.5\u00d73\u00d73 cm in size (). The mesh was not visualized on CT. The patient was admitted and received conservative management including intravenous antibiotics. On the fifth day of admission, she had a fever of up to 39.2\u2103 and chills, and aggravated groin pain with swelling in the right pubic area. Ultrasonography of the thigh on the sixth day showed an increased abscess pocket (longest axis, 6 cm) and severe muscular swelling (). Vaginal examination revealed the eroded remnant mesh with an abscess pocket. The patient underwent drainage of the abscess through a 1 cm incision in the pubic area.

The sigmoid colon cancer infiltrated the pericolic fat tissue without lymph node invasion in the preoperative colon study. Nine metastatic lesions were preoperatively detected in the liver (5 lesions in the right lobe and 4 lesions in the left lobe) (). Mean size of right side lesions was 4.3 \u00b1 1.2 cm and mean size of left side lesions was 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 cm. We planned to resect the sigmoid colon cancer and perform staged hepatectomy; a simultaneous right hepatectomy with wedge resection of the left side metastases. The preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was 75.9 ng/mL.\nThe sigmoid colon cancer was completely removed by low anterior resection. The pathologic findings of the sigmoid colon cancer specimen were moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, pericolic fat tissue infiltration, and no invasion of lymph nodes.\nThe staged hepatectomy was carried out 10 days after low anterior resection. Intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) was performed to detect the hepatic metastatic lesions. In contrast to the preoperative findings, a total of 9 lesions were detected in the left lobe. Therefore, we devised a new plan to perform non-anatomical resection of left side metastases followed by right hepatectomy after increasing the expected remnant liver volume. Mean size of left lobe lesions was 10 \u00b1 2 mm. All lesions of the left lobe were completely removed with the cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA; Integra LifeSciences Co., Plainsboro, NJ, USA).

She presented to her general practitioner with a 2-day history of increasing right leg weakness. She was referred to her local hospital where she presented as no longer able to walk. Her examination demonstrated 0/5 power in right ankle flexion, extension, eversion and inversion with increased tone. Her cranial nerve examination was normal as was her tone and reflexes. An urgent MRI of the spine was undertaken that revealed no evidence of epidural collection or neural compression. She subsequently underwent a CT scan of the brain that demonstrated a dural-based lobulated, heavily calcified left parafalcine mass associated with extensive oedema consistent with a meningioma (). The bulk of the calcification was at the periphery of the lesion with relative sparing of the central elements. 8-mg dexamethasone was administered intravenously prior to transfer to a tertiary centre where an MRI of the brain was undertaken. This showed a left extra-axial parafalcine mass compressing the pre- and postcentral gyri and abutting the paracentral lobule. It was isointense to cortex on T2 weighted images with hypointense peripheral component corresponding to areas of calcification. The mass demonstrated peripheral enhancement and an enhancing dural tail. There was no evidence of restricted diffusion. Overall, it was felt most likely to be a meningioma with some atypical features. She underwent a left frontoparietal craniotomy and resection of the lesion. Histology demonstrated a meningothelial meningioma, WHO grade I with focal areas of necrosis and features, raising the possibility of embolization-related changes. She recovered well and was discharged home after brief inpatient rehabilitation. At her 4-month review, she was walking with 5/5 power in hip and knee flexion and extension and 4/5 power in ankle dorsiflexion and plantaflexion. A 6-month follow-up MRI showed no recurrence.",

After undergoing massive small bowel resection due to acute superior mesenteric arterial occlusion 3 years previously, he had experienced claudication symptoms. The ankle-branchial index of his left leg was 0.85, and enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed localized occlusive lesions in the distal popliteal artery and the trifurcation, indicating thrombus-induced limb ischemia, given that fewer atherosclerotic lesions were detected in other arterial segments (). Furthermore, popliteal artery entrapment and cystic adventitial disease of the popliteal artery were excluded by axial imaging of enhanced CT (). His activity-limiting IC did not improve despite additional antiplatelet and exercise therapies throughout the previous year. Preoperative ultrasonography disclosed no saphenous veins available for bypass grafting; therefore, we decided to perform revascularization with endarterectomy for the localized infragenicular arterial lesions.\nThe surgical procedure was performed under general anesthesia. The distal popliteal artery and the trifurcation were exposed by a medial approach. After a single longitudinal arteriotomy, the arterial walls were found to be thickened in these segments, and soft and white thrombi were observed in the popliteal artery and tibioperoneal trunk (). Endarterectomy of 5 cm in length was carefully performed, and the intimal flaps of both proximal and distal edges were fixed with 8-0 polypropylene sutures to prevent dissection of the artery (). The arteriotomy was sutured by direct closure with 7-0 polypropylene using a 3-mm blood vessel probe to ensure its adequate luminal patency. Intraoperative angiography showed a well-recanalized popliteal artery, tibioperoneal trunk, and anterior tibial artery ().

Institutional Research Ethics Board approval (PSIY-380-12) and patient consent were obtained for the presentation of the current case. CE had been placed on clozapine after several trials of other antipsychotics in 1998, following a prolonged admission at a chronic care facility. He had been stable from that time onwards with clozapine at 500 mg in divided doses, and was residing at a group home under the care of the local assertive community team (ACT). ACTs are multidisciplinary mental health teams that manage individuals with severe mental illness in the community. They originated in North America in the 1980s as part of the planning to deinstitutionalize the chronic inpatient population and transition them in the community. It is an intense form of support in the community in most places in North America to manage severely mentally ill patients with multiple needs who would otherwise be unable to stay outside tertiary care hospitals.

He described the floor on which he was working as being in poor condition and very soiled. He reported a minor break in the skin and washed his thumb with running water only. Three days prior to admission, he had developed painful swelling and erythema of his left thumb. He attended his general practitioner who prescribed oral flucloxacillin and penicillin V. His symptoms got progressively worse and on arrival to the Emergency Department he was systemically unwell with a temperature of 38.0\u00b0C, malaise, and chills. His blood pressure, respiratory rate, and heart rate were all within normal parameters.\nOn examination, the patient had a tense swelling of the left thumb with cellulitis extending to his left hand and forearm with associated ascending lymphangitis to the left axilla. He was commenced on high-dose intravenous benzyl penicillin 2.4 g QDS, flucloxacillin 2 g QDS, and clindamycin 600 mg QDS to cover for a clinically suggestive Group A streptococcal infection with additional staphylococcal cover. He was taken to theatre on the day of admission where he underwent washout and debridement of his left thumb. A tissue specimen and two intraoperative swabs were sent to the Microbiology Department for Gram staining and culture.\nGram-negative bacilli were seen on the Gram stain of the tissue specimen obtained in theatre, and a Gram-negative organism was subsequently cultured from this specimen as well as from the two swabs taken intraoperatively.

She complained of acute retention of gas and flatus and she had no bowel movements in the previous 3 days. She also complained of nausea, vomiting and no food intake. The patient reported anorexia, severe weakness and weight loss of 12 kg over a period of 6 months. On physical examination, her abdomen was markedly tender at the right iliac fossa and a vague mass was palpated. Her bowel sounds were of obstructive type. The biochemical evaluation tests were within normal limits. The most important laboratory findings were elevated \u03b1-fetoprotein (> 800 ng/ml) and cancer antigen 125 (51.2 U/ml). HBV and HCV serum blood tests investigated in the past were negative. Abdominal X-ray showed opacity in the right upper abdomen, displacing the small bowel loops, and a few radiological signs of intestinal obstruction. The patient had clinically abdominal distention and features of intestinal obstruction on physical examination therefore, ultrasound was not performed. She also reported a history of liver hemangioma that was diagnosed 10 years previously. Following computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), without administration of intravenous contrast agent, a large (14 \u00d7 12.5 cm) well-defined, heterogeneous mass of unclear origin and nature was detected between the right hepatic lobe and the colon. The mass appeared hyper-dense on T1- and T2- weighted images compared with the surrounding lower-signal-intensity liver tissue.

Echocardiographically, he was diagnosed with d-transposition of great arteries, intact interventricular septum, moderate sized secundum atrial septal defect, moderate subvalvar pulmonary stenosis, Grade II tricuspid regurgitation, and normal right ventricular (RV) function with a semi prepared LV. A chest X-ray showed increased vascularity in the lung fields and a prominent right pulmonary artery. Echocardiographically, the left ventricle looked semi-prepared with a posterior wall thickness of 4 mm although cardiac catheterization revealed LV pressure of 69/12 mmHg and RV pressure of 100/14 mmHg.\nThe patient underwent an arterial switch operation with relief of LV outflow tract obstruction. He was stable for 24 hours after surgery. However, subsequently he became hemodynamicaly unstable with a chest X-ray suggestive of acute pulmonary edema.

    "original_text": "An 80-year-old man with a known history of right inguinal hernia was admitted to our department complaining for intermittent pain at the right groin and multiple episodes of vomiting started approximately 48 hours earlier. Clinical examination revealed the presence of a painful mass at the right inguinal area, as well as a tender abdomen with decreased bowel sounds. Abdominal radiography showed the presence of multiple air fluid levels and distended small bowel loops. Based on the medical history of the patient and the clinical examination, the diagnosis of strangulated inguinal hernia was made and the patient was emergently transferred to the operating room for open repair. Through a right inguinal incision the inguinal canal was accessed, where a relatively large, but not incarcerated inguinal hernia was found. In addition a solid mass was observed in close relation to spermatic cord and spermatic vessels. A small piece of the tumor was excised and sent for frozen section examination which was positive for malignancy. The patient underwent right high orchiectomy (Fig. ), followed by an exploratory laparotomy, as patient's symptoms could not be explained by the findings of the inguinal canal. Investigation of the abdomen revealed the presence of ascites, distended small bowel loops, 3 large tumors located at sigmoid, cecum and ascending colon, as well as multiple smaller lesions across the entire length of the small intestine and peritoneum. Interestingly, cecal mass was in direct contact with the posterior wall of the right inguinal canal.

Seven years after surgery, computed tomography (CT) revealed lymph node recurrence at the splenic hilum, which was treated with four courses of cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil. Treatment reduced the size of the lymph node, although 1 year later, lymph node metastasis was detected again at the pancreatic tail and splenic hilum (Fig. ). Chemoradiotherapy (50 Gy in 28 fractions) resulted in a complete response at the lymph nodes. However, 11 years after surgery, a cystic solid tumour was detected at the pancreatic tail using CT (Fig. a\u2013b) and endoscopic ultrasonography (Fig. a). A change in the main pancreatic duct was also detected using endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (Fig. b). No other metastases were seen on evaluation with positron emission tomography/CT (Fig. ), which strongly suggested primary pancreatic tail cancer with lymph node metastasis. Intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma was one of the differential diagnoses that were considered. Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with lymphadenectomy were performed to treat the tumour, which had a diameter of 30 mm and appeared to invade the artery of the gastric tube that had been reconstructed during the oesophagectomy. Thus, the artery was also resected to achieve curative resection. Operative time was 190 min and blood loss was 30 mL. The resected specimen from the pancreatic tail measured 29 \u00d7 22 \u00d7 30 mm (Fig. ). Pathological examination revealed that the tumour was a squamous cell carcinoma, which was compatible with the detection of the previous OSCC. The final diagnosis was pancreatic metastasis from OSCC (Fig. ). The resected metastatic lymph nodes at the splenic hilum also exhibited squamous cell carcinoma cells.

Figures and show abdominal computed tomography (CT) without contrast, significant for small bowel obstruction with intramural small bowel pneumatosis and extensive portal venous gas (PVG) within the left hepatic lobe. Emergent laparotomy was performed for acute abdomen. Exploration of the abdominal viscera revealed no evidence of inflammation, necrosis or perforation. The patient continued to have pain after surgery. Upper endoscopy was performed, revealing a non-perforated gastric ulcer which was treated with medical management until the pain resolved.\nOne year later, the patient was brought to the emergency department by her family for altered mental status.

The patient had suffered a blunt trauma in her right eye in a severe car accident. Multiple and irregular lacerations with active bleeding in the right upper eyelid were noted in the emergency room. Our ophthalmologist was consulted for blurred vision in her right eye. Direct ophthalmoscope revealed a late-onset corneal flap displacement with the flap being folded in the superior and inferior portion. In addition, the bare stroma was exposed. The connection between the nasal hinge of the corneal flap and the cornea was still intact ().\nSurgical intervention was performed 12 hours after injury. Under an operating microscope, surface debris was thoroughly scraped by a sterile surgical sponge with continuous irrigation of BSS. The margin of the corneal flap which was still in situ was then demarcated, followed by dissection of the central portion from the stromal bed. Finally, the whole corneal flap was refloated by a LASIK spatula. To expose the whole stromal bed, the corneal flap was lifted and reflected. Meanwhile, the superior and inferior folds of corneal flap were unfolded and flattened using a sterile surgical sponge, followed by vigorous irrigation with BSS at the end. In addition, the epithelial cells and remnants adherent to the underside of the corneal flap and stromal bed were carefully removed. The corneal flap was repositioned and stretched using surgical sponges in order to avoid folds and wrinkles. At last, a bandage soft contact lens was placed on the cornea for protection ().\nTopical antibiotic (0.3% ciprofloxacin) and corticosteroids (1.0% prednisolone acetate) were given postoperatively.

She had undergone a primary THA in 1999 for avascular necrosis of the femoral head. The primary procedure utilized a hybrid prosthesis, with a cemented femoral stem and uncemented acetabular cup. Her THA functioned well for approximately 15 years until a first revision was required in 2014 for polyethylene wear resulting in hip dislocation. Both stem and cup were left intact during the first revision, with a constrained liner and new femoral head inserted to prevent further dislocation. However, recurrent dislocations were experienced shortly after the first revision surgery. Despite management through closed reduction, pain medication and rehabilitation, the patient was seen in the ED following her fifth dislocation in late 2016. The patient presented with a complex medical history, including sickle cell disease, hypothyroidism, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Before ED admittance, the patient was mobile with the use of a Rollator walker but experienced an antalgic gait and increased walking difficulties. Despite regular Percocet use to control sickle cell crisis symptoms, the patient presented with pain in the left buttock, groin, and posterior aspect of her hip.

    "original_text": "A 42-yr-old man visited our hospital for management of liver masses. Two years earlier, he had undergone small bowel resection for removal of a 20 cm-sized mass, later shown to be a GIST. Following resection, he received postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy, at a total dose of 5,040 cGy. Upon presentation, multiple hepatic masses were revealed by computed tomography (CT). A paraffin block specimen of the previously resected small bowel mass was then reviewed. This tumor consisted of polygonal to spindle cells with moderate cellularity. The tumor cells showed pleomorphism, and necrosis was present. The mitotic figures were not frequent (2/50 high power fields). The tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for c-Kit and focally positive for SMA, but negative for CD34 and S100, supporting the original diagnosis of GIST of interstitial cells of Cajal origin.\nHe was prescribed oral imatinib mesylate 400 mg daily. Just after starting drug treatment, the patient complained of periorbital swelling, but no dose reduction was required. Three months later, the hepatic lesions improved, showing a partial response, and nine months after his first visit to our hospital, CT scan and positron-emission tomography showed no evidence of disease. Treatment was discontinued after a further 5 months of imatinib mesylate, but a CT scan performed 3 months after finishing imatinib showed disease progression. A second period of imatinib treatment was started, at the same dose of 400 mg/day. One month later, the patient complained of breast pain and scrotal swelling.

    "original_text": "A 75-year-old white female was admitted to the Department of Urology of our hospital following the ultrasound finding of a right adrenal mass of uncertain nature. Her medical history was unremarkable, except for long-term essential arterial hypertension. For a month prior to hospitalization the patient had complained of persistent and progressive epigastric and right loin pain. Physical examination showed only mild abdominal discomfort at palpation. No enlarged lymph nodes were present. Laboratory tests detected no abnormalities. Urinary levels of vanilmandelic acid, catecolamines and plasmatic level of aldosterone were normal.\nChest radiograph and electrocardiogram revealed no pathological findings. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy detected oesophageal hiatal hernia with reflux oesophagitis, and total-body CT confirmed the presence of a right adrenal mass of about 5 \u00d7 4 cm, suspected to be an adrenal carcinoma, so radical surgery was planned and performed with the resection of a roundish formation from the adrenal anatomic site. Normal adrenal gland was not visible ().\nThree days after surgery the patient developed a pulmonary embolism: an inferior vena cava thrombosis was identified by angio-CT scan. Pulmonary embolism was identified by angio-CT scan, too. Moreover, an unexplained progressive drop of hemoglobin concentration down to 7.7 g/dl, requiring infusion of two units of packed red cells, was observed.

The patient subsequently experienced recurrence of high-grade disease following two complete induction courses of intravesical BCG; therefore, we recommended proceeding with radical cystectomy. The patient agreed and requested creation of a continent urinary diversion.\nWe planned to perform an open radical cystectomy, extended pelvic lymph node dissection, and continent urinary diversion using the ascending colon, terminal ileum, and ileocecal valve as a continence mechanism (Indiana Pouch). Intraoperatively, the right colon was mobilized while carefully preserving the right colic and ileocolic arteries. A 12 cm segment of the distal ileum along with a 30 cm of cecum was harvested using a GIA stapler, while preserving the mesenteric blood supply. Bowel continuity was re-established by creating an ileocolic anastomosis using the GIA stapler. The SPY Elite Fluorescence system then was used to assess adequate perfusion of the anastomosis as well as the harvested bowel to be used for the urinary reservoir. This involved intravenous injection of 1.25\u20135 mg of a 2.5 mg/mL indocyanine green solution followed by visualization using a laser diode array capable of illuminating a maximum field of 18.5 \u00d7 13.5 cm2. A device camera then captured these image sequences at a rate of 3.75\u201330 frames per second based on the desired recording time of 30 second up to a maximum of 4.5 minutes. Images were viewed on a high-definition monitor in real time in the operating room, allowing for immediate evaluation of tissue perfusion []. The anastomosis appeared to be well perfused (); however, an approximately 3 cm segment of ascending colon demonstrated poor perfusion on SPY imaging ().

She had a history of two normal vaginal deliveries and small-bowel obstruction associated with BLH 10 years ago. In the latter, the patient underwent urgent surgery and ischemic bowel was excised in a local hospital.\nAbdominal X-ray examination revealed no niveau formation (Fig. ) although the patient mentioned that the symptoms were similar to those observed at the time of the previous surgery. There were no signs of bowel obstruction or peritonitis in physical examination. Hematological and biochemical examinations also yielded no abnormal findings. The patient was hospitalized and carefully observed overnight as an acute abdomen patient.\nBecause of no relief of abdominal pain, the patient underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) the next morning. Abdominal CT showed that the mesentery of the dilated small bowels converged at the right side of the uterus where an intervening band was found (Fig. ). From these findings, we decided urgent surgery because of closed-loop obstruction associated with bowel herniation in the right broad ligament of the uterus.\nLaparotomy revealed that the ileum entered a small opening in the right broad ligament of the uterus, by which the ileal loop approximately 70 cm in length was strangulated. The right broad ligament was partially incised and the hernia orifice was widened to release the strangulated ileal loop. The incarcerated ileum was preserved because ischemia was reversible.\nThe opening in the broad ligament measured 2.5 cm in diameter. The shape was oval and the margin was smooth (Fig. ). To reinforce the mesometrium, the defect was repaired with \u201cvest over pants\u201d type sutures [] using 3-0 silk strings.\nThe patient had a favorable postoperative course and was discharged on postoperative day 9. We obtained the surgical records from the hospital where the patient underwent the previous surgery for bowel obstruction 10 years ago",

Biopsies were obtained from the center and the edge of the ulcers, which revealed reactive squamous mucosa with fragments of granulation tissue and neuroinflammatory debris (). Immunostains for CMV, HSV1/2, and fungal organisms were negative. Otolaryngology obtained a biopsy of the ulcerative lesion found in the soft palate during initial EGD, which revealed nonspecific findings of acute and chronic inflammation and negative for infectious causes.\nThe patient was discharged on high-dose proton pump inhibitor, liquid diet, and total parenteral nutrition.

Physical examination revealed a mildly obese abdomen with a subtle mass in the left upper quadrant. No lower extremity edema was noted. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 15 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5-cm, well-circumscribed, preaortic retroperitoneal mass, which involved the IVC, causing mass effect on the surrounding organs (Figure ). The mass was believed to originate from the IVC but was without total IVC occlusion. Tumor involved the left renal artery, splenic artery, and distal pancreas. Hemoglobin, platelet, serum urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function test, \u03b1-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA 19-9 findings were all within normal limits. Cells obtained by computer tomographically guided needle biopsy stained positive for vimentin and desmin, confirming the mass was a high-grade retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma. Further imaging revealed metastatic involvement of the fifth cervical vertebra and epidural membrane. Over the course of the next 8 months, the patient underwent a C5 corpectomy and fusion with removal of the epidural tumor for his metastatic lesion and received 50.4 Gy intensity-modulated radiation therapy to his abdomen, 43.2 Gy to his cervical spine, and 4 cycles of ifosfamide and doxorubicin chemotherapy. Subsequent evaluation showed isolated disease in the retroperitoneum, and the patient was considered to be a candidate for resection with IVC reconstruction of his symptomatic primary tumor.\nSurgical resection of the mass was performed through a bilateral subcostal incision. Careful abdominal exploration confirmed the preoperative findings, and no other metastases were present. The tumor appeared to arise from the IVC at the level of the left renal vein and extend intraluminally in the IVC up to the caudate lobe, involving the left kidney, left adrenal gland, distal pancreas, splenic artery, and left renal artery.
