His medication included rivaroxaban, metoprolol, digoxin, furosemide, lisinopril, and salmeterol inhalers for his COPD. A complete overview of his medication at the time of presentation is listed in Table . One week prior to the current presentation he had been admitted to our emergency department (ED) with severe pain in his right arm. Upon admittance by an emergency physician there were no signs of fever. His pulse was irregular and the rate was within normal ranges. His blood pressure was 144/89 mmHg. Saturation was 97%. Auscultation of heart and lungs was not documented. Also, there was no documentation on the presence of endocarditis stigmata. Laboratory investigations showed elevated inflammatory parameters (see Table ). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was not performed. No blood cultures were taken. After a CT-scan had revealed a thrombus in his right brachial artery the care of the patient was swiftly transferred to a vascular surgeon. Surgical embolectomy was performed within short notice. Elevated inflammatory parameters were attributed to ischemia in his arm and he was discharged the next day. A few days after discharge, it was realized that a source for his peripheral embolus had not been identified and our cardiology department was contacted to exclude a cardiac origin of the thrombus. We observed two minor Dukes criteria, i.e. the presence of an aortic graft after a David procedure and an arterial embolus. Because the patient had already been discharged he was contacted for further analysis. Since he was already on rivaroxaban for persistent atrial fibrillation and he reported no further complaints (e.g. no dyspnea or fevers), it was decided to perform ambulatory transthoracic",

Four weeks before admission, she was in normal health for her age with a history of arterial hypertension. Because of atrial fibrillation, she was treated with rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily. Two weeks before hospitalization, she experienced pain in her lower abdomen accompanied by a feeling of illness and fatigue which she self-medicated with aspirin. She experienced nose bleeding but continued to take aspirin. She was then admitted to an external clinic after falling. During the first in-hospital night, she fell out of bed and struck her head. Thereafter, consciousness decreased and she was transferred to the neurocritical care unit of our institution.

Histopathological examination of the excisional piece revealed a malignant tumor that had anaplasia, marked cellularity, necrotic areas, and a remarkable neoangiogenesis with proliferation of endothelium of the capillaries. The tumor was histopathologically diagnosed as a glioblastoma multiforme. The subtotal excisional surgery was followed by cranial radiotherapy with a total dose of 60 Gy. Then we applied temozolomide (200 mg/m2/day peroral for 5 days; every 4 weeks for 10 cycles) and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg IV; every 2 weeks for 6 cycles) plus irinotecan (125 mg/m2 IV; every 2 weeks for 6 cycles) as first and second-line treatments. However, in the control magnetic resonance imaging, the tumor showed progression despite these treatments. Therefore, we began to use nivolumab as a third-line treatment.\nNivolumab therapy was started at a dose of 3 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks. Two days after the second dose, the patient was admitted to the hospital with a rapidly progressive decline in visual acuity of the eyes. On ophthalmic examination, the visual acuity of the right eye was counting fingers at 1 m and was very low on his left eye (limited to light perception). At the posterior segment examination, there was an optic disc swelling bilaterally. Other vital findings, such as blood electrolyte levels and neurological examination, were normal. An urgent MRI showed bilateral thickening of the optic nerves suggestive of optic neuritis, with normal intracranial pressure (). Bilateral optic neuritis was diagnosed with the combination of clinical features, ophthalmic examination and radiological findings.

He was managed with closed reduction of elbow, followed by cast immobilization and physiotherapy. After removal of cast, he progressively started having symptoms of median neuropathy in the form of numbness and paresthesia along the median nerve distribution in forearm and hand with inability to form a fist and weak hand movements (Figure ). Gradually there was thinning of the forearm muscles. On clinical examination, there was atrophy of forearm muscles (of the anterior compartment) and of thenar muscles (Figure ). He had weakness of small hand muscles as well in the median nerve distribution. Clinical impression was median nerve palsy. Ulnar and radial nerve function was normal on clinical examination. Nerve conduction studies revealed median nerve neuropathy at the level of elbow.\nHigh resolution USG was done, which revealed grossly thickened and hypoechoic median nerve in the region of distal arm with an abrupt cut off at the level of elbow (Figure ).

An FDG PET/CT scan revealed [] metabolically active, extensive skeletal osteolytic lesions in the calvarium, in the vertebral column at multiple levels, including the body and posterior elements and in the sternum, scapulae, ribs, and pelvic bones. A few sclerotic foci were also noted in the T4 and T5 vertebral bodies. No metabolically active lymphadenopathy was identified. A large metabolically active soft tissue mass was associated with the sternal lesion. A maximum SUV of 3.7 was seen in some of the skeletal lesions. Multiple metabolically active lung nodules were seen in both upper lobes and in the apical segment of the left lower lobe, with a maximum SUV of 1.5. On delayed images, there was significant increase in the SUV value of the majority of the lesions. A working diagnosis of skeletal metastases was considered. Biopsy from the sternal lesion ruled out malignancy and was indicative of tuberculosis.

On physical examination, two bullet entry points were evident at the right popliteal fossa and dorsal soft tissues of the distal right leg. Initial radiographs were negative for fractures or dislocation.\nComputed tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrated a retained bullet fragment within the popliteal fossa abutting the dorsal aspect of the popliteal artery. An 8 millimeter (mm) soft tissue density abutting the medial aspect of the popliteal artery was also identified, concerning for either a small pseudoaneurysm or short segment intramural hematoma. Streak artifact from the retained bullet precluded adequate assessment of this region. The peroneal artery demonstrated a 10 centimeter (cm) occlusion 2.5 cm distal to its origin but reconstituted distally at the level of the mid-tibia.

Percutaneous cystocentesis was performed, and 800 ml of serous liquid was aspirated. However, 1 week after cystocentesis, the cyst recurred, and its size was the same as that before the procedure. Therefore, resection was planned.\nIf the cyst was an epicardial cyst, tight adhesion of the cyst to the left atrium, left ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary vein was considered possible. However, we believed that the cyst was more likely a pericardial cyst because a pericardial cyst is more common than an epicardial cyst. Therefore, resection involving video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was planned initially. However, the pericardium was intact and an epicardial cyst was diagnosed intraoperatively. As preoperative CT showed compression of the left atrium, ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary vein, adhesion was suspected. Additionally, the possibility of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was considered. Therefore, open surgery through median sternotomy was performed. The cyst was found to be attached to the visceral pericardium involving the left atrium and pulmonary artery. Contrary to our expectation, the left ventricle was not involved. Additionally, coronary vessels were not involved. The cyst was most tightly attached to the main pulmonary artery. Thus, it was thought to have originated from the pulmonary artery (Fig. ).

She had pre-existent constipation, but no rectal bleeding, nor did she experience any night sweating. Physical examination did not show any anomalies except a left paraumbilical palpable mass. Ultrasound revealed a 6-cm hypoechogenic tumorous mass with sharp margins. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen showed an inhomogeneous round tumor of 73 \u00d7 61 mm with sharp margins and with hypodense fatty components in combination with enhancing soft tissue. The mass was located mesenterially, ventrally of the musculus iliopsoas with surrounding enlarged lymph nodes (maximum diameter 12 mm) (fig. ). Differential diagnoses like teratoma, liposarcoma or IMT were suggested. An additional PET scan revealed paratracheal lymph nodes which were interpreted as reactive, and the known left paraumbilical mass with only capsular FDG uptake. Ultrasound-guided biopsies were taken which revealed spindle cell proliferation with a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate, in which immunohistochemical analysis showed positivity for vimentin, pankeratin (not uniform), and focally smooth muscle actin and calponin, suggesting an IMT.\nGiven the clinical presentation and the pathological findings, it was decided to perform an explorative laparotomy with total resection of the tumor. Macroscopic inspection showed a tumor with a diameter of 10 cm with a smooth capsular outer surface (fig. ). Due to locally aggressive growth, both a section of the colon and the jejunum had to be resected. Microscopy showed a mesenteric tumor comprising diffuse, not sharply delineated and unencapsulated spindle cell proliferation with lymph node involvement per continuitatem but without involvement of the colon or jejunum and without atypia. This spindle cell proliferation was accompanied by a cell-rich mixed inflammatory infiltrate with for instance many plasma cells, lymphocytes and eosinophilic granulocytes. The tumor contained centrally a large area of necrotic debris, maybe fat necrosis. Immunohistochemical analysis",

He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 40 years and had been followed for chronic kidney disease presumed to be secondary to diabetic nephropathy since 2009. In November 2015, histological examination of colonic polyps removed during routine colonoscopy revealed the presence of prominent nodular aggregates of atypical small to medium size lymphocytes positive for b-lymphocyte antigen CD20 (CD20), cyclin D1, and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), with weak expression of lymphocyte antigen CD5 (CD5) and approximately 20% of the lymphoma cells staining for cellular proliferation marker Ki-67 (Ki-67). The histological diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma was made. He had no symptoms consistent with lymphoma. Complete blood count revealed modest anemia, and normal white cell and platelet counts. The blood smear did not contain abnormal lymphocytes at that time. Serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level was in the normal range at presentation and throughout the course of his disease. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) showed scattered metabolically active enlarged lymph nodes in both axillae, mediastinum, and around the upper abdomen around the pancreas.

Accordingly, he was initially treated by triple induction chemotherapy comprising docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil. Febrile neutropenia and neutropenic enterocolitis were observed as adverse events. Downstaging to T3N2M0 stage IIIB carcinoma was achieved after two courses of chemotherapy.

On examination, her blood pressure was 129/74 mmHg, pulse 84 beats per minute and regular, and temperature 36.8 \u00b0C. She had global right-sided weakness with a power grading of 1/5, with increased tone and brisk reflexes on the upper and lower limbs. Her plantar reflexes were downgoing. The examination of the left side of her body was unremarkable. It was not possible to assess for sensory, proprioceptive, and vibration changes, given her expressive and likely receptive dysphasia. She also had a pansystolic murmur audible in the mitral area, and her lungs were clear to auscultation. Her calves were soft and nontender bilaterally, and no peripheral edema was present. She was treated with intravenous alteplase and transferred to a tertiary center for endovascular clot retrieval (ECR) within 2 hours of her initial presentation. She was transferred back to our institute for ongoing care 3 days later. Once back under our care, we were able to confirm that she had no significant cardiovascular risk factors except for cigarette smoking of unknown pack-years and her age. She did not consume alcohol regularly. She had no similar or significant family, social, environmental, or employment history. She was receiving no regular medications prior to her stroke. We were also made aware that she was being investigated for a possible malignancy of undetermined source.

Emergency personnel at the scene found him comatose and pulseless. After several rounds of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and rapid sequence intubation, he was stabilized for transport to our hospital. On arrival to the emergency department, he had developed refractory hypotension and lost a carotid pulse for which he again required a round of CPR before return of spontaneous circulation. Once resuscitated and stabilized, head, spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT scans were obtained. He was found to have bilateral temporal bone fractures as well as a transverse clival fracture, as well as diffuse but predominantly right-sided traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhages with scattered locules of pneumocephalus (Figure ). Spinal imaging revealed intradural air at the L3-L4 levels (Figure ).

    "original_text": "A 44-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) after being found unconscious in his bathroom. The sink was broken, with blood reported all over the bathroom, suggesting some form of traumatic fall in the bathroom. On arrival at the emergency department, he was found to have an altered mental status with several facial lacerations, and a head CT demonstrated a small amount of frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage and a focal right frontal intraparenchymal contusion. Furthermore, his blood glucose was nearly 700 mg/dl and he was in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). A neurosurgical evaluation of the patient revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 11 likely related to a combination of the DKA and the cerebral contusions. When he became cooperative, he was moving all extremities symmetrically. Given a suspicion for traumatic injury, a cervical collar was placed in the field and a CT C-spine was performed after arrival to the ED. The initial report of the CT described a right unilateral jumped cervical facet with a laminar fracture without subluxation shown in the sagittal in Figure . However, as demonstrated in Figure , the midline sagittal CT scan of the cervical spine did not show any anterolisthesis of C6. Therefore, a jumped facet is less likely.\nOn closer inspection, however, it was evident that there was no pedicle on the right side at C6, and there was significant sclerosis around the edges of the lamina where the bone did not unite.

He had previously been identified with a pathogenic germline BRCA2 variant during successful management of intraductal breast carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and prostatic adenocarcinoma over 10 years prior. He otherwise had a maternal history of breast cancer during the 8th and 9th decade and two healthy adult children with germline BRCA2 variant mutations. At the initial otolaryngology visit, physical examination was normal, and he was empirically treated for bacterial sinusitis.\nOn follow-up, the patient had improvement of initial symptoms but had developed a nonproductive cough. His examination at that time was remarkable for a small pharyngeal ulcer, and antigastroesophageal reflux therapy was started. Subsequently, the patient underwent CT larynx without contrast by his Oncologist for additional workup of fatigue in the context of ongoing otalgia, sinus tenderness, and cough. This imaging revealed an asymmetric soft tissue prominence at the larynx with thickening along the adjacent right hypopharynx, a 1.3 cm lymph node and fat stranding at the right carotid space. Laryngopharyngitis was diagnosed based on repeat examination and review of imaging. A primary care physician then obtained a noncontrast MRI for new headaches incidentally identifying a transglottic mass invading thyroid cartilage with encasement of the right carotid, and a 1.6 cm right level IIA lymph node (Figure ). The patient was referred to our tertiary care center for concern of hypopharyngeal malignancy.\nEvaluation with flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed a mass at the right pharyngeal wall extending to the right pyriform sinus (Figure ).

She was diagnosed with submucosal fibroids by her previous gynecologist 5 years prior, based on chief complaints of atypical genital bleeding and hypermenorrhea. She underwent hysteroscopic myomectomy for one 1 cm sized and one 3 cm sized submucosal fibroid located between 2 and 3 o'clock in the uterine fundus. Asherman's syndrome was suspected after the patient exhibited secondary hypomenorrhea 10 months after surgery. Therefore, hysterosalpingography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. Intrauterine adhesions were suspected based on hysterosalpingography findings, while uterine cavity narrowing was identified using MRI. Hysteroscopy revealed filmy adhesions consistent with myomatous tissue at the excision site, and the patient was diagnosed with Asherman's syndrome.\nEight months after diagnosis, the patient underwent hysteroscopic adhesiolysis. The filmy adhesions observed on the left side of the fundus were easily separated with Hegar cervical dilators, and an intrauterine device was inserted after dilation. The patient was diagnosed with stage I Asherman's syndrome defined by European Society for Hysteroscopy classification of intrauterine adhesions, and menstrual flow returned to normal after the operation.\nWhile the patient had a strong desire to bear children, her inability to conceive for 7 years led her to pursue in vitro fertilization (IVF). After having a miscarriage at 7 weeks of gestation, she underwent cervical dilatation and uterine curettage.\nSix months after the miscarriage, the patient became pregnant again through IVF and was referred to our hospital at 7 weeks of gestation.

He gave a history of a road accident in which he fell from a motorcycle seven days ago. The patient did not have any history of trauma to the same knee, nor any history of systemic disease or corticosteroid use.\nOn examination, tense swelling and ecchymosis were noted around the right knee. There was a palpable defect over the patellar tendon. Tenderness was present over the tibial tubercle. Active extension was not possible. The patient was immobilized with a long knee brace and sent for MRI. An MRI T2 image revealed avulsion of the distal patellar tendon from the tibial tubercle insertion and a medial meniscus tear (Figure ).\nThe patient had diffuse swelling around the injured knee so we took him for surgery five days later after reduction of the swelling. He first underwent diagnostic knee arthroscopy and arthroscopic partial medial meniscectomy. A midline skin incision was made over the right knee. Complete avulsion of the patellar tendon from the tibial tuberosity was present with a few fibers remaining attached to the tibial tuberosity medially (Figure ).\nThe tendon attachment site on tuberosity was freshened up.

There was a history of alcohol abuse, but the patient referred abstinence from alcohol consumption for the past 6 years.\nLiver function testing revealed normal transaminase levels and a total bilirubin level of 2.16 mg dl\u20131 (normal, 0.20\u20131.20 mg dl\u20131). Serum total protein and albumin were within normal ranges. On haematological studies, no anaemia or coagulopathy was observed. Serum ammonia level was elevated, at 174 \u03bcmol l\u20131. Serologic markers for hepatitis B and C were negative; \u03b1-fetoprotein was also negative.
