One day before he came to our department, he went to the local hospital where they performed a computed tomography (CT) scan that showed a high-density shadow in the esophagus at the third thoracic vertebra (T3) level right beside the arcus aortae. Next, the local clinicians took an image of the esophagus using an electronic gastroscope with the intention of removing the fish bone (Fig. A). However, the image demonstrated that the 2 sides of the fish bone were penetrating the esophageal wall. Therefore, the local clinicians did not remove the fish bone because of the high risk of esophageal perforation and transferred the patient to our hospital.\nUpon admission to our facility, a physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Additionally, the patient was healthy before this incident and had no specific hereditary diseases. Next, we performed a 3D CT scan of the esophagus to get a more detailed image of the location of the foreign body. The CT showed a 3-cm long oblique, high-density shadow in the esophagus near the arcus aortae (Fig. B and C). A rigid endoscopy revealed that the fish bone was 24 cm downstream of the incisor, and one side was penetrating the esophageal wall. We clamped one side of the fish bone using foreign body forceps and pulled it out slowly. Very little errhysis was observed at the penetrating site; however, the extracted fish bone was only 1.3 cm long (Fig. D). Although we repeatedly checked the whole of the esophagus for missing parts of the bone, we did not find any remnants. The patient did not experience odynophagia or chest pain the day after surgery.

The patient's chief complaint was chronic low back pain. There was no antecedent trauma, bone surgery, or history of cancer. The onset of low back pain was described as insidious, with constant achy pain of at least two years duration which was progressively worsening.

During periods of increased pain, there were intermittent incidences of pain radiating to the right-sided posterior thigh and leg with \"pins and needles\" in the lateral toes of the right foot. Treatment to date had consisted of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, which she felt had been of limited benefit.

This was his third incarceration for the sexual molestation of a child, the most recent being the three-year-old daughter of a family friend. There was no history of alcohol abuse or recreational drug use in our patient.\nDuring incarceration in 2014, the patient was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. This led to the initiation of fluoxetine which was eventually titrated to 60 mg daily and believed effective.

Upon arrival, he showed an altered mental status with decreased alertness. He could follow commands but could not speak. He had no other focal deficits, such as hemiparesis or cranial nerve palsy. Computed tomography (CT) showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) []. Emergency angiography revealed a small aneurysm at the bifurcation of the left internal carotid artery and the posterior communicating artery []. The aneurysm was clipped successfully on the day of admission, and his neurological conditions showed remarkable improvement. Because the angiogram obtained on day 6 showed a sign of localized mild spasm in the A1 portion of the left anterior cerebral artery, hypervolemic and permissive hypertensive therapy with a continuous ventricular drainage to control the ICP was implemented to prevent ischemic complications. His neurological status remained stable with no findings of ischemia on serial CT examinations; however, he became restless over time and started becoming agitated, likely because of the long period of bed rest. His blood pressure (BP) hovered around 170\u2013190 over 80\u2013100 mmHg. On day 14, he repeatedly got up and lied down on the bed, which caused an inadvertent overdrainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via the intraventricular drain. The amount of CSF drainage was as high as approximately 200 ml in 2 h. His BP was 199/91 mmHg and no new neurological deficit was observed at this time. Emergency CT obtained 6 h after this episode revealed a ventricular narrowing compared to the previous CT images obtained before 2 days; in addition, a new, small, low-density area in the left occipital lobe was observed [].

    "original_text": "A 34-year-old lady with a history of failed IVF procedure one year back presented to the emergency department with one day mild epigastric pain, vomiting, and fatigue. Three days earlier, the patient had IVF with an embryo transfer procedure in a specialized center. She was well after the procedure; thus discharged home. She had normal menarche at the age of 14 years with regular menses, but she complained of oligomenorrhea for the preceding six years. She had been on metformin tablets 500 mg polycystic ovary syndrome for more than three years and was recently started on progesterone 10 mg to prepare the endometrium for conception. On examination, she looked exhausted but not pale or jaundiced. She was apyrexial, with a blood pressure of 128/70 mmHg, pulse rate 108 per minute (regular), and respiratory rate of 20 per minute. There was mild tenderness over the epigastrium but without signs of abdominal guarding and had normal bowel movements. On the second day, the intensity of the abdominal pain increased and the abdominal girth, and the patient became more tachypneic (respiratory rate 26 per minute). Nevertheless, the patient maintained adequate oxygen saturation throughout her hospital stay and did not require assisted ventilation.\nThe following table shows the investigations done on the first day of admission (Table ).\nThe relatively high white blood cell count in the presence of normal temperature and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels may be due to either hemoconcentration or stress response [,]. Urine analysis and culture were normal. Chest x-ray was within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasound showed multiple large cystic follicles in both ovaries with a moderate amount of free peritoneal fluid. Imaging of the visceral organs was unremarkable with no evidence of pleural effusion.

The patient did not feel uncomfortable until a mass of approximately 0.8 cm in the left frontal lobe was detected through a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan on June 15, 2016. Thus, the patient was referred to our department for further treatment. After comprehensive consideration, the patient underwent right ventricle Ommoya capsule implantation and right occipital lobe neoplasm resection on June 23, 2016 along with genetic testing, immunohistochemical detection, and drug sensitivity.\nPathologically, the mass was confirmed as a metastatic tumor from lung cancer, and the immunohistochemical analysis tended toward carcinoma. To re-evaluate the molecular features, DNA extracted from the tumor tissue was subjected to DNA sequencing analysis by NGS. The results showed that the patient had both MET gene amplification and a novel ALK rearrangement, collectively known as KLC1-ALK fusion, which was created by KLC1 exon 9 and ALK exon 20 ( and ). The BM progressed despite gefitinib administration. Thus, crizotinib administration began on July 12, 2016 after gefitinib treatment, with the former not showing clinically relevant adverse effects in the patient. The dosage of crizotinib treatment was 250 mg/day at twice a day for this patient.

    "original_text": "A 19-year-old nulliparous woman presented with abnormal vaginal bleeding and dysmenorrhoea. Her medical history was uneventful. Pelvic examination revealed the presence of a large mass measuring 5 cm in diameter and protruding from the cervix. The preoperative ultrasound demonstrated a uterus with heterogeneous material visualized within a thickened endometrial cavity measuring 13.9 \u00d7 21.4 mm. Laboratory tests showed low haemoglobin level of 5.2 g/dL. With these findings we interpreted the mass as a prolapsed pedunculated submucous myoma. A hysteroscopic resection of the myoma was planned.\nTwo weeks after the outpatient visit, an examination under anesthesia revealed a remarkable increase in the degree of the prolapse of the large mass. The mass was noted to extend outside the vagina and beyond a palpable dilated cervix (instead of outside the cervix, which was the case on presentation). The myoma was clamped and twisted around its pedicle and the stump was ligated under direct vision. Excess downward traction on the myoma was avoided in order not to cause an inversion of the uterus. Electrocoagulation was performed when bleeding from the pedicle stump persisted. After the procedure the fundus was impalpable and the cervix could not be visualized on pelvic examination. The bladder was empty so it was not possible to misinterpret it as the uterus. After this, a fimbria appeared in the vagina. These findings made us strongly consider the possibility of a uterine rupture. A laparoscopy followed by laparotomy with Pfannenstiel incision was performed and the fundus of the uterus was perforated from the left cornual area to the right. The uterus could be preserved and was closed in layers. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged from the hospital five days after the surgery.

She was diagnosed with LS in 1999 after the discovery of hypokalemia, but genetic test to confirm diagnosis had never been performed. For hypertension, she was treated with lacidipine 6 mg daily that brought about reduction but not normalization of BP. Despite the fact that amiloride is the drug of choice for LS treatment [], in Italy it is commercially available only in fixed formulation with hydrochlorothiazide; therefore a calcium channel blocker was preferred in this patient.\nEarly after the first evaluation, the patient became unintentionally pregnant. Therapy with lacidipine allowed BP control until the 25th gestational week, when the patient was hospitalized for a hypertensive crisis (BP 160/110 mmHg associated to a strong headache). The absence of proteinuria ruled out preeclampsia, as possible differential diagnosis. The patient started extended release (ER) nifedipine 20 mg twice a day plus a fix dose combination of amiloride 2.5 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once a day, doubling gradually the dosage, achieving BP normalization in the absence of any adverse effect on pregnancy.\nAt 37th week of pregnancy ultrasound scan examination revealed fetal growth retardation (as testified by an abdominal circumference at the 15th percentile, according to customized growth chart) together with anomalies in the umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry. Upon a second hypertensive crisis (BP 150/100 mmHg), the patient was again hospitalized and started amiloride 7.5 mg once a day, as we were finally able to obtain the oral formulation with amiloride alone.

Computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram was performed and was negative for pulmonary embolism and showed only small bilateral pleural effusions.\nOn admission, patient underwent thoracentesis and approximately 1L of brown fluid from the left pleural space was removed. Pleural fluid evaluation demonstrated an exudative effusion with lipase of 2912 IU/L and amylase of 2783 IU/L. CT abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a fluid density tract arising from the pancreatic tail, extending caudally through the diaphragm from the esophageal hiatus, communicating with the left pleural space (). The patient was started on medical therapy with octreotide. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) confirmed a PPF tract with irregular, dilated, main pancreatic and common bile ducts (). The patient underwent ERCP two days after admission which redemonstrated mild diffuse dilatation of ventral pancreatic duct involving the head, body, and tail of the pancreas with evidence of pancreatic duct leak in the most upstream tail of the pancreas that extended caudally to the left pleural cavity, consistent with PPF. A 5 FR x 10 cm plastic stent was placed in the pancreatic duct and a biliary and pancreatic sphincterotomy was performed to divert the fluid leak.\nThe hospital course was complicated by post-ERCP acute pancreatitis, which was treated with bowel rest and empiric antibiotics. Postprocedure chest radiograph showed worsening pleural effusions and surgical management including distal pancreatectomy was considered. However, surgery was deferred after the patient improved clinically with medical management, and a repeat chest radiograph revealed improvement of the pleural effusions.

The result of the pathology consultation in our hospital was the same as that at the local hospital. No moles were seen on the skin or mucous membranes of the patient\u2019s body, and other physical examination findings were normal. The gynecological examination revealed ulcerative black lesions with a diameter of about 1.5 cm on the anterolateral right side of the clitoris.

    "original_text": "A 42-year-old man presented to our department with the sudden onset of headache under progressive right hemiparesis and hemihypesthesia. Neurological evaluation revealed decreased grasping power of the right hand and paresthesia of the right arm. The laboratory findings were normal. CT showed a cystic mass with fluid-fluid level and a calcified nodule at the left thalamus and obstructive hydrocephalus with signs of increased intracranial pressure (). Brain MRI showed about a 50\u00d730\u00d730-mm-sized lobulated cyst with a fluid-fluid level, a focal peripheral calcified nodule, and subtle enhancement in the left thalamus (). The cystic mass compressed the third ventricle and left basal ganglia. The differential diagnoses of the radiological findings were cavernous malformation, neurocysticercosis, and low-grade glioma. Based on the clinical and radiological features, we decided to remove the mass through a contralateral interhemispheric transcallosal transchoroidal approach that had more advantages than other proven approaches to thalamic lesions (). The patient was placed in the supine oblique position with head elevation. After head fixation, the sagittal plane was aligned parallel to the floor with the superior placement of the left hemisphere to reduce brain retraction of the right hemisphere by gravity. After making a curvilinear scalp incision along the coronal suture, craniotomy crossing the midline sagittal sinus was performed two-thirds in front and one-third behind the coronal suture, as in the usual anterior interhemispheric approach. Opening of the interhemispheric fissure to reveal the corpus callosum was performed with less retraction of the ipsilateral hemisphere with the assistance of gravity. With the use of neuronavigation, the ideal trajectory was identified to expose the contralateral ventricle with the lesion. We discerned the orientation of the thalamostriate and septal veins to confirm entry into the left lateral ventricle with the thalamic lesion.

She had a fall on the school ground while playing 1 hr before the presentation, had no symptoms of nausea, and did not have any discharge or bleeding from her nose. The medical history was unremarkable and did not have any history of daily medication. No gross facial asymmetry was evident. She had no abrasions on the lower or upper lip. Her temporomandibular joints were functioning within limits and with no clicking, pain, or any abnormal mandibular deviation. On intraoral examination, the patient had a complete set of primary dentition and had moderate oral hygiene, with mild plaque deposits at the gingival margins. There was a fracture in the right maxillary canine (tooth number 53) with the oblique fracture line extending subgingivally (). Radiograph (IOPA) taken in the right anterior region of the jaw (tooth number 53) revealed evidence of fracture line running 2 mm below the cementoenamel junction and involving the pulp ().\nThe treatment options and prognosis for tooth 53 were discussed with the patient's mother. Preoperative photographs were taken, and local anaesthesia was administered (2% xylocaine with 1 : 80,000 adrenaline) on the buccal and palatal aspects of tooth 53. The mobile tooth fragment was extracted, and the remaining tooth structure was surgically extruded using a maxillary anterior forceps (). Occlusion was checked to ensure that there are no occlusal interferences. Acid etching of tooth numbers 51, 52, 53, and 54 was done. The bonding agent was applied, and a semirigid splint was placed and stabilised using a flowable composite ().

He had a history of a stabbing wound in his left subcostal region 3 months prior without any pathological findings in the thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) scan (Fig. ). The patient was followed up with a daily physical examination. He had no abdominal pain and fever. Oral intake was started. He tolerated the regimen. The patient was discharged on the 3rd day of hospitalization.\nDiaphragmatic hernia was considered due to the history of a stab wound, accompanied by the physical examination findings. Thoracoabdominal CT revealed a diaphragmatic hernia and fluid in the hernia sac (Fig. ). Due to respiratory distress and general abdominal tenderness, the decision to perform an emergency laparotomy was made. Operative exploration showed the herniation of the transvers colon through the diaphragmatic defect (Fig. ). After the removal of the dense adhesions, the colon segment was taken into the abdomen. Ischemia, necrosis and perforation were observed in the colon (Fig. ). There was a 6 cm defect in the diaphragm (Fig. ). There were also necrotic fluids and stool in the hernia sac in the thorax. The hernia sac and necrotic tissues were excised. It was decided to perform colon resection and anastomosis because the abdomen was clean. The defect in the diaphragm was sutured with a non-absorbable suture. The patient was taken to the intensive care unit for close follow-up. He had respiratory distress.

Emergency medical services were called at the nursing home and the patient was reportedly hypoxic with oxygen saturation in the 70s on room air with subsequent development of agitation and lethargy after the seizure. The patient was transferred to an outside hospital's emergency department (ED), where additional tonic-clonic activity was noted. She subsequently developed hypotension with a blood pressure of 52/36 mmHg that was refractory to crystalloid intravenous fluid resuscitation. Central venous catheter (CVC) was placed and norepinephrine was started for persistent hypotension.

The patient was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care facility cardiac intensive care unit for evaluation of cardiogenic shock.\nUpon arrival, the patient was alert and following commands, but disoriented. She was still requiring supplemental oxygen and norepinephrine for hypotension. Given the concern for cardiogenic shock, a stat bedside transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained, which demonstrated a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.

The patient was reported to have decompensated on account of nonadherence with his home medications resulting in frequent hospitalizations and poor functioning. As per the patient's admission records, the patient's initial labs and urine toxicology were within normal limits. The patient had been on various antipsychotics since his diagnosis with schizophrenia at the age of 19, including haloperidol, olanzapine, and risperidone, but he continued to decompensate despite adequate medication trials. The decision was made to start the patient on clozapine due to possible failure of these previous antipsychotics. Clozapine was started at 25 mg PO twice daily and titrated up to 150 mg PO twice daily over the next 12 days. His current daily dose was 300 mg when he was transferred to the telemetry unit following a sudden development of fever and tachycardia on the psychiatric inpatient floor.\nOn the medical inpatient unit, the patient was mostly selectively mute and did not appear to be in any pain, was not vomiting, and had no diarrhea and no reported loss of consciousness or seizures. His admission vitals were a temperature of 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit, BP of 115/81 mmHg, HR of 114 beats per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Physical examination did not reveal any significant findings other than a mild dehydration, no skin rash, no jugular venous distension, basal crepitation or pedal edema. Cardiac auscultative findings were largely normal except for a tachycardic heart rate; apex beat was in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.

The patient had no history of trauma, previous fractures, systemic or metabolic diseases, and eating disorders. She was in lactation period and did not take any medication including supplementation of vitamin D and/or calcium; however, dietary calcium intake of the patient was found to be within normal ranges. On physical examination, no pathologies including swelling, redness, or any scar were detected. The ranges of motion of both knees were preserved, but painful through the flexion. The McMurray test result was positive for both knees; however, the other tests for meniscus and ligamentous injury were negative. Neurological examination findings were also normal. Deep tendon reflexes were normoactive and no motor, neither sensorial loss was detected. Plain radiographs of both knees (anteroposterior and lateral projections) were taken for the initial evaluation. The joint spaces were normal, and no fracture nor sclerotic line was detected. For a more detailed investigation, bilateral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knees were taken which showed an incomplete fracture line at the medial proximal tibia and bone marrow edema throughout the proximal tibia bilaterally (Figure 1). The MRI also showed that bilateral anterior cruciate ligaments were partially ruptured. We also performed bone single-photon emission computed tomography/ computed tomography (SPECT/CT) and whole-body bone scintigraphy. The investigations were interpreted as a benign process with an increased activity at the level of medial tuberosities of tibias bilaterally (Figure 2).

The patient had no known comorbidities apart from being diagnosed with pregnancy-induced hypertension. The conception was planned and was not assisted by any interventional or medical means. There was no history of congenital anomalies in the family or of twin pregnancies. Ultrasonography at our institution revealed a single intrauterine fetus, corresponding to 27 weeks and two days of gestation, displaying a normal interval growth from the previous ultrasound. The presence of a multiloculated cystic mass with septations and calcifications was also noted. This mass was devoid of any vascularity (Figure ).\nOn color Doppler examination, no vascularity was noted and the mass, reported as measuring 104 x 53 mm, appeared as arising from the anterior wall of the uterus. The differential diagnosis of placental teratoma, chorioangioma, hemorrhagic placental degeneration, or degenerating fibroid was considered. A repeat scan in the third trimester revealed the same findings.\nAt 36 weeks and five days of gestation, the patient gave birth, via C-section, to a fetus with good Apgar scores (9/1, 9/5). A second congenitally malformed fetus was also delivered, which was devoid of cephalic end structures. Only the feet and lower limbs of the fetus were discernable (Figure ). A single placenta measuring 515 grams was also delivered, containing two umbilical cords. The patient was discharged in a stable condition on the sixth day of admission.\nA histopathological examination of the placenta revealed placental discs measuring up to 19.5 x 14 x 4 cm.

He had no previous psychiatric history. When seen he gave a 2-week history of exaggerated egosyntonic unipolar affective reactions with symptoms of overwhelming tiredness and sadness, and difficulty in concentrating. A few months earlier, he was diagnosed with eczema in a dermatology clinic and was prescribed fucibet cream (betamethasone with fusidic acid), which is classed as potent corticosteroid. His skin condition did not improve satisfactorily and was considered to have recalcitrant eczema. He was then prescribed clobetasol propionate cream, which is classed as a very potent corticosteroid. As advised, he applied the cream twice daily and to the areas affected i.e. forehead, neck, arms, and chest. Ever since he commenced clobetasol cream, he began to experience severe mood swings. He described these experiences to immediately follow the application of the cream to his body and the episodes lasted upto couple of hours each time. Despite these experiences, he continued to apply the cream, as he has seen an improvement with his skin condition. His medication history suggests that he has drug sensitivity as he reacted badly to local anesthetic for a nasal surgery and he is also allergic to penicillin.\nHe is not known to drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes or take illicit substances. He was not on any other medications at the time of contact and had no significant medical history.

He endorsed mild chronic mild low back pain, which did not impair his daily activities and which he attributed to a previous car accident. During initial workup for hematuria, abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse lumbar spinal osseous lesions with both osteoblastic and osteolytic features (Figure ). The patient was therefore admitted to internal medicine service for workup of potential metastatic malignancy. His grandmother had cervical cancer; otherwise his family history was unremarkable. Physical examination showed mild tenderness to palpation on thoracic and lumbar spine. His right orbital rim was slightly more prominent than left side and there was a dark skin mark on right front thigh along L1-2 distribution (Figure ).\nDuring the hospital stay, the patient\u2019s laboratory tests were significant only for bacteriuria and vitamin D deficiency with a normal complete blood count/comprehensive metabolic panel, including alkaline phosphatase. Serum protein electrophoresis was negative for any M protein. Tumor markers including CEA and PSA were negative.\nChest, abdominal and pelvic CT scan with contrast was carried out, which showed additional similar thoracic spinal lesions. No primary tumor lesion was identified, except a small 4 mm non-specific pulmonary nodule. Single photo emission computed tomography (SPECT) and whole body nuclear scan were carried out for further characterization of patient multiple bone lesions. SPECT showed ground-glass sclerotic lesions on maxillofacial region and right calvarium, which is typical for fibrous dysplasia (Figure ). All bony lesions are associated with increased nuclear signal uptake (Figure ).

He was stabilized by bilateral nonselective internal iliac arteries embolization (Video 1, available as supplemental material online). As a complication, he developed skin necrosis in the lumbosacral area. The defect size was 20 \u00d7 20 cm (400 cm2) extending from L4 to S4 and total bone exposure. Considering the necessity of a reliable coverage after bone debridement and the relative patient instability precluding a free flap, a reconstruction based on propeller LAP flaps was planned (six weeks after initial trauma, in reason of the hemodynamic and systemic fragility after the polytraumatism, requiring multiple orthopedics interventions). Planification included angio-CT () with 3D reconstruction to exactly localize lumbar perforators. The most suitable vessels in this case were L4 perforators on both sides. Perforators were then double-checked with an ultrasound Doppler probe and marked on the skin preoperatively (Video 2, available as supplemental material online). Flaps were designed from the posterior midline toward the anterosuperior iliac spine. The horizontal distance from the posterior midline to the perforators was 9 cm on both sides and the distance from the posterior midline to the medial edge of the flap was 4 cm (). After extensive bone debridement with posterior corpectomy and dura mater exposure, flaps were raised on each side (23 \u00d7 10 cm and 20 \u00d7 10 cm; left and right sides, respectively) (). Fasciocutaneous flaps were raised from lateral to medial including the lumbar fascia and the pedicle was dissected with microinstruments. The pedicle included L4 lumbar perforator, accompanying vein and cutaneous nerve.

The patient was apparently all right 6 months back when her parents started noticing that she was getting irritable on trivial matters and would start crying even on minimal provocation. One day following an altercation with parents, the patient stormed off and allegedly consumed half a cup of floor disinfectant. She was then rushed to the hospital for management. Following this incident, the patient started keeping to herself and would not interact with her family. Her symptoms gradually worsened so much so that her parents found her crying most of the day. She would get anxious and breathless even if approached by her mother for a regular conversation. Since 10 days, the patient would tell her mother that she was unable to write anything in college due to tremors in her hands and stopped going to college altogether. Her mother initially thought that she was making excuses to not study but noticed her hands used to tremble and she was not able to hold anything for long. Family members noticed progressive slowing in her activities along with frequent staring episodes. She would respond to her name only after being called 4\u20135 times. Gradually, her upper limbs started becoming stiff and the tremulousness worsened. She was unable to eat as she could not close her mouth and had drooling of saliva. Her forearms remained flexed in uncomfortable positions for long periods without discomfort. She was unable to sleep due to these symptoms.
