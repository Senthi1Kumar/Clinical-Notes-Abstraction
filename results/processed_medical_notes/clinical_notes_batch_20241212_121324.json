The pain was diffuse, dull, and paroxysmal, and could be alleviated by rest. He also presented with transient fever (maximum 39.2\u00b0C) for several times. He did not seek medical services until nausea and vomiting occasionally occurred especially in the morning 1 month after the onset. He underwent a head computed tomography scan at the local hospital, showing a 15 mm \u00d7 10 mm cyst in the pineal region (just a chance finding). No apparent changes were found in other intracranial structures including the sella turcica area. He was treated pharmacologically with analgesics. However, his condition did not improve. After 2 weeks, because of frequent nausea and vomiting, he came to our hospital. The patient was down in spirits with heavy complexion. In addition to the above symptoms, he also complained a mildly decreased bilateral visual acuity (VA) in recent weeks. He denied polyuria, polydipsia, and sexual hypoactivity, and had no symptoms of unconsciousness, convulsion, epilepsy, and cognitive disorder, and no special circumstances regarding his family history or personal history related to his presentation were identified. Neurological examination showed a normal function of both sensation and motor at 4 limbs. No apparent changes in superficial and deep tendon reflexes were observed. Both superficial and deep tendon reflexes were normal. Pathological signs and ataxia were absent. Upon rough ophthalmologic examination, his left palpebral fissure was relatively small with ptosis, and pupillary light reflex was insensitive on the right side. The left VA was 0.8 and the right 0.6. There was suspicious defect in right upper quadrant of his right eye. However, his VA declined sharply. Just within 3 days while waiting for his head MRI scanning, the patient complained he even could not see anything with his right eye, and his vision on the left side blurred further",

His medications included warfarin, nifedipine, pantoprazole, gabapentin, cinacalcet, calcitriol, calcium carbonate, calcium citrate, and ergocalciferol. Prior history included atrial fibrillation and complete heart block, and the patient had previously undergone failed endocardial pacing systems bilaterally, followed by an epicardial lead placement in 2015 with revisions due to a high threshold and early battery drain. His prior endocardial leads were extracted due to sepsis and infection. He then presented with episodes of loss of capture even at the highest pacing output after multiple refusals from surgeons to perform further lead revisions. Device check showed an underlying junctional escape rhythm at 30 beats per minute (bpm). The patient had previous AV fistulas placed in the upper and lower extremities, and imaging studies revealed chronic occlusions of bilateral subclavian, superior vena cava, and internal/external jugular veins. These chronic occlusions allowed for extensive collateral formation, and as a result, the patient remained asymptomatic with respect to his venous obstructions. In preparation for this procedure, the case was discussed with vascular surgery in the event that a complication arose.\nDespite having an IVC filter in place, the patient's sole remaining pacing option was a transfemoral leadless pacemaker implantation. Preoperative laboratories demonstrated that patient had a supratherapeutic INR of 4.7; he was subsequently given vitamin K and his warfarin was held resulting in an INR of 1.9 on the day of the procedure. The delivery of this system became imperative when the patient's epicardial lead lost capture at the beginning of this procedure. The patient remained asymptomatic, but was now in a junctional rhythm at a rate of 20\u201330 beats per minute throughout the intervention.

Fine needle aspiration cytology was inconclusive and the patient underwent a diagnostic lymph node excision for histological evaluation, which showed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) and 15fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) were undertaken to identify the primary site and revealed a 2 cm mass involving the right tonsil with a right sided level II lymph node mass extending into the deep lobe of the right parotid gland. He was treated with radical chemoradiation comprising image-guided intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) delivering 65Gy in 30 fractions to the oropharynx and right neck level II with 54Gy in 30 fractions to right neck levels III to V and left neck levels II to V. Concomitant cisplatin 100 mg/m2 was given on days 1 and 29 of radiotherapy. A FDG-PET/CT scan performed at 3 months post-treatment confirmed a complete metabolic response.

Ultrasound revealed a large DVT in the left femoral vein stretching from the popliteal to the iliac vein.

Physical examination revealed an exophytic and ulcerative vulvar mass, approximately 4 cm in diameter, localized on the right labium majus at less than 2 cm from the midline, without palpable inguinal lymph nodes bilaterally. An incisional biopsy was performed, and histology revealed an invasive poorly differentiated vulvar SCC. A total-body CT scan performed to stage the disease resulted negative for distant metastases.\nThe patient underwent right hemivulvectomy in order to obtain wide tumor-free pathological margins in June 2017. Concomitant inguinal lymph node dissection was not performed due to the patient's refusal (risk of lymphedema). Histopathologic findings confirmed a poorly differentiated vulvar SCC arising on a background of lichen sclerosus.

She was a housewife and her symptoms developed after undertaking strenuous work helping her family prepare for a wedding. The patient remembered that she had sustained a fracture to the right elbow when she was 6 years old but could not remember the details of either the injury or its treatment.\nOn physical examination, the power of extension of the thumb and four fingers of her right hand was reduced to a trace, but the power of dorsiflexion of her wrist was normal (Figure ). Pre-operative electrodiagnostic data were compatible with PIN palsy. There was no sensory disturbance in the area supplied by the superficial radial nerve.

A bony prominence was palpated on the anterolateral aspect of her elbow.\nPlain radiographs of her right elbow revealed an anterior dislocation of the radial head and elongated radial neck (Figure ). Ultrasonography revealed that the posterior interosseous nerve was compressed by the dislocated radial head, and there was focal swelling from just distal to the radial head to just before it entered the supinator muscle (Figure ).\nWe performed an exploration with an anterolateral curved incision of the right elbow. The radial nerve was encased in fibrotic tissue that also enveloped the PIN and lay anterior and superior to the dislocated radial head. We dissected out the nerve and fibrotic tissue.

She was treated with first-line chemotherapy including bevacizumab, capecitabine and oxaliplatin from March 2007. Oxaliplatin was discontinued after four months of treatment due to severe neuropathy. At that time, she achieved disease stabilization with gradual decline of CEA levels. She continued to receive bevacizumab and capecitabine for eight months until disease progression. Subsequently, she was enrolled in a clinical study and received cetuximab, bevacizumab and irinotecan for four months with good control of disease. She was withdrawn from the clinical trial due to significant toxicities. Afterwards, she developed progressive disease on single-agent cetuximab.\nIn January 2009, with improvement of neuropathy secondary to prior oxaliplatin use, chemotherapy with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin and 5-FU every two weeks was initiated. She tolerated the first two cycles without major side effects. In early March 2009, during her third cycle of chemotherapy, she experienced upper body skin rash and pruritis shortly (5-10 minutes) after starting oxaliplatin treatment. Oxaliplatin infusion was discontinued immediately. The hypersensitivity symptoms resolved after steroid and antihistamine treatment. No petechiae or mucosal bleeding was noted. Due to our prior experience with patient one, a CBC was immediately obtained after the onset of hypersensitivity symptoms.

Right posterolateral thoracotomy in the 4th intercostal space was done (Fig. ). Ventilation of the left lung was maintained by selective intubation. The thoracic aorta was X-clamped just above the aneurysm while another (distal) clamp was placed right below the aneurysm and also above the aberrant left subclavian artery. Thus, perfusion and oxygenation of the aortic arch branches were provided by the beating heart as well as by selective lung ventilation. Perfusion of the thoracic and abdominal aorta below the distal clamp was secured by a partial CPB (2 l/min) while the adequate perfusion was controlled and adjusted by comparison of arterial pressure on the both radial and left femoral arteries. The aortic coarctation and aortic aneurysm were resected and replaced with tubular prosthesis of 22 mm in diameter (Figs. d and ). The CPB time lasted 94 min in a mild hypothermia (34 degrees Celsius).\nThe postoperative course was uneventful. On the 8th postoperative day the patient was discharged (Fig. b).",

    "original_text": "A 6-year-old boy was referred with double stream urination. Physical examination revealed the presence of the double glans accompanied by second urethral meatus positioned dorsally (). Further evaluation by voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) showed duplex bladders in the coronal plane (). The accessory bladder lies anterior to the main bladder with no evidence of vesicoureteral reflux. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan showed horseshoe kidney with acceptable cortical function in the right kidney (60%) and diffuse decrease in the cortical function of the left kidney (40%). Cystoscopy was performed and the cystoscope easily passed through the ventral meatus unlike the dorsal orifice due to severe stenosis. The right ureteral orifice drained at the entrance of the accessory bladder to the main bladder while the left orifice entered the main bladder at its normal position. However, both urethral orifices originated from the main bladder. Further study by spinal magnetic resonance imaging revealed butterfly vertebrae in L1, L2, and L3 (). Overall, the patient had bladder duplication in the coronal plane with two distinct urethras, both originating from the main bladder, accompanied by glans diphallia with dorsal stenotic urethra (). The patient was taken to surgery and the bladder was exposed through a lower midline incision. The main and accessory bladders were separated by adjacent fascia. After opening the main bladder, the septum between the two bladders was resected and the two lumens were anastomosed (). Due to the patent ventral urethra and stenotic dorsal urethra, the closure of dorsal urethra was planned. A catheter was placed in the stenotic dorsal urethra to demonstrate the orifice, and the orifice was subsequently ligated and cauterized. The biopsy of the intravesical septum revealed a muscular tissue lined by a transitional epithelium with congestion and hemorrhage. Postoperatively, the patient had good caliber urination at ventral orifice with no stream at dorsal orifice and he was discharged with good condition. The patient has no complication after 1",

    "original_text": "A 62-year-old female presented for continuous diffuse abdominal pain, predominantly located in the left abdominal quadrant, associated with nausea and loss of appetite, without frank weight loss or changes in bowel habit; symptoms started about one month earlier and became progressively worse. The past medical history was significant for mild arterial hypertension controlled with medication and coronary artery disease. Her family history was unremarkable for any medical conditions, and the patient denied alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking or illicit drug use. The clinical examination showed an ill-appearing patient with discrete pallor, normal weighted (BMI = 20 kg/m2). The abdominal examination revealed a slight epigastric sensitivity in the left upper abdominal quadrant, without palpable masses. The laboratory findings (cell blood count, biochemistry, and coagulation profile) were within normal ranges. An abdominal ultrasound was performed but pancreas visualization was not concluding, due to artefaction. An intravenous enhanced abdominal CT scan revealed a well-defined lesion, 35 mm diameter, arising from the tail of the pancreas, hypodense, without contrast enhancement ().\nSerum tumor markers, CA19-9 and CEA, were normal.

The patient presented with ulcerated lesions on the anterior chest and dyspnea due to malignant pleural effusion. Apart from the reported complaints, the patient's medical history was unremarkable; and so were the family and social histories.\nThe patient was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast (Stage IIIb) on February 2004. Pathological examination of the needle biopsy sample was performed. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the tumor cells were positive for estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors and overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression. The tumor was graded as intermediate (grade 2) according to the nuclear grading system. The patient was administered doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, followed by docetaxel as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Trastuzumab was later added to the chemotherapy regimen. However, there was recurrence of the breast cancer, for which she was treated with weekly doses of paclitaxel and trastuzumab. On April 2005, after trans-areolar total glandectomy, she was readministered trastuzumab. However, local and axillary recurrence of the tumor occurred 4 and 2 times, respectively. The tumor cells tested negative for estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors; however, HER2 overexpression persisted. She received a combination therapy of vinorelbine and trastuzumab. Thereafter, treatment from our clinic was stopped for a year since the patient wanted to undergo alternative therapy. She revisited our clinic in January 2009 for ulcerated lesions on the anterior chest and severe dyspnea.

She had previously undergone bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and en bloc subtotal colectomy for bilateral high-grade ovarian serous papillary carcinoma infiltrating the sigmoid colon. She also had peritoneal and diaphragmatic seedlings which were debulked concurrently. After the resection, the residual disease was estimated to be less than 0.5 cm2. Subsequently, she received 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and taxol. Her CA125 level which was elevated at 149 U/L prior to resection later returned to 8 U/L (normal range = 0 \u2013 25 U/L). Apart from chemotherapy, there was no past history of exposure to radiotherapy or any carcinogens.\nDuring this presentation, the only abnormality on routine hematology and biochemistry was a slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase at 178 U/L (normal range = 35\u2013130 U/L). The CA125 level was within the reference range (7 U/L) and no other tumor markers were assayed. A Computerized Tomography (CT) scan revealed a large heterogeneous mass almost completely replacing the right lobe of the liver (Figure ). No other abdominal, pelvic or lung lesions were identified.

He also complained of severe, intermittent, diffuse abdominal pain associated with diarrhea and hematochezia for 2 d prior to this ED visit. He did not have a sore throat, rhinorrhea, abdominal pain, joint pain or rash.\nThe patient had a past medical history significant for UC. The patient had lived in the Great Lakes region for his entire life, worked in construction for many years and had no history of recent travel. He lived with 3 young children who all had recently suffered from a viral respiratory tract infection lasting approximately 1 wk. He had pets at home including a gecko, a rabbit and 2 dogs. 10 mo prior, he had presented to the ED with similar complaints of diffuse abdominal pain and diarrhea associated with haematochezia for 6 wk. Investigation for common conditions such as gastrointestinal infections, endocrine disorders, food allergies and medication changes were ruled out, and a decision was made to perform a colonoscopy with tissue biopsy. Biopsy from the colon revealed non-specific histological findings i.e. crypt abscess, mild architectural distortion of the lamina propria and chronic inflammation. Markers of acute inflammation such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and c-reactive protein (CRP) were also found to be elevated, suggesting a diagnosis of UC.

The patient had been under the care of Dermatology since 2003 for an itchy rash on the legs, scalp and chest. A biopsy from a crusted lesion on the scalp (Fig. ) in 2003 revealed acantholysis of the keratinocytes in the upper part of the prickle cell layer (Fig. ), and direct immunofluorescence studies showed IgG positivity around the upper epidermal cells. These features were consistent with a diagnosis of PF. He was started on Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) 500 mg twice a day and Prednisolone 10 mg once a day by Dermatology in 2006, which had resulted in excellent control of his cutaneous lesions. Prior to this, Azathioprine alone had been introduced on two occasions by Dermatology, however the patient failed to tolerate it due to nausea and vomiting.

She had a Class II division 1 malocclusion, severe crowding in the maxillary arch, moderate crowding in the mandibular arch, anterior open bite, upper midline deviation to the right, and the maxillary right central incisor in infraversion (). The panoramic radiograph showed the complete development of the teeth, except for the third molars which were still in development. The patient had an asymmetrical face, convex profile, and lack of lip seal (). Growth pattern was vertical with a skeletal Class II malocclusion, according to the cephalometric values shown in . Due to the great esthetic impact of the malocclusion, the patient refused to perform the initial extrabuccal photographs.\nThe patient and her parents were asked about any history of trauma. They reported that the patient had suffered a fall in childhood, which could have generated ankylosis of the right upper central incisor.\nInitially, the treatment objectives consisted of alignment and leveling of the dental arches and Class II correction with the use of elastics. Lower premolar-to-premolar slices were planned to create space for dental alignment. However, during the initial alignment and leveling, it was noted that the maxillary right central incisor did not move, which led to a unilateral right open bite. The ankylosis of the maxillary right central incisor was then confirmed. An attempt was made to traction the ankylosed tooth using a .018\u2033 segmented wire together with 5/16 medium elastics with 50g of force on each side, 16 hours per day, but it was not successful ().

The patient reported that the swelling started two weeks prior to the presentation but denied any associated pain. The patient denied injury or trauma to the foot. An X-ray of the right foot revealed old fracture deformities but no evidence of an acute osseous lesion. A lower extremity Doppler ultrasound was performed and ruled out the presence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient also endorsed dysuria, dribbling, and urinary retention over the previous day but adamantly refused placement of a catheter. When the patient was told that he would be discharged from the emergency department, he began complaining of chest tightness, shortness of breath, and nausea, all of which he denied on a review of symptoms during the initial evaluation. He stated that the chest discomfort had been present all day, was non-radiating, and rated at a 4/10 in severity. Electrocardiography (EKG) and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits. The patient was admitted for further evaluation.\nDuring the hospitalization, the patient developed multiple additional complaints that after appropriate workup, ultimately did not lead to a specific diagnosis. The patient worked with physical therapy and occupational therapy, which established that the patient was difficult to assess, as his functional mobility issues were inconsistent. He was noted to have deficits in balance, endurance, and safety awareness, which affected the patient\u2019s ability to perform the activities of daily living.

    "original_text": "A 27-year-old Indian man presented with complaints of a clicking sound upon partially opening his mouth. He had experienced this symptom for the past year.\nRelatives had observed that the sounds were absent when he was asleep. Our patient had had a single episode which was suggestive of mania with psychotic symptoms seven years prior to presentation. Since then he had been taking a combination of lithium and carbamazepine continuously as he felt there had been mild fluctuations in his mood when he had attempted to discontinue the drugs. There had been no changes in his drug dosage prior to the onset of his palatal problems. He had no history of using antipsychotic medication. He also had no other significant personal, medical or family history of neuropsychiatric illness. On his detailed psychiatric evaluation, no anxiety, mood or psychotic symptoms were found.\nThe results of our patient's physical examination revealed bilateral rhythmic oscillations of his soft palate associated with a clicking sound and tremors of the tongue,which were not synchronous with his palatal movements. The clicking sound was not audible when his mouth was closed or wide open. With distraction, his tongue tremors reduced in intensity but no obvious change in the clicking sound was noticed. As such, there was no obvious evidence that our patient's palatal movements were under voluntary control. He had no difficulty in speaking or swallowing. There were also no abnormalities in his eye movements.\nAn examination of his other systems did not reveal any abnormalities.

    "original_text": "An 11-year old girl was referred to our department with a ten-year history of difficulty in walking diagnosed as cerebral palsy (CP). The history obtained revealed that the patient was followed up regularly by paediatric neurologists for her CP, and she had multiple botulinum injections when she was 8 years old. The physical examination based on the walking analysis illustrated limited range of motion in addition to 55\u00b0 of increased femoral anteversion in either hips. From the data of walking analysis, physical examination and radiological findings, the increased femoral anteversion and excessive soft tissue contractures due to CP were considered the primary reason for her walking difficulty. To improve her gait pattern, a combination of soft tissue procedure and distal femoral derotational osteotomy were planned.\nUnder general anaesthesia, the tendons of adductor longus, iliopsoas, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, gracilis, and gastrocnemius were released from the musculotendinous junction bilaterally. Bilateral distal femoral derotational osteotomy was then performed just above the metaphysis level with a lateral approach, and osteosynthesis was obtained by dynamic compression plate and screw fixation. Bilateral long leg casts were applied postoperatively to maintain osteosynthesis. The patient was discharged on the third post-operative day, casts were removed one month later and routine rehabilitative physiotherapy was instituted.\nAt one-year routine follow-up, there was complete union of the osteotomy. Although pre-operative radiographs of the right knee showed no evidence of any cystic or tumoral lesions around the distal femur (), the second-year follow-up radiographs revealed an asymptomatic large bone cyst in the distal part of the right femur.

The patient had a history of Class II obesity (body mass index [BMI] 35.6 kg/m2) and sleep apnea. She had a history of a dilation and curettage and was also previously diagnosed with endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) and was treated with megestrol acetate for 3 months. She had a negative endometrial biopsy before initiating treatment. After failing numerous ovulation induction cycles, the decision was made to proceed with IVF. She underwent a GnRH agonist down-regulation gonadotropin stimulation protocol and was triggered on stimulation day 10.\nTVOR was performed under monitored anesthesia care during which both ovaries were easily visualized and multiple preovulatory follicles were observed. The patient's co-morbidities required minimized depth of anesthesia resulting in patient movement complicating the retrieval. Follicular aspiration was particularly challenging on the left side but ultimately resulted in recovery of 19 oocytes.\nOn emergence from anesthesia, the patient reported immediate and significant sharp, predominantly left-sided lower abdominal and back pain. After an hour, her pain was controlled and she was discharged. She presented to a local emergency room (ER) while en route home due to recurrent severe lower abdominal pain, emesis, and copious leakage of vaginal fluid.\nIn the ER, her vital signs were stable. She described flank pain and sharp left lower quadrant abdominal pain with exacerbations, followed by increased vaginal leakage and back pain. Her abdominal examination demonstrated a diffusely tender and moderately distended abdomen without rebound or peritoneal signs. She received intravenous (IV) analgesics and antiemetics, which moderately improved her pain and resolved her recurrent emesis.

The skin overlying the mass was reddish and hyper-pigmented. The mass had been present for more than 8 years but had grown rapidly over the past few months. There were no palpable lymph nodes and no other breast masses on physical exams. A chest CT showed no remarkable lymph nodes and a 9.3 \u00d7 6.7 cm, well-defined, thin-walled, cystic mass with some nodular enhancing lesions in the lateral wall of the mass. This suggested a benign soft tissue mass, such as a large epidermal inclusion cyst (Fig. ). Because we considered the mass to be a benign cystic mass, we excised it without lymph node dissection. We were able to save the nipple because the mass was limited to the subcutaneous layer beneath the areolar tissue. The mass was a well-encapsulated cystic lesion that contained old blood material, and there was no gross invasion into the surrounding tissue. Microscopic examination revealed an intracystic papillary projection (focal area with papillary projection), representing in situ carcinomatous lesions with apocrine features. A microscopic focus of the invasive carcinoma was identified in the cystic wall adjacent to the in situ lesions (Fig. ).

    "original_text": "A 50-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for investigation of a mass in the right external auditory canal. She had suffered from hearing loss and ear fullness in her right ear for some months. She had no significant past medical history. On physical examination, right otoscopy revealed a soft mass totally filling the external auditory canal and hiding the entire tympanic membrane (Figure ). Right threshold of hearing (averaged over 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz) was 51.25 dB with conductive hearing loss. A tympanogram showed type B in her right ear.\nAn enhanced temporal bone computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a soft-tissue mass lateral to the tympanic membrane that filled the right external auditory canal without involvement of the tympanum. There was no evidence of bone erosion. The tympanic membrane and the ossicles appeared normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the temporal bone demonstrated a slightly hypointense external auditory canal mass in T1-weighted images, and hyperintensity in T2-weighted images (Figure ). This finding was considered to be a vascular lesion. There were no feeding vessels to a mass found by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).\nThe lesion was removed using a transcanal and retroauricular approaches under general anesthesia. The base of the lesion was found to be in the posterior wall. The lesion was close to the annulus tympanicus, but did not adhere to the tympanic membrane. The tumor and skin were fully removed from the external auditory canal leaving a part of the anterior wall. We could not identify the feeding vessels. Total bleeding during the operation was 30 ml. Bleeding was easily controlled by monopolar and bipolar coagulation. We transplanted a skin graft excised from her right thigh to the right external auditory canal (Figure ).

Her depressed mood developed eight months prior to admission. Five months prior to the admission, she began to experience frequent falls. Eventually, her left hand's 5th finger was fractured due to a bad fall, and she was hospitalized at the orthopedic department. Twenty days later, she was transferred to a local psychiatric clinic because her depressed mood was aggravated. She was diagnosed with major depressive disorder without psychotic features.\nAlthough the patient did not report being under stress, her admission notes indicated that her main symptoms included depression, anxious mood, loss of interests, insomnia, and suicidal ideation. Her short-term memory was slightly impaired. No other cognitive examination was performed. The brain MRI obtained at the beginning of hospitalization showed no specific findings.\nShe was treated with 20 mg of escitalopram for depression and 37.5 mg of quetiapine for insomnia. Dysarthria and masked face then developed; nevertheless, she did not take any other medication because her level of subjective discomfort was not sufficiently severe. She was discharged twenty days after the hospitalization because her mood symptoms showed improvement.\nFifty days before the next admission, her memory impairment became progressively worse and she was disoriented as to time. No depressive mood was observed. The quetiapine was switched to 1.5 mg of risperidone. After switching medication, the masked face and her recurrent falls increased remarkably in intensity.\nShe visited the emergency medical center because of a right orbital wall fracture that she sustained after falling forward.

Eight years later she was diagnosed with a new primary tumour in the contralateral (right) breast. This was a grade III, 3/17 node positive, ER positive/HER2 negative invasive ductal carcinoma, which was treated with mastectomy, axillary node clearance, chemoradiotherapy and letrozole (Femara, Novartis, UK). The patient had been disease free up to the latest presentation in 2016. The clavicular pain initially settled spontaneously but recurred and prompted further investigations. Clinical examination revealed a mass involving the left clavicle measuring 5 cm in transverse diameter.

    "original_text": "A forty-three-year-old male patient underwent a zero mismatch, living related kidney transplant in 2012. He received no induction. The donor had normal body mass index and underwent an uneventful laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. Transplant kidney had a single vein and a single artery with three hilar branches with no discernable atherosclerotic plaque. The artery and the vein were anastomosed end to side to the external iliac artery and vein, respectively. Good flow to all branches of the renal artery was noted and good urine output was noted after releasing the vascular clamps; however, sudden stoppage in urine output was noticed after closure of the surgical wound, at the time of anesthesia reversal. An urgent duplex ultrasound was performed in the operating room which revealed no flow in transplant renal artery, resulting in open exploration. Now, the allograft appeared blue and was soft on palpation. A clot was noted in the main renal artery extending in to the upper polar branch that compressed the other two branches and compromised the renal perfusion. Further, upon release of the arterial anastomosis, a dissection of the transplanted renal artery extending up to the upper pole branch was noted. The allograft was perfused with cold saline after clot extraction. The dissection was repaired in the following manner: The dissected branch of the renal artery was excised at the trifurcation of the main artery and a saphenous vein graft was interposed between the main renal artery and external iliac artery (). At the end of the repair, upper pole of the allograft remained nonperfused. There was immediate graft function with good urine output. His serum creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL till date.

    "cleaned_text": "a forty-three-year-old male patient underwent a zero mismatch, living related kidney transplant in 2012. he received no induction. the donor had normal body mass index and underwent an uneventful laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. transplant kidney had a single vein and a single artery with three hilar branches with no discernable atherosclerotic plaque. the artery and the vein were anastomosed end to side to the external iliac artery and vein, respectively. good flow to all branches of the renal artery was noted and good urine output was noted after releasing the vascular clamps; however, sudden stoppage in urine output was noticed after closure of the surgical wound, at the time of anesthesia reversal. an urgent duplex ultrasound was performed in the operating room which revealed no flow in transplant renal artery, resulting in open exploration. now, the allograft appeared blue and was soft on palpation. a clot was noted in the main renal artery extending in to the upper polar branch that compressed the other two branches and compromised the renal perfusion. further, upon release of the arterial anastomosis, a dissection of the transplanted renal artery extending up to the upper pole branch was noted. the allograft was perfused with cold saline after clot extraction. the dissection was repaired in the following manner: the dissected branch of the renal artery was excised at the trifurcation of the main artery and a saphenous vein graft was interposed between the main renal artery and external iliac artery (). at the end of the repair, upper pole of the allograft remained nonperfused. there was immediate graft function with good urine output. his serum creatinine is 1.4 mg/dl till date. follow-up doppler scans revealed a nonperfused upper pole with no evidence of stenosis in the saphenous vein graft. again, a timely recognition of reduction in urine output and urgent doppler scanning resulted in early reexploration and repair of arterial dissection, thereby averting graft loss.",
