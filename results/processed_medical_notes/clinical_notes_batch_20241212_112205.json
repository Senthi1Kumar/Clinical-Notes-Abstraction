The patient had no history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis or any neck swelling, and neurological examination showed no abnormalities. A lumbosacral spine MRI (magnetic resonance image) scan revealed multiple lesions in the L4, L5, S1 vertebra bodies, sacral bone and left pelvis bone, suggesting of a metastatic disease (Fig. ). A PET (positron emission tomography) scan showed abnormal hypermetabolic foci in the L4, L5, S1 vertebra bodies, sacral bone, left pelvis bone and left thyroid lobe, giving further indication of metastatic tissues (Fig. ).\nThe patient had no previous history of neck irradiation and his family history was negative for any form of thyroid disease. Clinical examination of the neck using ultrasound revealed a left-sided nodule of 2 cm in size. Routine blood tests and thyroid function tests were also within normal limits. However, FNA (fine needle aspiration) of thyroid tumor and biopsy of the vertebra bone confirmed the presence of a metastatic carcinoma.\nOnce the carcinoma was confirmed, a total thyroidectomy and level VI neck dissection was conducted. Histology analysis revealed a microscopic focus of intrathyroidal low-grade MEC within the 2 cm nodule, as well as in one lymph node, however, no papillary features were identified. Postoperative, the patient was treated with palliative external beam radiotherapy (30 Gy) to the vertebra bodies, sacral bone and left pelvis bone to relieve pain. The patient did not receive radioactive iodine therapy. Six months after treatment, the patient died due to severe pain and fatigue caused by the disease.\nIn pathological studies that followed, there were no indicators of papillary carcinoma or follicular carcinoma, and no evidence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis in the thyroid parenchyma. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive results for thyroglobulin, confirming that the carcinoma primary origin site is the thyroid, and thus the diagnosis of thyroid mucoepid",

On physical examination, he had lower limb varus alignment, no muscle atrophy, no effusion, normal range of motion, a stable knee, and normal meniscal and neurovascular examinations.\nRadiographic images were normal. MRI was reportedly normal. Due to the persistence of symptoms despite analgesics and muscle strength exercises, diagnostic arthroscopy was performed. We detected no evidence of joint damage. Histological and microbiological tests of the synovial lining from various areas were normal.\nHowever, owing to worsening symptoms 2 years later, another MRI was performed, revealing a tumor in the synovial lining just over the proximal pole of the patella; the tumor was isointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2, with intra-osseous invasion of the upper pole of the patella (), suggestive of SH.\nUpon open surgery, the synovial lining above the upper pole of the patella was swollen and bluish brown, with poorly defined margins, and there was invasion of the quadriceps tendon and the superior pole of the patella. We resected the tumor and half of the quadriceps tendon to healthy margins and curetted the superior patellar bone lesions back to normal trabecular bone. Histological examination revealed blood vessels with multiple arterial and venous vessels in the stroma, confirming the diagnosis of arteriovenous SH.\nAt the 6-week follow-up, the patient had a stiff knee with a range of motion of 0\u201330\u00b0. At 10 weeks, we performed arthroscopic arthrolysis and obtained new biopsy samples. Histological examination showed no evidence of a tumor.

He presented to the emergency department with a primary complaint of shoulder pain and difficulty in swallowing. On primary survey, the airway was patent and he was hemodynamically stable. A single bullet wound was visualized above the left scapula. On chest radiograph, the bullet was located in the left pulmonary hilum near the mainstem bronchus []. No pneumothorax or hemothorax were apparent; this was confirmed with the radiologist. At this point, the patient complained of increasing difficulty in swallowing and was intubated for airway protection. An orogastric tube was passed erroneously into the airway precipitating vigorous coughing and eventual vomiting of gastric contents. Once this was properly replaced, the patient underwent CT angiography (CTA) of the chest and flexible bronchoscopy. CTA revealed no vascular injury; however, air was present throughout the mediastinum and the subcutaneous tissues of the anterior neck []. The bullet was again seen near the left mainstem bronchus []. There was no pneumothorax or hemothorax. After discussion with our radiologist, we believed that the bullet had likely caused a small airway injury which had quickly sealed, leading to the pneumomediastinum without evidence of pneumothorax or bronchopleural fistula. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed no blood or bullet fragments, but only a small abrasion in the left posterolateral trachea which was thought, at the time, to be due to trauma from the initial orogastric tube placement.\nAs no significant injuries were noted on initial bronchoscopy, the patient continued to be managed nonoperatively. In light of there being no pneumo- or hemothorax, the presumed trajectory of the bullet was from above the left scapula directly to the left pulmonary hilum. Based on this, it was felt that he was at low risk for esophageal injury, and gastrointestinal endoscopy was deferred. He remained intubated, afebrile, and hemodynamically stable.

Three months later he experienced fevers, sweats, and a dry cough, which spontaneously resolved after several weeks without antibiotic treatment. His symptoms recurred in June 2017 and at this time were associated with raised inflammatory markers. Further investigation, including a computed tomography (CT) chest, identified multiple peripheral lung lesions that were initially presumed to be malignant. Once again, his symptoms spontaneously resolved without any antibiotics. A follow-up CT chest in August 2017 identified resolution of the peripheral lung lesions, challenging the initial presumed diagnosis of malignancy.\nA further CT chest was organized in November 2017, and on this occasion there was recurrence of lung lesions in new areas, suggestive of septic emboli with internal cavitation (Fig. A, B). At this time that patient complained of sweats and lethargy, and was consequentially hospitalized for further investigation of his relapsing remitting lung lesions.\nOn admission, four blood cultures all identified Streptococcus mutans. A transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiogram was completed, which identified a perimembranous VSD but no endocardial vegetation (Fig. C). A CT pulmonary angiogram was performed to exclude a pulmonary embolus and to identify an appropriate lung lesion to biopsy.\nA thoracoscopic lung biopsy was completed, which isolated S. mutans from the necrotizing lung abscesses. Furthermore, the patient complained of lower back pain, which was investigated with spinal magnetic resonance imaging and identified early L3-4 osteomyelitis without a complicating epidural abscess. As the patient was not haemodynamically compromised during admission, there was no need for urgent surgical repair of the VSD. The decision was made to treat the VSD-related IE medically, followed by an elective VSD repair following a completed course of antibiotics. Initial medical treatment included six weeks of intravenous benzylpenicillin and ceftriaxone, followed by three months of oral amoxicillin",

He also stated having a three-hour pressure-like epigastric discomfort with radiation to the right upper quadrant. The pain started while lifting heavy objects at work and continued intermittently. There was no history of syncopal or presyncopal episodes. His past medical history disclosed multiple episodes of palpitations since the age of 20, but no associated chest pain, a syncopal episode related to exercise a year earlier and negative history of illicit drugs, tobacco, or alcohol intake. Importantly, his father died at the age of 57 due to a massive myocardial infarction.\nUpon arrival, blood pressure was 100 mm Hg systolic and 60 mm Hg diastolic; he was tachycardiac with a heart rate of 220 beats per minute. Apart from tachycardia, cardiovascular examination and the rest of physical exam were unremarkable. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed narrow complex tachycardia with a ventricular rate of 220 beats per minute (). Presumed ST-segment elevation <1 mm was noted only in lead III during tachycardia. Vagal maneuvers were attempted to convert the rhythm but were unsuccessful. Subsequently, successive intravenous boluses injection of adenosine at doses of 6 and 12 mg were administered with successful conversion to sinus rhythm ().

The lesion showed good enhancement with intravenously infused contrast material in the arterial phase on CT and was considered to be RCC clinically. No metastases in regional lymph nodes or distant sites were evident on whole-body CT, therefore T1N0M0 RCC was diagnosed. The patient was judged as high-risk for surgery due to his poor liver function.

In past, she has undergone hysterectomy one year and six months ago because of hysteromyoma and was never found to have any heart diseases and relevant history. She was never found to have diabetes mellitus and denied relevant history of smoking. On examination, there was no abnormality in physical examination including cardiac auscultation etc. except for mild edema of both lower extremities. The laboratory examinations revealed normal results including tumor markers etc.\nTransthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography showed normal parameters of the left and right ventricular wall thickness, size and function. The right atrium was mildly enlarged and filled with a medium echogenic oval tumor mass which is approximately 5.5 cm*2.3 cm (Figure ). The tumor mass originated from inferior vena cave, extended into right atrium (Figure ), moved back and forth through the tricuspid orifice into right ventricle. The tumor of right atrium and inferior vena cave has no stalk and has well-demarcated borders with the wall of right atrium and inferior vena cave (Figure ), which caused the tumor wandering within right atrium and inferior vena cave. The moderate tricuspid regurgitation was detected.

The patient had begun complaining of progressive fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias, and back pain beginning approximately one year before diagnosis at his primary care provider's office, which initially seemed to be associated with his, at the time, recent parathyroid resection. Lyme's disease, endemic in the patient's geographic region and often considered in nonspecific presentations with these symptoms, was ruled out by antibody assay. On retrospective analysis of the patient's history, he apparently had worked at a local university in maintenance and did not have a known history of employment in manufacturing or significant chemical handling. There was no known family history of genetic conditions that would predispose the patient to multiple malignancies.\nThe patient progressively worsened over months; he developed nausea, dry heaving, and decreased appetite. CT of the chest and HIDA scan had been performed which revealed nonobstructive cholelithiasis with normal gallbladder function. The patient subsequently underwent a noncontrast CT of abdomen and pelvis, which revealed a large abdominal mass measuring 7 cm \u00d7 5.5 cm abutting the mid portion of the transverse colon, with numerous metastatic foci in the liver, lymphadenopathy adjacent to the pancreatic head, a large lytic lesion involving the tenth rib, and scattered lytic areas throughout the spine and left iliac wing ().

Thereafter, she developed gradual swelling and moderate pain in the bilateral sternoclavicular joints with a marked elevation of her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Whole-body bone scintigraphy (WBBS) revealed tracer concentration in the superior margin of the sternum. Pathological examination following a sternal biopsy suggested aseptic chronic osteomyelitis. After treatment with antibiotics, her symptoms were temporarily relieved. In 2011, the patient presented with pain in the anterior chest wall (ACW), thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, and left hip.

Both the donor and recipient were cytomegalovirus-negative. She received basiliximab 20 mg prior to her transplant surgery and another 20 mg on day 4 post-transplant. Following transplantation she was immunosuppressed with mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone and tacrolimus. She had longstanding stable kidney function following transplantation with a baseline GFR of 84 mL/min and a creatinine of 80 micromol/L. Her past medical history was remarkable for iatrogenic hypothyroidism following parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism, and she had no prior history of malignancy.\nIn April 2015, after ten years of immunosupression, she developed an irregular hyperpigmented and evolving lesion on her left upper back which was resected in May 2015. The biopsy of the left scapular site revealed a superficial spreading invasive melanoma with a maximum Breslow thickness of 2.59 mm, Clark level of IV, with, mitoses of 5/mm2. No ulceration was identified, but tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor regression were present. Peripheral margins were uninvolved, but deep margin was involved by a satellite nodule and microsatellitosis was also present. Wide-local excision and bilateral axillary lymph node biopsies were performed July 2015, as lymphoscintigraphy had identified drainage of each of the lesion to the contralateral axilla when injected with technetium 99 sulfur colloid. Three right axillary lymph nodes were removed and were negative for malignancy, but 1 left axillary lymph node was removed and pathology revealed an 8.5 mm \u00d7 7.5 mm melanoma deposit with extranodal extension.

    "original_text": "A 34-year-old male diagnosed with CF as a child was found to have CFRD at age 20 after joining our tertiary care clinic. He was diagnosed with CFRD based on fasting glucose and HbA1c levels along with symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia. He was started on insulin therapy the year following diagnosis () with 1 unit of rapid acting insulin analogue, insulin aspart, per 20 g of carbohydrates, and no basal insulin. Eight years after being diagnosed with CFRD, he was approved to start a new therapy, ivacaftor 150 mg orally twice daily for treatment of his CF based on his G551D mutation. Pre-ivacaftor, his insulin regimen was unchanged as he generally averaged between 4 and 6 units of insulin aspart per meal consistent with a carbohydrate content of 100 to 120 g per meal. This dose was consistent with what he received as an inpatient during admissions with stable postprandial levels not requiring additional correction. Within 6 months of starting ivacaftor, he reported recurrent hypoglycemic episodes and stopped insulin therapy. Between starting ivacaftor and the 3 subsequent years, the patient had been hospitalized for CF exacerbations 8 times at our institution. On these admissions, he rarely required insulin with only low-dose sliding scale insulin aspart as needed for elevated blood sugars.

As the local resections were microscopically incomplete, a strategy including wide surgical excision with skin graft reconstruction and right posterior cervical lymphadenectomy was adopted.

In recent few months, her cough had significantly worsened, she could not sleep supine as this aggravated her symptoms, and more recently, while sitting, she could feel clear drops running down her throat and spontaneously emerging from her left nostril. She had a history of worsening headaches in the past 4 weeks and was referred to the otolaryngologist for the evaluation of chronic allergic rhinosinusitis.\nThe patient underwent a nasal endoscopic evaluation and a left-sided lateral skull base defect appeared to be the location of the CSF leak. Subsequent referral to neurosurgery for evaluation and definitive surgical treatment was done, with meningitis workup being negative. Further imaging included computed tomographic (CT) scan that revealed an osseous defect between the roof of the left sphenoid sinus and the floor of the left middle cranial fossa, immediately adjacent to the foramen rotundum [Figure -]. Magnetic resonance imaging ((MRI) revealed fluid buildup in the left sphenoid sinus [Figure -]. The elevated risk of meningitis and worsening symptoms and signs required expedient surgical intervention. Given the lateral location of the defect, we favored a left anterior lateral skull base approach with an orbito-zygomatic osteotomy rather than an endoscopic approach.\nThe vascularized pericranium was preserved along with the temporalis, and pericranium used as a pedicle flap to cover the defect.[] The foramen rotundum and the V2 component of the trigeminal nerve were identified, with the defect being contiguous with them. The osseous defect demonstrated infiltration of meningocele into the sphenoid sinus [], which was later confirmed during the surgery.

He was diagnosed with rectosigmoid colon cancer and underwent endoscopic stent placement as a bridge to surgery for large bowel obstruction. He was found to have multiple lung metastases and a horseshoe kidney on CT scan (Fig. ). 3D-CT angiography showed an aberrant renal artery at the isthmus from 3 cm under the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) branch of the aorta (Fig. ). Laparoscopic anterior rectal resection was performed with a five-port conventional technique in which sigmoid colon and upper rectum were mobilized via a medial approach. During the operation, the IMA, left ureter, left gonadal vessels, and hypogastric nerve plexus were identified and preserved (Fig. , ). The root of aberrant renal artery was not visualized. The root of the IMA was located considerably cephalad to the renal isthmus, and the left branch of aberrant renal artery that was close to IMA was detected and preserved (Fig. ). The specimen was removed through a small laparotomy wound, and intraperitoneal reconstruction was performed according to the standard double stapling technique. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on postoperative day 16. Pathological examination demonstrated no metastasis of the lymph node.\nHorseshoe kidney is rare, with an incidence of 0.25%, and the incidence is higher in males than in females at a ratio of 2:1. Horseshoe kidneys are fused at the lower pole in 95% of cases, and the isthmus is composed of fibrous tissue alone or contains parenchyma. The horseshoe kidney is located at a level lower than the normal kidneys because elevation of the kidneys interferes with the isthmus at the origin of the IMA.\nA literature search revealed 23 patients who underwent surgery for colon cancer with concomitant horseshoe kidney including our patient, from 1983 to 2017 [\u2013].",

After EVAR, a gradual increasing of the aneurysm sac was found without evidence of any type of endoleak. Eventually, the aneurysm reached a diameter of 9.7 cm on the computed tomography (CT) angiography and abdominal pain redeveloped. CT angiography showed a huge aortic aneurysm without evidence of endoleak, and it was considered that this was due to endotension.\nCT-guided sac aspiration was performed through the translumbar puncture of the aneurysm sac, and 400 mL of a dark brown-colored liquid was aspirated (). CT scan was performed the day after the puncture and the sac shrunk back to its original size (). Abdominal pain subsided and the palpating mass disappeared. One month after the aspiration, a CT scan was retaken, and the scan showed that the aneurysm sac increased back to the size before the aspiration (). Additionally, the scan showed no signs of endoleak. A second aspiration was performed again, and a further 300 mL of the dark brown colored fluid was aspirated. During the second aspiration, small amounts of contrast media was administered through the lumbar puncture site in order to search for the presence of collateral flow induced endoleak and to detect any possible rupture of the aneurysm sac. But no contrast media leakage from the sac was found, and no endoleak was found.

Initially, we used a single port of approximately 2.5 cm to perform a biopsy (wedge resection) of the lesion. During the procedure, a 5-mm rigid thoracoscope was used for viewing, along with a linear stapler and endoscopic grasping forceps for wedge resection. There was no reticulating instrument used in the procedure. The tumor was then removed with an endo-bag.

    "original_text": "A 72-year-old woman with a past medical history of sarcoidosis underwent an endoscopic examination owing to dysphagia. The endoscopic examination revealed a circumferential tumor with ulceration in the cervical esophagus. Biopsies obtained during the endoscopy indicated squamous cell carcinoma. Contrast-enhanced CT showed extensive tumor growth with suspected tracheal invasion and enlarged lymph nodes extending from the cervical region to the upper mediastinum. FDG-PET/CT revealed abnormal FDG accumulation in the primary lesion (SUV max: 23.1) and lymph nodes (SUV max: 5.45) from the cervical to upper mediastinal region (Fig. ). However, it was difficult to determine whether the multiple lymphadenopathy was benign or metastatic because of her past medical history of sarcoidosis. Therefore, and also for the purpose of preserving the larynx, we initiated definitive chemoradiotherapy. The patient was administered 2 cycles of 45 mg cisplatin and 700 mg 5-fluorouracil with 60 Gy/30 fr radiation therapy over 2 months. In each cycle, 8 mg dexamethasone was administered to prevent side effects of chemotherapy. After completing the chemoradiotherapy, we observed complete disappearance of FDG uptake in the primary cancer in the esophagus, and only a slight reduction in FDG uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes (SUV max: 3.26; Fig. ), which indicated that the lymph nodes were affected by sarcoidosis. The primary lesion of the esophagus relapsed 3 months later. Then, the patient underwent thoracoscopic and laparoscopic total laryngopharyngoesophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction via the posterior mediastinal route. The pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the cervical esophagus. The resected lymph nodes demonstrated no tumor metastasis. However, some lymph nodes showed granulomatous reactions and contained several small epithelioid cell granulomas (Fig. ), suggesting the presence of sarcoidosis. The final stage was determined as pT2N0M0, pStage IB (UICC 7th). The patient was discharged 27 days after surgery. Contrast-enhanced CT performed 6 months after surgery showed no tumor recurrence.

Over the next 48 h there was gradually increasing pain and swelling, resulting in difficulty in weight-bearing. Initial assessment in his local Emergency Department, including ankle radiographs, showed no evidence of bony injury. Ligamentous injury was suspected and he was managed conservatively.\nOver the next week his symptoms progressed and within that period he was unable to mobilize without crutches. He was admitted to hospital at this stage. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was carried out of his ankle which showed a grade 1 injury to his medial collateral ligament, lateral ligament complex, tenosynovitis of the posterior tibial tendon, subtalar osteoarthritis, as well as some overlying soft tissue oedema. There was no evidence of bony injury, destruction or any infective processes. The patient was subsequently discharged with analgesics and referred for a course of physiotherapy.\nA bone scan was later performed which showed a florid increase in activity of the left ankle, highly abnormal and suspicious of infection (Figure). A white cell scan was also strongly positive for infection in the hindfoot. A subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed X-ray appearances of cortical destruction and lytic lesions in the calcaneus, talus, navicular and cuboid bones (Figure). These appearances were suggestive of osteomyelitis.\nSurgical debridement of his left hindfoot was performed and he was commenced on broadspectrum antibiotics (cefuroxime). As his pain was progressive, one week later he underwent a triple fusion of the ankle with exploration and washout. A below knee plaster of paris was fitted and was managed non-weight bearing.

No abnormal findings were observed on his hematological and biochemical examinations.

Abnormal findings were not found in the lung field and mediastinum (Fig. a\u2013c). Bronchoscopic examination was performed under topical anesthesia.

The medical and family histories were unremarkable, as were the results of the physical examination.\nExtraoral examination revealed facial asymmetry, with swelling present on the left side of the mandible. Intraoral examination revealed a non-tender bony hard swelling causing obliteration of the vestibule of the left side of the mandible, extending from the right deciduous lateral incisor to the left deciduous second molar region, measuring approximately approximately 7 \u00d7 4 cm in size. The swelling caused buccal and lingual cortical expansion and the buccal plate was perforated in some areas ().\nThe CT revealed a well-defined multilocular radiolucent lesion extending from the lower right deciduous lateral incisor to the left deciduous second molar region causing bucco-lingual expansion and thinning of the buccal plate. The lesion also showed small calcified areas and multiple impacted permanent teeth (). Based on the clinical and radiographic findings, a presumptive preoperative diagnosis of odontogenic tumour was made with differential diagnosis of AFO, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumour and calcifying odontogenic cyst.\nIncisional biopsy was performed and the specimen was sent to the oral and maxillofacial pathology department for histopathological analysis. Macroscopically, the specimen was white in colour, measured 3 \u00d7 2.3 \u00d7 2\u2005cm in greatest dimension and was firm in consistency with irregular surface.\nMicroscopically, the lesion showed multiple follicles of proliferating odontogenic epithelium. The odontogenic epithelium showed peripheral tall columnar cells exhibiting nuclear palisading, hyperchromatism, and reversed polarity.

On general examination, the patient was apparently healthy. The medical history and family history were insignificant. No notable findings were recorded on extra-oral examination.\nIntra \u2013 oral examination revealed a solitary, well defined, roughly oval shaped gingival mass arising from the attached and free labial gingival margin covering two thirds portion of the crown of teeth 33 and 34 (Fig. ). It was a slow growing swelling which gradually progressed to its present size of 2 \u00d7 2 cm. The overlying mucosa was intact and the color was similar to the adjacent mucosa. Associated signs or symptoms such as pain, bleeding, discharge, numbness or fever were absent; oral hygiene was inadequate. The swelling was non-tender on palpation with firm consistency and smooth surface texture. Intraoral periapical radiograph (IOPA) of right mandibular anterior region was recorded. A minor arc shaped bone loss in relation to teeth 33 and 34 was demonstrated.\nBased on the clinico-radiographical findings, clinical diagnosis of pyogenic granulomas was established with differential diagnosis of peripheral ossifying fibroma, peripheral giant cell granuloma and fibrous epulis. The rare differential diagnosis include benign connective tissue tumors and peripheral odontogenic neoplasms.\nFollowing the routine blood examinations, the lesion was removed in toto under local anesthesia. The excised mass was sent for histopathological examination.\nGrossly, the specimen was roughly spheroidal in shape measuring 2 \u00d7 2 cm approximately and covered by a capsule with soft to firm consistency.

    "original_text": "A 46-year-old female presented to a community hospital emergency department with a one-day history of abdominal pain radiating to the right shoulder and light-headedness. Past medical history was significant for Myasthenia Gravis. The patient was hemodynamically stable, and physical examination was unremarkable other than abdominal tenderness to the right upper quadrant. Laboratory tests were significant for an elevation in ALT to 337 and AST to 140 and a positive D-dimer of 1.17. Based on nonspecific symptoms and the positive D-dimer, a CT chest was ordered to rule out pulmonary embolism.\nCT of the chest showed no evidence of thromboembolism however, due to some elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, a portal venous scan through the abdomen was undertaken. This examination revealed a very large heterogeneous low-density subcapsular collection, involving almost the entire right lobe of liver measuring 16 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 16 cm (). At the inferior aspect of the lesion, there was an area identified of slightly greater enhancement. There were multiple additional low-density lesions identified throughout the liver parenchyma in keeping with benign cysts. Upon the completion of the study, the working diagnosis was a ruptured hepatic adenoma.\nBased on the results of the CT and progressive tachycardia, the patient was booked for an emergency laparotomy. On examination the entire right side of the liver was grossly distended with subcapsular blood.

During the next cycle, ovulation was again induced using clomiphene citrate, and 5000 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was administered at day 25 after the start of this menstrual-like bleeding event. During hCG treatment, a total of two ovarian follicles measuring \u226516 mm, one in the right ovary and one in the left ovary were detected.\nThe second IUI was performed on day 26.

    "original_text": "A 38-year-old woman was referred to our institution for evaluation of a 6-month history of sore throat and left neck pain. The pain became intense enough to require narcotic pain control. Progressive odynophagia and dysphagia to solid food also developed. She had had a 4.5 kg weight loss before presentation. Physical examination of the head and neck region was normal, including fiberoptic visualization of the larynx and hypopharynx. A barium swallow study indicated a long, pedunculated intraluminal mass, originating from the upper esophagus and extending inferiorly below the level of the inferior pulmonary veins (). It was estimated that the mass was 23 cm long and 3 cm in diameter. With the presumptive diagnosis of an intraluminal lipoma, a flexible esophagoscopy was performed; it revealed a smooth mucosa-covered, pedunculated mass arising from the posterior aspect of the esophagus, below the cricopharyngeus, with an estimated vertical dimension of 21 cm. The inferior apex of the mass appeared ulcerated. Biopsies of the ulcerated region showed reactive squamous mucosa with candidal colonization.\nSubsequently, direct laryngopharyngoscopy was performed with a Weerda laryngoscope.

The patient was helmeted at the time of the crash and there was no reported loss of consciousness. He reported isolated right lower extremity pain without neurologic complaints.\nExam and diagnostics\nThis was an isolated injury with no clinical or radiographic evidence of intracranial, -thoracic, -abdominal, or -pelvic injury. A FAST exam (Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma) was performed prior to our orthopaedic exam, which demonstrated no signs of hemorrhage.\nInspection of the right lower extremity revealed two large wounds to the anterolateral and anteromedial tibial diaphysis. The anterolateral and anteromedial wounds measured approximately 20 cm and 12 cm in length, respectively. Both wounds exhibited gross contamination with road debris as well as exposed muscle and fracture fragments (Figure ). There was no clinical evidence of compartment syndrome. There were no sensory or motor deficits involving the superficial peroneal, deep peroneal, or tibial nerves. A strong dorsalis pedis pulse was palpable, however the posterior tibial pulse was unidentifiable on palpation or Doppler ultrasound. A computed tomography (CT) angiogram was obtained which demonstrated vascular stenosis of the posterior tibial artery at the level of the fracture. All hematologic and metabolic labs were within normal ranges.\nTime from the emergency department to the initial operative encounter\nDual antibiotic prophylaxis, consisting of cefazolin and gentamycin, was administered promptly upon arrival to the emergency department. Antibiotic administration was estimated to be within three hours from the time of injury. A brief bedside irrigation with 3 L of sterile saline was performed and the wounds were dressed with moist gauze.

The patient had been on prednisolone and methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis. He also had a past history of acute coronary syndrome 5 years previously; this was treated with coronary stent implantation followed by anticoagulant therapy. He additionally had a past history of a right pneumothorax 3 years previously that was presumptively caused by rupture of a subpleural rheumatoid nodule and successfully treated with conservative thoracic drainage. Regarding his present admission, the left pneumothorax did not resolve after 1 week of chest tube drainage. There were no bacterial pathogens present in the pleural effusion. We decided to perform pleurodesis because his left lung expanded well after chest drainage and he had some risks for pneumothorax surgery, as previously mentioned. The air leakage finally subsided after six times pleurodesis procedures (with a blood patch once, a talc slurry three times, and OK-432 (streptococcal preparation) two times) prior to discharge (Fig. b). However, he presented to our hospital 1 week after being discharged because the pneumothorax had asymptomatically relapsed (Fig. c).

However, according to the midwife's knowledge of the negative blood group (A-) of the mother and the mother not satisfied with the transfer of the baby and herself to the hospital, the midwife asked the mother to transfer the fetal placenta to the midwifery clinic on recommended conditions to check the fetal cord blood sample. Her husband brought the placenta to the midwifery clinic, and cord blood sampling was performed. Fortunately, the placenta was also checked for completeness and the midwife ensured that the placenta was completely out. The fetal blood sample was A +and there was a need to inject RhoGAM for the mother.

Vital signs at the time of presentation were stable. On physical examination, she appeared cachectic and dehydrated. Her abdomen was soft, non-tender with audible bowel sounds. Mild right lower quadrant tenderness was noted. Labs were significant for microcytic hypochromic anemia and urine analysis positive for leukocyte esterase. Liver function test was normal. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly. Abdominal US revealed mild ascites and dilated common bile duct to 1 cm. The patient was admitted to medical service with a diagnosis of dehydration, failure to thrive, and for work-up of an occult gastrointestinal malignancy. She was scheduled for EGD and colonoscopy by gastroenterology team. In addition to all of this, her CEA was 12.2 ng/ml (normal less than 3 ng/ml). While the patient was on the medical service, her hemoglobin dropped to 6.2 gm/dL requiring blood transfusions. During the second unit of blood transfusion, the patient became hypoxemic and tachypneic. She was transferred to Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) and subsequently intubated for acute respiratory failure. Chest X-ray at this point showed bilateral infiltrates, and the patient was started on IV antibiotics for possible pneumonia. The scheduled GI procedures were cancelled due to critical health status.
