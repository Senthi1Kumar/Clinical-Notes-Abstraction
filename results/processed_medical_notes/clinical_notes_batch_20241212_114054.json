Pain was especially on the right shoulder and was extending to the right wrist and hand. His past medical history was unremarkable with no trauma reference. He experienced no benefit from medical treatment. His complaints increased during the last 1.5 months. We admitted the patient to our clinic for further examination and treatment.\nAt physical examination, cervical neck movements were limited and painful in all four directions and there was local tenderness on the right side of C5 and C6 dermatomes. Muscular strengths were normal. There was no sensorial deficit. Deep tendon reflexes were all normal.

Her BMI was 38 (height 4 ft 11.5 inches, weight 188.2 pounds), and she had a lifelong history of morbid obesity and obesity-related comorbidities, including obstructive sleep apnea requiring a continuous positive airway pressure machine, an elevated hemoglobin A1c (5.8) and a fasting blood glucose increasing her risk of developing diabetes mellitus, and degenerative joint disease which significantly impacted her ability to exercise. The main challenges she identified in losing weight involved eating carbohydrate rich foods, overeating during meals and limited activity due to musculoskeletal pain. The patient had made multiple attempts to lose weight through commercial dieting programs but had been unsuccessful. The patient also completed a six-month medically supervised diet through her primary care provider, which also included working closely with a bariatric registered dietician, following a strict diet of about 1800 calories/day and performing modified exercise, about 120 minutes/week. Despite these intense medical weight loss efforts, she was unable to maintain a healthy weight. The patient was motivated to try bariatric surgery after she witnessed the significant weight loss success her daughters had from this intervention. Her greatest hope from the bariatric surgery was to be healthier and to alleviate her obesity-related comorbidities.\nThe patient\u2019s surgical history included cesarean section and evacuation of an ectopic pregnancy.

The patient had undergone maxillary molar restoration treatment 2 years earlier, after which she reported biting regularly on her buccal mucosa. On most occasions, the wound had healed within a week, so she had not sought medical treatment. An extraoral examination revealed no facial swelling or asymmetry. However, an intraoral examination revealed an area of diffuse swelling on the left buccal mucosa measuring about 15 mm \u00d7 30 mm and containing a papillary lesion with multiple red, blue, and clear pebble-like vesicles (Figure ). On palpation, the lesion was nontender and soft. The swelling had not expanded to the veins and was pulsatile. An orthopantomogram confirmed that the adjacent bone was intact. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a soft tissue mass with a clearly distinguishable outline of the buccinator muscle (Figure ). The lesion was surgically excised under local anesthesia with a margin of 3 mm and a depth of 2 mm via the inside surface of the fascia of the buccinator muscle. The outcome was favorable. Pathologic examination of the specimen revealed expanded lymphatic vessels lined by thin endothelial cells and containing lymphatic fluid.

Because the ascending aorta was unsuitable for arterial cannulation, the surgeon elected to perform axillary cannulation via the right subclavian artery with side graft anastomosis. The patient arrived to the operating room (OR) with nicardipine and esmolol infusions running through an 18-gauge peripheral intravenous (IV) line in the right antecubital (AC) fossa. Prior to induction of anesthesia, we disconnected the infusions from the right AC and administered medications though an 18-gauge IV in the left forearm. The patient also had a left radial arterial line (AL), and we placed the pulse oximeter and noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) cuff on the RUE. After intubation, we placed a right radial AL, and the surgeons placed a left femoral AL. All arterial pressures correlated closely. Additionally, a 9-French central line was placed in the right internal jugular vein. The patient was cleansed and draped for surgery with her arms tucked to her sides.\nShortly after the procedure began, the right radial AL tracing went flat, and the pulse oximeter waveform was lost. We attributed this to the surgeon partially clamping the right subclavian artery in preparation for arterial cannulation. We switched the pulse oximeter to the left hand and relied on the left radial and femoral AL for pressure readings. Just prior to arterial cannulation, we noted that the right radial pressure returned, although about 20 points lower than the left radial/femoral. Immediately after initiating CPB, the right radial mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased to 200 mm Hg, and left radial/femoral MAP decreased from 60 to 30 mmHg. The perfusionist alerted the surgeon about the high line pressures and decreased CPB flows. After a brief attempt to troubleshoot and adjust the cannula",

    "original_text": "A 56-year-old female with a prosthetic left wrist implanted 8 years before due to chronic polyarthritis presented herself to our emergency department with a massive painful swelling and signs of hand phlegmon (Figure 3a ). Her daily medication was methotrexate and prednisolone. Methrotrexate was paused, while prednisolone was reduced and the pain therapy adjusted by the pain therapist. We immediately performed a first debridement with relieving incisions. Daily wound lavage and antibiotic treatment were initiated. With no tangible improvement of the local wound signs and continuously increasing white blood cell count, we decided to remove the prosthetic wrist (Figure 3b ), stabilizing the hand by external fixation. After two more debridements and wound closure, the patient could be discharged 4 weeks later with external fixation and ongoing low dose prednisolone. After full recovery, the patient was hospitalized again for the removal of the external fixation and for autologous wrist arthrodesis by performing a free fibula flap to the left wrist (Figure 3c ). Once more, the wound healing was not adequate and both, staphylococcus and enteroccus could be verified within the wound. Antibiotic therapy was adjusted and additionally, we performed a gracilis flap to close the wound on the left wrist (Figure 3d ). However, the elevation area of the flap on the lower limb showed wound healing problems requiring a debridement and local skin grafting for wound closure.\nWith an overall hospitalization of more than 14 weeks, we could finally discharge the patient. 6 months after the last procedure was performed, again the patient was transferred to our hospital with the status of an acute sepsis and encephalitis with the left wrist being the focus of infection.

    "cleaned_text": "a 56-year-old female with a prosthetic left wrist implanted 8 years before due to chronic polyarthritis presented herself to our emergency department with a massive painful swelling and signs of hand phlegmon (figure 3a ). her daily medication was methotrexate and prednisolone. methrotrexate was paused, while prednisolone was reduced and the pain therapy adjusted by the pain therapist. we immediately performed a first debridement with relieving incisions. daily wound lavage and antibiotic treatment were initiated. with no tangible improvement of the local wound signs and continuously increasing white blood cell count, we decided to remove the prosthetic wrist (figure 3b ), stabilizing the hand by external fixation. after two more debridements and wound closure, the patient could be discharged 4 weeks later with external fixation and ongoing low dose prednisolone. after full recovery, the patient was hospitalized again for the removal of the external fixation and for autologous wrist arthrodesis by performing a free fibula flap to the left wrist (figure 3c ). once more, the wound healing was not adequate and both, staphylococcus and enteroccus could be verified within the wound. antibiotic therapy was adjusted and additionally, we performed a gracilis flap to close the wound on the left wrist (figure 3d ). however, the elevation area of the flap on the lower limb showed wound healing problems requiring a debridement and local skin grafting for wound closure.\nwith an overall hospitalization of more than 14 weeks, we could finally discharge the patient. 6 months after the last procedure was performed, again the patient was transferred to our hospital with the status of an acute sepsis and encephalitis with the left wrist being the focus of infection. as life-saving procedure the left hand needed to be amputated at the distal forearm. finally, the patient recovered from both sepsis and encephalitis and could be discharged from our clinic to rehab.",

There was no trauma remembered or pain, family history showed no conspicuous eye disorders, no infections, or abnormalities in pregnancy or birth, and no genetic disorders were known. General pediatric physical examination was normal for all systems. The parents had Turkish origin, and history of parental consanguinity is known.\nThe clinical examination under general anesthesia showed a blue discoloration of sclera in both eyes. Intraocular pressure was within normal levels (8 mmHg in the left eye and 10 mmHg in the right eye). The posterior segment was examined by standardized echography and showed no retinal anomalies or retinal detachment. Axial length was 21.7 mm in the right eye and 22.1 mm in the left eye, suggesting myopic eyes. Retinoscopy in cycloplegia showed \u22124.0 diopter and astigmatism of \u22124.5 at 168 degrees on the right side. Retinoscopy in the left eye was not possible.\nThe cornea of the left eye revealed complete corneal edema with obvious stromal and bullous epithelial keratopathy. The epithelial layer was closed. Central corneal thickness was 745 \u03bcm in the left eye and the mean value of thickness peripherally was 550 \u03bcm as measured by ultrasound pachymetry (PalmScan AP 2000, Micro Medical Devices, USA).\nThe right eye showed corneal thinning with a central thickness of 212 \u03bcm and a peripheral thickness of 308 \u03bcm with corneal astigmatism in topography (\u22124.5D at 169 degrees). The inferior paracentral cornea showed a deep stromal scar with the remaining corneal surface clear.

Initially he was taken to a local hospital where fluid resuscitation was done and he was transferred to our centre on inotropic support for further management. Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy was done in view of hematemesis, which was normal. Patient was evaluated further with computed tomography (CT) abdominal angiography, which revealed no evidence of any mucosal or submucosal pathology in relation to the UGI tract. Patient developed two more episodes of hematemesis one on third and the other on seventh day of hospital admission. Repeat UGI endoscopy revealed fresh blood trickling from nasopharynx and oropharynx and clotted blood in esophagus and stomach []. In view of fresh blood in nasopharynx, CT angiography of neck and paranasal air sinuses was performed. The sphenoid sinus and posterior ethmoidal air cells showed areas of hyperdensities indicating hemorrhage. In addition, CT angiography revealed a large saccular aneurysm within right sphenoid sinus arising from cavernous ICA []. The aneurysm was projecting medially into sphenoid sinus with breach in the lateral sinus wall. Digital subtraction angiography revealed a wide necked saccular aneurysm arising from medial wall of proximal cavernous ICA measuring 17 \u00d7 15 mm with its neck measuring 8 mm. It is projecting medially and anteriorly with teat in its medial aspect. Manual cross-compression test done during angiography showed good cross-flow across Anterior Communicating Artery (AcomA) into right middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA) branches with venous delay of less than 2 s in right cerebral circulation [].

She had noticed the pigmented lesions in her oral cavity 3 years ago and till the beginning of the treatment no major change in the oral cavity was observed by the patient. Oral examination revealed multiple, painless brown-black pigmentation, on the buccal mucosa, lower lip and posterior of the palate, bilaterally (). No cutaneous or fingernail lesions were observed. She was systemically healthy and was not on any medication. She was neither a smoker nor a habitual drinker of alcohol. There was no family history of abnormal mucocutaneous pigmentation.\nLaboratory investigation results, including a full blood count, hematinic levels, serum chemistry and inflammatory markers, were all within normal range. The patient underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, as well as a colonoscopy, which revealed no evidence of polyps. To rule out Addisons disease, the serum cortisol and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) levels were measured and the values were normal.

Although the patient reported adherence to the prescribed medication regimen, she developed heart failure with hypotension and oliguria the next day. Coronary angiography performed under intra-aortic balloon pumping demonstrated total occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). Subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention achieved successful revascularization of LAD. The patient recovered steadily and gradually. However, four days later, her condition deteriorated suddenly and she went into shock. Her echocardiography results revealed cardiac tamponade with substantial pericardial effusion. Pericardiocentesis was performed, resulting in massive continuous drainage, and she was referred to us for emergency surgery.\nThe patient was markedly cyanotic and in cardiogenic shock with systolic blood pressure of 70 mm Hg. A large dose of dopamine had been administered. She was intubated immediately, and the results of blood gas analysis showed marked metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.251 and a base excess of \u221213.2 mmol/l. Emergency surgery was undertaken via a median sternotomy. Upon opening the pericardium, a blowout rupture of the LV free wall was found. A large volume of fresh blood was expelled rapidly from the tear at the LV base, between LAD and its diagonal branch. We were unable to measure the size of the tear, because we had to cover the area quickly with TachoComb\u00ae sheets to achieve hemostasis. The LV apex was dyskinetic. A total of three TachoComb\u00ae sheets (5 \u00d7 5 cm each) were applied to the bleeding point and the surrounding area of fragile necrotic tissue.

At 1 month of age, he developed a wet cough without any other symptoms. He was followed by his primary care provider (PCP), and no treatment was given at the time. His symptoms continued on and off until 1 year of age. At 1 year, the mother noticed increased frequency of productive cough, lack of appetite, and poor weight gain. His weight-for-age percentile ranged from 0.3 to 5.0. His stools were reportedly normal. He had no excessive sweating. He was referred to an outside asthma/allergy specialist for evaluation of asthma. He was prescribed budesonide without any improvement. He had frequent pharyngitis and otitis media that were treated with oral antibiotics that reportedly helped treat acute infection, but the cough persisted. He was also prescribed a H2 blocker for possible gastroesophageal reflux disease, but no improvement in symptoms was noted. Family history was negative for CF.\nAt 30 months of age, he was seen by his PCP for one week of cough and fever. He was treated with amoxicillin. His symptoms continued to worsen despite oral antibiotics, and he had two episodes of small-volume hemoptysis. He was subsequently admitted for community-acquired pneumonia and influenza B. Chest X-ray showed diffuse ill-defined opacities in the perihilar area and diffuse bronchiectasis. During the hospitalization, pediatric pulmonary consult was obtained.

His medical history was remarkable for chronic heart failure, moderate mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. He was undergoing treatment with apixaban and pilsicainide for atrial fibrillation. He was severely hypoxic (SpO2: 80 under O2 15 L/min by oxygen mask) and hypotensive (systolic blood pressure: 80 mmHg) on admission. In the emergency department, we performed intubation into the right main bronchus through guided bronchoscopy; this was followed immediately by right side one-lung ventilation as portable chest radiography showed consolidation in the left upper lung. Bronchoscopy showed that the trachea was almost obstructed by haemorrhage and haematoma. He experienced cardiopulmonary arrest immediately after the airway was maintained. However, spontaneous circulation was restored by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Contrast computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an aortic aneurysm at the aortic arch, which penetrated the upper lobe of the left lung (Fig. A,B). We suspected that it would be difficult to perform emergent surgery because of the patient\u2019s poor general condition. Furthermore, we believed that there was no indication for endovascular stenting due to the following reasons: (1) the root of the left brachiocephalic artery was close to the penetrating portion of the aneurysm, at a distance of 12 mm. Thus, there might have been a high risk of obstructing blood flow to the brachiocephalic artery; (2) a risk of aortic injury might have been induced by stenting because the aortic arch was highly calcified. He was admitted to the intensive care unit, and we controlled blood pressure using nicardipine and discontinued anticoagulation therapy and performed platelet and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion for haemostasis. Bleeding from the APF decreased gradually due to astriction by haematoma.

Physical examination revealed decreased breath sound, increased tactile fremitus on the affected side, and dullness to percussion of the left lung. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse thickening and calcification of the pleura on both sides, pleural effusion and atelectasis on the left side ( and ). After hospitalization, the patient received a thoracentesis on November 26, 2018. The pleural fluid was bloody exudate, and no tumor cells were found in the exfoliated cells of the pleural fluid sample. According to the imaging findings, we tracked the patient\u2019s occupational history and learned that the patient had a history of close contact with asbestos for 30 years. The diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma needs to be ruled out clinically, and it is planned to be transferred to surgery for open pleural biopsy. At the same time, laboratory examination revealed elevated plasma D-dimer (26190Ug/L), combined with the patient\u2019s chest pain, dyspnea symptoms, and a large amount of pleural effusion, the possibility of pulmonary embolism should be considered. Then, the computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed for the patient, and the results showed that there was embolism in the right pulmonary artery branch (). After the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, we immediately used anticoagulant drugs for the patient. Because anticoagulants are easy to cause massive hemorrhage, no open pleural biopsy was performed.

CT scan and MRI of the head disclosed enlargement of the entire ventricular system and a calcification in the right occipital lobe (). Insertion of external ventricular drainage resulted in dramatic improvement of consciousness and visual recovery. Her ventricular CSF biology was normal (protein, 0.4 g/L; leukocyte count, 12/mm3). Her body temperature rapidly rose to 40\u2103 and a lumbar puncture was performed. The CSF level of protein was 8.5 g/L, and the leukocyte count was 680/mm3, among which 61% were lymphocytes and 18% were eosinophils. These discrepancies between ventricular and lumbar CSF samples led to MRI of the spine, which disclosed a heterogeneous mass located in the cauda equina from L4 to S2. There was neither leptomeningeal enhancement nor subarachnoid cysts suggestive of arachnoiditis at the thoracic, cervical, or cranial levels (). Since there was no other obvious explanation for the hydrocephalus (no obstructive lesion of the intracerebral CSF pathways nor at the craniocervical junction, and no abnormality in the spinal subarachnoid spaces at superior levels), this lumbosacral mass was considered to be responsible for the hydrocephalus, due to obstruction of the subarachnoid spaces by the mass itself and/or surrounding arachnoiditis. Surgery performed via a lumbosacral laminectomy allowed subtotal removal of an intradural, poorly limited, pearly white mass with small cystic formations surrounding the nerve roots, with thickening of the arachnoid layer.

He was severely hypoxic (SpO2: 80 under O2 15 L/min by oxygen mask) and hypotensive (systolic blood pressure: 80 mmHg) on admission. In the emergency department, we performed intubation into the right main bronchus through guided bronchoscopy; this was followed immediately by right side one-lung ventilation as portable chest radiography showed consolidation in the left upper lung. Bronchoscopy showed that the trachea was almost obstructed by haemorrhage and haematoma. He experienced cardiopulmonary arrest immediately after the airway was maintained. However, spontaneous circulation was restored by cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

We suspected that it would be difficult to perform emergent surgery because of the patient\u2019s poor general condition. Furthermore, we believed that there was no indication for endovascular stenting due to the following reasons: (1) the root of the left brachiocephalic artery was close to the penetrating portion of the aneurysm, at a distance of 12 mm. Thus, there might have been a high risk of obstructing blood flow to the brachiocephalic artery; (2) a risk of aortic injury might have been induced by stenting because the aortic arch was highly calcified. He was admitted to the intensive care unit, and we controlled blood pressure using nicardipine and discontinued anticoagulation therapy and performed platelet and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion for haemostasis. Bleeding from the APF decreased gradually due to astriction by haematoma.

The pain was moderate (VAS 5/10). No sphincter-related symptoms were observed.

He had recently quit smoking and denied alcohol use but actively used other recreational drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, and methamphetamine. He was unemployed. He had no known other medical co-morbidities and was taking no other medications prior to developing AA. The etiology of AA was felt to be idiopathic because he had no improvement after an initial trial of sobriety. AA improved following immunosuppressive therapy and, although human leukocyte antigen typing was performed, a subsequent bone marrow transplant was deferred not only because of the medical therapeutic response but also due to his ongoing recreational drug use. Although he was no longer transfusion dependent a month after starting immunosuppressive therapy, his treatment compliance waned overtime due to regular ongoing recreational drug use of cocaine and methamphetamines. He routinely used unsterilized tap water for illicit drug injections, but he denied other exposure to fresh or salt water sources at home or in the community.\nOn presentation to the emergency department he was not in distress, with a heart rate of 90 bpm and a blood pressure of 116/59. Severe pallor was noted upon examination, as well as a petechial rash and mild ecchymoses (Fig",

She is the first child of a consanguineous (second-degree relatives) couple. Both parents are healthy and have never had fractures. During her first year of life, she had delayed motor development and growth failure. At one year of age, she could not sit by herself and weighed 7.5 kg (< 3rd centile). She presented to our hospital at 14 months of age with fractures of both femora without a history of significant trauma. She was found to have ptosis of both eyes with normal teeth but no blue sclerae. She was small for her age. Her weight was 7.8 kg (3rd centile) and her length was 68 cm (< 3rd centile). Skeletal survey showed diffuse osteopenia, multiple healed fractures of the right humoral shaft, both tibiae and fibulae. Spine radiograph showed flattening and indentation of vertebral bodies (Fig. ). A diagnosis of OI was made and intravenous bisphosphonate therapy (pamidronate 1 mg/kg/dose for 3 days) was initiated and given every 3 months. However, she sustained 1\u20132 long bone fractures per year from minor trauma. She required multiple corrective osteotomies to correct her deformities. At the last follow-up, she was 14 years old, weighing 20 kg. She could not walk due to her long bone deformity (Fig. ). Remarkably, although she was in a special education class due to physical disabilities, her cognition was appropriate for age. She could talk fluently and do mathematics properly.\nPrenatally, her younger sister was found to have a dilated fourth ventricle by an ultrasonography.

The lesion became more prominent on movement of wrist. There was a history of similar growth in the father. No abnormality was detected on general physical examination. Local area examination revealed a 3 \u00d7 3 cm, soft to firm, hemispherical, non-tender, mobile lesion on the medial aspect of right wrist []. Clinically, a diagnosis of lipoma was made and confirmed by FNAC. The patient was not open to any surgical intervention and was given the option of injection lipolysis. After discussing the possible side effects like hyperpigmentation, skin loss, prolonged pain, swelling, or tenderness, late onset hives or itching and skin contour irregularities in detail, an informed written consent for three sessions at 6-8 weeks gap was taken.\nThe lesion was cleaned and draped. The area was divided into small grids (1.5 cm apart) []. Solution of phosphatidyl choline and deoxycholate (50 mg/ml) was filled in insulin syringes (4 injections of 16 units of formula). The pinch and pull technique was used. The lipoma was pulled away from the underlying structures and four units were injected in each of four grids (total of 16 units). Care was taken not to inject any material while withdrawing the needle to avoid any intradermal deposition of the drug. The injections were not perceived as painful by the patient. Immediately after the injections there was swelling, redness and burning sensation which persisted for around half an hour []. No external compression was used and gradually the swelling settled. In the next 48 h, the lesion shrunk to half of its original size and disappeared completely within next 3 weeks, after the first injection itself. The patient is under follow up for the last 9 months with no evidence of any recurrence [].",
