In the four months leading to the patient's presentation to the hospital, he had increasingly frequent and intense hallucinations as well as paranoid beliefs that usually occurred when he was driving. He believed people driving in other cars and pedestrians were trying to harm him. He began hearing congruent persecutory hallucinations while driving the car and made dangerous and strange driving maneuvers. These episodes of paranoia occurred in 15-20-minute intervals, lasted for a few minutes, and were accompanied by hallucinations. He was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit as he posed a danger to himself and others while in his state of psychosis.\nThe patient had a prior medical history that included hypertension and chronic kidney disease. He denied any past or current use of alcohol or other illicit substances. He had a prior psychiatric history in which he reported paranoid delusions since the age of 15. His paranoid beliefs centered around people in his family and arbitrary strangers he met who he believed were plotting to hurt him. The patient was on haloperidol 10 mg PO daily that managed his paranoid beliefs throughout his adult life. He worked successfully as paralegal, raised a family, and retired from work without any significant psychiatric episodes.\nUpon mental status examination, he exhibited significant psychomotor retardation; however, his gait was steady. His affect was blunted. His thought content was notable for paranoid beliefs. A cognitive assessment utilizing the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) screening tool revealed a score of 20/30 while a MMSE revealed a score of 21/30 consistent with moderate cognitive impairment.

The patient was intubated in view of poor score on Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). He was hemodynamically stable. On clinical examination, the patient had bilateral decreased air entry and positive chest compression. There were no abdominal signs. On focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) there was minimal free fluid in the abdomen. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of thorax and abdomen showed bilateral hemopneumothorax and a grade III liver laceration.

CPS found the knife, resulting in her involuntary psychiatric hospitalization. On evaluation, the child also reported that this was not the first time her mother physically abused her. She also stated her mother often called her derogatory names.\nUpon obtaining collateral information from the mother, she admitted to disciplining her daughter. She said she hit her with her bare hand first, but her daughter continued to talk back to her. She then hit her with a belt out of anger. Contrary to the child's statement, the mother claimed it was the first time she hit her daughter with a belt. She also stated that her daughter often verbalized suicidal statements when she did not get her way.\nOn physical examination, the patient appeared as stated age with fair grooming. Multiple cord-shaped and belt-buckle-shaped bruises were found on the child's arms and legs. She was calm and cooperative although mildly guarded. She presented with poor eye contact and some psychomotor retardation. Her speech was slowed and low in volume. She reported feeling sad and fearful with congruent affect. Her thought process was logical and linear. Thought content included fear of her mother and suicidal intent and plan as above.

Two days later MRI of the brain was done which revealed subdural fluid collections over the bilateral convexities and SAH in the parietal and occipital lobes. There were prominent cortical veins but no obvious CVT. At this point the etiology of the headache was unclear as the head CT during the initial ED visit was negative for any subdural or SAH. Because of venous engorgement, a cerebral venogram was done and was negative for venous sinus thrombosis. A four-vessel angiogram was performed to investigate the cause of SAH which revealed a 1.8 \u00d7 1.6 mm right ophthalmic artery aneurysm (). Rupture of this ophthalmic artery aneurysm was presumed to be the cause of SAH and headaches. It was stented and coiled.

He was the first-born child to unrelated healthy parents, born at 38 weeks of gestation after an unremarkable pregnancy. His birth weight was 3.5 kg, and meconium was passed on the first day of life. The patient had no history of meconium ileus or diabetes mellitus and lacked family history of CF. Tracing back his medical history, the patient was formula feeding but failure to thrive with a weight of 6.8 kg at the age of 8 months and had intermittent diarrhea. For further evaluation of the condition of growth and development, the patient was taken to a local hospital at the age of 8 months, and received complete blood count and liver function tests. And the results indicated liver involvement with slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) with values of 78 and 82 U/L, respectively. The patient suffered from recurrently and slightly elevated ALT levels ranging from 70 to 92 U/L and AST levels ranging from 80 to 90 U/L. In addition, the common etiologies that easily lead to increased levels of ALT and AST were also excluded, such as cytomegalovirus and hepatitis B virus infection. Initially, these symptoms were not paid enough attention by the physicians or parents because the elevated levels of ALT and AST can recover to normal levels automatically without treatment or through the injection of magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate before four years of age.\nPhysical examination for the patient at the age of 4 years showed a weigh of 16.5 kg with a height of 104 cm. The patient had a BMI of 15.3, which was in the 50th percentile for his age. The physical examination also revealed tachypnea and a barrel-shaped chest. The liver was palpable ~2 cm below",

He had a medical history of limited-disease small cell lung cancer with tracheal stenosis; a tracheal stent procedure had been performed 8 years ago (Fig. ). During the preoperative assessment, a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed that a part of the tracheal stent placed between the main bronchus and the main right bronchus had penetrated the esophagus (Fig. ). Endoscopic examination of the upper digestive tract revealed the part of the tracheal stent in the esophagus (Fig. ). The patient did not experience recurrence of lung cancer or show symptoms of narrowing of the respiratory tract.\nWe needed to plan the anesthetic management of this patient, especially the intraoperative respiratory management. We planned general-epidural anesthesia via spontaneous breathing because we were concerned that an increase in the airway pressure due to positive pressure ventilation may cause mediastinal emphysema.\nAn epidural catheter was placed into the epidural space between L3 and L4 and 10 ml of 0.75% ropivacaine was administered to induce analgesia under level Th6. After preoxygenation with 100% oxygen, general anesthesia was induced rapidly using 0.025 mg of fentanyl and 60 mg of propofol, but without the use of a muscle relaxant, which resulted in the loss of consciousness. Spontaneous breathing was maintained and anesthesia was deepened using 4% sevoflurane via laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion (ProSeal type, #4) without manual bag mask ventilation. Anesthesia was maintained using 2% sevoflurane and intermittent administration of 0.375% ropivacaine through the epidural catheter.\nAn open colectomy was performed in the lithotomy position.

Physical examination showed an abdomen with a scar after median laparotomy with a palpable tender mass in the upper right quadrant with positive Murphy's sign and rebound tenderness. Laboratory blood tests revealed a leukocytosis of 22.7 \u00d7 109/L, C-reactive protein of 48 mg/L and normal kidney and liver function tests. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) scan showed a clearly enlarged gallbladder with a thickened wall of 7 mm (Figure ), with fluid supra- and sub-hepatically (Figure ). Free air within the gallbladder wall was not seen. She was admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.\nPercutaneous drainage of the gallbladder was considered because of her age and comorbidity, but because of her rapid clinical deterioration we decided to perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy instead. Laparoscopy was performed and revealed a strongly hydropic and fully necrotic gallbladder, with necrosis extending into the cystic duct (Figure ). The gallbladder was not embedded in the liver, but was hanging from the cystic duct and artery. Further exploration showed a two-fold torsion of the gallbladder around the cystic duct (Figure ). A cholecystectomy was performed. (See Additional file for further imaging of peroperative findings). As the critical level of safety was obtained, with both the cystic and hepatic duct clearly visible, leaving a drain was not considered mandatory.

After the swelling subsided, he underwent right tibia fracture intramedullary internal fixation. Two weeks after the operation, the patient was able to walk with double crutches without load, and was able to walk without crutches and with some load 3 months after the operation. However, the patient complained of pain in his right lower extremity, especially when moving downhill or down stairs, and experienced a limping gait and obvious tenderness at the fracture end. Three years after originally presenting at Lhasa Hospital, the patient was experiencing persistent pain in the right lower extremity, and his daily activities were severely affected. Thus, he was re-diagnosed with nonunion of the right tibial fracture after internal fixation (Fig. ). The main causes of the nonunion of the fracture were considered to be the excessively thin intramedullary nails and unstable fixation of the fracture. The operation was repeated with replacement of the crude intramedullary nails and grafting of iliac bone (Fig. ). Three months after the operation, the tibial fracture had failed to heal, and further surgical treatment was performed. The proximal locking screw of the intramedullary nail was removed with an expectation to eliminate the stress shielding effect and to promote fracture healing by increasing the microdynamic force while retaining the static interlocking nail. Five months after the operation, the patient abandoned the crutches and was able to walk with a heavy load. Nevertheless, 2 years after the operation, active pain of the right leg persisted with some tenderness around the fracture, especially when moving downhill or down stairs.

He presented to the spinal cord injury unit after a cauda equina syndrome developed following lumbar spine surgery. Due to his previous UC history, the standard surveillance of urothelial carcinoma was used to investigate for recurrence. A cytology was obtained and showed atypical cells in groups. The initial office flexible cystoscopy demonstrated a noninvasive appearing UC covering approximately 50% of his pendulous urethra with frondular lesions. The prostatic and membranous urethra were spared. The patient was taken to the operating room for cystourethroscopy under anesthesia, biopsies and upper urinary tract evaluation. The upper urinary tracts were negative for lesions on retrograde pyelogram and bladder and urethral biopsies were obtained with similar pathology as seen on office cystoscopy. On pathology, the biopsies showed low-grade superficial urothelial carcinoma (pTa) with a small focus of high-grade carcinoma []. Surgical options were then discussed and the patient wanted a bladder sparing minimally invasive surgery. Therefore, the patient was taken back to the operating room for a second look TURBT and a staged fulguration of urothelial carcinoma with the holmium laser [Figures and ]. Using holmium:YAG laser vaporization through a 21-Fr cystoscope, the lesions in the pendulous urethra were ablated using a 600 \u03bcm fiber with settings of 8 Hz and 1.0 Joules (8 Watts). Only one half of the urethra was treated for fear of urethral stricture. A total time of 20 minutes was taken for the procedure with minimal discomfort postoperatively.

The patient had been originally subjected to a routine blood check up, which revealed mildly elevated transaminase levels. He was then referred for an abdominal U/S and eventually for a CT scan on an outpatient basis. Both revealed a large, well circumscribed mass of 6.8 cm in diameter, which seemed to be in direct contact with the head of the pancreas and the inferior vena cava (Figure ). A subsequent MRI of the abdomen showed the mass to measure about 7.3 cm, to have irregular borders and to be located posterolaterally to the pancreatic head. The inferior vena cava was located directly behind the mass, and seemed to be slightly displaced by the tumor. The portal vein was located directly above the mass. Both these vessels did not appear to be directly invaded by the mass.\nEndoscopic ultrasound scan was performed which allowed FNA of the mass. The cytology revealed cells morphologically and immunogistologically indicative of a neuroendocrine pancreatic neoplasm. Subsequently, the patient was referred to our hospital for further surgical and possible antiproliferative therapy.\nOn physical examination the patient was found to manifest periodic choreo - athetosic movements that had appeared in the 3 months that preceded the diagnosis of his pancreatic tumor, to together with polyarthralgia of his limbs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 large joints.

There was no specific bleeding tendency on the serologic test and he had no history of anticoagulant medication use. There was no loosening or malalignment of the prosthesis on simple radiographs. We diagnosed the patient as having refractory hemarthrosis because he did not respond to conservative treatments with eight times of repetitive joint aspiration.\nInterventional angiography was performed, and the vascular blush pattern was observed in the inferior lateral genicular artery, which was confirmed as a bleeding site, so selective embolization was performed (). However, selective embolization to the inferior lateral genicular artery failed due to the overlap between the entry of the selecting branch and the femoral component. So, we diagnosed it as refractory hemarthrosis and planned an arthroscopic procedure to identify and treat the bleeding sites.\nThe arthroscopic procedure was performed.

Chest CT did not reveal any pulmonary metastasis, thus allowing the final staging as cT3aN0M0 (Figure ). On the preoperative imaging evaluation, there was no evidence of the invasion of the vena cava, which was medially dislocated, but significant collateral circulation was present. Due to the characteristic appearance of the tumor at imaging scans, pre-operative biopsy was not performed. The patient signed the informed consent prior to publication of this case.\nFollowing the preparation for standard transperitoneal right radical nephrectomy, the surgical intervention was performed in general anesthesia with orotracheal intubation by pararectal prolonged right subcostal approach. One of the main issues during the surgery was the difficult dissection of the renal pedicle, due to the significant collateral vessels and tumoral invasion. Due to this fact, the surgical strategy was modified. First, circumferential dissection of the tumor was performed. The dissection continued towards the renal hilum, where it was observed that the tumor encompassed the renal vessels and a significant segment of the IVC. Therefore, the next step was to isolate the IVC using vessel loops. During the medial dissection of the tumor, the injury of the infra-renal vena cava occurred. In order to perform hemostasis, rapid excision of the remaining tumor and further isolation of IVC was performed.

Examination revealted that the patient\u2019s airway was clear, but there was a bilateral absence of breath sounds and hyperresonance on percussion. The patient was hemodynamically stable. He was intubated due to respiratory failure. Bilateral chest tubes were inserted based on a high clinical suspicion of pneumothorax. Thereafter, the patient developed a large subcutaneous emphysema, despite the fact that the chest tubes were functioning with his severe air leakage. Past medical history was unremarkable with no previous formal depression diagnosis. A social history check showed daily marijuana and tobacco use.\nThe patient was sent for a head, neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis CT scan. The scan revealed giant bullous emphysema on the superior lobes bilaterally, right pneumothorax with a collapsed lung, along with multiple rib fractures, and lung emphysema (, ). A hip dislocation was detected, and closed reduction was performed.\nThe patient was sent to the ICU, where he improved clinically after conservative treatment with continuous negative pressure suction using a 20 cm water column. He was extubated after 48 h, with persistence of the air leakage on both chest tubes.\nOn the day following extubation, he developed hypoxia associated with disorientation and agitation and had to be intubated again. Hypoxia was postulated from pulmonary contusion and ventilator-associated pneumonia worsening his already baseline compromised lung. He developed sepsis, and subsequently acute kidney injury with the need for dialysis.\nDuring the course of 5 days, the patient presented hypoxia and a severe mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis, despite the use vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Three hour after injection of radiotracer, the whole-body bone scan was performed which revealed a photopenic defect in vertex of skull in anterior projection []. In view of history of lung malignancy, it was initially diagnosed as lytic lesion representing skeletal metastases. However, on careful evaluation of whole-body image in posterior projection, no such defect was noted []. On further evaluation, we observed increased tracer uptake in the edge of static chest and pelvis images in anterior projections [Figure and ]. However, again spot views of same regions in posterior projections were within normal limits [Figure and ]. These discrepancies caught our attention, and we suspected these to be artifactual. Suspecting nonuniformity, we moved the patient toward the central field of view of the detector to eliminate the artifact from images and noticed no such defect in the skull [Figure and ]. We immediately performed the intrinsic uniformity test with 99m Tc point source for the anterior detector, which showed the increased value with a similar pattern of artifact as appeared in patient images toward useful field of view (UFOV) []. Surprisingly, the artifact did not appear in the daily quality control test performed in the morning. We informed the service engineer about the incident. The engineer found malfunctioning of two PMTs toward Y axis in the anterior head of the gamma camera. On the next day, service engineer opened anterior head of gamma camera and replaced the malfunctioning PMTs located in the border. After the service engineers rebuilt the head, tuning was performed to ensure that PMTs voltage gain was within limits.

She was initially seen and treated by an orthopaedic surgeon from an outside facility with physical therapy, followed by a left knee arthrocentesis to rule out infection. The aspirate demonstrated proteinaceous fluid with few benign inflammatory and epithelial cells and cultures were found to be negative. Due to the increasing pain, gait instability, and discomfort, coupled with lack of relief by the current measures, she was referred to the orthopaedic surgery clinic at our institution for further evaluation.\nAt her initial visit, the patient reported steadily increasing, sharp pain localized to her left knee joint with associated swelling that worsened with ambulation and prolonged standing and lacked improvement with conservative management. Her day-to-day activities were becoming restricted secondary to the pain and she reported occasional falls due to the perceived instability of her knee joint. Physical exam revealed a mild antalgic gait and tenderness over her proximal tibia. An in-house X-ray was notable for an increase in size and number of osteochondral bodies in the left suprapatellar recess with a left joint effusion and \u201clysis and subsidence of the tibial component and decreased thickness, suggestive of loosening and wear\u201d (Figures -). The patient then underwent a bilateral knee bone scan which confirmed the tentative diagnosis of implant loosening with polyethylene wear and instability. The patient was counseled on her treatment options, including surgical and non-surgical management, and elected to undergo revision surgery of her left knee arthroplasty.\nA classical anterior approach to the knee was made through the patient\u2019s previous scar.

She was vertiginous after coming out of the water and required admission to a tertiary hospital emergency department and was discharged with a diagnosis of vestibular neuronitis.\nShe continued to experience symptoms of vertigo, difficulty focusing, dizziness and a feeling of falling to the right for over 4 months and saw various healthcare providers with no cause found. She had a plain computerized tomography of the head without contrast that was reported as normal. Eventually she was referred to a neuro-ophthalmologist for the complaint of \"difficulty focusing\" and automated perimetry showed a small incomplete congruous homonymous quadrantanopia (Figure ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a left occipital infarct. There were multiple areas of bilateral posterior circulation infarcts involving the cerebellum, and right thalamus (Figures ). Echocardiography, carotid ultrasound and hypercoagulable screens were negative. A computerized tomography (CT) angiogram showed a right vertebral dissection with both thinning and a double lumen of the vertebral artery (Figure ). The patient was placed on anticoagulant therapy with no further neurological symptoms.\nVertebral artery dissection (VAD) is a potentially fatal condition where disruption of the vessel wall results in thromboembolism and subsequent ischemic stroke. It may occur following neck injury resulting in neck extension, flexion or rotation [-]. Symptoms include neck or head pain, partial Horner's syndrome and those of ischemic stroke in its involved territory []. The presentation may vary from case to case. The patient likely sustained the VAD following minor neck torsion injury during swimming, followed by a shower of emboli causing multiple posterior circulation infarcts.

    "original_text": "A 28-year-old man with severe aortic regurgitation underwent aortic valve replacement with a mechanical prosthetic valve about 10 years ago. At the time of this operation the ascending aorta was slightly dilated and measured as 3.4 cm. An ascending aortic aneurysm was suspected with chest X-ray in routine follow-up of the patient who had not been controlled until that time (). Echocardiography and chest-enhanced computed tomography revealed a giant ascending aortic aneurysm about 16 cm in diameter with intact aortic arch (). Prosthetic valve function and other cardiac structures were assessed as normal with two-dimensional and color Doppler examination. An elective operation was planned for the aortic aneurysm. The operation was performed under cardiopulmonary bypass, established by cannulation of the right femoral artery and right atrium via the right femoral vein. Cardiopulmonary bypass was started before sternotomy to decompress the aneurysm. Chest was opened with a median resternotomy. A giant ascending aortic aneurysm was occupying most of the space in the pericardial cavity, with the heart lying posteriorly (). The aortic arch was not found to be involved. After careful dissection of the aneurysm we were able to cross clamp the aorta proximally to the brachiocephalic trunk. After cross-clamping, the aorta was opened and cardioplegic solution was infused into each coronary artery. The previously implanted valve prosthesis was intact and assessment of valve functions was normal. Aneurysm of the ascending aorta was resected leaving the functional old mechanical prosthesis in place and we implanted a 34-mm Hemashield woven graft (Meadox Medicals Inc, Oakland, NJ, USA), associated with the left and right coronary artery button implantation. Distal anastomosis of the aortic graft was performed under aortic cross clamp (Figures and ). Aortic clamping time was 117 minutes.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen and pelvis revealed thickening of the transverse colon wall. Colonoscopy showed an ulcerated tumor in the transverse colon, and histological analysis indicated moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were normal, and no sites of distant metastasis were reported on preoperative examination. She underwent a laparoscopic extended right hemicolectomy using the non-touch isolation technique. Histopathological examination of the specimen revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading the subserosal layer with low venous invasion (v1) and no lymphatic invasion (ly0). The surgical margins were negative. A total of 92 lymph nodes were removed, of which none showed metastases. The tumor was diagnosed as stage IIA (T3, N0, M0) according to the International Union Against Cancer tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) classification (7th edition) []. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was on regular follow-up every 3 months without adjuvant chemotherapy.\nFifteen months after her colectomy, a CT scan demonstrated a tumor in the antero-lateral rectal wall that was 20 mm in diameter, and a right ovarian tumor that was 25 mm in diameter (Fig. ). The ovarian tumor was a cystic mass with a solid component on magnetic resonance imaging (Fig. ). Colonoscopy revealed a superficial elevated lesion in the middle rectum that was shown by histological examination to be moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (Fig. ). Serum CEA levels were normal. These findings were indicative of rectal cancer with ovarian metastasis, or double primary cancer of the rectum and ovary. A diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy detected no disseminated peritoneal metastases or liver metastases. Intraoperative cytological examination of the peritoneal lavage was negative for carcinoma.

Laboratory results came out normal, with no signs of infection or positive tumor markers. Radiological examination showed no apparent abnormalities as well. An MRI was obtained, and a tumor mass in the intradural region level of T10\u2013T12 was found (). At that time, the patient was offered surgery, but she chose to undergo treatment with a bone setter. Around two months later, the patient returned to hospital with profound weakness on her lower extremity. Her physical examination revealed paresis from her thigh on both lower extremities grade 1-2/5 power in left and right lower limbs, respectively. Increased patellar reflexes were found on both limbs. Another MRI was performed and showed that the mass had grown to lumbar vertebrae L2, accompanied with worsening of the neurological statuses and impaired sensibility, as well as defecating and urinating problems (). From the history, spinal manipulation procedure was performed by a bone setter, although no specific techniques were available for review.\nA surgical procedure was proposed for exploration and decompression to the patient. The operation started by opening the lamina on T10\u2013T12 levels, followed with laminectomy and hemostatic procedure to stop the bleeding, until the dura was exposed (). A dense mass from T10 to T12 was palpable from the dura layer. After we exposed the lamina, we observed that the dura was tense from touch, and a solid mass underneath the dura was palpable from T10 to L2.

On examination, there was an extension lag at the middle finger, poor grip strength, and reduced height of middle ray (). The patient had a history of incidental trauma to the left hand for which he was treated conservatively. Over the 6 months after the trauma, the patient started developing the symptoms in the form of gradual shortening and reduced handgrip strength and presented to our hospital. On investigation, blood parameters including calcium levels and parathormone levels were normal. The X-ray showed pathological fracture of third metacarpal with osteolytic lesion involving base of second metacarpal and carpal bones (). Magnetic resonance imaging showed almost complete osteolysis of the 3rd metacarpal with only the base visible and fracture of the 4th metacarpal with thinning and resorption of the bone and surrounding soft tissue. It also showed pathological fracture involving capitate with patchy areas of osteolysis (). Serial X-rays taken at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 18 weeks, and 6 months revealed that there was progressive concentric reduction of metacarpal shaft, first involving third then fourth metacarpal giving appearance of a sucked candy (). At this point in time, we kept in mind the differential diagnosis of primary bone tumor like aggressive giant cell tumor or aneurysmal bone cyst or metastasis from any other primary tumor. Positron emission tomography scan was done to rule out any tumor, however, no evidence of tumor was found. Parathyroid hormone levels were within normal limit. Biopsy suggested myxoid areas, proliferating vessels interposed with skeletal muscle fragments with no evidence of malignancy. Based on the clinical-radiological and histopathological presentation, we made a diagnosis of vanishing bone disease. Since there was increased proliferation of blood vessels, we planned to reconstruct vanished metacarpals with non-vascularized fibula as there already was a hypervascular bed. Dorsal S-",
