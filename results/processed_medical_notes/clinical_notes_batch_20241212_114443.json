He had high blood pressure, and he started continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) because of hypertensive nephrosclerosis 8 years previously. A PD catheter was primarily inserted at the right abdomen, but it was removed and inserted at the left abdomen because of exit site and tunnel infection 5 years previously. He had no past medical history of diabetes mellitus and major abdominal surgery. In the peritoneal equilibration test, his result was high. Bloody ascites was not evident. One year previously, he had been hospitalized for PD-associated peritonitis caused by touch contamination that was treated with intraperitoneal cephazoline and cephtazidime. Bowel adhesion was not noted 5 years previously; however, local bowel adhesions and agglomeration of the intestine were detected by computed tomography (CT) after the identification of PD-associated peritonitis (Fig. , ). The major findings of EPS, such as peritoneal thickening and calcification, were not noted on CT.\nOn physical examination, his blood pressure was 134/74 mmHg, pulse rate was 76 beats/min, and temperature was 99.7 \u00b0 F. He complained of severe pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, and this area was tender on palpation. The exit site was clear. Laboratory tests revealed mild inflammation, with a white blood cell count of 10,100 /\u03bcL and C-reactive protein level of 0.9 mg/dL. The peritoneal fluid cell count was increased at 980 /mL. Based on these findings, PD-associated peritonitis was diagnosed. CT showed localized dilation of the intestine, which suggested adhesive small bowel obstruction (Fig. ). As we suspected that the peritonitis might be associated with bacterial translocation from the dilated intestine, he was advised to stop eating and was switched from CAPD to hemodialysis. Additionally, he was treated with intravenous vancomycin and cephtazidime. The PD catheter was flushed once a day",

    "original_text": "The patient was a 26-year-old woman with schizophrenia who was admitted to our hospital\u2019s department of psychiatry in a catatonic state. The schizophrenia had been diagnosed 3 years before her presentation to us. Her medical history included a lumbar vertebral fracture that occurred at the time of schizophrenia onset; she had tried to jump during a state of confusion. After the diagnosis, she visited psychiatric departments at numerous hospitals, but she loathed the weight gain that occurred with the use of antipsychotic drugs, so she did not return for follow-up examinations or take her prescribed medications regularly.

She had no additional medical history or familial medical history. Transvaginal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figures and ) revealed two pelvic cysts. The left-sided unilocular cyst was 9 cm in diameter. The right-sided multilocular cyst was 5 cm in diameter. We diagnosed this condition as bilateral ovarian cysts.\nAlthough the serum levels of tumor markers (CA125, CA19-9, and CEA) were normal for a pregnant woman, considering the large size of the cyst, cyst resection was attempted at 14 weeks; however, it was converted to probe laparotomy. Marked adhesion around the cysts, posterior uterus, and Douglas' pouch made cyst resection impossible as extensive adhesiolysis may cause uterine damage and also uterine contractions after surgery. Gross examinations revealed no metastatic lesions or lymph node swelling. Abdominal fluid cytology revealed no malignant cells.\nAt 32 weeks of gestation, MRI revealed that the left-sided cyst size had increased to 27 cm in diameter (Figures and ), although she was asymptomatic. As shown in , the right-sided multilocular cyst became very close to the left monocytic cyst. At this stage, the left large monocytic cyst appeared to merge with the smaller right multilocular cyst, forming a large cyst occupying the entire pelvic cavity, which was later confirmed by laparoscopic findings.\nThis large cyst showed no solid-part or papillary growth. The serum levels of tumor markers remained normal. Malignant ovarian tumor could not be ruled out but was considered less likely.

His pretransplantation serum alpha-fetoprotein level is 1210 ng/mL. The pretransplant work up for LT included a CT scan of the abdomen and chest that showed no evidence of distant metastasis. A nuclear bone scan was also negative for bone metastasis. According to Hang-Zhou Criteria of China, he received an orthotopic liver transplantation on December 17, 2015. One day after liver transplant, the patient was given immunosuppressive therapy based on a standard rapid-taper regimen of corticosteroids and low-dose tacrolimus monotherapy (1 mg every 12 h) to the currently recommended target level.

Then, he developed hoarseness and dysphagia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that there was a mass on the posterior wall of the nasopharynx and multiple bone destruction in the basal part of the occipital bone (Fig. ).

She noticed the lump eight months ago and it was gradually increasing in size. It was painless initially; however, the lump gradually became tender. The patient was otherwise fit and well with no co-existing morbidities. Closer examination of the right thigh revealed a high consistency mass, with reduced mobility. There was no right inguinal lymphadenopathy or lymph nodes enlargement.\nLaboratory blood tests were unremarkable. An MRI scan was requested to further assess the mass, which was irregular but well-defined in the medial compartment of the thigh, measuring 8.2 x 6.6 x 4.3 cm in size. The mass showed an intermediate signal on both T1 and T2-weighted imaging, appearing hyperintense compared to the adjacent muscular tissue, which also persisted on fat-suppressed imaging. The mass invaded the intramuscular fat planes and caused compression and displacement of the adductor muscles. There was no evidence of intra-muscular invasion. Normal cortical outline and medullary signal intensity of the femur were seen in the right thigh. There was no evidence of bone contusion, marrow oedema, fracture line, or cortical discontinuity. Other muscles of the thigh had a normal outline and signal intensity with no evidence of focal or diffuse oedema. Neurovascular structures were unremarkable. Overall, MRI findings were suggestive of soft tissue neoplasm, with a possibility of a neurogenic tumour. A wide excisional biopsy was then performed to further assess the tissue histologically by the pathologist and confirm the diagnosis. The removed mass measuring 8.5 x 6.5 x 5.4 cm and is shown in Figure . The mass had a smooth outer surface and a soft consistency.

A duodenal tumor was identified on gastrointestinal endoscopy (Fig. ), and a biopsy revealed a NET. The serum levels of insulin, gastrin, and glucagon were within normal ranges. CT did not initially reveal evidence of pancreatic invasion between the tumor and the pancreas; however, irregularities of the duodenal wall and swelling of the lymph nodes around the pancreatic parenchyma were observed. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with non-functional duodenal NET with multiple liver metastases, T2N1M1 stage IV (UICC 8th). In addition, CT revealed the anatomical variation of the CHA, which branched from the SMA and ran fully through the head of the pancreatic parenchyma (Fig. , Additional file Figure S1). The CHA branches into the left hepatic artery (LHA), the middle hepatic artery (MHA), and the right hepatic artery (RHA) (Fig. a, b).

Furthermore, his son had been diagnosed with juvenile dilated cardiomyopathy and died at the age of 15. The pulse rate was 90 beats per minute and systolic blood pressure 102 mm Hg. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a regular wide QRS rhythm with a QRS duration of 200 ms and right bundle branch block configuration with a marked left axis deviation in the absence of obvious P waves (A). The device interrogation demonstrated ventricular sensing without CRT pacing at a V-V interval of 700 ms, which was faster than the right atrial (RA) regular rhythm (B). The ventricular rhythm was not diagnosed as a tachycardia by the CRT-D detection algorithm because the detection zone for ventricular tachyarrhythmias for defibrillation or antitachycardia pacing had been programmed to over 150 beats per minute. From those observations, our initial speculation was that it was an accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR) with VA dissociation. Then, we decided to attempt a catheter ablation procedure because the AIVR inhibited effective CRT pacing.\nAt the beginning of the procedure, a 10-polar catheter and a 20-polar catheter were placed into the coronary vein (CV) and on the RA free wall, respectively. A 4-polar catheter was also placed in the right ventricular apex.

    "original_text": "A 21-year old man with history of 8 year palpitation was referred for electrophysiologic study and possible radiofrequency ablation. Physical examination and transthoracic echocardiographic study did not disclose any abnormality. Baseline ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QRS intervals and no evidence of preexcitation. Antiarrhythmic drugs (propranolol and verapamil) were discontinued two days before the procedure. Baseline intervals in sinus rhythm were as follows: sinus cycle length=690 msec, AH=74 msec, HV=37 msec, QRS=90 msec, PR=133 msec. The minimal pacing cycle length maintaining 1:1 antegrade conduction (AVWP) was 320 msec and the minimal pacing cycle length maintaining 1:1 retrograde conduction (VAWP) was 400 msec. Single extrastimulus testing in the right atrium and the right ventricular apex leaded to a sustained narrow complex tachycardia. The arrhythmia was a short PR- long RP tachycardia with following characteristics: cycle length=376 msec, AH=141 msec, HV=42 msec, VA=200 msec, HA (HRA) =236 msec, HA (His) =243 msec and eccentric atrial activation during the arrhythmia (). The arrhythmia was easily reproducible with stable hemodynamic.\nA ventricular extrastimulus delivered at RV septum in the inflow region synchronous with His activation during the arrhythmia neither advanced nor delayed the subsequent atrial activation.

She underwent a right craniotomy and tumour excision (Simpson II) in the same year but repeated imaging showed residual tumour over right sphenoid and orbital wall. Initial histopathological findings confirmed the diagnosis of meningothelial meningioma WHO Grade 1. Due to tumour progression, she had a severe right eye (RE) proptosis and a right orbital decompression was done by the Neurosurgical team in 2015. Subsequently, in 2016 her tumour continued to progress with involvement of right posterior ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses and she underwent radiotherapy. She was referred for eye assessment and noted to have RE proptosis, restricted extraocular movement and vision was perception to light. She subsequently defaulted follow-up. The surgical team continued to monitor her tumour progression with a six-monthly imaging until 2019 when her MRI brain showed evidence of increased size of residual mass with new extension into right temporal region, as well as another new right temporal mass. A third surgery involving craniectomy and debulking was done. Two months later, she was treated with radiotherapy to a total dose of 60Gy given in 30 fractions (Figure ).\nThree weeks after completing radiotherapy she complained of worsening of RE proptosis for one-week duration, associated with pain with a score of 3/10. She had no fever or any other symptoms. On examination, her RE vision was non-perception to light (NPL), positive relative afferent pupillary defect and no ocular motility. She had corneal epithelial defect and lagophthalmos due to proptosis, conjunctival hyperemia and chemosis. Her fundus examination showed a pale disc but not swollen.

Her personal history revealed a spontaneous abortion and no consanguinity. She underwent routine ultrasonographic examinations at 13, 22, and 30 gestational weeks at a regional hospital; however, at 35 gestational weeks, ultrasonography revealed an abnormal fetal thoracic wall.\nPrenatal ultrasonography revealed a fetal thoracoabdominal wall defect with partial displacement of the left ventricle and the liver associated with rotation and elongation of the heart and a high index of clinical suspicion for intracardiac malformations such as tricuspid atresia, a ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary artery hypoplasia (Figures \u2013).\nBased on the aforementioned findings, she was admitted to the Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic in T\u00e2rgu Mure at 39 gestational weeks, where she underwent a cesarean section. The male newborn weighed 3,100 g with an APGAR score of 7.

He had no known medical problems and was not diabetic. On admission, the skin of the penis was partially necrotic with progressing gangrene, it was malodourous, and the abdominal wall and scrotum appeared normal.\nUltrasound, retrograde urethrogram, intravenous urogram, and urethroscopy were done within 24 hours. These confirmed a normal upper urinary tract and bladder and showed obstruction of the penile urethra secondary to multiple calculi; however, the calculi were embedded and the tissues were grossly inflamed and ulcerated. He was started on intravenous ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole which were continued for 5 days during his hospital stay followed by amoxicillin/clavulanic acid upon discharge for a further week.\nThe patient consented for extraction of the urethral stones as well as aggressive debridement of the penile tissues with the risk of amputation.

His past history was remarkable for gastro-esophageal reflux and hypertension. The ultrasound of the urinary tract suggested the presence of a sessile bladder wall\u2019s tumor approximately 3 cm in size engaging anterior wall and part of the bladder neck. These imaging were confirmed performing a cystoscopy. In October 2012 the patient underwent a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURB). Histological examination showed a high-grade papillary TCC of the bladder with muscle invasion (pT2). The computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen-pelvis and chest X-ray was negative for metastases. A month later the patient underwent a RC and urinary diversion to an ileal conduit. The final pathology report confirmed the result of the TURB.

Therefore, we opted for performing a transthoracic biopsy, as well as a mediastinal lymph node biopsy by mediastinoscopy, and, depending on the results of the intraoperative analysis, we would also insert an indwelling central catheter for chemotherapy. The patient was brought to the HOR, and the procedures were performed sequentially. Elective endotracheal intubation, large-bore peripheral venous access, and an indwelling urinary catheter were used. The patient was initially placed in the right lateral decubitus position for performance of a percutaneous Tru-Cut needle biopsy, with the gantry (Artis Zeego; Siemens, Munich, Germany) set to tomographic mode, by the interventional radiology team. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed that it was a carcinoma. The patient was then placed in the supine position to undergo mediastinoscopy with biopsy of the lesion, with the gantry set to fluoroscopic mode. Examination of a frozen section biopsy specimen confirmed an epidermoid carcinoma in the infracarinal lymph node. In view of the diagnosis of (stage N2) lung cancer, we proceeded to insert a catheter for chemotherapy, again with the gantry set to fluoroscopic mode.\nThe use of an HOR in the case described here allowed all procedures to be performed sequentially, in the same setting, without need for transportation. In addition, we would have the flexibility of adding pulmonary lobectomy if the pulmonary mass was positive for cancer and did not extend into the mediastinum.

She was 31 weeks and four days pregnant after spontaneous conception. This was her second pregnancy. During this pregnancy, she had a 12 weeks screening and a 20 weeks scan. Both of these screenings were reassuring. Her first pregnancy was three years ago with normal delivery. The first baby was a girl who weighed 3210 grams.\nInitially, she had a cardiotocography (CTG), which was reassuring.

The preoperative CT scan showed a suspicious mass in the pancreatic head, without any evidence for extrapancreatic tumor manifestation (Fig. A). An explorative laparotomy was performed by the local surgeon and the tumor was classified as locally not resectable. A tumor biopsy was taken and a palliative gastroenterostomy was performed. The histopathological analysis revealed a poorly differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head. After the primary operation, the patient was referred to our center. As the tumor was judged borderline resectable, our interdisciplinary tumor board recommended \u2018neoadjuvant\u2019 chemotherapy with Gemcitabine/Oxaliplatin for 10 cycles. Restaging after the complete neoadjuvant therapy showed local tumor regression without evidence of distant metastasis. Therefore, a pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple's operation) was subsequently performed. The histopathological examination showed an ypT3, N0 stage, Grade 3 tumor. The dorsal resection margin revealed an R1 resection, and the resected specimen revealed severe intrapancreatic NI by cancer cells (Fig. B). In the postoperative period, the strong pain sensations disappeared completely 2 weeks after tumor resection. With postoperative pancreatic enzyme supplementation, the patient experienced slight weight gain. At this time, an additive chemotherapy with Gemcitabine was initiated. Five months postoperatively, the patient had no pain, but suffered from mild polyneuropathy of hands and feet due to the side effects of the neoadjuvant treatment. Seven months after resection, the patient developed severe lumbar pain which again required the hospitalization of the patient. The performed CT scan showed local tumor recurrence around the inferior vena cava and liver metastasis (Fig. C and D). The chemotherapy regimen was changed from Gemcitabine to 5-Fluoruracil and a symptomatic adjunct analgesic therapy with Pregabalin was initiated in addition to Metamizol, which led to a short-term pain relief.

His blood pressure was raised 230/100 mmHg and fundoscopy showed hypertensive retinopathy. USG showed features of cystitis with hypoechoic areas extending into the thickened bladder wall with features of pyelonephritis. An infective pathology was offered as diagnosis on imaging. A clinical diagnosis of bilateral obstructive uropathy due to tumor with chronic kidney disease was made, and the patient was put on hemodialysis and cystoscopy planned at a later date. Cystoscopy findings were of a growth with small fronds/papillae, prominent at the bladder neck with a very rigid thickened bladder wall.

She had no previous illness, and her elder brother died few years ago from parietal glioblastoma multiforme. General physical examination was unremarkable; there were no cutaneous stigmata of neurofibromatosis. The neurological examination demonstrated facial hypoesthesia in the distribution of the second and third divisions of the trigeminal nerve. The rest of cranial nerves and neurological examination were within normal.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a 40 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 40 mm isointense lesion that enhanced heterogeneously following intravenous Gadolinium administration enhancing lesion in the anterior part of left middle cranial fossa involving the anterior part of the temporal lobe and extends to the infratemporal fossa through foramen ovale (Figures , , and ). The tumor had intra-axial enhanced solid and cystic unenhanced components in the left anterior temporal lobe with surrounded vasogenic edema. The radiological findings were likely consistent with trigeminal schwannoma. Surgery was performed via temporal extradural and intradural approach, with neuronavigation guidance, through left orbitozygomatic-temporal craniotomy. The tumor was seen extradurally easily separable from the dura. It was noticed that it is smaller than the expected size from the MRI. The dura was then opened and a striking intra-axial soft tumor was noted in the superior and middle temporal gyri. Complete microsurgical resection, with ultrasonic aspirator, of the intradural portion of the tumor was performed through anterior temporal lobectomy and the dura was closed. The extradural portion was exposed with drilling of middle fossa floor into the infratemporal fossa and enlarging foramen ovale laterally.

On physical examination, diffuse bulky lymphadenopathy was found in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Detailed oncologic history and treatment regimens that were taken by the patient have been well explained in Table .\nLaboratory workup showed hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. During the hospitalization, computed tomography (CT) scan head was done that showed negative findings for any acute events. Due to altered mental status with underlying worsening of NHL and metabolic disturbances, the toxic and metabolic encephalopathy were the differentials under consideration. Metabolic derangements were corrected during hospitalization and that improved his mental status as well. Idelalisib treatment was discontinued abruptly a week prior to patient\u2019s presentation to the hospital due to pancytopenia and a mixed response on the CT scan imaging.

Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal system revealed a yellowish-colored, adipose-tissue-like appearance of a polypoid mass with a smooth surface covering between 25 and 34 cm of the esophageal wall (fig ). Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax revealed a posterior mediastinal mass (height \u00d7 width \u00d7 depth: 10 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3 cm; fig ), which was compressed between the vertebral column, aorta and heart and pushed the lumen of the esophagus leftward (fig ). The mass had low-density tissue absorption, which was characteristic of adipose tissue when compared with surrounding tissues.

Therefore, esophageal lipoma was considered the most likely diagnosis, and the decision for surgical excision was made.\nA right-sided mini-thoracotomy was performed, the mediastinal pleura was opened and tumor location was identified. Enucleation of the lipoma was the planned operative strategy. The overlying muscle layer of the lower third of the esophagus was incised to expose the tumor, which was then completely enucleated (fig ).

The patient showed: height 165 cm, velvety and translucent skin, and bilateral venous varicosities (Fig. ). The patient had a total of two pregnancies, the first uncomplicated, the second terminated at about 4 months of gestation because of the presence of the above mentioned aneurysm of the ascending aorta at high dissection risk. She had recurrent wrist dislocations in childhood. Proband's father suddenly died at the age of 33 years for unknown causes. The 26 years old proband's daughter did not present valvular, aortic or other anomalies during several echocardiographic evaluations. Her clinical history included a pituitary adenoma and she suffered from reactive hypoglycaemia and allergic rhinitis. Recurrent left patella dislocations were reported, without other signs of joint hypermobility. She showed mild myopia.\nIn Patient 1, sequencing analysis of genomic DNA disclosed in exon 6 of the TGFBR1 gene the c.1052A>G transition, leading to the substitution of an aspartic acid with a glycine in position 351 of the aminoacidic sequence (p.Asp351Gly) (Fig. ).

The findings in the operation were as follows: The lesion of adenomyosis existed at the posterior wall of the uterus and the lesion and rectum adhered to each other firmly. A vertical incision was made in the middle of the posterior wall of the uterus, and the adenomyosis lesion was enucleated as much as possible (50 g in total).

Sixteen months later, the tumour recurred in the oropharynx and the left upper lobe of the lung. She was treated with a regimen containing carboplatin, paclitaxel, and cetuximab. The tumour progressed to submandibular lymph nodes, soft tissues, and lumbar vertebral body. She was initiated on immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab and radiation therapy.\nA detailed social and family history was taken in an attempt to understand the aggressiveness of her cancer. She worked in a private company involved in the environmental cleaning of lakes and ponds and was exposed to a significant amount of chemicals, including herbicides and pesticides. She has a scant history of smoking: half a pack per day for roughly 1.5 years. She drank alcohol socially on the weekends. Her maternal grandmother died from brain cancer. There was no other family history of cancer. Genetic testing was not performed.\nWithin 1 month of starting radiation therapy, she presented with progressively worsening severe, sharp, constant pain of the right shoulder and chest associated with right arm numbness, cough productive of clear sputum, and dyspnoea on exertion. Pain was exacerbated by right arm movement. She denied any trauma, travel, or oedema of the arm.\nOn examination, she appeared frail with evidence of weight loss. She had a heart rate of 86 b.p.m. and blood pressure of 121/74. On auscultation, coarse rales and rhonchi were present in the left lower lung field.

The patient also complained of epigastric discomfort for the past 6 months. Her symptoms did not resolve even after taking some medicine prescribed in the clinic. She did not have a history of gastropathy and affirmed that she had been wearing dentures for many years.\nPhysical examinations found that the skin of the upper abdomen was red and swollen, and there was an apparent local tenderness with an inflammatory mass. The size of the skin protrusion measured approximately 4 \u00d7 5 cm, and there was no evidence of a surrounding scar or ulcer. There was no rebound pain or muscle tension in the remaining area of the abdomen. The patient had an average body temperature of 37.5\u00b0C, with an increased white blood cell count (18.12 x\u00d7 109/L [reference value 3.5\u20139.5 \u00d7 109/L]) on laboratory examination.\nAn ultrasound (US) examination of the abdomen revealed a 4 cm strip-like hyperechoic object entangled in the muscles of the abdominal wall, which was 2.5 cm away from the surface of the skin. The hyperechoic object penetrated the muscle layer and was partially located in the abdominal cavity, while the surrounding soft tissues were also hypoechoic (Fig. ). In the US finding, the atypical stripe echo in the abdominal wall was considered a foreign body.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a flaky, soft tissue density shadow between the anterior abdominal wall and subcutaneous fat, and a thin strip of bone-like hyperdense shadow.

She already underwent three breast lumpectomies in another hospital for benign lesions; two of the left breast and one of the right breast. She did not take any medications and had no family history.\nClinical examination confirmed the presence of a small nodule in the left breast, situated medially at 9 o\u2019clock. Mammography and echography revealed a spherical, homogenous, non-cystic, well-defined mass of 19 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 19 mm. The lesion was situated close to the pectoralis major muscle and was suspicious for muscle invasion. Doppler ultrasonography revealed an important perilesional and peripheral vascularization. Several enlarged ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes were noticed.\nCore needle biopsies (CNBs) were taken from one enlarged axillary lymph node and from the breast lump. The latter showed a spindle cell lesion with a sharply defined round border that separated the lesion from the surrounding fat tissue. At higher magnification, a variable cellularity was observed but no infiltrative permeation in the surrounding tissue was noticed. Both poorly and highly cellular areas consisted of bland-looking spindle cells. While the poorly cellular areas were characterized by a dense compact collagenous stroma, the more crowded areas showed haphazardly arranged cells embedded in loose connective tissue with myxoid appearance (Fig. a). Mitotic figures were absent. The CNB taken from the lymph node showed no malignancy.\nBecause of the discrepancy between the radiological findings (suggestive for an infiltrative malignancy) and the pathological findings (consistent with a bland-looking, sharply delineated spindle cell lesion), a complete local resection was recommended for definitive diagnosis.\nAt gross examination, the excised lesion presented as a sharply delineated nodule with homogenous white color, hard consistency and regular borders.

The patient reported that the mass was started to grow for the past three months. On physical examination, there was no tenderness or erythema around the mass. The range of motion of the wrist joint was within the normal range. Neurovascular examination findings were normal. The patient was not diagnosed with any chronic disease previously, including gout or not under any medication. He had a history of an occupational injury 33 years ago in which he lost extensor muscles and tendons on the right forearm. Thus, the patient underwent a tendon transfer surgery in which the FCU tendon was transferred to EDC tendon (Figure 1). The patient\u2019s family history was unremarkable for gout.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an iso/hypointense mass at proton density-weighted and fat-suppressed T1 images (Figure 2). We decided to perform excisional biopsy. A written informed consent was obtained from the patient. During surgery, it was confirmed that the FCU tendon was transferred to EDC tendon. The tumor was located within the junction where the FCU tendon was transferred to EDC tendon. Non-absorbable suture materials were observed within the tendon transferred region (Figure 3). A caseous material was reached following the opening of the paratenon suggestive of tendon necrosis, tuberculosis, or a foreign body reaction. An excisional biopsy was performed, and the specimens were sent for histopathological and microbiological evaluation. The weakened tendon was repaired with eight-strand and epitendinous sutures.\nNo organism was seen in the initial Gram staining, and there was no bacterial growth in the microbiology cultures. His preoperative blood laboratory test results were within normal ranges for complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and uric acid levels.
