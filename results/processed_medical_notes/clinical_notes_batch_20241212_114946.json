No large solid or cystic masses were seen.\nA standard barium single contrast upper gastrointestinal (UGI) series was performed with the contrast entering the antrum and duodenal bulb. The proximal duodenum and descending duodenum were markedly dilated in caliber with apparent tapering of the third part of the duodenum. There was an abrupt cutoff with no contrast extending beyond approximately the mid abdomen []. Delayed images were obtained while the patient was supine with contrast never extending beyond the third portion of the duodenum [].\nPatient was subsequently placed prone for several minutes with eventual slight transit of contrast []. Thirty minute delayed prone images demonstrated contrast in the proximal small bowel, however proximal duodenum remained markedly dilated and contrast/debris filled []. Additionally delayed overhead images demonstrated contrast extending to the distal small bowel after patient had been upright for greater than 30 minutes []. Markedly dilated proximal duodenum with abrupt cutoff in the third portion of the duodenum raised concern for a questionable mass like positionally dependent extrinsic compression of the third portion of the duodenum.\nA subsequent computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was performed with oral and intravenous contrast. The duodenum was distended with the third part of the duodenum tented downward []. The duodenal/jejunal junction was severely narrowed and coursed distally anterior to the right common femoral artery below the bifurcation [].\nThe patient was taken for an exploratory laparotomy and found to have dense vascularized bands without intestinal malrotation.

She reports no past medical history, and social history is notable for tobacco use. The patient stated that she first noticed a small, yellow, and fleshy bump on her right nipple approximately two years prior. She became concerned due to its rapid growth in the last year. Four months prior, she visited her primary care provider who performed a shave biopsy of the lesion. Initial pathology results suggested squamous cell carcinoma, but this was thought to be discordant with the clinical picture. At consultation, she reported that her right breast had also started feeling hot and tender for two weeks duration. On examination, her right breast was erythematous and rigid with a 2.2 cm lesion consuming the right nipple. Her nipple also drained yellow pus. The patient was placed on a course of antibiotics due to concerns for an abscess.\nAn MRI was ordered to investigate possible underlying breast malignancy. Results of the MRI showed no solid mass underlying the nipple. A wedge biopsy of the nipple was performed to confirm the initial shave biopsy pathology (). Pathology showed verrucous histologic features with chronic inflammation and underlying abscess with concerns for a possible cutaneous malignancy. Specifically, there was marked papillomatosis with hypergranulomatosis between the papillae as well as a lack of granules at the papillary surfaces. Immunohistochemical testing was also positive for HPV L1 capsid protein. Because the initial shave biopsy showed SCC with positive margins, this clinical picture suggested that an inadequate sample was taken during the wedge biopsy.

Having no pain relief again and with a progressive symptomatology in the right leg accompanied by numbness, the patient was admitted to our hospital.\nAt admission the patient showed severe lumbar spine pain with radiation alongside the dermatome L5 on the right side till the first toe persisting for 6 days and suggesting a nucleus pulposus prolapse. Since 2 days the patient had a hypoesthesia in the same dermatome with a maximum in the lower leg and foot. The femoral nerve stretch test was positive on the right side and the straight leg raise test was early positive at 20\u00b0 elevation of the right leg while these tests were negative on the left side. The Achilles tendon reflex and the patella tendon reflex could be provoked on both sides similarly. There was no motoric deficit in both legs, no bladder or bowel dysfunction, and no saddle anesthesia. Importantly, the skin had no abnormal findings. The medical history was unremarkable except of arterial hypertension and a nucleotomy of a cervical disc. For ambulant non-controllable pain the patient was admitted to our hospital. Under intravenous pain therapy the medical condition ameliorated slightly. For differential diagnosis the patient underwent a MRI scan of the lower back. This showed no herniated disc but a slight spinal stenosis between L4 and L5, as well as, an unspecific swelling of the spinal nerve root L5 on the right side (). Based on these findings a conservative treatment including oral analgesia, physiotherapy and a series of lumbar epidural corticosteroid infiltrations was initiated. After",

His past medical history was not conclusive for any inflammatory bowel disease. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in a different medical center eight months prior to his admission demonstrated an abscess cavity, measuring 2 cm in diameter, located superior to the levator ani muscle and its tract of 10 cm coursing from its internal opening in the rectum down to the perianal region ().

She also had the diagnostic of systemic arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus Type II for 17 years. The patient reported having been admitted to another hospital unit for the treatment of ischemic stroke, which was complicated by peripheral vascular complications and the need for amputation of the right hand, right hallux, and distal phalanx of the left hallux. She also presented with a pressure ulcer associated with the right calcaneal osteomyelitis due to being bedridden for a prolonged period. This was treated with debridement, tenotomy of the calcaneus tendon, and antibiotic therapy in the unit of origin. The culture result showed polymicrobial growth.

Four months prior, she visited her primary care provider who performed a shave biopsy of the lesion. Initial pathology results suggested squamous cell carcinoma, but this was thought to be discordant with the clinical picture.

On examination, her right breast was erythematous and rigid with a 2.2 cm lesion consuming the right nipple. Her nipple also drained yellow pus. The patient was placed on a course of antibiotics due to concerns for an abscess.\nAn MRI was ordered to investigate possible underlying breast malignancy. Results of the MRI showed no solid mass underlying the nipple. A wedge biopsy of the nipple was performed to confirm the initial shave biopsy pathology (). Pathology showed verrucous histologic features with chronic inflammation and underlying abscess with concerns for a possible cutaneous malignancy.

The surgery was not performed in our hospital. The postoperative course was reported as uncomplicated and the patient was discharged. However, 3 years later, in 2008, the patient complained about consistent, sharp, abdominal pain which was not accompanied by fever, nausea or vomiting.

It was suspected that symptoms were connected with diverticular disease, hemorrhoids or gastroenteritis. From March 2011 the patient additionally complained about consistent pain within the lower part of the rectum. In June 2011 the patient was again hospitalized and underwent computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis which, apart from diverticular disease, revealed chronic perianal abscesses which were diagnosed as a postinflammatory process after diverticulitis. Laboratory tests were within the normal range. Colonoscopy showed diverticular disease and a 2 mm polyp in the descending colon which was removed and sent for histopathologic examination, which revealed a tiny tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia with complete removal. After the hospitalization and the patient's discharge, symptoms were somewhat reduced, but not entirely alleviated.\nIn November 2011 symptoms again intensified and the diagnostic process needed to be repeated.

Examination of the oral cavity revealed extensive trauma to the soft and hard palate, without any other lesions to be seen in the head and neck region. Following stabilization of his condition the patient reported that he repeatedly stabbed his palate due to the intolerable character of the ongoing local pain, over the last few months, which he could not tolerate.

The urinary tract anomaly was first revealed in the 26th week of pregnancy with bilateral hydronephrosis and possible posterior urethral valve in prenatal ultrasound. The delivery was uncomplicated with a birth weight of 3860 g and an Apgar score of 10. During the neonatal period, a voiding cystourethrography was performed and ruled out a posterior urethral valve as well as vesicoureteral reflux. Dynamic renal scintigraphy showed significant loss of the left kidney function and impaired urinary outflow from the right kidney with dilatation of the urinary tract. Due to significant hydronephrosis and residual left kidney function, the consulting urologist qualified the patient for a left side nephrectomy, which was performed without complications. A progression in the chronic kidney disease was observed with recurrent urinary tract infections during infancy. At the age of 11 months, the child was qualified for a Sober ureterostomy due to persistent right side ureterohydronephrosis. The procedure had to be performed twice, at 1-month interval, because of an early stomal stenosis. The mother of the patient maintained proper care of the ureterostomy, with daily use of urostomy bags and sealing paste, and no further complications were observed for several years. At the age of 8 years, during a routine follow-up, abdominal ultrasound showed a dilation of the right renal pelvis up to 11 mm with a slightly hyperechogenic structure within it, measuring 19 mm \u00d7 8 mm (Fig. ), with a strong acoustic shadow but no twinkling artifact. Due to the unclear ultrasound picture, an abdominal computed tomography (CT) was perform and showed an oval structure (22 mm \u00d7 7 mm \u00d7 13 mm) with a density similar to body fat in the slightly dilated right renal pelvis.

No other previous significant disease was reported and she was in good health.\nThe patient underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy without apparent complications. The first trocar, through the umbilical port, was introduced under direct vision due to the possibility of abdominal adhesions surrounding this site, which were confirmed during the surgical procedure.

The patient had a history of thyroid follicular adenocarcinoma which was treated surgically with total thyroidectomy and postoperative iodine treatment 25 years prior to presentation. At 12 years post thyroidectomy, she was diagnosed with a calcaneal mass of the same pathology and diagnosed with delayed distant thyroid carcinoma metastasis to the calcaneus. 10 years after calcaneal mass excision, the patient was diagnosed with a proximal tibial mass that turned out to be also delayed metastasis of the same pathology.\nAt the first presentation 15 years ago, she initially presented complaining of mild edema of the left ankle with intermittent pain upon daily activity. Physical exam showed full range of motion of the ankle joint with intact motor power and intact neurovascular status. There were no cutaneous lesions.\nPlain radiographs of the left ankle showed a 3-centimeter oval lytic lesion in the anterior aspect of the calcaneum ().\nAn MRI of the left ankle showed a 3.2 cm well-defined benign-looking lytic lesion of the calcaneal neck reaching the cortex which appeared to be mildly irregular with mild degenerative disease of the posterior subtalar joint consistent with an intraosseous ganglion cyst of the calcaneus ().\nMedical treatment with NSAIDs and paracetamol was initiated, along with partial weight bearing and relative rest with no improvement at follow-up at 4 weeks. Surgical intervention was decided due to the persistent pain. The cyst was resected with a margin of surrounding fibro-osseous tissue and the bone grafted.

    "original_text": "A 47-year-old Iranian male patient referred to our outpatient clinic in the Imam Khomeini Hospital, Sari, with a palpable and painless mass in his left shoulder.\nThe patient did not complain about pain or weakness in this location. On examination, the mass was small, mobile, firm, and nontender located in the soft tissue of left shoulder. The skin covering the mass was intact, and there was no ecchymosis and even erythema (). The shoulder range of motion had no functional impairment, and the patient was able to do the routine tasks with no neurovascular disturbance. Medically speaking, important clinical signs and symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and respiratory symptoms were not detected.\nThere was no visible fluctuation in this field, and it was estimated 0.5-1 cm in length and width. Tumor consistency was not similar to bone, and it seemed to be a soft tissue mass. The patient denied any history of trauma and also no significant family history was identified. Interestingly, the patient was operated by general surgeon 6 times because of relapses in a way the last one was 1.5 years ago. At the first time, the patient was referred to the outpatient clinic because of gradual mass enlargement. The patient was operated by wrong method as transverse approach in the lateral border of the shoulder ().\nIn the recent recurrence, chest X-ray showed no obvious lung or bone involvement ( and ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) illustrated a small extraskeletal nodular lesion with ring enhancement and no bone involvement at subcutaneous fat on lateral aspect of shoulder measuring about 13 mm which could be due to a recurrence of the previous tumor ( and ). Unfortunately, no previous documentation such as MRI was found.

In addition, the pain did not affect food intake or daily physical activity. Before medical consultation no systematic treatment had been applied for the pain, which was relieved after some minutes, only to relapse some days later.\nHistory revealed an episode of reported angina 4 months prior to consultation, with non -specific ST/T abnormalities in the ECG.

Biochemical testing for hepatic and renal was also within normal values. Imaging included a chest radiography, which revealed no abnormalities and an abdominal CT scan with oral gastrografin intake, which revealed a 3 \u00d7 6 cm cystic formation located at the lower pole of the spleen (Figure ). Due to the lack of an infectious (no compatible clinical signs, no CRP or WBC count elevation, negative serological testing for Echinococcus) or traumatic background and the lack of evidence in favor of a cystic neoplasm (homologous content, normal perimeter, no increase in cancer-associated biochemical markers, such as Ca 19-9 and CEA), a latent congenital epithelial cyst was considered most probable. Four days later an MRI examination confirmed the previous result. The symptoms were not definitely associated to the cyst and the physician related them to the patient's increased stress, assuming she had irritable bowel syndrome.\nEight years later (2005), the patient visited her physician, reporting a periodic continuation of the abdominal pain, whereas neither the character nor the frequency of episodes differed.

    "original_text": "A 2-year-old male patient from a foreign country was referred to our pediatric surgery clinic for esophageal replacement. According to the parent, esophageal stenosis developed a year ago due to corrosive ingestion. Balloon dilatation was tried first in the patient who had two strictures, one proximal and one distal. When endoscopic balloon dilatations failed for the proximal stricture, a SEMS was placed. The stent was repositioned after two weeks because of stent migration. In the meantime, the patient could not be followed up for three months due to the civil war in the country. During this time, the patient's nutritional status gradually deteriorated. In the last examination, it was revealed that the stent had migrated distally and the proximal esophagus was severely narrowed. It was thought that the stent could not be removed endoscopically. Gastrostomy was not considered, and the boy was referred for esophageal replacement. When the patient came to our clinic, he was fed with liquid food only, which took a long time, and he had difficulty swallowing his saliva. The patient was hospitalized, and total parenteral nutrition was started. Esophageal passage graphy showed almost no passage (). When we performed endoscopy, we found almost complete obstruction (). In tomography, it was revealed that the proximal esophagus was extremely widened and the stent was approximately 1 cm below (). The lumen of the esophagus distal to the stent could not be evaluated. In the first stage, we aimed to excise the strictured part of the esophagus and remove the stent before the esophageal replacement. The strictured part of the esophagus was excised and the stent was removed via a right thoracotomy. On the fifth day, oral feeding was started and the thorax drain was removed on the 7th day. On the 14th day, the patient underwent endoscopy. The proximal esophagus was normal and balloon dilatation was applied to the distal stenosis. Distal stenosis was easily dilated. The patient was discharged on the 17th postoperative day without any problems. Now he is aged 4",

She had no past history of ocular problems or trauma. Because of metastatic adenocarcinoma lung with the tumour demonstrating a mutation in exon 19 of the EGFR gene, she was considered suitable for primary palliative treatment with gefitinib and has been started on this medication three months earlier. Medical history also included palliative radiotherapy on her spine and right shoulder and treatment with morphine sulphate, diclofenac, and gabapentin.\nOn examination, her left eye had very poor vision of perception to light only. Slit-lamp examination revealed a shallow anterior chamber and a perforated corneal ulcer that measured 4.7 \u00d7 5 mm, which was plugged by the iris (). The eye was white with no conjunctival injection or anterior chamber cells. There was no evidence of meibomianitis or trichomegaly. It was difficult to visualise the fundus due to the corneal pathology but ultrasound examination demonstrated choroidal detachment with no evidence of intraocular metastasis. The right eye showed no abnormality with good vision.\nAs it was suspected that gefitinib could be the cause of her corneal ulcer, her oncologist decided to stop the medication due to the potential ocular toxicity, although gefitinib treatment had reduced her lung tumour size. Initial ophthalmic management included a bandage contact lens to reform the anterior chamber and topical antibiotics. A subsequent tectonic 6.25 mm corneal graft was performed without complication ().\nPost-operatively, her eye remained quiet, however, because of the development of a dense cataract, her vision only improved to hand movement. Two months after stopping the gefitinib treatment and while awaiting cataract surgery, she developed severe left retroorbital pain. On examination, she had iris prolapse through a melting corneal graft, and the crystalline lens was extruded (). This was managed initially with botulinum toxin injected into the upper lid producing a ptosis to provide protection for the eye and oral antibiotics were started.\nIt was agreed, after consultation",

    "original_text": "A 49-year-old man, an amateur long-distance runner for 10 years, healthy and with no history of diseases, with positive results of periodic health examinations, had been suffering only from frequent headaches of unknown organic cause since early childhood. He had not suffered from any significant cardiac diseases apart from arrhythmia (single supraventricular extrasystoles) that did not require any medical treatment. Three months prior to the episode he had had his periodic exercise ECG, echocardiogram and Holter-ECG performed. None of them showed any contraindications for practising sport. Family history did not indicate any risk of vascular diseases either. After 3 h of the marathon race the patient started suffering binocular visual impairment in the form of flash lights variably narrowing his visual field. It was not accompanied by any other symptoms, neurological complaints or pain. The patient thought these symptoms were functional disorders caused by exhaustion and dehydration, so he only slowed down and finished the race. He did not suspect that this symptom might be caused by any trauma. After 2 h of rest the symptoms resolved spontaneously. After another 2 h the patient headed to the Accident and Emergency Department, where he underwent observation and was consulted by the neurologist, who did not recognize any abnormalities. He was also examined by the ophthalmologist and underwent ophthalmoscopy with the examination of acuity and field of vision. No abnormalities were found. He was discharged home with the diagnosis of function disorders caused by exhaustion. In another 7 days following the race the patient suffered only from permanent headaches, slightly more severe than the ones he used to complain about. Consequently he visited the neurologist again but again the examination did not reveal any abnormalities. He was referred for cervical spine X-ray and carotid artery Doppler ultrasound. The headache resolved after 8 days. Cervical spine X-ray did not reveal any significant abnormalities and Doppler ultrasound showed normal morphology of carotid arteries with no blood flow disturbances.

His initial surgery was performed in 1974, with the latest revision for periprosthetic infection 2 years prior to presentation to our clinic. He had undergone 5 previous surgeries and had a history of PJI with Escherichia coli at an outside hospital. On initial presentation, the patient had loose-appearing femoral stem with severe osteolysis (). He had a history of hypertension, deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, and asthma. After preoperative medical optimization, the patient underwent resection of proximal femur down to the distal femur metaphysis and placement of an MAAS (). He was allowed to partial weight bear to his affected limb postoperatively and was treated with 6 weeks of IV ceftriaxone. Intraoperative cultures grew E coli again. He underwent completion of his 2-stage reconstruction after 17.2 weeks using a tapered revision hip prosthesis in combination with a femoral allograft. An intramedullary nail with lateral locking plate was used for allograft fixation distally (). Patient opted to delay his second stage reconstruction after his antibiotic holiday as he was functioning well with the spacer and had several social challenges he needed to resolve prior to reimplantation. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein normalized prior to this surgery. This construct was chosen for several reasons. First, we did not wish to proceed with total femur replacement as this was our last option and patient had a native pain-free knee. Second, other proximal femur constructs would have been technically challenging, given the short amount of femur distally along with the difficulty obtaining fixation in the metaphysis of the femur versus the diaphysis.

The presenting complaints started about a year back as insidious onset of heel pain which was constant aching in nature and aggravated by periods of prolonged walking and standing. There was no history of trauma. She was a known seropositive rheumatoid arthritis patient on Hydroxychloroquine, Sulphasalazine and Methotrexate for 20 years. She was under the care of a rheumatologist and had steroid injections in the right heel for plantar fasciitis in the past. On examination there was diffuse tenderness around the heel with full range of ankle movements but painful limitation of subtalar joint movements. There was no hind foot malalignment evident on weight-bearing radiographs of foot and ankle (). But that of the ankle revealed a sclerotic line with areas of osteolysis suspicious of a fracture of the calcaneus (). An MRI scan of the ankle with T2 weighted images showed linear high signal intensity in the body of the calcaneus suggestive of an insufficiency fracture of the calcaneus (). The patient was treated with moon walker boot and commenced on oral Alendronic acid 10mg on alternate days for eight weeks with Calcichew and Vitamin D tablets. The patient was advised to use the moon boot while weight bearing and remove at bed time. At the eight weeks follow-up she was completely pain free and able to fully weight bear. The radiographic examination showed the fracture had healed ().\nThe patient was referred back to our orthopaedic clinic after two years by her general practitioner with complaints of recurrence of right heel pain with no history of trauma.

The lesion originated in the ascending branch of the left mandible, and the first surgical procedure was performed in March 1997 followed by disease recurrence in April 1999. A second resection was performed in May 1999, and during the next 16 years, the patient underwent several surgical approaches that were consistently followed by disease recurrence. Some of the procedures were conservative surgeries, but others were radical procedures that left her with several deforming scars. She presented to our clinic in January 2015 with a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that evidenced a right, triangular aspect, paracellarlesion, extending to the homolateral cavernous sinus (13 \u00d7 9 mm), which was suspected to be a residual lesion that would have achieved the cavernous sinus by contiguity growth after several surgeries. Her last surgery had been performed in April 2014 and was followed by local radiotherapy in May 2014. She was asymptomatic and not willing to undergo a new invasive procedure. She decided to be followed without further intervention.\nFor the next 18 months, she was clinically stable and asymptomatic, but she returned in July 2016 with intense pain on the right side of her face that required multiple hospital visits for intravenous analgesia. MRI revealed an extensive heterogeneous lesion with contrast enhancement centered on the right cavernous sinus anterior to the cavus of Meckel and exhibiting anterior extension towards the upper orbital fissure (measuring approximately 19 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 16 mm). To identify new treatment possibilities, we decided to perform a new biopsy and conduct molecular testing (Fig. ).

Examination at the emergency room after recovery was normal. Brain imaging was not performed because of the pregnancy. Two subsequent EEGs were normal, and no specific diagnosis was made at the time.

Fifteen years later, while driving, she noted weakness of her arms, legs, and trunk severe enough to warrant stopping the car. Weakness recovered slowly after 15 minutes. A similar episode occurred a few months later. Potassium levels and clinical examination when asymptomatic were normal. Subsequently, the frequency of similar episodes with flaccid paresis of her limbs, affecting predominantly the legs and lasting several minutes, increased and they occurred daily, always after resting. No correlation with food intake or fasting was reported. In addition, she complained of painless cramps in her arms and legs muscles, which could become painful if she tried to stretch her muscles. These lasted up to 10 minutes and also occurred during sleep.\nA detailed neurologic examination at the age of 42 years revealed no abnormalities.

There was no associated erythema and her leg was non-tender. There was no history of trauma. There was no significant antenatal history in her mother and our patient was delivered normally at a local hospital with an uneventful postnatal period. There was no history of umbilical cannulation, cardiac catheterization, or any other femoral intervention. She had reported these symptoms since early childhood but no medical evaluation was done in the past. There were no other complaints.\nHer physical examination was remarkable for large venous collaterals on her anterior abdominal wall with flow from below upwards (Fig. ). She was also noted to have swelling and multiple venous ulcers on her left lower limb (Fig. ). Both lower limbs had varicose veins. There was no calf tenderness. There was pedal edema on her left lower limb. The rest of her examination was normal.\nOn color Doppler examination, her infrarenal IVC as well as her bilateral internal and external iliac veins were not visualized. A short segment of her proximal right common femoral vein and proximal superficial femoral vein were faintly visualized. Her left-sided common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were not visualized.\nA computed tomography (CT) venogram done to define her venous anatomy showed absence of infrarenal IVC as well as absence of bilateral common iliac and left common femoral veins (Fig. ). A short segment of her right common femoral vein was seen with collaterals draining into her anterior abdominal wall. Her venous system at the level of the renal vein and above was normally developed (Fig. ). There were well-developed collaterals over her anterior abdominal wall and in her bilateral lower limbs.

    "original_text": "Patient CK is a 57-year-old man with a medical history of allergic rhinitis and obstructive sleep apnea who presented to clinic in May 2017 with nasal obstruction of 3 years\u2019 duration which was refractory to medical management with nasal steroids and saline. He was a former boxer and reported a history of 3 open septorhinoplasties to correct trauma-related nasal defects and 1 incision and drainage of a septal hematoma following the last open rhinoplasty in 1982. On examination, a soft compressible mass was observed filling the anterior nasal cavity bilaterally arising from the anterior septum. The rest of the examination was normal. The patient presented with a prior needle aspiration revealing respiratory epithelium, confirming mucocele. To assess for interval changes prior to surgery, we obtained an updated computed tomography (CT) sinus scan revealing a 2.4 cm \u00d7 2.0 cm \u00d7 2.0 cm cystic mass in the anterior septum with dystrophic calcification particularly of the right wall of the cyst ( and ). He was taken to the operating room, and 6 cc of a thick gelatinous material was aspirated from the mass and sent for culture. Transnasal endoscopic approach was performed after making a modified Killian incision just anterior to the curvature of the mass on the right side. Three layers of tissue were noted with the superficial layer being the septal flap followed by a fibrous and boney layer with the mucosal lining of the cyst being noted most medially ( and ). At the end of the case, all the mucous membrane lining was removed along with the dystrophic bone, and the right and left septal flaps were re-approximated with quilting suture. Doyle splints were placed at the end of the case and left in place for 3 weeks. Final pathology for the case reflected bone and respiratory epithelium consistent with a mucocele.

Her symptoms began 11 months prior to diagnosis when she initially fell on her hip and felt a bump with associated pain. In the emergency room, the initial history and physical examination resulted in the diagnosis of a hematoma around her proximal femur. Her symptoms worsened over the next nine months and she experienced recurrent falls. Radiographic imaging six weeks prior to her initial cancer diagnosis did not reveal significant abnormalities. Due to the concern for a possible hip fracture, a CT scan without intravenous contrast was obtained. While the CT confirmed no displaced fracture, it indicated clinical correlation for a nonspecific left thigh tissue collection suggestive of a hematoma. An MRI was obtained after the CT and demonstrated a soft-tissue mass in the subcutaneous tissue of the left hip suspicious for sarcoma. The patient had a consultation with an orthopedic oncologic specialist one week following the MRI and underwent a radical resection of the sarcoma the next day.\nThe pathology report revealed a 13.5 cm superficial left hip undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma with 50-60% necrosis. Margins were negative, with the closest evidence of cancer being 2 mm within surgical margins. A staging chest CT one week after surgery demonstrated two tiny lung nodules with the larger nodule measuring 4 mm which indicated a recommended follow up of three to six months. Of note, there was also a small hypodense lesion in the spleen that was inadequately visualized. Tumor stage was established to be Stage III measuring 13.5 cm at its greatest dimension. The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging was established to be pT2a, cN0, cM0 without evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastases.

The mass had a positive doppler signal, and the patient had palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.\nOn CT and ultrasound imaging of the abdomen, the patient was found to have an anomalous venous connection between the left and right saphenous veins. The connection traversed across the anterior abdominal wall and contained an aneurysmal segment close to the right saphenofemoral junction that was 3.6 cm in diameter and was partially thrombosed (Figs and ). The patient had a duplex ultrasound on hospital day one that showed the femoral veins to be patent bilaterally. Systemic anticoagulation was started with warfarin. On hospital Day 2, the patient\u2019s pain improved and she was subsequently discharged on warfarin therapy before her INR was therapeutic with an outpatient lower extremity venous duplex to ensure no further progagation of the thrombus.\nFour days after her initial presentation, her venous duplex showed acute deep venous thrombosis in the left common femoral vein with more subacute thrombus in the left popliteal vein, the left greater saphenous vein and the left lesser saphenous vein.

The patient reported a sensation of tightness in and around the ulcer sites with increasing severity. Both ulcers had thick nonhealing edges with a punched out appearance. The patient had been administered previously with various medications, including various types of antibiotics for six months with no improvement in the healing of the ulcers. He was on Tab. methotrexate 15 mg once-a-week for seronegative rheumatoid arthritis from past 10 years. He had no history of psoriasis at any time. He underwent complete blood investigations, which showed no pancytopenia or any other significant hematological abnormality. Culture and sensitivity tests from ulcer sites were repeatedly sterile for bacteria and fungi. Venous and arterial doppler studies of both lower limbs were done to exclude peripheral vascular disease and were normal. In view of underlying rheumatoid arthritis, a biopsy of both the ulcers was performed. There was no histopathological evidence of vasculitis or granulomatous lesions []. After extensively reviewing the clinical and investigational findings, it was found that the appearance and characteristics of the ulcers resembled those of methotrexate-induced ulcer previously reported in the literature. After a detailed discussion with the patient, methotrexate was stopped and the ulcerated lesion was closely monitored. Also, the patient was monitored for any exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis. Two weeks after withdrawal of methotrexate, the ulcer showed definite signs of healing and by six weeks it was almost complete healed []. No other significant adjunctive wound healing measures were given. There was no exacerbation of symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.

Both upper and lower limbs exhibited pronounced involuntary movements and she was rated as level II according to the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) []. She presented with a combined crouch and spastic gait pattern. Both hips internally rotated during gait with an equinus foot position, however, she was able to ambulate and ride a bicycle without assistance. She was able to climb stairs one step at a time. She initially twisted and injured the right knee in a fall from a bicycle in 1999. The obvious injury was not pointed out in X-ray examination by the local physician, and the injury was left untreated at that time. She reported an uncomfortable sensation in her right knee since her fall in 1999. She again experienced pain and instability in the right knee while walking and using the stairs in 2001. X-ray, CT and physical examination by another local physician diagnosed an avulsion fracture involving the ACL at the tibial insertion with an intraarticular loose body (Figure A and B). Arthroscopic resection of the loose body and fixation of the avulsed bone fragment under pull-out technique was performed in 2001. Bone healing at the ACL tibial insertion site was not successful and symptoms still remained. An additional surgery for resection of the bone fragment at the tibial ACL insertion was performed in 2003. The patient continued to feel pain and instability when walking after the second surgery, even with the use of the functional ACL brace. Our examination revealed physical findings of involuntary movement, making objective evaluation of ACL function difficult to perform using accurate testing or instruments. Her involuntary movement was increased when she was nervous, such that attaching instrumentation around her leg for testing created anxiety and therefore exaggerated her involuntary movement. Her Lysholm score was 31 points and an International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC)",

She was diagnosed with TCS type 1 on the basis of clinical findings and genetic testing. As part of the underlying condition she had bilateral conductive hearing impairment treated with hearing aids. She also had a mild degree of micrognathia with good mouth opening and lower jaw protrusion. There was no history of chest or upper airway infections and she had an effective cough. There was no family history of syndromic conditions or scoliosis.\nThe development of a scoliosis was first noted at the age of 14 years. No treatment was given at that stage and the deformity gradually progressed. At presentation to our clinic, she was post-menarche with height 162.7cm, arm span 171cm, body weight 50.6kg, and body mass index 31.2.\nOn clinical examination, she had a severe right thoracic scoliosis which was rotated to the right and was producing a marked prominence of the rib cage and scapula adjacent to the convexity of the curve. There was also thoracic translocation and listing of her trunk to the right with associated waistline asymmetry and prominence of the left side of her pelvis. A left upper thoracic scoliosis was present and this resulted in levelling of her shoulders. Her pelvis was level with no evidence of leg-length discrepancy. There were no skin or soft tissue abnormalities overlying her spine. She reported no neurological abnormality. A neurological examination confirmed normal tone, muscle power, sensation and tendon reflexes in her upper and lower limbs, as well as symmetrically elicited abdominal reflexes. There were no upper motor neuron signs.\nRadiographs of her spine during initial assessment in our clinic revealed a right thoracic scoliosis extending from T6 to L1 and measuring 90\u00b0 and a left upper thoracic scoliosis extending from T1 to T6 and measuring 51\u00b0. Thoracic kyphosis was within normal limits but lumbar lordosis was increased with an overall negative sagittal balance of her spine. The radiological evaluation excluded the",
