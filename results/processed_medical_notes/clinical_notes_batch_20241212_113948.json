    "original_text": "A 38-year-old male patient with a 40-pack-year history of smoking initially presented with sudden-onset right-sided facial nerve palsy which was diagnosed as idiopathic Bell's palsy and was treated with prednisolone. Three weeks later, the patient developed a new left-sided facial palsy in addition to his unrecovered right-sided facial palsy. The patient denied any systemic symptoms except for a mild headache. His physical examination showed bilateral lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy. Outside of the facial nerve paralysis, he was neurologically intact, and his physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Further workup was carried out to rule out autoimmune, metabolic, infectious, and vasculitic causes and revealed no abnormality. A chest X-ray showed a right upper lobe opacity which prompted a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest which showed a well-defined, suspected soft-tissue lesion in the right upper lobe with extensive hilar and ipsilateral mediastinal lymphadenopathy (Fig ).\nAt this point, the differential diagnosis included sarcoidosis and primary lung cancer given the presenting complaint was bilateral facial nerve paralysis. Because the intrapulmonary lesion was too distal to be reached by flexible bronchoscopy, video-assisted mediastinoscopy was performed and revealed gross right-sided mediastinal invasion. Multiple biopsies from lymph nodes were taken and revealed metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung. Accordingly, positron emission tomography (PET)/CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were performed to stage the cancer. Brain MRI with contrast showed normal enhancement of the seventh and eighth cranial nerves with neither brain metastasis nor leptomeningeal metastasis. The PET/CT showed a metabolically active right upper lobe lesion with extension into the mediastinum and active ipsilateral mediastinal lymph nodes but no distant metastasis. Due to our high clinical suspicion of leptomeningeal involvement, a lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures and cytology were all negative.

A physical examination was significant for decreased sensation to light touch over the right side of her face and her right upper extremity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain revealed a large heterogeneous skull base mass. Chordoma was suspected over chondrosarcoma, and the diagnosis was confirmed by pathology after tissue was obtained during an endonasal surgical resection. Resection of the chordoma left residual tumor in her lateral skull base at the hypoglossal canal and jugular foramen. She was referred to a proton facility where she received fractionated proton and photon beam therapy: 77.4 Gy total, 59.4 Gy (cobalt gray equivalent) in 33 fractions with protons and 18 Gy in 10 fractions with photons. She was returned to our care afterwards. Scheduled MRIs showed decreasing lesion size through postoperative year 2. However, she experienced acute cranial nerve 6 palsy approximately 2.5 years after surgical resection. An MRI showed a 3\u00d71.5\u00d74 cm mass in the resection cavity with signal change suspicious for dedifferentiation. A subsequent biopsy obtained during a retrosigmoid craniotomy confirmed high-grade sarcoma.

He reported mild irritative voiding difficulties such as urgency, frequency, nocturia, dysuria, a mild low back pain and perineal discomfort. Although there was no urethral discharge, the patient complained of local burning sensation on urination and an itching sensation in the urethra. The symptoms lasted for fifteen days.\nA complete review of systems was unremarkable as well as his medical and family history. The patient's hemogram was normal without leucocytosis. The midstream urine showed microscopic hematuria, pyuria but no bacteriuria indentifying the organism infecting the urinary tract was present. The PSA values were elevated 7,6 ng/ml with a free PSA/total PSA ratio 39%. The transrectal ultrasonography revealed a cystic mass in the transitional zone of the prostate with a solid and a nodular inner portion.\nOn rectal examination, the prostate was normal in size and consistency. The prostatic secretions obtained by prostatic massage showed a number of inflammatory cells (more than 30 white cells per high-power field) but no causative infectious agent was found by culture or other means. Several eggs were observed amongst the inflammatory cells measured 51\u201359\u00d726\u201329 \u03bcm with one convex side (Figure ). The size and shape of the eggs identified them as a group of Enterobius vermicularis. On examination of the prostatic secretions we found a soft palpable material which was 5 mm diameter in size and spherical shape. Palpation gave the impression of a tissue than a stone. An incision was performed in this material and a 4 mm long living worm was found. (Figure ).

She reported previous episodes of exercise independent headaches and nose bleeds. Auscultation revealed no cardiac murmurs, but an accentuated second heart sound and reduced pulses in the lower limbs. There were no clinical signs to suggest Alagille or William\u2019s syndrome or clinical evidence of neurofibromatosis. Blood tests showed normal inflammatory markers and normal creatinine. The urine dip showed no markers for blood or protein. No regular medication was taken at the time she presented. The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, no significant signs of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy or abnormal repolarization. Echocardiography detected a severe concentric LV hypertrophy (14 mm diastolic septal diameter, 15 mm diastolic diameter of the LV posterior wall) and a long hypoplastic segment in the abdominal aorta with massive arterial collateralization. Cardiac catheterization confirmed the diagnosis of a midaortic syndrome with a minimum diameter of <1.5 mm and a gradient of 50 mmHg between the aortic arch and the femoral arteries (Figure ). The narrow part began directly under the diaphragm above the truncus coeliacus and continued down to the bifurcation of the arteriae iliacae including the renal arteries, with reversed flow in the caudal aorta up to the renal arteries. Because of the extraordinary length of the hypoplastic segment of 23 cm, we decided for a stepwise interventional therapy with a paclitaxel covered balloon.

A splenectomy was performed.\nTwo months later, the patient showed clinical signs of recurrent sepsis with a white blood count of 12,000/mm3. CT angiography (CTA) revealed a 60-mm paravisceral aortic pseudoaneurysm at the origin of the celiac artery (CA) (Fig. .\nThe patient was transferred to our tertiary care vascular surgical center. Written consent was obtained from the patient. Placement of a covered stent into the CA was attempted to prevent aneurysm rupture but this was technically unsuccessful.\nThrough a midline laparotomy, the paravisceral aorta was exposed through the lesser sac and the infrarenal aorta was exposed distal to the pancreas (Fig. . The crura of the diaphragm were divided to facilitate aortic clamping. The aorta was clamped proximal to the CA and below the renal arteries. Then, the pseudoaneurysm was opened and all infected tissues and necrotic aortic wall were removed. The reconstruction of the CA was not feasible due to the necrotic tissues and the infected environment.

A computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram was performed, as he was hypoxic, and revealed a 3.6-cm speculated mass within the anterior right upper lobe, partially invading the anterior chest wall. It also revealed mediastinal and hilar adenopathy, an extensive osseous lesion (including compression fracture at T7), and a small pericardial effusion (Figure ). A CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast was performed and revealed a diffuse metastatic disease involving the liver, adrenal glands, spleen, and the bones. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic spine did not reveal spinal cord compression, but it did show the compression fracture at T7 and multilevel thoracic spondylosis. An MRI of the brain revealed a 5-mm lesion in the left occipital lobe, without edema or mass effect.\nThe hematology-oncology team was consulted for an evaluation of the metastatic disease and the eosinophilia. A core needle biopsy was obtained from a liver lesion and the result came back as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung (cytokeratin 7, TTF1, and napsin-A were positive, while cytokeratin 2 and CDX2 were negative). Given his functional status, the decision was made to hold on systemic therapy and start on palliative radiation to the spine for pain control. The plan was to complete radiation sessions and then evaluate his functional status before starting systemic therapy.\nHe continued to have a high WBC count during the admission (Figure ).

At presentation, he was conscious, hemodynamically stable maintaining oxygen saturation at 98% on room air with no visible signs of respiratory distress. His Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was 15, and was able to move all four limbs. The patient had sustained open fracture both bone left leg along with fracture right ankle.\nChest radiograph showed no intrathoracic injury with normal lung parenchyma. Computed Tomography showed burst fracture of fifth lumbar vertebra with canal compromise () and ruled out any injury to head, cervical spine, thorax and abdomen. After primary care, patient was admitted to the orthopedic ward for spine stabilization surgery and surgery for lower limb fracture.\nOn day four post-admission, an emergency consultation call was sent to our intensive care unit (ICU) in view of patient\u2019s deteriorating status. When seen, he was grossly pale and febrile at 101 F, pulse rate of 140 per minute, systolic blood pressure of 80 mmHg and respiratory rate of 32 per minute maintaining oxygen saturation around 90% on oxygen face-mask. Patient\u2019s GCS was 15. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral diffuse coarse crepitation and he was immediately transferred to the ICU.

A physical examination revealed marked right upper quadrant pain with normal bowel sounds. Murphy\u2019s sign was positive. His vital signs were within the normal range. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed an enlarged gallbladder with surrounding fatty tissue inflammation. The blood biochemistry was essentially normal, including C-reactive protein (1.9 mg/dL) and total bilirubin (1.4 mg/dL) levels. An enhanced computed tomography examination revealed an enlarged gallbladder and incarcerated gallstone. Gallbladder wall enhancement was discontinued, and the fundus of the gallbladder was located centrally beyond the round ligament (Fig. ). The round ligament was attached to the right umbilical portion, which was associated with the anomaly of the intrahepatic portal vein system (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography demonstrated the root of the cystic duct, while the middle portion of the cystic duct was unclear (Fig. ).\nWith the preoperative diagnosis of grade II acute gangrenous cholecystitis according to the 2018 Tokyo guidelines or gallbladder torsion, LC was planned. The first port was inserted into the umbilicus, and an enlarged and reddish gallbladder was observed. The gallbladder was swollen; however, torsion was not detected intraoperatively. The second port was placed in the epigastric area, while others were at the right hypochondriac and right lumbar regions. The gallbladder was attached to the left side of the hepatic round ligament (Fig. ). The cystic duct and the cystic artery were located in the normal positions.

These symptoms had become worse around the time of his visit and were accompanied by dysphonia, weight loss, and intermittent aspiration. He complained of foreign body sensation. Various physicians failed to make an accurate diagnosis and the symptoms of the patient continued to deteriorate progressively.\nThe patient had no significant past surgical or medical history other than being a smoker for the past 20 years. There was no abnormality of the tongue and oral cavity including hypopharynx on examination by an otorhinolaryngologist. Clinical examination including neurological examination was normal with no evidence of dysarthria.\nNo intracranial pathology was seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain, done to rule out intracranial pathology. A barium swallow showed that osteophytes were severely protruding at the anterior portion of the 4th\u20136th cervical spine and displaced the lower pharynx and the proximal esophagus anterosuperiorly. In the oral phase, there was no abnormality other than premature bolus loss. In the pharyngeal phase, esophagus was displaced anterosuperiorly with constriction anterior to C5 vertebra.

He had no history of urinary stones and a 5-year history of hypertension with medication. He complained of sharp pain in the left flank and iliac crest areas (). The pain was rated at 10/10 on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Initially, he visited a local clinic and was administered medication for pain control. However, he was referred to our hospital as there was no significant improvement in his symptoms. To evaluate the potential intraurinary causes, he was admitted to the department of urology. Several tests, including routine urine analysis, blood tests, and X-ray were performed. Although there was no evidence of common intraurinary lesions, such as a urinary stones or urinary tract infection, he constantly complained of intense pain. He underwent abdominopelvic computed tomography (APCT), which indicated severe stenosis in the proximal portion of the left renal artery (). There were no abnormal findings in the spinal discs, facet joints and paraspinal muscles in APCT. Renal scan (Tc-99m DTPA [diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid]) was performed to evaluate his kidney function. It revealed that the glomerular filtration rate of left kidney was decreased (). The patient underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, wherein a stent was inserted into the left renal artery. Pain improved by 5/10 on the NRS, after intervention. Two days later he was discharged home.\nHowever, the day after he was discharged, he returned to the emergency room with severely aggravated pain of 8/10 on the NRS and was readmitted to the cardiology department. Flank pain worsened again despite stenting having been performed on the last admission, which was considered the cause of pain.

The patient had no other contributory history including that of fever, acute bouts of cough, coagulopathy, or any other chronic medical or surgical co-morbidity. She was referred for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spinal cord to evaluate the cause of paraplegia on a 1.5 Tesla whole body magnet (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany). An examination was performed on a 1.5 T scanner [] which revealed a mixed intensity complex multilobulated lesion in the anterior epidural space with convex posterior margin, adjacent to the C7-D2 vertebral bodies. The lesion was seen to cause gross compression and displacement of the spinal cord in the region with altered cord signal intensity (extending from C3 to D3 levels) suggestive of cord edema. This raised a suspicion of small anterior epidural hematoma which, however, could not explain the gross compression of cord along with the length of the edematous cord segment. The MRI also showed multiple dilated tortuous vascular channels in the epidural space along with the hematoma, as well as in the paravertebral space. This prompted a computed tomography (CT) angiography [] which confirmed the presen ce of extensive epidural, paravertebral, and chest wall collateral vessels, along with a hypertrophied anterior spinal artery compressing the spinal cord in the cervicodorsal region. The imaging was performed on a 64 Slice MDR CT scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, USA). The collaterals were connected to bilateral internal thoracic, vertebral, and anterior spinal arteries. In addition, the long segment cord edema was probably due to vascular congestive state in the region as a result of slow flow and compression of perimedullary veins by the intraspinal space-occupying lesion hence formed.

JS's medical practitioner (GP) made a presumptive diagnosis of gastric ulcer disease and prescribed Cimetidine, then Lansoprazole and later Esomeprazole to no avail. JS was then advised by her GP to cease all medications and diagnosed functional dyspepsia. With persisting symptoms, the GP opted to prescribe an anti-depressant, Fluoxetine hydrochloride. JS's symptoms persisted and, in addition, she began to experience adverse effects to the Fluoxetine hydrochloride and so this was ceased.

There were over-sensitivity, swelling and minimally elevation of skin temperature on palpation. Range of motion of the left shoulder was 50 degrees of forward flexion, 40 degrees of abduction and 40 degrees of internal rotation. Blood examination revealed the WBC count to be 5110/mm, CRP 19.02 mg/L and body temperature 36.7\u00b0C. Radiographic examination of the left shoulder showed destruction of the joint () and there was dislocation of the joint with a Hill-Sachs lesion on the computerized tomography (). Prior diagnosis was septic arthritis according to these findings. It was also recognized that the patient was diabetic, had similar symptoms on the opposite shoulder 6 years ago, had several surgeries on the right shoulder and had ongoing discharge from a sinus. This history alerted us and a MRI examination of the left shoulder was made which displayed Osteoarthropathic changes and extensive fluid. 250 mL hematoma was depleted by puncture of the joint (). Direct microbiological examination revealed no bacteria and the culture was negative. Thus the prior diagnosis of septic arthritis was cleared off. The elevation of CRP was attributed to discontinuous discharge from the opposite shoulder. The process was considered to be chronic as the temperature of the body and WBC count were normal. When the case history was detailed, it was recognized that he had neck pain and had a diagnosis of syringomyelia. He was out of routine control for several years. A MRI of the cervical vertebrae detected the syrinx (). Consequently, a final diagnosis of Charcot osteoarthropathy of the left shoulder due to syringomyelia was accomplished. The patient was discharged and referred to Neurosurgery for the follow-up of the syrinx and Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation for the rehabilitation of the left shoulder.",

The patient signed a written informed consent before her engagement in the study. The patient was under 5 mg/day Everolimus (Afinitor) for 2 months. According to the patient, the symptoms appeared the first month of medication intake and persisted. The clinical examination revealed the presence of erythema and ulcers, but these did not interfere with the patient\u2019s diet. According to a meticulous examination of the oral cavity, the patient was diagnosed with oral mucositis grade II of the national cancer institute scale (NCI) (). A speech therapy specialist diagnosed the patient with a chronic dysphagia. The NCI assessment scale for oral mucositis and the functional outcome swallowing scale for staging oropharyngeal dysphagia (FOSS) () [] were used in order to assess the severity of the complication before the treatment and after 24 h of each treatment.

In January 2018, a routine gastrointestinal endoscopy found an ulcerative lesion of approximately 10 mm diameter in the greater curvature of the gastric body (Fig. ). An endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) of this lesion showed the first three sonographic layers were blurred, which suggested submucosal invasion.

Additional ultrasonography revealed a sessile polypoid lesion, and gallbladder stone and wall thickening were not observed.

At the beginning of treatment, routine examinations indicated that the level of amylase was 82 U/L, while other laboratory indices and abdominal ultrasound scan were normal.

On examination, general signs of poor health were observed. His blood pressure was 150/60 mmHg and pulse rate 90 beats per minute (bpm). His temperature was 37.3 \u00b0C and he did not appear to be in distress. A physical examination did not reveal any bowel obstruction. His laboratory findings were within normal range except for an elevated white blood cell count (14.5 \u00d7 109/L), slightly low red blood cell count (3.12 \u00d7 1012/L), and slightly raised level of creatinine (124 \u03bcmol/L). His medical history included recent completion of radiotherapy treatment for a Gleason score 9 prostate adenocarcinoma, previous cerebrovascular event, asbestosis, atrial fibrillation, and chronic lymphoid leukemia. His abdominal surgical history included only an open appendectomy 40 years prior. He is a retired marine engineer and lives with his wife. He reported that he did not drink alcohol and had quit tobacco smoking 30 years ago. His family history is noncontributory.\nComputed tomography (CT) of his abdomen and pelvis was performed and demonstrated a peritoneal recess containing multiple small bowel loops over the anterior side of the intraperitoneum lying between peritoneal lining and the transverse abdominis fascia consistent with a pseudoherniation of a preperitoneal subtype (Fig. ). There was no mass or dilatation of bowel loops and no mass to his upper abdominal organs or retroperitoneum.\nIn view of CT abdomen findings, a surgical opinion was sought. As there was no evidence of bowel compromise, he was managed non-operatively.

Pain was progressive in nature and radiating towards the flanks. Pain was associated with fever at times. There was history of passage of loose stool mixed with blood every 10 min, which relieved the spasmodic pain. On inquiry, he revealed similar on and off incidences for the past 12 years . In the past he had undergone colonoscopy examination in other centers and was diagnosed as ulcerative colitis. He was on medical treatment for ulcerative colitis for the past 10 years which did not improve the condition. He had a history of weight loss of more than 15 kg in past 6 years.\nClinically he was pale with poor general condition. He had gross ascites and rectal prolapse. Other systems were within normal limits.\nAs a fresh investigation, repeat colonoscopy and biopsy were carried out. On colonoscopy examination the provisional diagnosis was ulcerative colitis (Fig. ) but the biopsy was reported as nonspecific colitis. No evidence of ulcerative colitis was seen in the biopsy. USG and CT scan of abdomen showed diffuse circumferential wall thickening in the rectosigmoid region of bowel and narrowing of lumen (Fig. ). Wall also showed multiple small \u2018anechoic cystic spaces\u2019 on USG. A provisional diagnosis of ulcerative colitis was suggested.\nConsidering the colonoscopy picture, radiological impression, condition of the patient and lack of response to medical treatment, subtotal colectomy was planned. Preoperative routine investigations showed Hb 6 gm/dl, platelet 76 000/ cu mm, with microcytic hypochromic anemia . All other results were within normal limit. Hartman procedure for subtotal colectomy was carried out (Fig. ).

The patient gave a history of an increase in swelling in the morning and before meals and the swelling usually subsided by evening. On general physical examination the patient was well built and nourished with no relevant past medical history. None of the family members of the patient had reported a similar lesion.\nOn intraoral examination, a fluctuant swelling measuring approximately 1 \u00d7 1 cm in diameter was seen on the lower lip. On palpation, the swelling was nontender, mobile, and soft in consistency. Based on the clinical presentation, a provisional diagnosis of mucocele was rendered. The lesion was surgically excised under local anesthesia and sent for histopathological examination as three soft tissues, white to brown in colour, smooth to rough surface, fluctuant to firm in consistency, and collectively measuring approximately 1.4 \u00d7 1.2 \u00d7 0.4 cms ().\nMicroscopic examination in a low power revealed the presence of numerous ectatic, variable-sized ducts interspersed in a fibrocellular connective tissue stroma (). On higher magnification, the ductal/cystic spaces showed mucin pooling with abundant muciphages (). Associated mucous minor salivary glands showed acinar atrophy with squamous metaplasia of the excretory duct. Areas of hemorrhage were also seen overlying the lesional tissue.\nConsidering the location and the benign clinical appearance of the lesion, the differential diagnosis was narrowed down to four possible lesions: namely, mucocele, lipoma, sclerosing polycystic adenosis, and polycystic dysgenetic disease in order of their frequency of occurrence. These can be easily distinguished histopathologically. Mucocele is unicystic in nature with watery spinnbarkeit nature of material in aspirate, lipoma presents as an encapsulated mass of mature adipocytes, and sclerosing polycystic adenosis exhibits fibrosis and hyperplastic ductal and acinar epithelial elements.

Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging suggested a malignant mass in the prostate, and he underwent transurethral resection of the prostate in February 2015. The pathological results showed acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate with a Gleason score of 3 + 3. In subsequent years, radiological examination showed no recurrence and his prostate-specific antigen level was normal.\nThe patient complained of lower abdominal pain in January 2017. A mass was found in his sigmoid colon by enteroscopy examination. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography examination showed a mass in the sigmoid colon with local lymph nodes invasion and a mass in the right upper lobe of the lung. In March 2017, the patients underwent biopsy of the 2 masses. Biopsy of the colon showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog exon 2 mutation, and biopsy of the lung showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with epidermal rowth factor receptor exon 21 mutation. In April 2017, the patient underwent surgical resection of the right upper lobe of the lung, and postoperative staging showed T1bN0M0 (stage IA). Since the colon cancer presented as unresectable stage III, from May 2017, we gave him 8 cycles of chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX6 regimen (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, leucovorin 400 mg/m2, 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 on day 1, followed by 5-fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 intravenous infusion over 46 hours every 2 weeks) to convert it to resectable colon cancer.
