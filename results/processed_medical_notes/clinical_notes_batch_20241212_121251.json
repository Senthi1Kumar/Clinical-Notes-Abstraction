Twenty seconds after administration of the second 0.2 mg dose of atropine, the PR interval prolonged and the patient developed a complete heart block with a 15-s episode of ventricular asystole due to persistent non-conduction of P waves without ventricular escape ().

During stress, echocardiography showed a wall motion abnormality of the distal septum and anterior apex (present on stress echocardiography 2 years prior), and the ECG did not show ischemic changes. Echocardiography immediately after the syncopal episode showed a decrease in ejection fraction from 62% to 45% that resolved after 75 min.\nThe patient was admitted and 2 h after the initial episode of syncope, telemetry captured another 13.5-s period of ventricular asystole with persistent non-conduction of P waves without ventricular escape or a compensatory increase in atrial rate ().

A physical examination showed a 10\u00b0 varus deformity, a 25\u00b0 flexion contracture, and a limited amount of joint movement in the patient's right knee. There was no neurological damage. Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) images showed a malunited isolated medial condyle fracture in the coronal plane with an intra-articular incongruity (Figure ).\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no ligaments injury in the knee. We planned for corrective osteotomy of the medial femoral condyle (Figure ).\nThe knee was placed in the flexed position for skin incision. An anterior skin incision was made that extends 3 cm proximal to the patella to the tibial tubercle. The medial parapatellar arthrotomy was made 2 cm proximal to the patella, curving along the medial patella and parallel to the patellar ligament to the tibial tubercle, and the distal medial femoral condyle was exposed. An approximately 5-mm step was detected in the medial femoral condyle. The chondral structures, meniscus, and ligaments were in good shape. An osteotomy line was identified with fluoroscopy using two Kirschner wires. Then, corrective osteotomy was carried out carefully. Posterior soft tissue dissection was not performed to protect the blood supply of the femur medial condyle. Therefore, a difficulty was encountered in bringing the osteotomized medial condyle to an anatomical position. This problem has been overcome by hyperflexing the knee and letting the tibial plateau push the medial condyle forward.\nThe condylar osteotomy fragment was fixed by inserting two 4.5-mm headless compression screws from the anterior to the posterior direction of the medial femoral condyle.

The patient had a significant history of septic arthritis of the right hip joint which was managed conservatively in the past. On examination, it was found that the patient had a stable (negative telescopic test) and mobile hip with moderate restriction of abduction (20\u00b0). There was no fixed deformity. There was 7 cm of true femoral shortening. The child walked with a Trendelenburg gait with an added component of shortening which was partially compensated by ankle equinus. Radiological investigations revealed severe coxa vara with the steep acetabular inclination and was classified as Choi\u2019s Type 2 septic hip sequel. Based on this workup, it was found that the child was having abductor lurch and femoral shortening, and both needed to be addressed. The patient was put on a lateral position in the operation theater and proximal femur was opened by a posterolateral approach. The hip abductors were carefully identified at their insertion on the greater trochanter (GT) and also the vastus lateralis distally. Piriformis tendon was also carefully identified. A 2 cm thickness of GT with attached abductors proximally and vastus lateralis distally was elevated with an oscillating saw (). Care was taken to preserve the piriformis attachment on to main femoral fragment. With the help of patella holding clamp, the GT fragment was held and shifted to 2 cm distally and fixed with two 4 mm cannulated cancellous screws. The wound was closed over the suction drain and the patient was then planned for monorail external fixator in the supine position. Gradual distraction was started from the 5th post-operative day ().

    "cleaned_text": "a 13-year-old female patient presented with complaints of painless limp in the right lower limb. the patient had a significant history of septic arthritis of the right hip joint which was managed conservatively in the past. on examination, it was found that the patient had a stable (negative telescopic test) and mobile hip with moderate restriction of abduction (20\u00b0). there was no fixed deformity. there was 7 cm of true femoral shortening. the child walked with a trendelenburg gait with an added component of shortening which was partially compensated by ankle equinus. radiological investigations revealed severe coxa vara with the steep acetabular inclination and was classified as choi's type 2 septic hip sequel. based on this workup, it was found that the child was having abductor lurch and femoral shortening, and both needed to be addressed. the patient was put on a lateral position in the operation theater and proximal femur was opened by a posterolateral approach. the hip abductors were carefully identified at their insertion on the greater trochanter (gt) and also the vastus lateralis distally. piriformis tendon was also carefully identified. a 2 cm thickness of gt with attached abductors proximally and vastus lateralis distally was elevated with an oscillating saw (). care was taken to preserve the piriformis attachment on to main femoral fragment. with the help of patella holding clamp, the gt fragment was held and shifted to 2 cm distally and fixed with two 4 mm cannulated cancellous screws. the wound was closed over the suction drain and the patient was then planned for monorail external fixator in the supine position. gradual distraction was started from the 5th post-operative day (). careful follow-up evaluation was done and distraction was stopped once limb length equalization was achieved (-). the fixator was removed after 112 days. the patient had no complication postoperatively except mild pain during early phases of distraction which was managed with high-dose",

On obtaining a detailed history he admitted to having early satiety for the past three months and nonbilious vomiting and colicky epigastric abdominal pain for the past three weeks. His physical examination was pertinent for pallor and his abdomen was soft and nontender with no apparent swelling or hepatosplenomegaly. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy () was performed which showed a large mass in the gastric antrum obstructing the gastric outlet with a nonbleeding but friable ulcer on top []. Biopsies were sent due to the concern for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST), gastric lymphoma, or adenocarcinoma stomach. A Computerized Tomography (CT) abdomen was ordered to further look into the etiology of the mass and determine the size and presence of lesions elsewhere. The CT abdomen [] revealed a homogeneous submucosal mass of 5 cm x 2.5 cm size. The lesion was in the gastric antrum, homogeneous, and well contained within the gastric wall. There were no lymphadenopathy or remote lesions in the abdomen. This together with endoscopic features of the mass was suggestive of benign gastric lipoma. Surgical referral was done for possible surgical removal; however, it was advised to try to endoscopically resect or at least debulk the mass for palliation of his symptoms before attempting a surgical removal because of patient's debility and comorbidities.\nAfter the failure of initial attempts to do a complete resection, partial piecemeal resection was made with the aim of debulking the lesion to relieve symptomatic gastric outlet obstruction.

    "original_text": "A 44-year-old woman with an extensive history of advanced and refractory endometriosis presented with abdominal complaints associated with a pseudo-obstruction bowel syndrome. She had previously undergone multiple abdominal surgeries, including a subtotal colectomy. She did not respond to ovarian suppression with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, and a recent embolization of both ovarian arteries only achieved a partial and temporal hormonal response. Repeated post-embolization transvaginal ultrasound investigations could only discriminate the right ovary; the atrophic left ovary could not be visualized. Surgical ovariectomy was considered to be high-risk because of extensive abdominal and pelvic adhesions on a diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). She subsequently was referred by her treating gynecologist for radiation to the right ovary in order to achieve a postmenopausal hormonal status. Because the patient suffered from chronic and severe bowel complaints with a need for total parenteral nutrition, extensive pelvis radiation, a historical method for ovarian ablation, was considered contraindicated. MR-guided radiotherapy, a recently introduced advanced technique, was preferred in order to optimally spare the surrounding bowel and selectively treat the right ovary.\nIn preparation of MRgRT, on the day of the initial consultation, a simulation (SIM) MR scan was performed on MRIdian (Viewray Inc., Mountain View, US). The SIM MR scan was acquired in shallow breath-hold in order to restrict respiratory artifacts. The MRIdian uses a 0.35 Tesla magnetic field with a balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP) sequence. In this sequence on the MRIdian, there is heavy T2 weighting, hence the fluid and the ovarian follicles are bright. However, as this acquired SIM MR scan did not take the phase in the menstrual cycle into account, none of the ovaries were clearly detectable.

The patient had no specific medical conditions within her family history. She had no prior history of alcohol consumption and she was a nonsmoker.\nThe patient first experienced symptoms of persistent diarrhea and abdominal pain in 1994. In 1997, she underwent comprehensive testing including stool cultures, gastroscopy, colonoscopy, and small bowel biopsy and numerous blood tests, which ultimately confirmed very active small bowel CD and a small patch of colitis at her terminal ilium, palpable hemorrhoids, lactase deficiency, and shallow duodenal ulcers.

    "original_text": "A previously healthy 60-year-old male was referred to the outpatient clinic due to atrial fibrillation. The patient reported pain in the lower left leg for 3 weeks followed by right-sided chest pain and dyspnea for 2 weeks. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a dilated right atrium (RA) with a large longitudinal thrombus (1\u20131.5 cm \u00d7 15\u201320 cm) fluctuating through the tricuspid valve (). The patient was stable and had no signs of right or left ventricular strain. Treatment with rivaroxaban 15 mg \u00d7 2 was initiated, and he was admitted to our center with suspected multilevel VTE: deep venous thrombosis (DVT), RA thrombus, and acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Computed tomography confirmed PE in the lower right pulmonary artery with associated pleural effusion. TTE and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) confirmed the RA thrombus. Ultrasound revealed a large DVT in the left femoral vein stretching from the popliteal to the iliac vein. The patient was switched from rivaroxaban to unfractionated heparin (UFH) 5000 IE bolus followed by infusion starting at 1000 IE/hour and monitored by APTT. APPT remained in the lower range (maximum 77) treatment despite increasing doses of UFH to a maximum dose of 1900 IE/hour.

The pain was located at the hypogastrium and intensified after the ingestion of a meal. The patient also complained about postprandial urgency for defecation which temporarily worsened the pain. Finally, the pain was totally relieved after defecation. He did not mention any other symptoms including fever, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, weight loss, rectal bleeding.\nThe patient stressed that his symptoms had begun a few days after the inadvertent ingestion of a toothpick, which was had been concealed in a fast-food potato by his friends for a joke. He reported that he bolted the potato without chewing, and although he was informed about the joke he never saw the toothpick in his stools. Shortly after that event, he suffered from postprandial abdominal pain and urgency for defecation. He sought for medical help at the emergency department of a city general hospital, but due to the negative results of the examinations, the symptoms were attributed to irritable bowel syndrome. Thereafter, the patient was accustomed to the postprandial abdominal pain without treatment. When he joined the army, progressive worsening of the severity and the frequency of the abdominal pain led him to the emergency department of our hospital.\nHis past medical history was unremarkable for significant illness including previous abdominal surgical procedures. The patient did not take any medications; he was a smoker (20 cigarettes per day) and consumed small amounts of alcohol infrequently (20 g once or twice a week). Physical examination revealed a nervous, healthy, well-nourished young man, with normal vital signs without any clinical findings except for a mild discomfort to deep palpation of the hypogastrium.

Ultrasound diagnostic demonstrated pericardial effusion and a dissection membrane in the ascending and descending aorta (Fig. ). The patient was immediately transferred with the diagnosis of a DeBakey Type I Aortic dissection. Further comorbidities included arterial hypertension, renal insufficiency stage 4 with a history of kidney transplant 2014 after preeclampsia after childbirth 2007, among others.. Initial consensus was found to minimise the operative risk for the mother and to perform surgery leaving the fetus in vivo and choosing an optimal operative strategy with a mild hypothermia and arch inspection to limit the period of circulatory arrest to an absolute minimum. After conferring with the pregnant mother however, she decided to deliver the baby via caesarean section despite the early phase of prior to aortic repair. To minimise the perioperative risk of bleeding the patient consented to an operative hysterectomy before heparinisation for the establishment of extracorporal circulation.\nSurgery was performed on the day of diagnosis in a collaborative manner, with induction of general anaesthesia immediately prior to caesarean section performed via a Misgav Ladach operative technique and subsequent supracervical hysterectomy. The fetus was immediately transferred to the neonatal paediatricians, the initial body weight was 690 g with an APGAR 2/4/6 and a naval pH of 7.19.. After semi-closure of the abdomen we proceeded with the surgical treatment of the aortic dissection. Arterial cannulation was established via the right subclavian artery, mild hypothermia was targeted and exposition of the aorta and supraaortic vessels was achieved.

Taking into account these data, we thought it unlikely that he had some inflammatory disease and/or autoimmune disorder such as collagen disease. Since his blood glucose level was relatively low and the number of eosinophils was relatively high, we examined the possibility of adrenal deficiency.

After a multistage limb salvage procedure which required vascular repair and soft tissue reconstruction, she presented to our clinic more than a decade after the injury. The patient stood 1.6 m and weighed 64.8 kg, with a calculated Body Mass Index (BMI) of 25.3. She acquired a leg length discrepancy of 30 mm, right shorter than left, had right hip pain, walked with a limp and complained of symptomatic hardware about her hip (Fig. ). She underwent a proximal femoral osteotomy and placement of a 10.7 mm antegrade PRECICE\u00ae expandable femoral IMN (Fig. ). Although she required four units of pRBC transfusion post-operatively, she tolerated the procedure well with no other complications. The femur was left in situ after the osteotomy to allow surgical wounds to heal.\nTen days post-operatively, she followed up with uncomplicated healing wounds to begin her lengthening, 1 mm per day for a goal of 30 mm total lengthening. She was followed weekly with physical exams and plain film radiographs (Fig. ). After four weeks of lengthening, physical exam demonstrated equal iliac crest height on standing and symmetric rotation. Bilateral long leg Weight-Bearing (WB) plain films demonstrated that the right femur was within 2 mm of length compared to the left femur (Fig. ) and regenerate was visible in the osteotomy gap. There was some backing out of one of the distal interlocking screws.

The diarrhea was self-limiting and he was treated only with antipyretic drugs. Ten days later, he felt muscle weakness in both upper and lower extremities. Proximal weakness in his arms resulted in difficulty in lifting them above his shoulders, and in his legs in difficulty climbing stairs and rising from a low chair. During the following days weakness also appeared in his distal arm muscles, and gradually increased in his upper and lower leg muscles until our patient became severely disabled. Three days prior to admission, our patient complained of muscular pain in both his legs, low back and shoulders.\nOn admission, seven days after the first symptoms occurred, our patient's mental status was normal and cranial nerves were not affected. Both nerves innervating the proximal and distal muscle groups were affected in the upper and lower extremities resulting in symmetric proximal and distal muscle weakness which ranged between 3 and 4 on the Medical Research Council (MRC) grading scale. Deep tendon reflexes were normal, with the exception of both triceps brachii reflexes which were abolished. Pathological reflexes were also absent. There was no sensory nerve dysfunction and no sphincter disturbances (Quantitative Sensory Testing, Semmes-Weinstein monofilament, 128 Hz tuning fork).\nElectrophysiological investigation was performed three weeks after the beginning of the first symptoms. Electromyography (EMG) revealed polyphasic neuropathic muscle action potentials with reduced interference pattern and compensatory motor unit potentials in the proximal and distal muscles of his upper and lower extremities. The amplitude of motor evoked potentials was slightly reduced for both peroneal and right mediana and for the ulnar nerve.

On examination, there were small erosions and ulcers present on the soft palate and bilaterally on the buccal mucosae. The patient had been under the care of Dermatology since 2003 for an itchy rash on the legs, scalp and chest. A biopsy from a crusted lesion on the scalp (Fig. ) in 2003 revealed acantholysis of the keratinocytes in the upper part of the prickle cell layer (Fig. ), and direct immunofluorescence studies showed IgG positivity around the upper epidermal cells. These features were consistent with a diagnosis of PF. He was started on Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) 500 mg twice a day and Prednisolone 10 mg once a day by Dermatology in 2006, which had resulted in excellent control of his cutaneous lesions. Prior to this, Azathioprine alone had been introduced on two occasions by Dermatology, however the patient failed to tolerate it due to nausea and vomiting. Oral involvement only began in January 2008 which required hospital admission for a short period.\nHis only other relevant medical history was hypertension, for which he took Nifedipine. At initial presentation, he was also taking Ranitidine and Alendronic Acid for protection against osteoporosis with prolonged systemic corticosteroid use. He was a non-smoker and had low alcohol intake.\nAt initial appointment, MMF dose was increased to 1 g in the morning and 500 mg in the evening for 2 weeks, and thereafter 1 g twice a day. Full blood count, urea and electrolytes and liver function tests were normal, and regular blood monitoring was carried out appropriately.

Her previous pregnancy was ectopic for which she had laparotomy and salpingectomy.\nAt presentation, she was investigated and it was found that she had anovulatory infertility. She was placed on clomiphene citrate and became pregnant following the second course of the drug. Early scan done revealed twin pregnancy at 9 weeks of GA and she was registered for antenatal care. Her antenatal visits were unremarkable until GA of 17+1 weeks when she presented with drainage of liquor and subsequently expelled the leading twin. Umbilical cord was ligated high up in the cervix. Urgent scan done revealed that the remaining twin was viable with a separate placenta. Endocervical and high vaginal swabs were collected and sent for microscopy, culture, and sensitivity. She was placed on intravenous Augmentin (amoxycillin and clavulanic acid) and metronidazole for 3 days and then changed to oral forms for another 7 days and her vital signs were closely monitored. Vaginal swab microscopy, culture, and sensitivity were done at intervals and antibiotics given based on the result. Full blood count was equally done and was normal. She later opted to be discharged from the hospital. She was seen in the antenatal clinic every two weeks and ultrasound was done at each visit. Full blood count, prothrombin time, and fibrin degradation products estimation were equally done during the follow-up visits. At the gestational age of 30 weeks, the patient presented with bleeding per vaginam which was spontaneous. Scan done revealed viable fetus with EFW of 1.77 kg and showed that the bleeding was from the placenta of the expelled fetus.

The dose was reduced by 50% while she was treated with prednisone for the cutaneous symptoms. However, upon taper of steroids, her skin manifestations returned with a limitation of ambulation secondary to hyperkeratotic lesions on feet, so the dose was further reduced by 25% at week 8.\nAfter a total of nine months of treatment, whole body PET/CT and MRI scan of the head demonstrated a complete response and the vemurafenib was discontinued due to cumulative toxicity.

The migraine headache was described as pulsatile, bilateral, and on the forehead, persisting from a few hours to half a day.

She took oral loxoprofen 60 mg to treat the headache, on average, <15 days a month, which did not meet the standard of mediation-overuse headache. The tension-type headache was followed by muscle stiffness from the shoulders to the neck and was exacerbated by fatigue. The frequency of pain attacks was one per week. The duration was 1 or 2 days. The headache was bilaterally located, of pressing quality, was not aggravated by walking, not associated with nausea and photophobia.\nEight days before admission, the patient had engaged in farm work. During this work, she reported that grass fragments had entered her right eye while operating a mower. She experienced strong pain and a foreign body sensation but stated that there had been no bleeding or inflammation. The next morning, she reported general malaise and a persistent pulsatile headache on both sides of her forehead, accompanied by a fever of 38.5\u00b0C by the evening. The headache was accompanied by nausea and occasional vomiting; it was aggravated by turning her face downward and was not associated with photophobia and phonophobia. The effect of loxoprofen was inadequate and lasted only a few hours. The symptoms gradually worsened over the following 3 days, and the nature of the headache changed to a pain that tightened around the whole head.

The result was satisfactory in that a normalized standing and ambulation was achieved. The aesthetic sequelae consisted of the presence of longitudinal scars in the anterior surface of both knees extending to the distal third of anterior thigh and proximal third of the pretibial area. The patient showed a marked asymmetry in contour and volume of both legs. The soft tissue coverage was rated as normal but showed a significant lack of compliance in her right leg. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed no significant vascular abnormality but confirmed the extreme atrophy and asymmetry in muscle bellies of both legs. The patient was informed about the need to perform at least two sessions in order to expand soft tissues without having untoward results.\nDuring the first session, 270 cc of adipose tissue was grafted in her right leg, 170 cc to in left leg, and 20 cc were distributed under and inside the scars. The distribution of injected fat covered the whole girth in her right leg and was more selective in her left leg. The scars were grafted at different levels in order to obtain a better shape and texture. There was no intramuscular infiltration at any level. Six months later, a second session was performed in which 320 cc of fat were grafted to the right leg, 170 cc to the left, and 20 cc were used to treat scars. Pre- and postoperative images show a marked and stable improvement in contour, volume, symmetry, and scar quality after 16 months (Figure ).

Patient's electrocardiogram () showed normal sinus rhythm; right axis deviation; and T-wave inversion in leads III and V1\u20134. Her pulse rate was 110 beats/min. Subsequently, transthoracic echocardiography in the emergency room revealed left atrium enlargement with an evidence of left atrial mass prolapsing through the mitral valve during diastole. The enlarged left atrial mass was probably attached to the interatrial septum. In addition, there were signs of mild eccentric mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Left ventricle was of normal size with intact ventricular septum. The patient was further analyzed by transesophageal echocardiography. It revealed large left atrial mass attached to the interatrial septum (size: 6.6 \u00d7 3.1 cm; ), with mobility into and out of the left ventricular inflow. Of significance, another mass was also evident in the right atrium (size: 1 \u00d7 1 cm; ). Mitral valve appeared structurally normal.

There was no recent traumatic event that she could recall. She was placed on seven-day course of prednisolone drops with resolution of her symptoms for approximately four weeks. However, her symptoms recurred and she was again treated with another short course of mild steroid drops with minor alleviation of her symptoms. Two days after this, her symptoms returned and, thus, she was referred to ophthalmology for a concern of a chronic foreign body of the left cornea.\nOn examination, her vision was 20/20 bilaterally with intraocular pressures of 17 and 14 mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively.

A 7 mm soft-flow aortic cannula was placed on the ascending aorta. Bicaval venous cannulation was performed with 22 Fr cannulas. The patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass with vacuum assisted venous return. An aortic cross-clamp was placed and cardiac arrest was achieved by cold blood antegrade cardioplegia. Snaring down the vena cavas, the right atrium was opened longitudinally. A retrograde cardioplegic catheter was placed into the coronary sinus for intermittent cardioplegia administration. The incision was extended to the left of the right auricle toward the left atrium posteriorly. There was a 2 cm-length foramen ovale type atrial septal defect.
