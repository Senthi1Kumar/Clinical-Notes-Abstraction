    "original_text": "A 29-year-old male patient who complained of pain and swelling around the popliteal area and symptoms of common peroneal nerve palsy in the right lower leg was referred to our service. The patient had a medical history of re-revision of ACL reconstruction using a transtibial technique for femoral tunnel in the right knee 6 weeks ago in another hospital. The initial ACL reconstruction was performed 9 years ago with an Achilles tendon allograft after the patient had injured his knee during a soccer game. Revision was performed four years ago with an Achilles tendon allograft under the diagnosis of re-ruptured ACL that occurred during a basketball game. The patient's past history revealed popliteal fossa pain that started from the night of the 3rd operation (re-revision ACL reconstruction). The pain became aggravated on the 2nd postoperative day, sudden swelling of the popliteal fossa was noted and symptoms of common peroneal nerve palsy developed. The surgeon who had performed the re-revision surgery could palpate the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arterial pulses and concluded that the patient had intact circulation and that the paralysis could be the result of inadequately long post-operative leg splinting. The patient was required to rest for 6 weeks. With no sign of pain and swelling subsiding, the patient was referred to our hospital.\nOn arrival, the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibia arterial pulses were palpated. Vital signs, including blood pressure, were within normal limits, and the results of blood gas analysis were normal. Dorsiflexion power of the right ankle was observed as grade 1-2 with 80% sensory loss compared to the contralateral limb. Ankle brachial index and toe pressure were not measured before surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomographic (CT) angiography were performed for evaluation.\nMRI findings showed abundant hematoma in the popliteal fossa and CT angiogram showed pseudoaneurysm of the popliteal artery and leakage of administered dye at the level just superior to the medial and lateral superior genicular artery",

He had no other atherosclerotic risk factors except for tobacco abuse. On physical examination, blood pressure was 90/70 mmHg and pulse was 130/min. Bilateral crepitant rales were heard along the lungs. The patient had 1 + edema in both legs.

A venous blood sample showed hypercholesterolemia and a sedimentation rate of 81 mm/hour. Based on these findings, transthoracic echocardiography was performed and revealed a 44 x 31 mm mass in the left atrium.

Multiple aspects of her personalities were reported, including the following: a personality of a seven-year-old child, a personality that would behave as a teenager, and another that acted like a male person in addition to her normal 55-year-old personality. She reported that she had been constantly dominated by her alternate personalities and became aware of their existence when people around her informed her, usually after a situation ended. She reported that stressful situations and substance abuse could aggravate the fragmentation of her personality. This was found to be mostly an involuntary phenomenon with seldom memory of the event.\nWhile transitioning between these personalities, she was found to be violent even to people who were close to her. This could range from being suicidal to homicidal for which she was arrested twice in the past. She had to be isolated and restrained by being locked in a room and calling the police. As a result, she was hospitalized in a mental institution for a significant period at least two to three times in the past. Under the influence of stress or substances like marijuana or cocaine, her personality would split into various personalities. These states were very different from one another in terms of age or gender.\nOne of her alternate personalities behaved as a seven-year-old child and would show the same interests and choices that included becoming moody or a self-arrogant personality.

The physical examination of the patient demonstrated insignificant swelling but no effusion in her knee, and the active range of motion was 70\u00b0 of flexion and 10\u00b0 of extension deficit. Her neurovascular examination was normal. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score was 38 and visual analogue scale score (VAS) was 8 (0 best, 10 worst). There were no signs of infection clinically, and serum laboratory analyses were within reference values.

An early transvaginal ultrasound in first trimester did not report any adnexal masses. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a large 9 cm left ovarian mass that was multiloculated with nodule thickening of septas and of the wall with a positive Doppler flow inside. The CA 125 assay was 50 IU/L. A diagnostic laparoscopy was proposed to the patient due to the concern of possible borderline or even malignant tumor, but she declined this procedure. At 24 weeks, a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) without contrast was performed as the patient refused gadolinium injection. The heterogeneous mass had not increased in size (7.7 cm). The solid component exhibited an intermediate T2 weighted signal and a high diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) signal, suggesting the possibility of a borderline component (). There was no ascites, peritoneal carcinomatosis, lymphadenopathy, nor any signs of compression. CA 125 and MRI remained unchanged at 28 weeks.\nGiven the absence of symptomatology and the stable imaging, the pregnancy was prolonged until an acceptable level of prematurity, as recommended by the French national multidisciplinary network for the management of pregnancy-associated cancers.

During his last catheterization and stent procedure, which took over 4 hours (approx. 33 mSv), he developed a radiation-induced injury to his right back around the T10 dermatome (). During the following years, the burn was closely followed at an outside facility, and the area developed a chronic nonhealing ulcer which continued to evolve over time eventually growing outward from his back and developing a foul odor on his presentation to our facility in 2017. He reported increasing pain at the periphery of the tumor margin. Up to a year prior to presentation, the area was flat and biopsies revealed no evidence of malignancy. Upon presentation to us, however, the physical exam demonstrated a fungating mass approximately 5 \u00d7 9 cm with central purulent necrosis and induration surrounding the periphery (Figures \u2013). No additional nodularity or adenopathy was found on physical exam initially.

He had also a history of deep neck pain for 3 months, but it had been disregarded. A review of patient's medical history revealed that he had an acute myocardial infarction 2 years before, which was treated by percutaneous coronary angioplasty. The patient had a 30-year history of cigarette smoking and opium use. Physical examination showed a firm, well-defined swelling measuring about 3 \u00d7 3 cm in the body of the mandible on the right side. The skin over the mass was normal in color and texture. No palpable submandibular and cervical lymph node was evident.

Orthopantomograph as observed in revealed multiple multilocular radiolucencies in the left side of mandibular body and ramus area involving coronoid and condylar process. There was thinning of inferior border of mandible. Posterior border of ramus and right side of mandible appeared normal. Coronal slice of computed tomography (CT) scan showed expansion of medial and lateral border of the left side of ramus with thick and curved bony septa and homogenous density []. Axial slice CT at level of mandible showed soft tissue mass in left side of mandible with complete destruction of buccal and lingual plates and remnant of bone within mass extending into adjacent soft tissue with loss of flat plane []. From these clinical and radiographic findings, differential diagnoses of ameloblastoma or odontogenic keratocyst were considered. Fine needle aspiration was carried out, but it did not yield any fluid.\nTo obtain a specific diagnosis, an incisional biopsy was done.

He was a keen rugby player and had experienced an avulsion fracture of the AIIS during a rugby game which was played without a warm up six months previously. MRI just after injury showed a single bony fragment measuring 12 mm \u00d7 4 mm \u00d7 12 mm at the rectus femoris origin of the AIIS and it was retracted inferiorly 3 cm, anteriorly 1 cm and laterally 0.5 cm. Conservative treatment was advised by the Paediatric Orthopaedic Surgeon and he was referred to a physiotherapist for mobilisation and subsequently muscle strengthening.\nFive months post-injury he was progressing well with the physiotherapy, although, he still felt a sharp pain in his left groin when running with a ball while playing rugby. Flexion was restricted to 70\u00b0 and a decrease in internal rotation in comparison with the opposite side was observed while abduction, adduction, extension and external rotation were comparable to the other side. There was no significant tenderness and no bruise in the region of the groin, and no distal neurovascular deficit. Plain radiographs demonstrated hypertrophic calcification in the region of the rectus femoris avulsion, whilst the hip joints were normal in appearance. A CT scan showed well corticated heterotopic bone formation at the site, measuring approximately 3.5 cm at maximum diameter (). Motion analysis using the three-dimensional CT datasets clearly showed the impinging area especially in 70\u00b0 of hip flexion.\nBoth conservative and surgical management were suggested and discussed with the patient and his parents.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to identify if there is an accompanying injury, which revealed a complete tear of the patellar tendon and complete tears of the ACL and the medial collateral ligament (MCL) at the femoral attachment sites, and increased signal intensity in the lateral meniscus led us to suspect an injury to the meniscus ().\nAt 6 days after injury, primary suture repair of the patellar tendon with ACL reconstruction was carried out. The patellar tendon repair preceded the ACL reconstruction. Initially, a 10cm longitudinal skin incision extending from the middle of the patella through the center of the patellar tendon to the tibial tuberosity was made to expose the ruptured patellar tendon. The patellar tendon was completely torn in the midsubstance, the torn end had a frayed mop-end appearance, and the tear extended to the medial retinaculum (). Taking consideration into the shape of the torn end and the distally narrowing anatomical shape of the patellar tendon, the torn end was longitudinally divided into three equal sections, and three core sutures of the patellar tendon were determined.

He had sought treatment from a local bone setter for four weeks following which pain and swelling decreased, but the deformity and elbow stiffness had persisted, for which he attended our hospital.\nOn examination, the Beighton hyperlaxity score of the patient was 5/9. There was flexion deformity of the elbow joint and wasting of muscles of the arm and forearm. The olecranon process was displaced from the olecranon fossa of the right humerus and an abnormal bone mass was palpable on the anterior aspect of the distal humerus. There was a flexion deformity of 40 degrees of the elbow joint with further flexion of 70 degrees. Pronation and supination were normal. There was a valgus laxity of the right elbow joint. The differential diagnoses were neglected dislocation of the elbow joint (posterior/anterior) and mal-united supracondylar fracture.\nAntero-posterior and lateral radiographs of right elbow demonstrated an anterior dislocation of the elbow joint with an anterior bone mass at the distal humerus. The bony anatomy of the elbow appeared unclear on radiography, and a Computed Tomogram (CT) with 3D reconstruction () confirmed an anterior dislocation of the right elbow joint with a bony projection from the anterior border of the distal humerus.

She was found to have on an average of four to five episodes of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) per year during the same period. She was apparently well until about two years ago when she started developing LRTI which was initially treated with various antibiotics including fluoroquinolones, beta-lactam antibiotics and macrolides at different walk-in clinics. Chest X-rays obtained before the presentation were normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest which was obtained at our hospital revealed right lower lobe focal cylindrical bronchiectasis.

Repeat sputum cultures grew pseudomonas aeruginosa every time. She was managed symptomatically with airways mucus clearance and fluoroquinolones as needed.\nHistory for pulmonary childhood infections, immunodeficiency, severe allergies and other risk factors for bronchiectasis was negative. Serum immunoglobulin G subgroups and immunoglobulin E levels were normal arguing against immunodeficiency and ABPA. Upon closer review of the computed tomography of the chest, a possible endobronchial lesion was noticed resembling a polyp of about half a centimeter in length (Figure ) at the right lower lobe posterior segment.

He first noticed the ulnar deviation in his early twenties. Initially he had no associated pain and he still had full function of his hands and therefore did not receive treatment. Three years prior to presentation he developed pain at the base of both thumbs and approximately 4 months priorly he began to have a significant increase in pain in his left 2nd and 3rd metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints as well as in both 1st carpometacarpal (CMC) joints. He also began to notice some wasting in the muscles between his thumb and index fingers. As an active surgeon, he noted minor difficulty with some instrumentation such as hemostat use when in the OR. Symptomology was treated with over the counter anti-inflammatory medication.\nThe patient has two brothers (aged 54 and 53) that are affected, one brother that is not affected (age 45), and two sisters that are not affected. Both parents are deceased but the patient did not believe that they had any ulnar deviation of their fingers. The patient also has three children, none of which show hand abnormalities. By report, neither of the patient's affected brothers have any pain or other arthritic symptoms associated with their hands.\nOn physical exam bilateral adductor wasting was noted bilaterally with greater changes on the left hand. No symptoms of numbness in the ulnar nerve distribution were encountered. He has hyperextension of the PIP joints that is worse on the left side giving a mild swan neck impression of the digits.

A noteworthy finding in this prosthesis was a maxillary right central incisor root remnant, which had been covered by soft tissue and remained for five years underneath the pontic site (). The radiographic and clinical evaluation showed no inflammation, dehiscence, external root resorption, or any known pathologies, and the arch form was maintained without any sign of ridge deformation. It was evident that a submerged root of the maxillary right central incisor had prevented bone resorption, especially in the interproximal area. Due to the severe secondary caries, the prognosis for the maxillary right lateral incisor was poor: it was thus submerged as a root remnant at the pontic site. The tooth was endodontically treated due to the periapical lesion, then decoronated at a crestal bone level similar to that of the maxillary right central incisor.

On examination the patient was depressed and dressed in male attire but had female fat distribution. The growth parameters were normal with height of 163 cm and weight of 58kg. Pubertal assessment showed breast development & pubic hair tanner stage IV. Genital examination revealed a phallus of 6cm with redundant labia majora.

Fifty years previously, he had undergone a gastric bypass operation with a loop gastrojejunostomy to treat stenosis caused by a duodenal ulcer.\nHis medical history included chronic renal failure (managed with hemodialysis), right idiopathic pleural effusion, third degree AV block (managed by a pacemaker), and myelodysplastic syndrome. As of 2006, chronic gastric hemorrhage had been observed at the GE anastomotic site, and endoscopy was performed. In June 2012, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a slightly irregular mucosa surrounded by a smooth elevated area at the stomal site. The irregular mucosa was biopsied, and a papillary and tubular adenocarcinoma were diagnosed. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed that the tumor extended to the muscularis propria. CT showed an enlarged lymph node on the lesser curve of the stomach, which is suggestive of metastasis. However, the gastric wall did not appear thickened, which can occur secondary to neoplasia, and there was no indication of distant metastasis. The cancer was diagnosed as T2 N1 M0 stage IIB according to the TNM classification. Since the patient already had poor systemic function, surgery carried a very high risk of morbidity and mortality. Similarly, cancer chemotherapy could not be initiated. The surgeon repeatedly discussed the treatment options with the patient who ultimately elected surgical excision to avoid potential obstruction and hemorrhage at the stomal site. In October 2012, a distal gastrectomy, a small intestinal partial resection (afferent and efferent loops) and a Roux-Y reconstruction were performed.\nDuring the laparotomy, hepatic sclerosis and ascites were observed.

He first presented in September 2007 with the chief complaint of cough and left sided abdominal pain. Physical examination was significant for splenomegaly. His labs were significant for pancytopenia. A bone marrow biopsy in September 2007 was significant for 100% cellularity and sheets of atypical cells positive for CD138 and lambda light chains consistent with multiple myeloma. Protein electrophoresis showed a monoclonal spike (M spike) and an elevated IgD level of 190 mg/L. A diagnosis of IgD multiple myeloma was made and he was initially started on dexamethasone and later in October 2007 thalidomide was added to his regimen. Patient had intermittent lapses in his thalidomide treatment because of his insurance issues and his IgD level slowly kept rising. In July 2008 his IgD level was found to be 293 mg/L. A bone marrow biopsy performed in July 2008 was significant for 5% plasma cells by immunohistochemistry. He was continued on dexamethasone and thalidomide. A repeat bone marrow biopsy in July 2009 showed 40% plasma cells. At that point bortezomib was added to his regimen to reduce his tumor burden and he was referred for autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Patient only took 50 mg of thalidomide instead of usual 100 mg. His repeat bone marrow biopsy in February 2010 showed persistent multiple myeloma with 20% monoclonal plasma cells with overall cellularity of 60%. In March 2010 his IgD level increased up to 531 mg/L. At that point his thalidomide dose was increased to 200 mg daily. Patient was having issues with compliance. Eventually, he underwent autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) on January 2011 after 6 cycles of salvage CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) chemotherapy.

Local findings comprised a depression on the anterior surface of the right knee and a bony protuberance immediately distal to this. The right knee was swollen. No signs of trauma were seen, such as skin abrasions or subcutaneous hemorrhage. In terms of imaging findings, plain frontal radiography of the right knee showed inferior displacement of the patella with a fracture line on the lateral condyle of the femur (). Lateral radiography showed that an osteophyte on the superior pole of the patella had become impacted in the femoral trochlea (). No rotational abnormality of the patella was evident. The inferiorly dislocated patella was easily reduced when the knee was gently extended and was accompanied by a grating sound. Patellar reduction was confirmed on plain frontal and lateral radiography. Lateral radiography also showed an osteophyte on the superior pole of the right patella with a floating bone fragment nearby (). Sagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the insertion of the femoral quadriceps tendon was not detached and no rupture of the tendon was present.

His abdomen showed generalised distension and tenderness along with rigidity. The bowel sounds were diminished. His investigations revealed a haemoglobin of 11.6 gm% and white cell count of 16,200/mm3 with 80% neutrophils. The serum electrolytes and serum creatinine were normal. An erect chest X-ray showed free gas under the diaphragm and abdominal X-ray showed multiple air fluid levels with ground glass appearance in pelvis. Computed tomography (CT) revealed dilatation of small bowel loops with thickening of one of the loops. Free fluid along with air pockets was seen in the peritoneal cavity. An emergent laparotomy was undertaken through a right supra-umbilical transverse incision. This revealed presence of faeculent fluid in the peritoneal cavity and dilated bowel loops. The appendicular stump, caecum and colon were unremarkable. Thorough examination of the bowel failed to reveal any perforation. A tubular structure measuring 3-cm in length was found floating freely between distended small bowel loops; this was retrieved. A through lavage was given and a drain was placed in pelvis. Postoperatively the boy made a slow but satisfactory recovery and was discharged on day 7. A superficial wound infection he developed was treated by laying the wound partially open and dressing it.

She was apparently well until about two years ago when she started developing LRTI which was initially treated with various antibiotics including fluoroquinolones, beta-lactam antibiotics and macrolides at different walk-in clinics. Chest X-rays obtained before the presentation were normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest which was obtained at our hospital revealed right lower lobe focal cylindrical bronchiectasis.

Serum immunoglobulin G subgroups and immunoglobulin E levels were normal arguing against immunodeficiency and ABPA. Upon closer review of the computed tomography of the chest, a possible endobronchial lesion was noticed resembling a polyp of about half a centimeter in length (Figure ) at the right lower lobe posterior segment. Flexible bronchoscopy was performed revealing thick yellow-green secretions originating from the right lower lobe with an endobronchial lesion in the posterior segment at the same level as the CT scan abnormality.

Her physical examination and laboratory findings were within the normal range. An elevated right hemidiaphragm with hypoplasia of the right lung and a shift of the heart to the right side was seen on a routine chest X-ray. Her electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with normal ventricular rate response. Echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular systolic function and a normal left atrial diameter. We detected an increase in the systolic PA pressure (PAP=60 mm Hg) with normal right ventricular function. Lung scintigraphy showed a heterogeneous and decreased perfusion in the right hemithorax compared to the left side. We decided to perform computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA), since the chest X-ray was abnormal, to exclude the chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). CTPA revealed an absence of the right PA and dilated left and main PAs. Through magnetic resonance angiography of the aorta and PA, we confirmed the absence of the right PA and its branches, together with any additional anomalies. We performed right heart catheterization and coronary angiography to exclude coronary artery disease. The PAP as measured was 55/25 mm Hg with a mean value of 36 mm Hg and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 15 mm Hg. Pulmonary angiography also showed an absence of the right PA with a dilated left PA and the vasoreactivity test was negative.

He had no history of cranial radiation during childhood or clinical features of neurofibromatosis type I or II. He underwent gross total surgical resection. Pathologic evaluation, which was recently re-reviewed, showed an atypical meningioma with the following features: hypercellularity with sheets of monotonous meningothelial cells displaying a prominent mitotic activity with around 4 mitoses per 10 high power fields. In May of 1997, follow-up brain MRI revealed a recurrence in the vicinity of the original tumor bed. Surgery was performed with gross total tumor removal. Pathologic evaluation again showed meningioma with similar pathologic features. In September 1999, he developed multiple small tumor recurrences in the parietal, occipital and cerebellar lobes for which he underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with excellent results on tumor control. In September 2001, the patient developed additional recurrent lesions in multiple sites in the infratentorial, retroclival, left optic nerve sheet, and foramen magnum regions.\nHe was again treated by stereotactic radiosurgery with good tumor control defined as a complete disappearance or progressive decrease in lesion size. In June 2003, he received further SRS treatment to new cerebellar, premedullary and craniocervical junction lesions. In February 2004, he developed numerous lesions outside previously treated sites and was given whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) of 36 Gy as a palliative therapy because of the multiplicity and the progression of the brain lesions. Surprisingly many of the small lesions disappeared after WBRT and the patient remained asymptomatic until August 2005 when he developed left facial numbness. Brain MR imaging at that time showed a recurrent lesion in the left cerebellopontine (CP) angle, an area that was previously treated by SRS and WBRT. He was given 10 sessions of stereotactic radiotherapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) and achieved a good partial response but this lesion grew back and",

She was admitted to the internal medicine department. A cardiologist was consulted because of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and an enlarged cardiac silhouette on her chest X-ray. On physical examination her blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg with a heart rate of 120 beats/min. She had engorged jugular veins and an enlarged liver without peripheral oedema. Her ECG showed atrial fibrillation and low voltage. No Q waves were noted. An echocardiogram showed a large pericardial effusion of more than 30 mm and a swinging heart (Fig. ). The left ventricle was small and hyperdynamic without wall motion abnormalities. There was no collapse of the right ventricle. The inferior vena cava was dilated without inspirational collapse. Because of imminent cardiac tamponade a pericardiocentesis was performed with the immediate evacuation of 800 cc of haemorrhagic pericardial fluid.

The edema had begun at the ankles 35 years previously when she was pregnant. According to the patient, the edema worsened at the end of the day. Over the years, the edema spread to the hands and wrists and currently affects the entire body causing abdominal discomfort at the end of the day. Over the years, the patient sought several medical specialists to reduce the symptoms of edema. However, no effective results were obtained in spite of the therapeutic approaches, mainly with diuretics. She was referred to the Cl\u00ednica Godoy, Brazil, where the medical history was taken and a physical examination was performed. Generalized edema was identified, especially in the lower limbs, which was present in the early morning and worsened during the day especially on hot days. Another important fact reported by the patient was the weight gain of 1 to 2 kg by the end of the day. A bioimpedance test was performed using the In Body S10 apparatus, which detected a large amount of extracellular fluids in the entire body and intracellular fluids at the upper limit of normality. By bioimpedance, the volume of fluids in the lower extremities and trunk was above the upper limits, as was the ratio between extracellular fluids and total fluids which characterizes edema (). The upper limbs had a higher than normal volume of fluids, but without characterizing edema. After analysis, the diagnosis was idiopathic cyclic edema, clinical stage II lower limb lymphedema, lipedema stage I and excessive weight. Calcium dobesilate b.i.d. was prescribed and after four days another bioimpedance was performed that showed a significant reduction of the fluids of the upper limbs and trunk that was within the range of normality for the whole body.

    "original_text": "Twenty-four-year-old morbidly obese African American gravida 1, whose pregnancy was complicated by poorly controlled asthma, was subsequently admitted fourteen times over the duration of her pregnancy for medical stabilization, seven of those admissions being in the first trimester alone. At 30 weeks gestation the patient was admitted for asthma exacerbation, and a chest X-ray was performed. A well-circumscribed 0.64 \u00d7 0.59 \u00d7 0.64 radio-opaque lung nodule was identified on a posterior/anterior view (). When the patient was initially questioned about the foreign body in her left main stem bronchus, the patient stated that she had swallowed her tongue piercing. The patient went on to say that this was her third tongue piercing in a 15-month time span; all others were swallowed incidentally as well.\nGiven the patients' poor respiratory status now complicated by an aspirated foreign body, pulmonology was placed on consult to assist with management. The risks versus benefits of bronchoscopy in the antepartum period were discussed in detail with the patient as well as a physician team that was involved in the care of this patient. It was decided that the combination of poorly controlled asthma and anesthesia is needed for the proposed bronchoscopy; the risk of respiratory failure was too high for the mother who was only at 33 weeks gestation at that time. Surveillance of the fetus was done with serial ultrasounds on a biweekly basis and nonstress tests were done on a daily basis. Estimated fetal weight was consistently found to be at the 40th percentile adjusted for gestational age, with no signs of fetal distress on daily fetal testing. Eventually at 35 weeks the patient was induced for maternal indications due to a deteriorating respiratory status and went on to deliver vaginally a liveborn male infant without complications. The placenta that was delivered was noted to have very large calcifications (some as large as three to four centimeters in diameter), which confirmed the degree of hypoxia that occurred during this",
