This patient has a history of smoking (30 pack-year) and consuming alcohol for more than 30 years (approximately 200 ml per day). He was diagnosed as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 20 years ago and had been treated with methylprednisolone for 17 years. For the last three years, his SLE status has been stable and thus, he discontinued the SLE treatment.\nThe patient reported that the tumor in the middle of his lower lip had appeared for a year and gradually increased in size without any pain or bleeding. He did not receive any treatment because of his financial issue. For the last few months, the tumor had rapidly grown, bled and become painful, so that he could not eat or clean his teeth.\nOn examination, there was a 3 x 4 cm, raised, ulcerous, and bleeding tumor, developing in the lower lip and expanding to 1/3 external upper lip (). The submental lymph node was around 2 cm in diameter, firm, and hardly moveable. Ultrasound revealed a suspected metastatic submental lymph node with absent echogenic hilum. MRI Scan demonstrated a lesion in lower lip with size of 13 x 31 mm, which increased in T1W signal and T2W signal, strongly enhanced after contrast and did not invade surrounding tissue. A 2 cm and round lymph node was also identified (). The fine needle aspiration (FNA) result of the lymph node presented a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma and the biopsy result of the tumor confirmed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). No abnormality was detected by a metastatic work-up. Therefore, the clinical staging of this patient was cT2N1M0.

On examination, blood pressure was 137/71 mmHg and 113/56 mmHg in the right and left arms, respectively. Her left hand was pale and cold with an absent radial pulse on the left (). An audible subclavian bruit was present on the left side. Downbeat nystagmus and a right falling tendency during tandem gait were observed. No motor and sensory deficits were shown. No musculoskeletal abnormalities that could have been implicated in compression of the subclavian artery were evident.

Transabdominal US imaging identified an echogenic uterine mass and thickening of the endometrial stripe suggestive of endometrial malignancy []. Color Doppler US revealed hypervascularity of the endometrial mass []. The patient was referred to a gynecologist, where several endometrial biopsies were taken.

Past medical history was only remarkable for ulcerative colitis and there was no significant past surgical or family history. Around March 2018, she started having increased watery diarrhea with occasional blood (10-12 bowel movements per day from a baseline of 1-2 bowel movements per day) as well as cramping abdominal pain. She went to see her gastroenterologist in clinic. On physical examination, she had diffuse tenderness to palpation of her abdomen. Stool studies including stool cultures, stool ova, and parasites were sent which were negative. ESR and CRP levels were elevated. Therefore, she was thought to be in a moderate to severe ulcerative colitis flare based on the current criteria and was prescribed budesonide multimatrix (MMX) 9 mg once daily. Her abdominal pain improved but the diarrhea persisted. She then received a course of oral prednisone 40 mg daily for one month without any improvement of her symptoms and was subsequently started on infliximab therapy. Prior to initiating infliximab therapy, an interferon gamma release assay, hepatitis panel, varicella zoster antibody, and HIV tests were done which were negative.

The referring pediatrician told his father that he has a palpable testis in his right inguinal canal but no palpable testis on the left side. Apart from a clinically evident right irreducible hernia and empty both hemiscrota, the rest of the examination was unremarkable. After initial resuscitation with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, an urgent operation was undertaken. On inguinal exploration, the hernia sac was found to contain a viable cecum and small bowel loops. After reduction of the contents to the peritoneal cavity, the right testis was found in the inguinal canal. However, a second testis was unexpectedly delivered through the deep inguinal ring. Both testes have independent spermatic cords, i.e. two separate sets of vas deferens and testicular vessels on either side of a T- shaped structure resembling an infantile uterus and fallopian tube (Fig. ). Because of the shortness of the spermatic cord and the vague nature of this anomaly for the operating surgeon, only a biopsy was taken from both testes and all the structures were returned back to the peritoneal cavity followed by herniotomy.\nPostoperative pathology showed normal testicular tissue bilaterally with absent ovarian structures. Karyotyping was done for the patient and revealed a normal 46XY male karyotype. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed at the age of 6 months, which showed a closed left internal ring on the left side and a widely open internal ring on the right side. In addition, the left sided testis and spermatic cord were found joining their counterparts on the right side through the rudimentary uterus close to the right internal ring.

The onset was insidious and there was no history of injury, smoking, diabetes, peripheral vascular, and cardiovascular disorder. There was no visible swelling but localized pain and tenderness over the volar aspect of distal phalanx of the little finger. The neurovascular status was intact in the affected upper extremity. There was also the history of pain increasing on cold temperature, when a fan or air conditioner is on and during winters, On palpation, pinpoint tenderness was noted when the volar pulp was given pressure with a blunt pin. The nails were normal without any pain or discoloration. The patient had normal radiographs and patient was referred for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the finger. The MRI revealed a 14 \u00d7 3.5 mm altered signal intensity lesion in the soft tissue of the distal phalanx on the volar aspect best seen on sagittal T1-weighted images as T1 hyperintense lesion with heterogeneous hypointensity on fat suppression []. The lesion was closely abutting the distal phalanx cortex but without any cortical breach noted. The MRI was suggestive of glomus tumor and the excision biopsy was planned. The volar midline incision centered over the lesion was made under aseptic preparation and finger tourniquet, A glistening bluish-colored soft tissue lesion was found and that was removed en bloc with careful dissection []. Hemostasis was achieved and the wound closed after ensuring the excision of the lesion in its entirety so that to decrease chances of recurrence.

The patient is conscious, cooperative, hemodynamically stable, complaining of severe pain in the left hip, being unable to stand or bear weight on the left lower limb, which appears abducted and externally rotated, with no signs of any peripheral neurovascular lesions. In the groin area, an ovoid formation of hard consistency can be detected by palpation. Clinical and laboratory examinations exclude other coexisting abdominal, thoracic, neurological or musculoskeletal lesions.\nAn X-ray examination of the pelvis () and a CT scan of the hip () are performed and they confirm the diagnosis of type IB Epstein anterior hip dislocation associated with displaced intertrochanteric fracture of the femur.\nAn emergency surgical treatment was applied in less than 3 hours since the trauma occurred. The hip dislocation was reduced under general anesthesia and the intertrochanteric fracture was also reduced and internally fixed with a dynamic hip screw (DHS).\nUnder general anesthesia, a lateral approach of the hip was used, extended proximally and slightly anterior. After the superficial layers are incised, the femoral head is identified and reduced into the acetabulum by hand. Under fluoroscopic control, the intertrochanteric fracture was also reduced and internally fixed with DHS attached to a side plate with 5 screws. At the end of surgery, the stability of the hip is checked by performing a 90 degrees flexion of the thigh, internal-external rotation and abduction-adduction.\nPostoperatively, the patient is kept at rest in bed for 6 weeks and antithrombotic prophylaxis is initiated.

She demonstrated total right-sided hemiplegia with power grade zero of four, loss of sensation with hypertonia, and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes.\nFamily history was negative for similar conditions. The patient was delivered normally at 36 weeks of gestation; however, her mother had not followed prenatal and postnatal care advice. The patient was admitted and was resuscitated, which normalized her vital signs to 120/68 mm Hg for blood pressure and 90 heart beats/minute. Urgent radiological investigation including brain and neck computed tomography with and without arterial phase contrast was performed. A bilateral absence of the internal carotid arteries was seen with a complete bilateral obliteration of the petrous bone carotid canals. Multiple collaterals were seen communicating with the anterior cerebral circulation that was supplied by an enlarged posterior communicating artery (POCMA) from a basilar artery (BA) and carotid rete mirabile from the external carotid artery (Figures and ). Further radiological workup including magnetic resonance imaging with arterial (MRA) and venous (MRV) contrast enhancement of the brain and neck showed infarction of the left cortical area at the region of the central sulcus. No intracranial or extracranial aneurysms were seen, the flow to the superior sagittal sinus was normal, and there was no evidence of venous flow attenuation, thrombi, or venous occlusions.

He had progressive dyspnoea and a history of syncope on exertion. The transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed severe stenosis of a BAV with a peak velocity of 3.9 m/s (peak gradient 61 mmHg, mean gradient of 39 mmHg and area of 0.89 cm2). There was also the presence of moderate aortic regurgitation. Coronary angiography revealed non-flow limiting coronary artery disease. MSCT confirmed a Sievers Type 1 bicuspid valve with a partial raphe between the right and left cusps. The aortic annulus was large with a perimeter measuring 98 mm, mean Sinus of Valsalva diameter of 40 mm and an inter-commisural distance of 29 mm (Figure ). Both common femoral arteries were of large caliber and measured 8 mm on the left and 9 mm on the right. Following discussion by the Heart team and careful analysis of the MSCT it was felt that TAVI was technically possible if deployed at the inter-commisural space.\nTAVI was performed under local anesthetic and the right femoral artery was cannulated and a 20 Fr sheath was inserted. The left femoral artery was cannulated and a 7 Fr sheath was inserted. The left femoral vein was used for insertion of a temporary pacemaker lead. The bicuspid aortic valve was crossed retrogradely using a Amplatz Left 1 diagnostic catheter and a hydrophilic coated straight tipped Glidewire. This was exchanged for a pre-shaped Safari wire and placed in the left ventricular apex. A balloon valvuloplasty was performed using a 25 mm balloon and a simultaneous aortogram was performed.

The pain was relieved by taking an analgesic. He was in the normal state of health before one month. On initial evaluation, the temperature was 37\u00b0C, blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg, heart rate was 91 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20/minute, and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. On physical examination, the patient was healthy and appeared oriented and alert with intact cognition. His skin, extremities, and pulses were normal. However, the patient was anxious with frequent blinking of eyes. On neurological examination, his power, and coordination, and gait were intact, and his toes were down going. The sensation was intact bilaterally, and the reflexes were intact on both sides of the body. His cranial nerve examination was also unremarkable except ophthalmic nerve and eye examination. The patient was noted to have strabismus and diplopia. There was no evident deformity on his face or eye, and he did not have any muscle weakness. He had no history of previous trauma or fall.\nImaging studies were performed, and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a homogenous hyperdense and enhancing mass in the pineal region (Figure ).\nThe patient underwent endoscopic biopsy of the pineal region, which demonstrated cells with highly pleomorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei. A significant increase in mitotic activity was detected. There were many vessels but no area of vascular proliferation and necrosis. Granular bodies with eosinophilia were identified.

Previously she took treatment from local general practitioner, but symptoms did not relieved and lesion progressed with watery discharge turned to pus. On acquisition of detail clinical history, we found that she was married at the age of 16 and was wearing for 34 years saree with knot at same place. The lesion started initially as irritation, hyper pigmented and scaly small patch. Then gradually lesion increased in size with watery discharge. After applying ointments and completing course of antibiotics advised by local physician, lesion did not subsided and hence referred to our center. Her past medical and surgical history was unremarkable. She was not suffering from diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and any other major illness.\nClinical examination revealed a non-healing ulcer () on left side of waistline measuring 6\u00d73 cm with everted edges, rolled up margins and serosangious discharge from the thick indurate ulcer bed. On palpation ulcer was firm, tender and bleed on touching, surrounding skin was hypo pigmented and scaly. Inguinal lymph nodes were palpable and tender.

On physical examination, there were no palpable nodules, although cervical US revealed a single hypoechoic nodule (19 mm in diameter) in the left lobe. Doppler showed the presence of peripheral and central flows. US-guided thin-needle biopsy was suspicious for follicular cancer. The patient had a history of breast cancer that had been diagnosed and treated nine years prior and was being followed up by an oncologist; she was also undergoing clinical treatment for hypertension, lactose intolerance, and psoriasis. The patient was euthyroid. A new US was performed during the preoperative period and showed a single hypoechoic nodule (now 23 mm in diameter two months after the first US) in the left lobe, with a regular contour, microcalcifications, and the absence of lymphadenomegaly. The left lobe was accessed using the conventional technique to determine whether the RLN was below the inferior thyroid artery (ITA) and followed until its entrance into the larynx. The left lobe was removed without complications, preserving the laryngeal nerves and the parathyroid glands. Frozen section biopsy revealed papillary carcinoma, and thyroid resection was indicated for this patient. To access the right lobe, the standard approach to the nerve below the ITA was also used, but the right RLN was not found along its usual course, and the dissection had to be advanced in the cephalic direction. An NRLN was identified and exposed parallel to the ITA. The nerve was fully identified and followed from its origin in the vagal nerve until its entry into the larynx. Along its path, the NRLN was completely enveloped by thyroid tissue from the right lobe in the region of the ZT immediately after its path became parallel to the thyroid artery (). The patient did not present with laryngeal motor abnormalities or hypocalcaemia and is under treatment with oral thyroid replacement hormone.",

His medical and dental history did not show any significance or any relation to his lesion. The patient had been a smoker for 33 years. Intraoral examination revealed a destructive ulcerative lesion around the upper left first and second molars, which showed mobility and poor dental conditions, including dental caries, gingival recession and bone loss (Fig. a). A panoramic radiograph revealed a radiolucent area in the periapical region of the upper left first molar, suggesting an osteolytic lesion (Fig. b). According to the clinical and radiographic features, the main diagnostic hypotheses were periodontal disease associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma. The patient reported that there was no cancer in his family history. The results of laboratory analyses, including blood and urine studies, were within the normal range.

No history of allergies and no history of smoking or alcohol abuse were present. Past medical history was only remarkable for ulcerative colitis and there was no significant past surgical or family history. Around March 2018, she started having increased watery diarrhea with occasional blood (10-12 bowel movements per day from a baseline of 1-2 bowel movements per day) as well as cramping abdominal pain. She went to see her gastroenterologist in clinic. On physical examination, she had diffuse tenderness to palpation of her abdomen. Stool studies including stool cultures, stool ova, and parasites were sent which were negative. ESR and CRP levels were elevated. Therefore, she was thought to be in a moderate to severe ulcerative colitis flare based on the current criteria and was prescribed budesonide multimatrix (MMX) 9 mg once daily. Her abdominal pain improved but the diarrhea persisted. She then received a course of oral prednisone 40 mg daily for one month without any improvement of her symptoms and was subsequently started on infliximab therapy. Prior to initiating infliximab therapy, an interferon gamma release assay, hepatitis panel, varicella zoster antibody, and HIV tests were done which were negative. On 4/13/2018, she received her first dose of infliximab 500 mg based on her weight of 100 kg (5mg/kg).

He had a history of diabetes mellitus treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was diagnosed with background diabetic retinopathy. Examination using a Snellen chart showed a visual acuity of 6/12 in both eyes, meaning that he would need to approach to a distance of 6 meters to read letters that a person with normal acuity would be able to read at 12 meters. The patient noticed pain and swelling of his left eyelid at that time, and developed headache and vomiting 1 week later. Five days before admission, he developed patchy erythema with clustered vesicles with varying sizes on his left forehead and upper eyelid. On the day of admission, he developed drooping of the left upper eyelid, and was admitted to the infectious diseases ward with a diagnosis of HZO in the distribution of V1 on the left side, complicated by superficial punctate keratitis.\nThe patient was initially treated with intravenous acyclovir (500 mg every 8 hours), topical antiviral ointment (acyclovir 3%), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to relieve the pain caused by severe swelling and erythema of his left upper eyelid. On day 4 of admission, the inflammation of the left upper eyelid had resolved, but he was still unable to elevate the eyelid. Physical examination showed markedly crusted skin lesions in the distribution of V1 on the left side, with a positive Hutchinson\u2019s sign and complete levator paralysis. Examination of the extraocular movements with the eyelids held open showed near-complete ophthalmoplegia on the left side (Figure a). His visual acuity was 6/12 on the right side and 3/60 on the left side. He had anisocoria with the left pupil, which was poorly reactive to light and accommodation, measuring up to 6 mm in diameter.",

In 2005, because of work-related stress he began to drink heavily in the evenings, consuming 250 to 500 ml of spirits.

After 3 years of these symptoms he changed to a less stressful driving job and was able to gradually decrease his drinking without serious withdrawal symptoms.

She was a normal healthy child with a noncontributory medical history. However, she gave a dental history of trauma at the age of 4 years and loss of her left deciduous central incisor. She presented with a middle mixed dentition with normal overjet and overbite and an end-to-end molar relationship. Anterior incisor space was reduced due to the mesial drift of the erupted permanent left lateral incisor. The right central and lateral incisors had erupted at the appropriate time. Clinical examination, including labial and palatal palpation was performed. Intraoral radiographs were advised which revealed the presence of a mesiodens and a central incisor crown. For higher accuracy of localizing the position of the mesiodens and the root of the permanent tooth, vertical and horizontal shift radiographic views and a maxillary anterior occlusal radiograph were advised. These radiographic series indicated the presence of a well formed, labially placed mesiodens, with its long axis vertical in the alveolus, high in the anterior space. The root of the mesiodens was in close approximation to the permanent tooth crown. Placed high in the alveolar bone was a malformed central incisor, with a rudimentary root, placed at an angle to the crown. The unerrupted mesiodens showed a sufficiently long and straight root with a fairly flat crown favorably positioned for guiding into position ().\nConsidering the age of the patient, clinical and radiographic findings, and the following treatment was decided upon. Guiding the mesiodens to the edentulous area could provide a unique advantage of bridging the anterior space and prevention of the use of a prosthesis at such a young age.

He presents with bilateral amaurosis, which began insidiously 4 years prior, with no associated triggers and no previous studies to identify the cause. Psychiatric family history was denied.\nHe began his current condition with persistent visual and auditory hallucinosis, with a predominance of the former. He referred seeing his previous partner, from whom he had separated two and a half years prior and whom he had no contact, adding that she visited him at his house, would sit on his bed and talk to him. These episodes lasted several minutes and occurred continuously throughout the day, occurring more frequently in low-light environments. It is worth mentioning that he was fully aware that this phenomenon was not real and he referred to it as part of a disease, however, it caused him discomfort and sometimes agitation.\nAfter the complete vision loss he initiated with depressive symptoms which consisted of sadness, anhedonia, fatigue, weight loss and low self-esteem, later adding recurrent thoughts of death. Family members mentioned that he began with personality changes such as constant irritability, impulsivity and behavioral changes regarding personal hygiene and dressing, lasting weeks without taking a bath, a situation that had never happened before. For this reason, he was taken to a psychiatric evaluation and was hospitalized for diagnosis and treatment, initially admitted with an unspecified non-organic psychotic disorder.\nDuring the initial assessment, an ophthalmological and neurological alteration was found, being unable to perceive light in both eyes, with preserved eye movements, both slightly mydriatic pupils and bilateral hyposmia.

The surgical scar was observed on the post-ramus swelling, and there was fistula in one end of the scar that was about 0.5 cm in diameter [Figures and ].

Neurological examination revealed no motor loss due to severance of any branch of facial nerve in the affected side. Location of the fistula and nature of the discharge suggested a laceration of the right parotid gland substance resulting in a sialocele and a right parotid fistula formation.

    "original_text": "A 45-year-old male presented to our hospital, having been previously treated at another institute. Spme nine days prior, he had developed severe chest pain following retching. A chest x-ray then had showed a hydropneumothorax. Emergency intercostal drainage (ICD) insertion was done and a water-soluble contrast study had showed a leak from the lower oesophagus []. An endoscopic stapling was performed at the other institution where he was managed and that leaked on the third postoperative day. The patient presented to us with septic shock on day nine following the original perforation. A CT scan showed a free leak into the pleural space with a large collection. A new ICD was inserted, but it failed to clear the pleural space. We then decided to proceed with thoracoscopic mediastinal toilet. The patient was administered general anaesthesia with a double-lumen endotracheal tube. He was placed in the lateral decubitus position. A thoracic epidural catheter was placed for postoperative analgesia. A working port was established in the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line and two other 5 mm ports were placed. A 30 degree telescope was used for the procedure. A thorough mediastinal toilet was given []. The site of the perforation was identified but was too friable for attempting any form of closure. Local decortication was done. The thorax was drained with two IC drains. A laparoscopic-assisted feeding jejunostomy was carried out. At the end of the procedure, a left-sided cervical loop oesophagostomy was performed. The entire procedure lasted 150 minutes and blood loss was approximately 300 cc. No ventilatory support was required postoperatively. Jejunostomy feeds were started on the second postoperative day. On the fifth postoperative day, the patient was off IV antibiotics and on full jejunostomy feeds. During the course in the hospital he developed lower zone consolidation, which was treated with aggressive chest physiotherapy and IV antibiotics. The cervical oesophagostomy was closed two months after endoscopic [] and radiological confirmation",
