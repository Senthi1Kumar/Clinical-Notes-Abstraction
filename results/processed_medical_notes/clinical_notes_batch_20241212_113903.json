His pain did not respond to methadone, hydromorphone, cyclobenzaprine, gabapentin, pregabalin nor lidocaine patches. Previous interventional therapies provided only temporary, if any, relief. These included neurolysis of the celiac plexus, neurolysis of the superior epigastric nerve, 12th intercostal nerve, and paraspinal trigger point injections. Given, his lack of response, the decision was made to move forward with a trial of intrathecal medication in preparation for a possible intrathecal drug delivery. At this time, he was receiving oral long acting morphine 100 mg three times daily, oral morphine 30 mg every 6 h as needed, tizanidine 4 mg three times daily as needed, and amitriptyline 25 mg every evening. The intrathecal drug trial was successful leading to the implantation of an intrathecal delivery system. During the implantation, the intrathecal catheter was successfully placed through a Tuohy needle at L3-4. In the course of the Tuohy removal, the epidural portion of the catheter was sheared. The fractured portion could not be removed. The decision was made to leave the sheared catheter in place. A second catheter was successfully placed at the same level and connected to the pump.\nIn the immediate postoperative period, the patient reported about 50% pain relief but 10 days after the procedure, he began to experience orthostatic headaches, nausea, vomiting, and the development of a painful lump in his right paraspinal lumbar area. The physical exam was unremarkable for any neurological deficits, but a tender mass was palpable in the left paraspinal area at L3-4.

Because the ascending aorta was unsuitable for arterial cannulation, the surgeon elected to perform axillary cannulation via the right subclavian artery with side graft anastomosis. The patient arrived to the operating room (OR) with nicardipine and esmolol infusions running through an 18-gauge peripheral intravenous (IV) line in the right antecubital (AC) fossa. Prior to induction of anesthesia, we disconnected the infusions from the right AC and administered medications though an 18-gauge IV in the left forearm. The patient also had a left radial arterial line (AL), and we placed the pulse oximeter and noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) cuff on the RUE. After intubation, we placed a right radial AL, and the surgeons placed a left femoral AL. All arterial pressures correlated closely. Additionally, a 9-French central line was placed in the right internal jugular vein. The patient was cleansed and draped for surgery with her arms tucked to her sides.\nShortly after the procedure began, the right radial AL tracing went flat, and the pulse oximeter waveform was lost. We attributed this to the surgeon partially clamping the right subclavian artery in preparation for arterial cannulation. We switched the pulse oximeter to the left hand and relied on the left radial and femoral AL for pressure readings. Just prior to arterial cannulation, we noted that the right radial pressure returned, although about 20 points lower than the left radial/femoral. Immediately after initiating CPB, the right radial mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased to 200 mm Hg, and left radial/femoral MAP decreased from 60 to 30 mmHg.

Clinical examination revealed a convergent strabismus fixus with severe hypotropia of both eyes (Fig. ). The patient complained of increasing loss of eyesight and heavy retrobulbar pain. Visual acuity had deteriorated significantly from 0.6/0.5 to 0.1/0.1 within 3 months. A contrast enhanced orbital MRI scan showed distinct swelling of all extraocular muscles with bilateral compression of the optic nerve (Fig. ). There was no history of comorbidities except nicotine abuse. Laboratory tests showed a euthyroid biochemical status with TSH within the normal range, but elevated levels of Anti-Thyroid Peroxidase Antibody, Anti-Thyroglobulin Antibody and Thyroid Receptor Antibody. The patient\u2019s daily medication comprised of 200 \u03bcg L-Thyroxin and 200 \u03bcg Selenium.

The year before she had experienced an episode of chest pain, but she did not seek medical attention at that time. Upon arrival a full work-up was initiated and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed chronic DeBakey type I aortic dissection and aneurysmal degeneration of the aortic root measuring 7.74 cm and descending thoracic aorta (measurement 6.05 cm in maximum diameter) in axial view associated to a spiral dissection extending to both common iliac arteries (\u2013). Interestingly the patient had a bovine aortic arch with left carotid artery emerging from the innominate artery; the dissection followed the inner curvature of the aortic arch and it did not extend to the supra-aortic vessels. Aneurysmal degeneration of the aortic arch was not present (). An echocardiogram confirmed aortic valve insufficiency. She was taken to the operating room for Bentall and De Bono procedure, replacing the aortic root and valve with a mechanical prosthesis, the patient was discharged home on postoperative day nine on systemic anticoagulation. Two months later, she underwent endovascular treatment of descending thoracic aorta using a 200\u00d740 mm Zenith (Cook Inc., Bloomington, IN, USA) thoracic stent-graft that successfully isolated the aneurysm from the circulation. The distal thoracic aorta measured 3.3 cm and infrarenal portion 2.9, the decision was to maintain the patient under close surveillance. She was carefully followed in our institution by a multidisciplinary team, continuing her antihypertensive medical management with optimal blood pressure control.

    "original_text": "The patient is a 68-year-old male, immigrant to the US from Iraq, where he was a sheepherder. He has a long-standing medical history of echinococcal hydatidosis and known hepatic cystic disease for more than 30 years. He had been treated previously with cystectomies and hepatic lobectomy in his native country. Prior surgical treatment was complicated by intraoperative contamination and dissemination of the disease to the peritoneum and pelvis secondary (). Repeat exploratory laparotomy for palliative control of the extensive peritoneal and pelvic cystic disease was not curative and he was placed on lifetime maintenance therapy with albendazole. Serum titers against echinococcal antigen by an IgG-ELISA and cross-sectional imaging when necessary were employed to monitor disease status and response to therapy. Patient also has a 50-pack-year smoking history but otherwise has an unremarkable medical history. A routine abdominal CT scan obtained in late 2008 to monitor disease status revealed an incidental finding of a right lung base opacity. Dedicated chest CT confirmed a 2.5 \u00d7 1.6 cm right lower lobe nodule along the infrahilar region with possible post-obstructive atelectasis (). Whole body PET scan showed high FDG uptake in the perihilar soft tissue mass with SUV of 7, consistent with primary bronchogenic carcinoma. There were no foci of distant tumor metastasis but FDG-avid hydatid cysts were noted in the peritoneal and pelvic cavities. A biopsy of the lung lesion obtained via fiber optic bronchoscopy confirmed the presence of non-small cell lung cancer, favoring adenocarcinoma () with clinical staging of T4N0M0 (AJCC 6th edition).

    "original_text": "The patient was a 73-year-old man who was followed up for left shoulder pain for 1 year in another hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed because of progression of signs and symptoms, such as backache and lower limb weakness. Muscle weakness level was 4 in the manual muscle test, with slight difficulty of gait and muscle atrophy of the interossei dorsales muscle bilaterally. The patient complained of a moderate glove-and-stocking-type numbness on the four limbs. The MRI scan showed an area of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images in the C5 region (). At discovery, the tumor was protruding into the spinal canal from the left side of the C5 vertebral body and pressed the dura mater from the front. The neurological symptoms were ascribed to the compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots by an expanding mass partly protruding into the vertebral canal (Figures and ). The metastatic lesion was found on neither the technetium bone scan () nor the positron emission tomography. The patient was treated with surgical resection of the tumor, followed by reconstruction in two stages. As the first stage, a posterior approach was selected for decompression. No heavy ion radiotherapy was performed because the tumor massively invaded into spinal canal and foramen, compressing the spinal cord and nerve root directly. Total laminectomy was performed for C4, C5, and C6. All the posterior elements, including the superior and inferior articular process and pedicles of C5, were resected by using piecemeal spondylectomy with air burr and Kerrison rongeurs.

He had an uneventful postoperative course with no history of delayed wound healing or persistent drainage. Four years later, he presented with a 2-month history of a gradually developing painless swelling over the anterior aspect of the operated knee; the swelling was associated with a small sinus that was extruding a straw-coloured fluid. He had no history of fever, decreased appetite, or weight loss. He had no other musculoskeletal, respiratory, or systemic symptoms of note. He had no history of antecedent trauma, recent travel, or contact with infectious diseases. The patient is a known hypertensive, but the blood pressure was well controlled with treatment, and he is otherwise healthy. He is a retired teacher with no history of involvement in activities requiring excessive kneeling. He is ambulatory in his community and can walk comfortably with the assistance of a cane.\nThe patient's general physical examination results were within normal limits; positive physical findings were limited to the involved knee. There was an anterior knee swelling involving mainly the prepatellar area, approximately 7 cm in diameter, fluctuant, and not tender to palpation, with minimal surrounding erythema; the erythema was present mainly at the punctum. The punctum was draining a yellowish discharge on pressure (). There was no bony tenderness at the patella, distal femur, or proximal tibia. There was no detectable knee effusion, instability, or crepitus. The range of motion was well preserved (5\u2013110\u00b0), as it was a prosthetic knee.

He was severely hypoxic (SpO2: 80 under O2 15 L/min by oxygen mask) and hypotensive (systolic blood pressure: 80 mmHg) on admission. In the emergency department, we performed intubation into the right main bronchus through guided bronchoscopy; this was followed immediately by right side one-lung ventilation as portable chest radiography showed consolidation in the left upper lung. Bronchoscopy showed that the trachea was almost obstructed by haemorrhage and haematoma. He experienced cardiopulmonary arrest immediately after the airway was maintained. However, spontaneous circulation was restored by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Contrast computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an aortic aneurysm at the aortic arch, which penetrated the upper lobe of the left lung (Fig. A,B). We suspected that it would be difficult to perform emergent surgery because of the patient\u2019s poor general condition. Furthermore, we believed that there was no indication for endovascular stenting due to the following reasons: (1) the root of the left brachiocephalic artery was close to the penetrating portion of the aneurysm, at a distance of 12 mm. Thus, there might have been a high risk of obstructing blood flow to the brachiocephalic artery; (2) a risk of aortic injury might have been induced by stenting because the aortic arch was highly calcified. He was admitted to the intensive care unit, and we controlled blood pressure using nicardipine and discontinued anticoagulation therapy and performed platelet and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion for haemostasis. Bleeding from the APF decreased gradually due to astriction by haematoma.

She complained of small nodules in the left parotid region that had developed over the course of 2 years. Her main complaint was of recurring periods of worsened symptoms characterized by the exacerbation and remission of gland volume that was possibly triggered by occasional otolaryngologic infections or unrelated to these infections. These symptoms suggest juvenile recurrent parotitis. Facial panoramic radiography revealed the presence of multiple circular radiopaque masses in the left parotid region (Fig. ). The ultrasound revealed increased volume of the left parotid, with imprecise borders, heterogeneous echotexture with hypoechoic and hyperechoic areas within it. These features were suggestive of an inflammatory process associated with calcifications in the parenchyma of the gland. CT scan revealed a dense mass in the left parotid; it was heterogeneous and included calcifications in its center (Fig. ). Because of the association between the patient\u2019s clinical history, her clinical presentation, and the imaging findings, the possible origin of the calcified materials was questioned. There was evidence of sialoliths or dystrophic calcification associated with recurrent inflammation/infection. Sialoliths are typically symptomatic because of their association with secondary bacterial infections, which are generally treated with systemic antibiotic therapy. Spontaneous remission of bacterial sialadenitis associated with sialoliths is not expected. In addition, sialoliths generally observed as oval-shaped calcified masses or fusiforms on imaging. Because of the pediatric nature of this case, the clinical conduct selected to treat this patient was clinical follow-up and the use of imaging and functional assessments of the gland affected every 6 months or when any signs and/or symptoms appeared. After 48 months, the patient is asymptomatic, without periods of exacerbation of the condition. Recent ultrasound (Fig. ) demonstrates an improvement in the inflammatory aspect of the gland.

It started from the right iliac fossa and remained localized without any radiation. No relationship to intake of food or any posture was stated. It was continuous and pricking in nature. The patient also had a low-grade fever, which was continuous. This pain was associated with nausea but no vomiting. The patient had significant anorexia. There were no urinary or bowel complaints. There was no significant history of similar pain and the patient had enjoyed good general health before.\nUpon examination, he was an obese child in obvious distress lying in bed. His pulse was 130/min, his blood pressure was 110/65, and his temperature was 38\u00b0C. The rest of the general physical examination was normal. The abdominal examination showed tenderness in the right iliac fossa with rebound tenderness but no guarding or rigidity. There was no organomegaly and bowel sounds were present with an unremarkable rectal digital examination. The patient weighed 80kg.\nInvestigations revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 11.5 K/uL and hemoglobin was 14.4 g/dl. The rest of the serum chemistry values were normal. A plain abdominal radiograph was unremarkable and an ultrasound showed only minimal free fluid.\nWith a provisional diagnosis of acute appendicitis, the patient was taken to the operating room for an appendectomy. Upon opening of the peritoneal cavity, lightly hemorrhagic fluid was seen. On handling of the cecum, a torsed, gangrenous appendix epiploicae with 2 complete twists of the base was found [].

Blood workup showed a WBC count of 68,400 cells/\u00b5L, with an AEC of 27,360 cells/\u00b5L. A computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram was performed, as he was hypoxic, and revealed a 3.6-cm speculated mass within the anterior right upper lobe, partially invading the anterior chest wall. It also revealed mediastinal and hilar adenopathy, an extensive osseous lesion (including compression fracture at T7), and a small pericardial effusion (Figure ). A CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast was performed and revealed a diffuse metastatic disease involving the liver, adrenal glands, spleen, and the bones. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic spine did not reveal spinal cord compression, but it did show the compression fracture at T7 and multilevel thoracic spondylosis. An MRI of the brain revealed a 5-mm lesion in the left occipital lobe, without edema or mass effect.\nThe hematology-oncology team was consulted for an evaluation of the metastatic disease and the eosinophilia. A core needle biopsy was obtained from a liver lesion and the result came back as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung (cytokeratin 7, TTF1, and napsin-A were positive, while cytokeratin 2 and CDX2 were negative). Given his functional status, the decision was made to hold on systemic therapy and start on palliative radiation to the spine for pain control. The plan was to complete radiation sessions and then evaluate his functional status before starting systemic therapy.\nHe continued to have a high WBC count during the admission (Figure ).

The cough was dry, persistent, without any known aggravating or relieving factors. There was no history of orthopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. Fatigue had been persistent since onset of cough. It was worsened by moderate exertion but was not associated with respiratory distress. There was no fever or symptoms suggestive of any focus of sepsis. Both ankles were painful and swollen causing distress with mobility. She also had arthralgia in both knees and occasionally in the small joints of the hands. For several months prior to the onset of these symptoms, she noticed multiple recurrences of one or two painful spots on one or both legs or feet. These spots were not very distressing and there were several periods during which she forgot she had them. They seemed to disappear and re-appear at intervals and the patient never had to take any medication or see a doctor for that reason.\nThe described patient had sustained a slight injury to the dorsum of her right foot from a minimal domestic accident about a year earlier. This was treated with a few stitches with resulting good healing within a short period. However, a month prior to presentation, she started experiencing new onset of pain and palpable nodules within the inch-long scar () of the long-healed wound. On examination, two tender spots of EN () were identified on her feet. Faint but distinctive hyper-pigmented patches of early lupus pernio () were identified on her nasal alae. She was otherwise clinically stable.\nThe patient had presented at the pulmonology clinic where she was initially evaluated.

He first was assigned to the neurological area on the base of suffering from several neurological symptoms. The patient was a normal weighting young man with a reduced general condition. The symptoms were present since two days. He had no additional chronic diseases except for intravenous drug use of heroin about ten years. The last use of heroin in his left groin was about ten days ago. The first examination showed a patient with normal conscious level. He felt \u201cnot well\u201d and in the morning of the day he presented at the hospital he also noticed a dry mouth with a numb tongue.\nHe had a fever about 38,7 \u00b0C and suffered from several neurological symptoms, especially from cranial nerve dysfunction like ptosis, dysarthria and dysphagia. He had no paresis or paraesthesia in the upper or lower extremity and the Babinski sign was negative. Furthermore he had a normal blood pressure, no dyspnea or meningism. The clinical examination showed a typical abscess formation from about 10 \u00d7 10 cm in the left groin region and a tenderness of palpation of the inguinal lymph node. The first time the patient noticed this formation was ten days ago and he remarked that it has grown and is more painful in the last days.\nThere were a few differential diagnoses like Myasthenia gravis, including Fishers-disease, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, encephalitis and wound botulism. That\u2019s why we made a CT-scan of the cerebrum and a cerebrospinal fluid examination first. Both of them were without any pathological results.

    "original_text": "A 39-year-old woman was referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery with the chief complaint of a mass in the right buccal mucosa, which had been formed more than 2 months ago. The patient was also suffering from a severe trismus due to the lesion. In the intraoral examination, an ulcerative sessile painless exophytic mass in the right buccal mucosa was observed. Lymphadenopathy was not detected. No past medical or allergic history was found. Computed tomography scan (CT scan) of the patient showed large mass in right buccal mucosa which was attached to superficial skin and also due to bone depression in right zygomatic bone (Figure ). Incisional biopsy was carried out. The histopathologic examination revealed a neoplasm composed of small hyperchromatic basaloid cells arranged mostly in cribriform, and occasionally in solid and tubular patterns within a fibromyxoid stroma. The cyst-like spaces among the tumoral cells contained eosinophilic or basophilic material. The tubular pattern consisted of small ducts lined by several cuboidal cells which contained hyalinized material (Figure ). Nuclear pleomorphism, atypia, and mitotic activity were very low. These histomorphologic features were in favor of adenoid cystic carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other adenocarcinomas containing basaloid cells. C-kit antigen was diffusely positive in the tumoral cells. P63 was positive and scattered. Proliferation activity was also evaluated. Ki67 was positive in about 10% of the tumoral cells (Figure ).\nThese results were compatible with adenoid cystic carcinoma with a salivary gland origin. The patient underwent examinations to rule out distant metastasis by computed tomography of the chest and abdominal areas.

    "original_text": "A 68-year-old woman presented to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at Nagoya Ekisai Hospital (Nagoya, Japan) with a chief complaint of malaise and a 7-month history of swelling of the left buccal mucosa. The patient had no congenital swelling of the left buccal mucosa at birth and no history of systemic disease or relevant family history. The patient had undergone maxillary molar restoration treatment 2 years earlier, after which she reported biting regularly on her buccal mucosa. On most occasions, the wound had healed within a week, so she had not sought medical treatment. An extraoral examination revealed no facial swelling or asymmetry. However, an intraoral examination revealed an area of diffuse swelling on the left buccal mucosa measuring about 15 mm \u00d7 30 mm and containing a papillary lesion with multiple red, blue, and clear pebble-like vesicles (Figure ). On palpation, the lesion was nontender and soft. The swelling had not expanded to the veins and was pulsatile. An orthopantomogram confirmed that the adjacent bone was intact. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a soft tissue mass with a clearly distinguishable outline of the buccinator muscle (Figure ). The lesion was surgically excised under local anesthesia with a margin of 3 mm and a depth of 2 mm via the inside surface of the fascia of the buccinator muscle. The outcome was favorable. Pathologic examination of the specimen revealed expanded lymphatic vessels lined by thin endothelial cells and containing lymphatic fluid. A diagnosis of lymphatic malformation was confirmed on histopathology and immunohistochemical studies. Immunohistochemistry was negative for vascular markers such as CD31 and CD34, and the lymphatics stained specifically for D2-40 (podoplanin) (Figures , , ).

He had wrist drop and was unable to grip with the fingers. He complained of no sensory loss or numbness. His past medical history included long-term oral anticoagulation due to recurrent lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, glaucoma, and a non-significant aortic valve stenosis, with vascular risk factors including a 5-year history of treated hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and a history of non-significant stenosis of the left anterior descendent coronary artery. On admission, no abnormality could be detected by physical examination, apart from the neurological signs, which included a wrist drop on the left side with decreased grip strength (Fig. ). Pronation and wrist dorsiflection were lost, as well as the ability to form a ring with the thumb and the index. The reflexes of the left upper extremity were slightly brisk, with not pathological reflexes present and no sensory deficits. Laboratory parameters were without abnormal findings except for a slightly elevated fasting blood glucose level. Cranial CT revealed contrast-enhancing, irregularly shaped lesions with diameters of 7, 10, and 9 mm (in the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes, respectively), surrounded by perifocal edema. Carotid duplex ultrasonography did not demonstrate signs of focal atherosclerotic plaques, circulatory disturbance or stenosis on either side.

A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an irregularly enhancing mass measuring 5.8 cm anteroposterior \u00d7 3.2 cm transverse \u00d7 4.4 cm craniocaudal within the right parieto-occipital lobe, with significant vasogenic edema (Figures and ). He then underwent a right parietal craniotomy with maximal safe resection of the tumor.\nThe surgical pathology report showed a high-grade glioma with foci of necrosis and microvascular proliferation consistent with GBM (WHO Grade IV) (). His postsurgical course unfolded without complications.\nHe then went on to receive adjuvant radiation therapy with a total of 60 Grays divided into 30 fractions during the course of 44 days. He additionally received temozolomide at 75 mg/m2 daily while on radiation therapy, with essentially no toxicity. Temozolomide was subsequently continued at 150 mg/m2 daily five days out of a 28-day cycle.\nA follow-up MRI of the brain approximately 5 weeks post completion of combined therapy showed increased enhancement and diameter of the parietal mass, mass effect on the adjacent right occipital horn of the right ventricle, and diffuse vasogenic edema on the right cerebral hemisphere.\nSubsequently, the patient was transferred to an outlying institution for additional management where he underwent reopening craniotomy with microsurgical resection of the tumor with Gliadel wafer placement approximately 17 weeks from his initial resection.

She had received conservative therapy for small bowel obstruction twice in the previous year. Thus, adhesive intestinal obstruction was suspected at admission. A physical examination showed a slightly distended abdomen with diffuse and mild abdominal tenderness. A hematological examination showed elevated inflammatory markers (white blood cell, 17,000/\u00b5l; C-reactive protein, 0.63 mg/dl). Abdominal X-ray showed air fluid level of the small intestine. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) demonstrated stenosis and the wall thickness of the terminal ileum and intestinal distention of the proximal small intestine, which was the site that had been affected in the first bowel obstruction event one year previously (Fig. ). Colonoscopy performed 18 months previously at another hospital showed no abnormalities in the colon or rectum. Based on the above findings, recurrence of the small bowel obstruction at the terminal ileum due to adhesion was suspected. Transnasal decompression was attempted as an initial treatment. X-ray with contrast medium revealed stenosis of the ileum (Fig. ). We planned to perform laparoscopic surgery to treat small bowel obstruction. During laparoscopic surgery, no adhesion of the small intestine was observed in the abdominal cavity and telangiectasia was pointed out on the serosa of the terminal ileum.

In January 2018, a routine gastrointestinal endoscopy found an ulcerative lesion of approximately 10 mm diameter in the greater curvature of the gastric body (Fig. ). An endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) of this lesion showed the first three sonographic layers were blurred, which suggested submucosal invasion. An endoscopic biopsy of the lesion exhibited clear cytoplasm with prominent nucleoli, which was histologically compatible with metastasis to the stomach of the patient\u2019s known RCC. On the other hand, computed tomography (CT) incidentally detected a well contrast-enhancing round-shaped mass in the fundus of the gallbladder (Fig. ). Additional ultrasonography revealed a sessile polypoid lesion, and gallbladder stone and wall thickening were not observed. Although these findings were lacking conclusive evidence of diagnosis whether the gallbladder tumor was primary or metastatic, the circumstantial evidence potentially pointed to the tumor as a metastasis from the patient\u2019s known RCC. 18F-Fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography combined with CT (FDG-PET/CT) was performed as a preoperative workup to detect other possible remote metastasis. However, specific FDG uptake was not shown, even in the gastric and gallbladder tumors. The blood examination was unremarkable.\nIn February 2018, a gastric wedge resection via laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) technique was applied to the gastric tumor, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy to the gallbladder tumor was simultaneously performed (Fig. ). The operation lasted 190 min with little intraoperative blood loss. Intraoperative pathologic diagnosis was not performed in this case.

She continued to have chronic abdominal pain after these procedures and received an exploratory laparotomy and Roux-en-Y bypass with a partial gastrectomy. When she was first seen in the pain clinic, she complained of excruciating abdominal pain for six years. Oftentimes, her pain would be a 10/10 and that level of severity would remain for extended periods of time. She stated that this pain has affected many of her daily activities, including walking and sleeping. The pain had been refractory to ibuprofen, gabapentin, and duloxetine, among other non-opioid medications. She had also been placed on an array of opiates that included hydrocodone, tramadol, codeine, and fentanyl. When she was seen by our pain service, we began our plan of management conservatively. First, we provided trigger point injections in and around the abdominal scars left from her abdominal surgeries. This was followed by a trans-abdominis plane block. Neither of these provided relief. We then moved toward a diagnostic bilateral splanchnic nerve and superior hypogastric plexus block. She reported three days of 80% pain relief in her mid-epigastric region, and her lateral abdominal pain remained significantly improved. The next step in our treatment plan was an RFA of the bilateral splanchnic nerve and superior hypogastric plexus.\nThe splanchnic nerve block has demonstrated effective pain control in cholangiocarcinoma patients []. Given this, we planned for a splanchnic nerve RFA for our patient. The patient was positioned prone.

Her past medical history was unremarkable except for hypothyroidism, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia which were all controlled by medication. Gynecological examination revealed a firm mass measuring 3 cm in max diameter and protruding from the left side of the vagina. She also had a small endocervical polyp measuring about 1 cm in max diameter. The ultrasound examination did not reveal any other abnormalities and an excisional biopsy from the cervical polyp showed a benign and inflamed endocervical polyp. A resection of the vaginal mass suggested a low-grade spindle cell neoplasm. However, a subsequent panel of immunohistochemical stains showed that the diagnosis is a LG-ESS most probably originating from vaginal stromal progenitor cells. The patient subsequently underwent a successful total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and lymph node dissection (TAH-BSO-LND). There was no evidence of any primary endometrial neoplasm, metastatic disease or endometriosis in the resection specimen. The patient was prescribed Letrozole/Aromatase inhibitor 2.5 mg daily and discharged home. She remained well and disease free after 7 months of follow-up.\nThe resected vaginal tumor consisted of an irregular and round firm mass measuring 3 cm in max diameter.

Macroscopically, the bladder contained a large polypoid and ulcerated reddish tan tumor (5 \u00d7 6 cm).\nFor histological evaluation, 17 tissue specimens were obtained from the tumor. Histologically, the tumor consisted of the following three elements: giant cell sarcomatoid carcinoma (70% in area), squamous cell carcinoma (20% in area), and papillary urothelial transitional cell carcinoma (10% in area) (Figure ). The giant cell sarcomatous element and squamous cell carcinoma element were invasive into the peribladder fat tissue, while the transitional cell carcinoma element was invasive into the submucosa.\nThe sarcomatoid element was composed of malignant polygonal and spindle giant cells with frequent multinucleated giant cells (Figure ). The giant cells had hyperchromatic nuclei and showed many mitotic figures. The giant cell sarcomatoid carcinoma area was homologous, and did not show heterologous elements such as bones and cartilages. Specific structures including herring bone and storiform appearances were not recognized. The tumor cells did not show plasmacytoid features. Lymphocytic infiltration was absent.\nThe squamous cell carcinoma element was composed of malignant squamous cell with individual keratinization and intercellular bridge formation.

The pain was non mechanical and was present even at rest and night. He denied any constitutional symptoms. He had no significant medical history except that he was a smoker for over 20 years.\nOn neurological examination, patient indicated altered sensation from T8 dermatome and below; however, upper and lower limb motor power was normal. He had an unsteady gait and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes in both lower limbs.\nInitial X-rays of the thoracic spine were unremarkable, but MRI demonstrated abnormal marrow replacement and enhancement of the entire T6 vertebra including its posterior elements and right 6th posterior rib. MRI axial cuts at T6 level revealed right postero-lateral epidural extension of the lesion causing severe spinal canal, right lateral recess and right exit foraminal stenosis (, ). In addition, an irregular right lung nodule was noted. CT evaluation confirmed the vertebral involvement () and the presence of a lobulated right lung nodule with emphysematous changes in bilateral upper lobes. Further radiological assessment revealed no other lesion elsewhere.\nDuring the course of the work up, he developed bilateral lower limb weakness and was unable to stand. A diagnosis of thoracic myelopathy due to cord compression was made and immediate surgical management in the form of T6 decompression laminectomy along with T3-T8 posterior instrumentation was performed (). Surgery was uneventful; patient had good recovery and was ambulating independently.\nTissue biopsy from T6 right pedicle revealed presence of metastatic tumour cells with moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm in the marrow spaces suggestive of a metastatic carcinoma with neuro-endocrine features ().

The fever started one week back and was acute in onset, rising in a stepladder fashion. It was high grade, peaked at 104\u00b0F, intermittent in nature, and did not present with any rigors or chills after being administered paracetamol. It was also associated with a constant, generalized and bilateral headache, relieved by pain killers for two to three hours only. The patient also complained of abdominal pain, which he described as diffuse, gradual in onset, aching in character, nonradiating, aggravated by food intake, intermittent and associated with vomiting which occurred just after food intake, three to five times a day.
