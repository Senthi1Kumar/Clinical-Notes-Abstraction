The patient was afebrile, and the neurological examination showed normal. A 5 \u00d7 4 cm spherical swelling was seen on up left-sided neck.\nThe laboratory tests indicated high inflammatory reactions in case 1. The haematological and biochemical investigations were normal in case 2. All the patients coagulation function and bleeding times were both normal.

On physical examination, swelling of the face and lower extremities, along with tenderness and limited motion of both hip joints, No other significant findings were detected. The results of laboratory tests as following: parathyroid hormone 1396.8pg/mL, albumin 37.8 g/L, serum creatinine 1125umol/L, and hemoglobin 109 g/L. Liver function and coagulation function were within the normal range. A Doppler cardiac ultrasound revealed total cardiac enlargement with decreased left ventricular contractile function. A radiograph of the pelvis found bilateral femoral neck fracture.\nJugular vein venograms demonstrated superior vena cava occlusion, is not treatable using a smart stent. Upper extremity venograms demonstrated occlusion of the left internal jugular, and right cephalic vein. Placement of a left femoral vein catheter established temporary hemodialysis access. Due to bilateral upper extremities failed to find an adequate outflow vein and the patient's history of central venous occlusion, we decided to perform a left femoral artery to right femoral vein dialysis access utilizing a prosthetic graft and autologous cephalic vein.\nThe patient was placed in the supine position. Using a longitudinal incision on the right arm, the thrombosed cephalic vein was harvested. The thrombosed cephalic vein was cut open and its inner hyperplasia was removed.

After a few seconds, the patient developed a serious headache, mainly located on the left side. After a few minutes, she presented a paralysis of the right side and speech difficulties accompanied by dizziness and vomiting. These symptoms resolved after about 2 h.

Each headache was accompanied by dizziness and vomiting but without loss of consciousness. In most attacks, this patient experienced additionally a flushing of the neck and face and felt that the skin temperature of this affected area was increased, but the temperature was never measured.

He reported pain within the first week of initiating running at basic training. He was diagnosed with bilateral proximal tibia stress fractures at three weeks with instructions to stop impact activities. After failure of his symptoms to improve, he was referred to our facility. On presentation, he had tenderness about the medial aspect of each proximal tibia. Radiographs obtained at that time demonstrated bilateral proximal tibia stress fractures with varus alignment about each knee and articular collapse of the left tibial plateau. Metabolic labs were obtained and significant for a low vitamin D (15), but the remainders of labs including calcium, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and testosterone were unremarkable. MRI of the left knee demonstrated a medial tibial plateau fracture with two millimeters of articular depression and extension of the fracture to the tibial spine (). MRI of the right knee demonstrated a hypointense linear T2 signal surrounded by diffuse hyperintense signal suggesting a medial tibial plateau stress fracture with surrounding bone edema, without articular collapse or extension (). These fractures were at the level of the physis, and there was surrounding sclerosis on plain radiographs. Given the collapse of the articular surface in his left knee, the patient was indicated for open reduction internal fixation with allograft bone. The patient underwent the aforementioned procedure without complication, and the patient remained nonweight bearing to his bilateral lower extremities (). At the time of surgery, the bone at the fracture distal to the articular surface was softer and more friable in composition than expected for the stress fracture.

Six months following the index surgery, she had a recurrence treated with repeat curettage, liquid nitrogen local adjuvant, and placement of bone substitute graft. After the second procedure, she was ambulatory, but occasionally used a boot for comfort and avoided high-impact activities. Physical examination demonstrated a prominent first metatarsal base and a well-healed dorsal incision.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large soft-tissue mass surrounding the first metatarsal circumferentially and abutting the second metatarsal (). There was high T2 signal with no T1 signal changes at the base of the second metatarsal. Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated an expansile lucency at the proximal aspect of the first metatarsal base toward the dorsal lateral side (). There were some areas of cortical breach, and the bone was expanded and abutting the base of the second metatarsal.

The patient suffered from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with an implantable defibrillator inserted to maintain cardiac function but was otherwise fit and well.\nOn examination, a firm mass was arising from the palpebral lobe of the right lacrimal gland, underneath the supraorbital rim. Visual field testing and ophthalmoscopy examination were normal. Visual acuity testing using a Snellen chart revealed 20/70 vision in both eyes, which was in a normal range for a person of this age. Cranial nerve, ear, nose, and throat examinations were all normal. A computed tomography (CT) scan reported that the mass was a soft tissue tumour arising from the palpebral lobe of the lacrimal gland but that the orbits and globes were otherwise normal with no tissue compression or invasion ().\nThe entire right lacrimal gland was removed in our hospital under general anaesthetic through an orbitotomy. The expectation was that the tumour would be a pleomorphic adenoma and that removal would prevent future carcinoma development requiring more aggressive surgery with loss of vision. Following surgery the patient made a good recovery and was discharged from hospital the day after surgery. Hypromellose 0.3% eye drops were provided for the right eye to compensate for the reduced lacrimation that would now affect that eye.\nHistopathological assessment of the removed gland revealed that the soft tissue mass within the lacrimal gland was a PCV-ACC (Figures , , and ).

At the Nephrology outpatient clinic, because of the reduced eGFR and of the presence of proteinuria (300 mg/24 h), an hospitalization for further investigations was planned.\nWhile waiting for the admission, a couple of weeks later, the patient was admitted to the emergency room in another hospital for abdominal pain and dyspnea. On admittance the ECG tracing performed showed sinus rhythm with diffuse repolarization abnormalities. Further exams revealed an increase of troponin (54 ng/ml) and transaminases levels (GOT 50 U/L; GPT 125 U/L) and a cardiac ultrasound showed a severe left ventricular dysfunction with right heart failure. Patient was thus admitted to the coronary intensive care unit.

He was initially treated with prednisone with improvement of his dyspnea for possible eosinophilic pneumonia because of a prominent eosinophil component identified in a bronchioloalveolar lavage specimen. He was then lost to follow-up. Approximately 1 year later, his dyspnea worsened and was accompanied by a palpable mass in his medial right thigh. A biopsy of this lesion was pursued. Multiple pathologists reviewed the specimen and agreed on the diagnosis of IMT. Immunohistochemistry was carried out and identified intense, extensive expression of ALK. Treatment was initiated with crizotinib and resulted in a partial response. Eight months later, he experienced worsening chest pain and dyspnea and imaging studies confirmed disease progression. He was placed on celecoxib, and over the course of 1 month, he experienced significant worsening of his symptoms and performance status decline. He then presented to our center for further management. This patient did not qualify for available clinical trials (NCT01742286, NCT01283516) at the time of his presentation based on his performance status.\nDue to this patient's previous response to crizotinib and ALK expression, arrangements were made with Novartis, the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board and the United States Food and Drug Administration to administer ceritinib 750 mg daily on a compassionate use basis. His symptoms of dyspnea and pain significantly improved within 2 weeks of therapy. He developed mild nausea (grade 1) that was controlled with ondansetron and a dose reduction in ceritinib to 600 mg daily. Imaging studies after 8 weeks of treatment demonstrated a significant partial response to treatment that was confirmed 8 weeks later (Figure ).

She was treated with external beam radiotherapy to 60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks in accordance to ICRU-50. Two lateral parallel opposed fields were used to treat the nasopharynx and upper neck. The lower neck was irradiated with a direct anterior field with a central cord shield and a lower border just below clavicular heads. The junction of the upper and lower field was at the level of hyoid bone. It was followed by a 10 Gy Iridium-192 brachytherapy boost to the nasopharynx. Treatment was completed in May 1994. She remained well with no further recurrence of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma but developed xerostomia and mild fibrosis of the lower neck.\nShe re-presented in December 1999 with a mass in the left supraclavicular fossa and numbness in the arm, but no motor weakness. The mass was located within the area previously irradiated to 60 Gy. Her disease was staged with our standard protocol at the time with MRI of the neck and shoulder, CT of the chest and functional imaging using thallium-201 scintigraphy []. MRI showed a 3 cm \u00d7 5 cm mass involving the brachial plexus (Figure ). Open biopsy confirmed pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma.\nThe management of her case was discussed in our multi-disciplinary meeting. The agreed treatment plan was preoperative radiotherapy followed by en bloc resection. She received an accelerated hyperfractionated course of radiotherapy 48 Gy in 40 fractions (ICRU-50), treating twice a day over four weeks. The radiation field incorporated the brachial plexus and used 6 MV photons in an anterior-weighted, opposed oblique arrangement avoiding the spinal cord. Radiotherapy was completed in February 2000. Restaging investigations showed that the lesion had become more cystic on MRI, but its size had not changed. The degree of thallium-201 scintigraphy uptake had not changed significantly either.

She had previously undergone curettage and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cementation of a biopsy-proven giant cell tumor of the first metatarsal two and a half years prior at a different institution. Six months following the index surgery, she had a recurrence treated with repeat curettage, liquid nitrogen local adjuvant, and placement of bone substitute graft. After the second procedure, she was ambulatory, but occasionally used a boot for comfort and avoided high-impact activities. Physical examination demonstrated a prominent first metatarsal base and a well-healed dorsal incision. She exhibited tenderness to palpation throughout the area of the scar.\nRadiographs of the left foot showed an expansile, radiolucent lesion of the first metatarsal base surrounding the known cement implantation of the first metatarsal (). Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large soft-tissue mass surrounding the first metatarsal circumferentially and abutting the second metatarsal (). There was high T2 signal with no T1 signal changes at the base of the second metatarsal. Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated an expansile lucency at the proximal aspect of the first metatarsal base toward the dorsal lateral side (). There were some areas of cortical breach, and the bone was expanded and abutting the base of the second metatarsal. There was no evidence of direct extension into the second metatarsal or areas of osteolysis within the second metatarsal base. She was diagnosed with a second recurrence of giant cell tumor of bone of the first metatarsal base. As the tumor was recurrent, with destruction of the articular surface and little residual bone of the first metatarsal base, a wide resection of the tumor was recommended.\nThe procedure began by harvesting iliac crest bone graft (5 cm in length, 2 cm in depth).

Rheumatoid factor and ANA were negative. The findings were further confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging. As a result of the pain due to arthropathy, she used to come limping all the way into the thalassemia day care ward and was advised to start with the alternative, oral iron chelator deferasirox.

It was only after the availability of the drug at our pharmacy that she was started on deferasirox at a dose of 750 mg once a day. On day 6 of initiation of therapy, she started with pruritic skin rash that started from the neck and spread downwards to involve the whole body. She reported to us on day 11. On history taking, the patient reported that there was an increase in the number and severity of lesions since then. There was no history of breathlessness, difficulty in breathing or any episode of loss of consciousness. There was no family history of any allergic disease or bronchial asthma. On examination, she was having diffuse erythematous and palpable urticarial lesions all over the body. The lesions were more prominent on the dorsal surfaces.

Histology of the lung mass derived from bronchoscopy showed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (). No clear differentiation between metastases from the previous head and neck cancer and a second primary tumor could be made. Given the long time interval between the diagnosis of cancer the first time and the new findings with the evidence of tumor cells in the bronchial tree, a therapeutic approach for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer was chosen.\nTreatment consisted of three courses of carboplatin/vinorelbine and monthly zoledronic acid. In the following period of stable disease (no reduction in lesion size), the patient developed three consecutive episodes of pneumonia, each accompanied by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and resulting in hospitalisation. During the third episode, almost one year after initial presentation of chest pain, detection of liver and adrenal gland metastases indicated disease progression. Therefore, second line treatment with pemetrexed was initiated. After eight treatments, restaging computed tomography showed stable disease, but was indicative of abscess formation around the right hip (). Distinctly elevated CRP levels were also present. Following drainage, systemic treatment with antibiotics was initiated, yet microbiological examination of the fluid revealed sterile cultures. Six weeks later, the patient developed impaired vision, eventually leading to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient's abdomen and pelvis was performed and showed intraabdominal bleed and multifocal liver lesions. Initial complete blood count (CBC) revealed a hemoglobin of 7 g/dL and he was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells prior to transfer to our institution. On arrival, CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis showed multiple dense, heterogeneous masses throughout the liver with associated perihepatic and intraperitoneal hemorrhage and areas of tumor blush were noted but no extravasation was seen to suggest active hemorrhage. There was also multiple enlarged periportal and upper mesenteric lymph nodes, likely representing metastatic adenopathy. There were no lesions present on the pancreas. CT chest was obtained and showed no evidence of intrathoracic metastatic disease. Initial blood work revealed normal liver function tests, appropriate response in hemoglobin to transfusion and negative viral hepatitis panel. Tumor markers revealed AFP elevation to 8705 ng/mL, normal Carcinoembryonic Antigen and Cancer Antigen 19-9. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis showed multiple lesions throughout the liver with targetoid appearance. There was no evidence of cirrhosis and these lesions did not have imaging characteristics of typical HCC (Figure ). It was suspected the multifocal liver lesions were HCC given the elevated AFP. However, the MRI was not consistent with HCC and a liver biopsy was obtained. Pathology results were consistent with poorly differentiated, large cell-type neuroendocrine carcinoma with metastatic disease to the liver (Figure ). The patient had an unremarkable colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy six months prior to presentation therefore, it was suspected the primary origin of NET was in the small bowel.

Random ileal and colonic biopsies were obtained, which were unremarkable as well. Histology of the stenosis showed mild inflammation, mild stromal fibrosis, and architectural disruption. Subsequently, she underwent a computed tomography scan, which showed a mild thickening of the terminal ileum and sigmoid colon. The finding of thickened terminal ileum was further confirmed by a subsequent magnetic resonance imaging enterography, suggestive for Crohn disease (CD) localized at the terminal ileum. Due to the discrepancy of the radiological findings with the initial endoscopic examination, a further colonscopy with retrograde ileoscopy was performed, showing no visible endoscopic signs of inflammation and confirming the sigmoid stenosis. The repeated ileal and colonic biopsy sampling was again not diagnostic, showing a nonspecific pattern of inflammation affecting the sigmoid colonic specimens.\nThe physician in charge of the patient, in view of her clinical history and the radiologic finding of intestinal thickening, reckoned that the patient was affected by CD with terminal ileum and sigmoid colon localization and proposed a therapy immunomodulators: corticosteroids 1 mg/kg for 12 weeks together with antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) infliximab 5 mg at weeks 0, 2, and 6, followed by infliximab alone. After 6 months of treatment with infliximab (5 mg/kg every 8 weeks as maintenance), an endoscopic reevaluation was scheduled, showing a resolution of the stenosis",

On the right side also, patellar ligament was destroyed, tubercle of tibia and lower pole of patella were exposed, but the joint cavity seemed to be intact [].\nAt this point of time, as both patellar ligaments were destroyed, the young boy was unable to extend his knees actively, thus he became wheelchair bound for locomotion. Hence, to give the boy an opportunity to walk, reconstruction of patellar ligament, at least on one side, became essential. For the right knee, reconstruction of patellar tendon was done with an ipsilateral and looped semitendinosus tendon graft, and for the grossly destroyed left knee joint, arthrodesis was done.\nBoth the joints were operated in the same sitting by two teams simultaneously. The patient was operated in supine position under general anaesthesia. On the left-sided knee joint, infected and necrotic cartilages and bone of the articular surfaces of tibia and femur were removed; the bone ends were made raw and the exposed bones were covered with ipsilateral pedicled medial gastrocnemius muscle flap with skin graft over it.\nOn the right side, patellar tendon was reconstructed. Incision was made at pes anserinus. Semitendinosus tendon was identified and divided at musculotendinous junction. Proximal end of the divided distal part was delivered distally at incision site keeping the insertion intact. Mid pole of the patella and the tibial tuberosity were drilled",

The ovaries could not be identified, and blood tests, including tests to determine full blood count, kidney function, liver function, and CA125 and carcinoembryonic antigen levels, were all normal. Despite a large palpable abdominal mass, she remained relatively asymptomatic, complaining of some lower abdominal discomfort and urinary incontinence controlled with a pessary. In light of the normal CA125 and large pelvic mass, she was booked for an urgent diagnostic laparoscopy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and excision of the large pelvic mass. Laparoscopy revealed the mass to be arising from the small bowel mesentery, and the only procedure performed was peritoneal washing, which did not show any significant abnormality microscopically. A follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done, and her condition was discussed at the colorectal multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting.\nThe CT scan revealed a well-encapsulated enhancing mass with multiple septations and locules measuring 8.6 cm \u00d7 9 cm \u00d7 7.5 cm ().

She suffered from constipation since 1988, with the average defecation frequency once 3-4 d, and the lowest once a week, and received no special treatment then. However, she did not experience any abdominal symptoms during the first 20 years of her life.\nOn 10th February 1998, she was hospitalized in Department of Emergency Surgery in our hospital because of bellyache and constipation, and was discharged after conservative treatment.

The transverse colon resection was planned. The pre-surgical blood and urine tests were normal. The endoscopic pathological examination and the routine fecal examination were not conducted. The surgery was conducted on 12th March. During surgery, it was observed that the middle of the transverse colon was significantly distended to approximately 10 cm in diameter. Around 25 cm of the dilated colon was removed, and the splenic flexure was rectified. The post-operational pathological examination showed infiltration of acute and chronic inflammation cells and focal hemorrhage (the immunohistochemistry and specific staining tests were not performed, possibly due to the fact that HD was not considered, or to the unavailability of such a test then). However, after the first surgery, she still experienced constipation, and postprandial bloating and bellyache, and soon felt obvious aggravation of the symptoms. She was then prescribed with laxatives. She was hospitalized to our hospital again in 2000 due to ileus, and refused the suggested reoperation.

However, 2 days before the scheduled CT, he represented to the ED with right sided flank pain since morning on the day of his visit. The pain radiated to the right groin and was associated with hematuria. He was not passing blood clots. He denied any other complaints of fever, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. He had a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He had previous surgeries for appendicectomy and cholecystectomy.\nHis vital signs were stable.

On arrival, CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis showed multiple dense, heterogeneous masses throughout the liver with associated perihepatic and intraperitoneal hemorrhage and areas of tumor blush were noted but no extravasation was seen to suggest active hemorrhage. There was also multiple enlarged periportal and upper mesenteric lymph nodes, likely representing metastatic adenopathy. There were no lesions present on the pancreas. CT chest was obtained and showed no evidence of intrathoracic metastatic disease. Initial blood work revealed normal liver function tests, appropriate response in hemoglobin to transfusion and negative viral hepatitis panel. Tumor markers revealed AFP elevation to 8705 ng/mL, normal Carcinoembryonic Antigen and Cancer Antigen 19-9. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis showed multiple lesions throughout the liver with targetoid appearance. There was no evidence of cirrhosis and these lesions did not have imaging characteristics of typical HCC (Figure ). It was suspected the multifocal liver lesions were HCC given the elevated AFP. However, the MRI was not consistent with HCC and a liver biopsy was obtained. Pathology results were consistent with poorly differentiated, large cell-type neuroendocrine carcinoma with metastatic disease to the liver (Figure ). The patient had an unremarkable colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy six months prior to presentation therefore, it was suspected the primary origin of NET was in the small bowel. Regarding the intraabdominal bleed noted on initial CT scan, this remained stable on repeat scans",

They also saw repetitive movement in the form of running around in circles, and she was extremely sensitive to certain kinds of touches and textures. This is when her parents first took her to a doctor, and she was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder with moderate severity of symptoms. They tried putting her in a school at the age of 4 years, but she could not adjust there and has been home since then. Parents unfortunately could not afford any occupational therapy or sensory stimulation therapy for the child. She needs assistance in all daily activities but is toilet trained by day, for which she communicates with her mother.

Physical examination revealed a soft mass 4 cm in diameter in the right axilla without any other positive findings in the right breast. An axillary lymph node biopsy was conducted in a previous local hospital, and the histopathological results were suggestive of some metastatic carcinomas with an unknown primary lesion, while suspicion of lobular carcinoma of breast could not be ruled out.\nIn order to locate the primary lesion and other metastatic lesions, a PET-CT scan was performed in FAHZU, which reported multiple lesions with significantly increased FDG (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose) intensity presenting in the right side axilla. Meanwhile, the FDG (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose) was slightly elevated at the right elbow, considered as an inflammation or trauma (Fig. ). Therefore, a surgical resection of the right axillary lymph nodes and right supraclavicular lymph nodes was conducted in FAHZU. The histopathology report showed that 31/32 lymph nodes in the right axilla and 10/10 lymph nodes in the right supraclavicula were positive for metastatic carcinoma. For the time being, suspicion of metastatic epithelial sarcoma and metastatic breast cancer could not be ruled out.\nWith more detailed medical history review and physical examination, a mass on the right forearm was found (Fig. ). After a car accident 20 years ago, the mass had been growing slowly over the last decade without causing any pain or ulceration. There was also no abnormality of the right forearm X-ray in routine examination. An MRI scan was applied to the right forearm tumor and the report indicated that metastatic tumor could not be excluded. Therefore, a core needle biopsy (CNB) of the mass in the right forearm was conducted and the histopathology report suggested evidence of ES.

Other pertinent negatives from these initial studies included no excess of crypt apoptotic bodies, no blood vessel thrombi, and no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.

She was diagnosed as acute infarction on the bilateral paramedian midbrain including bilateral cerebral peduncle by magnetic resonance imaging ().\nAfter conservative management, her conscious level improved but she was still unable to open her eyes. Examination revealed pronounced bilateral ptosis, with left and right pupil diameter of 6 mm and 3 mm, respectively. The left pupil was not reactive to light. There was marked limitation of adduction, moderate limitation of depression and elevation in the movement of both eyeballs. Abduction was normal. There were no other findings of central nervous system disease that could cause ptosis from brain imaging, and no evidence of other orbital disease causing ptosis in an ophthalmologic examination. Muscle strength rated using the Medical Research Council Scale was grade 3/5 in both upper limbs and 4/5 in both lower limbs. She was transferred to the department of rehabilitation medicine for intensive rehabilitation management. Participation in the rehabilitation programs was difficult due to continuing inability to open her eyes.\nWe tried taping her lids with Micropore tape and used lubricants to prevent exposure keratopathy. However, this method was less efficient due to blinking. Eye-putti eyelash glue-mediated fixation of the upper eyelid to the supraorbital structures was ineffective. The patient became frustrated and depressed, and refused to participate in the rehabilitation programs.\nAfter about 6 months from the stroke attack, bilateral ptosis was not improved at all. Consultations were held with the department of plastic surgery with the aim of considering surgical treatment, with the thinking that it would be hard to anticipate spontaneous recovery. Plastic surgeons planned the surgical correction of bilateral ptosis and the Muller's muscle procedure was done, considering the benefits and losses.\nAfter surgical correction, the upper lid height was improved from 7",

She felt immediate bilateral neck, dorsal and lumbar pain and stiffness, and also reported blurred vision and nausea.

Her cervico-thoracic spine pain had persisted since then, accompanied by pain radiating to the right shoulder. The patient also reported moderate restriction of her cervical range of motion and intermittent occipital headache, particularly when neck pain was exacerbated. Her symptoms were increased by sustained neck positions, computer work for several minutes and sitting in a car for prolonged periods as driver or passenger.

Upon workup the patient was diagnosed with left-sided neck of femur fracture and was admitted in hospital for surgical management. There was no history of fracture in past. Her menstrual cycle was regular. There was no history of renal stones. There was positive history of hypokalemic periodic paralysis twice in past (12 and 13 years back). Her family history was unremarkable. There was no history of recurrent oral or ocular ulcers. On examination there was no uveitis, oral ulcers, lacrimal or parotid gland enlargement. Her workup was done which is shown in Table below. It showed hyperchloremic non anion gap metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia. DEXA scan revealed osteoporosis at right femoral neck (both T and Z scores were <-2.5) and at right hip (both T and Z scores were <-2.5).\nShe underwent left-sided dynamic hip screw fixation under general anesthesia which she tolerated well. On the fourth postoperative day she was allowed full weight bearing with walker. After surgery she was started on oral Ibandronate 150 mg once monthly (for osteoporosis) and tablet calcium carbonate (600 mg elemental calcium) twice daily and vitamin D 2000 IU twice daily. Due to low vitamin D levels she was given one intramuscular injection of vitamin D (200,000 IU). Oral potassium supplement three tablets thrice daily were continued. Potassium citrate was added in her regimen to correct renal tubular acidosis. Thyroxine 100 mcg was continued five days a week and 150 mcg was advised two days a week (the dose was adjusted according to recent thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) value of 9.97 which is suboptimal).

The patient mainly complained of difficulties doing her usual daily routine activity job for about 1 year and misplacing personal objects, she was having difficulties doing simple calculations and drawing simple paper patterns, resulting in erroneous calculations and wrong measurements along with decreasing ability to perform complex tasks such as arranging a meeting with her old friend, pay bills, and marketing. Childhood and prior developments were apparently normal. No neuropsychiatric disorders could be assessed in the family. She did not take drugs, including alcohol. Her past medical history was uneventful and was negative for stroke, transient ischemic attack, chronic infection, or other chronic illness. Except for incontinence and a slight slurring of speech, the physical examination revealed no further neurological deficits, especially no speech impairment, seizures or myoclonia were observed. The Mini Mental State Examination score was suggestive of dementia (21 of 30) and very low on the cognitive efficiency profile. There were also deficits on tests of visuospatial ability. Nevertheless, she experienced no changes in personality, appetite, or sleeping pattern noted, nor was she observed to be a snorer or have spells of apnoea, and there was no history of auditory or visual hallucinations. Blood count, biochemical profile, sedimentation rate, coagulation profile, and the results of radiography of the chest were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed normal results. Results of Venereal Disease Research Laboratories testing were negative, and no malignant cells were identified by cytological examination. Serum vitamin B12, folic acid, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were within normal limits. Computerised tomography of the brain revealed mild left hemispheric mass effects. MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy were performed on a clinical whole body 1.5-T imaging unit. T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR images revealed an ill defined area of signal intensity alteration in the left frontal region with involvement of rostrum of corpus",

At time of dialysis initiation, 6 years prior, a presternal-type PD catheter was placed due to morbid obesity at the time (BMI of 50 kg/m2 with a weight of 128 kg). The catheter consisted of 2 flexible silicon rubber tubes joined together with a titanium connector. The distal portion included the coiled fenestrated segment and was placed in the deep pelvis, while the external portion included a swan neck shape and 2 Dacron cuffs and was tunneled to the surface of the abdomen. The catheter was anchored with a purse-string suture in the posterior rectus sheath and tunneled to an exit site over the abdomen. The patient was treated with automated PD: 5 exchanges over 9 h with 2 L fill volume and no day dwell.\nOn admission, the patient was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 101/66 mm Hg, heart rate of 85/min, and oxygen saturation of 98% while breathing ambient air. She appeared well and was in no distress. Lung examination revealed normal respiratory effort. On palpation, the abdomen was soft and not tender. The patient had normally active bowel sounds. There was no drainage, induration, or erythema at the PD catheter exit site. The superficial cuff of the catheter was found incidentally to be external to the exit site. The external cuff was sufficiently distant from the exit site so as not to be causing any trauma to the tissue.
