On examination the abdomen was soft with mild central tenderness. The back had mild paraspinal tenderness in the lumbar region but no neurology. He was apyrexial. Observations were normal and on admission the white cell count was 8.2 \u00d7 109/l and the CRP was 244 mg/l. The patient was referred to general surgeons due to the abdominal pain.\nThe initial chest and abdominal radiographs were normal but blood tests showed a raised CRP of 244, so broad spectrum antibiotics were started. It was decided that due to the abdominal pain and raised inflammatory markers the patient required a CT abdomen/pelvis which showed para-aortic lymph nodes but no other abnormalities. Testicular lymphatic drainage goes to the para-aortic lymph nodes, so they were examined and had an ultrasound scan which were both normal. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus and, after discussion with the microbiologist, an MRI spine was performed to rule out osteomyelitis. This showed L2/L3 osteomyelitis, epidural abscess and psoas inflammation (Fig. ). The microbiologist also advised for a trans-oesophageal echocardiogram to rule out development endocarditis, which was normal. On further questioning, the patient had acupuncture treatment 2 weeks prior to admission for mechanical back pain. The treatment was performed by a trained physiotherapist and involved the insertion of sterile disposable needles into acupoints in the lower back to relieve pain.\nNeurosurgical advice recommended that due to the lack of neurological symptoms the patient could be treated conservatively with antibiotics. Microbiology advice was to treat the patient with IV flucloxacillin and oral rifampicin for at least 2 weeks and then to continue with oral antibiotics for at least a further 6 weeks depending on clinical improvement. Repeat bloods and MRI scans were performed to monitor the response to antibiotics (Fig",

Seven years prior to current presentation, the patient had reported a history of headaches, nasal congestion and bilateral discolored drainage refractory to prednisone, antibiotics, and endoscopic sinus surgery at an outside facility. Revision endoscopic sinus surgery one year after the initial surgery provided partial relief. Two years prior to current presentation, her left maxillary pain recurred, and a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a left wisdom tooth projecting into her maxillary sinus. Following wisdom teeth extraction, she had marked improvement in pain and nasal drainage; however 8 weeks later, left maxillary pain returned and was associated with left-sided yellow nasal discharge. Her oral surgeon discovered an infection in the molar adjacent to the extracted wisdom tooth and performed a root canal.\nTwo weeks following the root canal, she presented with continued left maxillary tooth pain and left-sided discolored nasal discharge. Extraction of the molar failed to resolve her pain, and she was subsequently referred to the facial pain/headache clinic by her dentist where she was prescribed gabapentin 300 mg TID, which was ineffective. Her dentist also prescribed her multiple courses of clindamycin 150 mg TID and guaifenesin 600 gm QID, which would improve her pain and discoloured drainage. However, her symptoms would return after completing the antibiotics. On examination with rigid endoscopy, she had widely patent maxillary, ethmoid, and frontal sinus ostia with no purulence or polyposis.

Pregnancy was uncomplicated until 17 weeks gestation when she presented with spontaneous PPROM. This was confirmed by the presence of a pool of clear liquor in the vagina and a positive nitrazine test. High vaginal swab cultures for bacteria were negative. Ultrasound scans confirmed a singleton pregnancy with oligohydramnios. There was complete anhydramnion at 19 weeks gestation, and this rendered assessment of foetal anatomy difficult.\nThe couple was counselled on the poor outcome and risks of infection to the mother and foetus but expressed the wish to continue with the pregnancy. The risks of significant perinatal mortality and neonatal morbidity associated with chronic anhydramnios and the poor outcome associated with extreme prematurity was fully discussed by the neonatal team. The risks were based on the risk of infection to both mother and the foetus, up to date evidence and the ultrasound findings.\nShe was commenced on erythromycin 250 mg eight hourly, and managed expectantly as an outpatient with twice daily temperature checks at home, as well as serial full blood counts (FBC), serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and weekly low vaginal swabs. Two weekly growth scan showed a normally growing foetus, with visible breathing movements, and chest circumference growing along the 50th centile. Abdominal circumference (AC) measurement in foetuses with oligohydramnios may be technically difficult and less reproducible as the abdominal profile may be significantly deformed due to compression, thus, it is probably more reproducible to use ratios based upon head circumference rather than AC as the fetal head is more rigid, even in such conditions [].

His initial observations include Heart Rate 126/min, Blood Pressure 102/79 mmHg, Respiratory rate 32/min, temperature 36.8C and oxygen saturation of 98% on 2 L of nasal prongs. The patient had a Glasgow Coma Scale of 14 and was clinically dehydrated. Abdominal examination revealed a distended abdomen that was tender in the left upper quadrant with no evidence of peritonism. Laboratory tests showed polycythaemia with Haemoglobin of 189 g/L and white cell count of 20.3 \u00d7 109/L with preserved renal and hepatic functions. Arterial blood gas analysis was consistent with normal anion gap metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.28 and lactate of 4.5.

    "original_text": "The baby boy was born full-term by spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 28-year-old healthy female mother as a fifth pregnancy. Immediately after birth, the infant cried but displayed no change in skin color, and his Apgar scores were 7 and 9 at one and 5 minutes, respectively. There was no history of a consanguineous marriage between the parents or the presence of a similar disease in the other children of the family or other family members. At birth, his weight was 2850 grams (10\u201350 percentile), height was 50 cm (50 percentile), and his head circumference was 34 cm (50 percentile). In his physical examination, there was no dysmorphic appearance and the other systems were found to be normal. On the postnatal second day, tonic and abnormal jerk-like seizures involving all the extremities were observed. The blood glucose was measured at 32 mg/dL during these seizures. The patient was diagnosed with hypoglycemic convulsion and given phenobarbital, after which he was sent to our clinic and hospitalized. His blood glucose was 32 mg/dL. The patient initially had subtle seizures like pedaling, licking lips, and swallowing which were then followed by generalized tonic convulsions. The patient first received 4 cc/kg intravenous 10% dextrose solution. Upon prolonged apnea and deterioration of his general condition both enteral and parenteral nutrition were started. Hormone tests, carried out to explain his resistant hypoglycemia, yielded normal results. Respiratory ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was required for the pathologic apnea following convulsions.

According to the parents, at the time of delivery, the obstetrician documented the swelling and associated it with lymphadenopathy. No further workup was preformed at that time. As the patient aged, the parents grew increasingly concerned about the prominence as it appeared to them to have grown in size. As a result, they took the patient to the emergency department for further evaluation. X-rays of the affected shoulder were obtained and a right midshaft clavicle fracture nonunion was diagnosed. At that time, child protective services (CPS) was consulted to evaluate the patient and the family for possible child abuse. The patient\u2019s parents were interviewed in the emergency department and 2 home visits were conducted.\nOn physical exam, the patient was well developed and well nourished. The patient\u2019s clothes were removed for the physical examination. There was no evidence of external trauma. No skin lesions or areas of hyperpigmentation were appreciated.

A physical examination showed her height to be 150 cm and body weight to be 50 kg. The chest and heart conditions were normal. A breast examination was also normal. The neurological examination on admission was normal. The laboratory tests on admission showed serum sodium at 152 mEq/L, serum potassium at 4.1 mEq/L, fasting blood glucose at 103 mg/dL, and hemoglobin A1c at 4.9%. The results of the liver and thyroid function tests, as well as the chest X-ray were all within normal limits. We performed the water deprivation test under the impression of diabetes insipidus. Urine osmolarity, after a pitressin injection, was markedly increased (>50%) and the results revealed complete pituitary diabetes insipidus (). A brain MRI was performed to demonstrate abnormal findings in the posterior pituitary gland, but it showed multiple enhanced nodules with surrounding edema in the entirety of the cerebral hemisphere, suggesting brain metastases (). To determine the origin of the brain metastasis, we performed the following diagnostic procedures: mammography, abdominal CT scan, gastroscopy, and bone scintigraphy. The abdominal CT scan showed a 3.5-cm heterogenous mass of the right adrenal gland, which separated the kidney.

The patient had a past medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and COPD. Her past surgical history included an appendectomy, hysterectomy, tonsillectomy, and bilateral total knee replacements. The patient had dementia; therefore, all her history was obtained from her son and her medical records. Her son reported no alcohol or NSAID use. Laboratory values were remarkable for Na 132, K 4.1, glucose 162, WBC 16.5, with a left shift, and lactic acid 4.2 (Fig. ). CT scans showed dilation of the stomach and proximal small bowel to the level of the proximal jejunum with air-fluid levels, communication between a collapsed gallbladder and the second part of the duodenum with associated pneumobilia consistent with cholecystoduodenal fistula, and a large (2.4 cm) calcified stone within the proximal jejunum, findings consistent with gallstone ileus (Fig. , Fig. ). She was referred to surgery for emergent laparotomy. Under general anesthesia, a periumbilical incision was performed. Upon entering the abdomen, the small bowel was visibly dilated proximally. A loop of proximal jejunum was brought into the operative field and ran distally; we were able to very quickly get to the point of the obstruction which clearly showed a gallstone in the lumen of the jejunum that appeared to be at least 2.5 cm to approximately 3 cm in size blocking the lumen of the jejunum.

She had a history of antenatal care follow up at a nearby health center. She presented to us with singleton and intrauterine pregnancy.\nOn arrival, she was screened for both subjective and objective data for her current and past obstetric, medical, surgical, gynecological, social, personal and family history. She had a history of early neonatal loss and one living child, her bilirubin value was elevated, she suffered pruritus and hepatomegaly in her previous pregnancies. She had a personal and family history of pruritus during pregnancy. From her previous personal history, she reported a history of similar features that resembled her current clinical presentation. The rest of her laboratory investigations and physical examination results, including vital signs (blood pressure 100/70 mmHg), were in their normal range and she arranged for her next follow up after being provided with an antihistamine drug and offered counseling and health education to ensure the best outcome for her pregnancy. At 30 weeks GA, she was assessed for any complaints, including the worsening of pruritus and underwent liver biochemistry tests. Based on this, her bilirubin total and bilirubin direct tests were 4.52 mg/dl and 3.45 mg/dl respectively. Other complete blood count tests and urinalysis were within the normal range. The progress of the pregnancy was also assessed using ultrasound and showed no any abnormality.

She denied any forms of trauma and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and was otherwise systemically healthy. She complained of pain on active elbow flexion and both pronation and supination. Prior to presentation to the orthopaedic outpatient clinic, she described a lengthy period of conservative management through simple analgesia including oral paracetamol, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and physiotherapy.\nOn examination, a palpable mass was felt in the right antecubital fossa measuring roughly 5 cm in diameter fixed to the underlying soft tissue structures. There was pain on active elbow flexion and pronation, with reduction of range of motion in both ranges. Elbow extension and supination were neither painful nor limited.\nStrength was equal to the contralateral side; however pain was elicited on all resisted movements. There was no vascular compromise, but reduced cutaneous sensation on the radial side of the thumb, corresponding to the distribution of the superficial radial nerve.\nA plain radiograph was performed () which showed an irregular circumscribed radioopaque lesion overlying the proximal radius, in close proximity to the radial tuberosity and distal to the radial head.

After failed control of the pain with medication, a primary physician referred this patient to our clinic after taking an ultrasonography with the impression of an 'unusual soft tissue tumor in the popliteal fossa.' Physical examination revealed a soft, non-tender mass in the posteromedial area of the left knee. The mass was non-movable, without evidence of palpable pulsation, erythema or venous congestion.

The range of motion of the knee was slightly decreased, and the patient complained of some discomfort with forced flexion.\nLateral plain radiography of the left knee revealed a round, soft tissue density lesion containing bony fragments on the popliteal fossa (). Ultrasonography showed a solid mass of the dimensions 4 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3 cm, well-encapsulated with heterogeneous echogenicity in the popliteal fossa ().

Because exacerbation of his interstitial pneumonia was considered, the patient was hospitalized and 60 mg/day oral prednisolone (PSL) was administered. As his dyspnea improved, the PSL dose was tapered by 5 mg every 4 weeks following discharge.\nOn September 2, almost three months after discharge, the patient suddenly developed a fever around 38\u00b0C and felt intermittent pain in his left lower leg. At that time, he was taking 25 mg of PSL daily. Although he developed steroid diabetes, his HbA1c levels were controlled within the normal range. When he presented to the emergency room of our hospital, his left lower leg had a localized reddish appearance and was slightly edematous without snowball crepitation.

He was hospitalized with a diagnosis of acute bacterial cellulitis.\nAfter admission, the patient received intravenous meropenem. His fever subsided and his mental status returned to normal within days. On day 23 after admission, his leg was no longer swollen or reddish, but the localized pain had not completely disappeared.

He reported having these symptoms for the last one year. Recently, his symptoms worsened and he needed to void every two hours and had nocturia multiple times a day. There was no history of difficulty with voiding, poor or intermittent urine stream, or postvoid dribbling.\nHis past medical history is remarkable for long-standing hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. He has been on amlodipine 5 mg once a day, metformin 1000 mg three times a day, and atorvastatin 20 mg once a day. He did not undergo any previous surgical operations. He worked as an accountant. He had smoked 10 cigarettes daily for the last 20 years. He consumed alcohol occasionally. The family history was non-contributory.\nUpon examination, the abdomen was soft with no tenderness or palpable masses. Digital rectal examination revealed no enlargement of the prostate. Examination of other systems was normal. The prostate-specific antigen level was 2.1 ng/ml. Urinalysis findings were normal. Urine culture revealed no significant growth.

Cerebral CT angiogram showed vascular lesions in the right ICA and right P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) (data not shown). Subsequent DSA demonstrated dilated, tortuous, and redundant right vessels of the supraclinoid ICA () and the right P1 segment ().

In addition, we found fresh blood clots around the P1 lesion and in the ambient cistern ().\nWe treated the P1 segment lesion by proximal occlusion combined with STA-P2 bypass. We confirmed the patency of bypass intraoperatively by Doppler ultrasonic probe and ICG video angiography. Moreover, the intraoperative ICG video angiography analyzed with Flow800 showed a blue P1 segment lesion after the proximal occlusion and STA-P2 bypass, indicating decreased perfusion of the lesion after the surgical procedure compared with perfusion before the treatment (). Post-operative CTA demonstrated that the bypass was patent (). The P1 segment lesion was still present after the operation but was smaller than the preoperative lesion according to the DSA images ().

    "original_text": "A 52-year-old woman was treated with percutaneous RFA for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at segment 7. She had been diagnosed with hepatitis B in 1997. Her past medical history revealed that she had undergone central bisectionectomy for a 5-cm HCC, which was located between segments 4 and 8, seven years ago. From August 2007 to May 2009, after the operation, she had been treated with transarterial chemoembolization for a total of six times due to a recurrent HCC at her remnant liver segments. When the seventh recurrence was detected by follow-up liver computed tomography (CT), RFA was performed percutaneously under ultrasonographic guidance in the 3.5-cm viable tumor of segment 7, located in the liver dome and close to the diaphragm. After RFA, the total bilirubin level gradually increased without any other symptoms, and a level of 10.9 mg/dl was measured 5 days post-RFA. A liver CT was performed thereafter, and showed obstructions of the entire right portal flow with right bile duct dilatation and decreased perfusions of the atrophic right posterior section. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed and showed structure of the common hepatic ducts and dilatation of both intrahepatic ducts (). Therefore, endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) was performed, and two plastic stents (pigtail stents with 7-french and 10-cm length) were inserted in the right and left bile ducts, respectively. The decreased level of total bilirubin was confirmed three days after stent insertions, and the patient was discharged without symptoms on that same day.

His previous medical history revealed a cholecystectomy.\nAbdominal examination at admission revealed a diffuse distention and mild rebound tenderness. Laboratory studies revealed unremarkable serum blood count, electrolytes, and liver biochemistry.\nAbdominal computed tomography (CT) without intravenous contrast demonstrated some gas-filled cysts within the small bowel wall, not associated with free intraperitoneal air. Based on the CT finding of air within the bowel wall, the patient was diagnosed with small bowel PI. The patient was not treated and he was discharged at his own request.\nOne month later, presenting with a new episode of generalized abdominal pain, the patient underwent abdominal ultrasound (US) and plain abdominal film. The latter showed a large amount of intramural gas within some small bowel loops (); US was useless due to intestinal tympanites. Abdominal CT with intravenous contrast administration was performed further to evaluate the pneumatosis and to investigate any possible complications. The scans confirmed the presence of small gas-filled cysts arising from the wall of the jejunum and ileum ().\nThe onset of subobstructive symptoms over the following first month led the patient to repeat abdominal CT examination with intravenous contrast.

She had been able to perform basic activities of daily living despite a functional capacity of less than 4 metabolic equivalents and she had had no cardiac symptoms other than shortness of breath on exertion before the neurologic symptoms occurred. Upon preoperative evaluation, a 2-dimensional (2-D) echocardiography showed severe AS (aortic valve area = 0.79 cm2, pressure gradient = 88/53 mmHg) and concentric LV hypertrophy. However, no LV outlet obstruction and LV dilatation was observed and the LV contractility, stroke volume, and ejection fraction were normal. The necessity of cardiac surgery before lumber discectomy and the possibility that the lumbar surgery could be delayed were discussed with neurosurgeons and cardiologists taking into consideration the anesthetic and surgical risks. Considering the condition of her AS, the cardiac surgery should have been performed first. However, the patient refused the cardiac surgery for financial reasons and because of her fears relating to cardiac surgery. The lumbar surgery was required to prevent aggravation of her neurologic symptoms/deficits. Therefore, we decided that CSEA was the safest anesthetic method to use after considering the potential risks of GA that can occur in AS patients with diminished cardiac reserve (mentioned above), the patient's cardiac condition and functional capacity, and the characteristics of the operation.\nOn the day of surgery, the patient was very nervous despite being premedicated with intramuscular midazolam 2 mg; her blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were 160/70 mmHg and 95 bpm, respectively. Before performing anesthesia, the patient was sufficiently hydrated and elastic stockings were applied to both legs to minimize blood pooling.

    "original_text": "A 26-year-old man was referred to our emergency department; he complained about bilateral red eye associated with a loss of visual acuity (VA) starting 1 week ago. His medical history was remarkable for grade IV chronic kidney disease secondary to genitourinary malformation and under treatment with hemodialysis. He developed secondary hypertension, which was managed with oral antihypertensive drugs.\nHis VA was \u2018hand motions\u2019 in both eyes. The anterior segment examination revealed bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhage with no signs of intraocular inflammation. Dilated fundus examination evidenced serous retinal detachment with macular involvement (fig. ). No retinal tears were observed in the peripheral retina examination with scleral depression. However, curvilinear whitish lesions scattered throughout the peripheral retina were observed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans confirmed the presence of subretinal fluid in the macular region (fig. ).\nThe patient was uncompliant to oral antihypertensive therapy and dialysis treatment. His blood pressure measured 180/110 mm Hg. A systemic workup was conducted with the only relevant finding of a significantly increased creatinine value (17 mg/dl).

He was diagnosed with a left femoral neck fracture, and surgery for the fixation of the left lower extremity with an intramedullary nail was planned. Preoperative interview revealed a history of tuberculosis and a subsequent pulmonary CT revealed severe tuberculous damage in left lung and diffuse lesions in right lung (Fig. ). Echocardiography showed significant pulmonary arterial hypertension (109 mm Hg). The patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class III. Ultimately, we performed an ultrasound-guided SIFI block combined with a sacral plexus block. After obtaining preoperative informed consent, sedation was initiated using an infusion of dexmedetomidine (1 \u03bcg/kg maintenance). Using all aseptic precautions, the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) was first palpated and a high frequency linear ultrasound transducer (UMT-400, Mindray, China) was placed over the inguinal ligament to identify the femoral artery. The probe was then moved laterally to identify the sartorius muscle and to place it at the center of the ultrasound field of vision. The probe was then rotated 30\u00b0, just perpendicular to inguinal ligament and moved towards the femoral head to identify the internal oblique muscle, iliacus muscle, and the ilium (Fig. ). Local anesthesia of puncture site was performed with 5 mL of 1% lidocaine, and a continuous plexus block needle (1000 mm \u00d7 20 G, Germany) for catheter placement was advanced in an in-plane technique, in the cephalad direction, to enter the superficial part of the fascia iliaca.

Lab findings showed elevated AST, ALT, pancreatic lipase, and direct bilirubin (). Patient was worked up for a differential diagnosis of pancreatitis versus cholecystitis.\nUltrasound of right upper quadrant found dilated common bile duct with minimal intrahepatic biliary dilation without any definite evidence of choledocholithiasis. Focal prominence was seen in the region of the pancreatic head with suggestion of atrophy within the remaining portions of visualized pancreas. MRCP was recommended. MRCP investigation found obstruction of the biliary tract as the extra hepatic CBD enters into the pancreatic head and mildly dilated pancreatic duct in body and tail. MRI confirmed this \u201cdouble duct sign\u201d finding of simultaneously dilated CBD and pancreatic duct. A normal CBD measures 4.1 mm in diameter and a normal pancreatic duct measures 3.0 mm in diameter, with the patient's CBD measuring 10 mm and pancreatic duct measuring 3.5 mm (). This finding is suggestive of a mass in the head and neck of the pancreas.\nDue to the continued symptoms of abdominal pain, the patient was scheduled for a simultaneous pancreaticoduodenectomy and needle biopsy with frozen section of mass. Patient tolerated the procedure well and no longer complained of any abdominal discomfort or pain.\nOn gross examination, the pancreatic mass measured 5.5 \u00d7 2.2 cm involving the bile duct and pancreatic duct. Histological samples were taken from the pancreatic tissue and lymph nodes. Lymph nodes showed reactive follicular hyperplasia, sinus histiocytosis, and scattered nonnecrotizing granulomas ().

On admission, she was found to have random venous glucose of 33 mm/L and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) of 13.1%. (Table ). She had a significant family history of diabetes, and her father was diagnosed to have diabetes mellitus (DM) before the age of 40. Her weight at baseline was 48 kgs, with a calculated body mass index of 18.5. Detailed history revealed that she did have mild polyuria and polydipsia with the onset of sinusitis-related symptoms. Her vitals were stable, and the initial physical examination was unremarkable. She was started on oral hypoglycaemic agents on admission but soon failed despite adequate doses and was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus. She was continued on her antibiotics for the treatment of sinusitis and commenced on insulin glargine 16 units at night, glulisine five units three times before meals, and metformin. She was discharged promptly after three days as she recovered from her sinusitis and was competent with the self-administration of insulin.\nOn Day 4, she was readmitted, as she developed generalized swelling. It started off with lower limb swelling and progressed to develop discomfort over her groin and lower abdominal area due to swelling. This swelling swiftly progressed to involve the upper limbs, abdomen, and torso the following day. She remained ambulant and did her usual activities and was compliant with her medications. She was not taking any other herbs or over-the-counter medicines when she went home. Her vitals were stable and her weight increased to 55 kgs by this time. Physical examination revealed a generalized edematous woman with marked pitting edema extending over all four limbs and face. Her heart sounds were dual and lung sounds were clear. The examination of her abdomen was unremarkable, apart from the soft tissue swelling. The examination did not reveal a shifting",

With the diagnosis of inguinal endometriosis, she had been treated with two cycles of low-dose birth-control pills, and five cycles of genogest previously, but the groin was increased in size to 5-cm with pain. In her past medical history, no history of gynecologic problems and specifically no dysmenorrhea nor dyspareunia were recorded. In the right groin, there was a 5-cm bulge which was detected as a homogeneous hypoechoic subcutaneous tumor and measured 53 \u00d7 29 mm by ultrasonography (Fig. ). Her serum cancer antigen-125 was elevated to 95.4 U/ml (range <35 U/ml) before starting hormone therapy, and down to 40 U/ml when she came to our hospital even though the tumor size was unchanged. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 6-cm unilocular tumor with internal high intensity in T1WI image which suggested internal bleeding (Fig. ). We diagnosed the right inguinal tumor as a Nuck cyst. An inguinal approach was selected and after opening the skin and subcutaneous fat, a dark red tumor was founded which protruded from the femoral ring, in spite of our initial impression that the tumor was located along the round ligament (Fig. ). After careful dissection, the tumor turned to be a unilocular cyst containing serous fluid, which was connected with the peritoneum through a string structure at the femoral ring, which was not connected with the abdominal cavity. The cyst was excised and the string structure was resected at the femoral ring. We inserted a plug into the extended femoral ring, and confirmed no other hernia. Her postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on the first postoperative day. The histopathologic examination showed that mesothelial cells lined the wall of the cyst with degeneration, inflammation, hemorrhage, formation of hyperplastic collagen fiber and hemos",

The bilateral TMJ ankylosis had been induced due to trauma when the patient was 4 years old. He had undergone TMJ surgery twice, but the operations had been unsuccessful and the TMJ ankylosis relapsed ().\nThe clinical examination revealed no systemic diseases. The patient\u2019s maximum incisal opening was 11mm. Because of the old injuries and unsuccessful operations, the mandibular deficiency had developed. The patient was experiencing sleeping disorders and mostly slept in a prone or a sitting position due to respiratory problems. The lateral and forward motions of the mandible were restricted. Based on the patient\u2019s condition and the past surgical history, a two-step treatment was performed. First, the gap arthroplasty method was applied, and afterwards, DO was performed.\nThe gap arthroplasty surgery was followed by physiotherapy. Approximately 3 to 10 days after the surgery, the patient was put on a soft diet and began the jaw-opening exercises. Three to four weeks after the surgery, a normal diet was started. After the discharge, the patient was visited once a week to evaluate the changes.\nThe osteodistractor was installed four months later (). After the installation, since the condylar stop had been removed in this case, and there was a possibility of upward and backward shift of the proximal mandibular segment, we used a custom-made device to prevent these movements.
