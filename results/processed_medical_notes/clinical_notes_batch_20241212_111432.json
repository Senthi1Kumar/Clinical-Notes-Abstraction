He did not undergo coronary revascularization because adenosine myocardial perfusion imaging showed perfusion defect during stress in the inferior and inferolateral region, consistent with the RCA territory and did not reveal evidence of reversible ischemia. His medical history was significant for cerebral infarction, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. His current medication with respect to antiarrhythmic drugs included amiodarone hydrochloride 100 mg and bisoprolol fumarate 1.25 mg.

Immediately performed transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a preserved left ventricular global function without significant wall motion abnormalities and no signs of right ventricular strain, though an extended diameter of the ascending aorta of 52 mm was accompanied by a mild aortic regurgitation with hemodynamically noncompromising pericardial effusion. Thus, under the working diagnosis of an acute aortic syndrome, a contrast-enhanced CT using a triple rule out protocol was initiated. Because of inadequate gating due to repeated premature ventricular contractions at the time of image acquisition despite administration of beta-blockers, finally a non-ECG-gated contrast-enhanced CT of the ascending aorta was completed in order to exclude aortic dissection. The CT showed an extended diameter of the ascending aorta with a maximum of 51 mm without hint for dissection membrane or false lumen. However, imaging of the aortic root as well as the supracoronary aorta was hampered by aortic motion artifacts, thereby judging a tiny contrast signal in the left anterior quadrant of the ascending aorta as a pseudointimal flap (Figures and ).\nIn order to rule out a peri-/myocarditis as another possible explanation for the persistent clinical symptoms, we performed a cardiac magnet resonance imaging (CMR) shortly after initial presentation. Surprisingly, cine-CMR imaging demonstrated an ulcer-like lesion superior to the aortic root in the left anterior quadrant of the ascending aorta () but no typical late enhancement pattern.

The mother complained that her son got tired easily on exerting himself during activities such as playing.\nUnder the routine admission protocol, the entire panel of blood markers was sent, electrocardiogram was performed, and the patient was then sent to the radiology department for an ultrasonographic evaluation and radiography. The hemoglobin was 9 gm/dL, and the packed cell volume (PCV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) too were below the lower limit of normal. The total leucocyte count at 23,900/\u03bcL was significantly raised, and differential leucocyte count revealed eosinophils at 60%. The electrocardiogram revealed a right bundle branch block with right ventricular strain pattern.\nUltrasonography (USG) of abdomen and pelvis revealed an enlarged midline liver with two sets of dilated hepatic veins; multiple splenules were seen on the right side with empty left splenic region.

Her past medical history was significant for rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and hyperthyroidism status after radioactive iodine ablation. No history of trauma or systemic etiology was found. Physical exam was unremarkable for motor or sensory neurological deficits. No functional impairment was detected. CT of abdomen and pelvis obtained at an outside facility revealed an enhancing mass identified within the medullary space of the right iliac bone which extends from the level of sacroiliac joint to the roof of right acetabulum (). Patient first underwent CT guided biopsy of the right acetabular mass. A pathological fracture was identified within the medial wall of the right iliac bone. Patient underwent incisional biopsy, curettage, and bone graft of right posterior wall of acetabulum.

The patient developed the onset of rapidly progressive motor weakness beginning in the lower extremities and ascending over the course of several days. He presented to an outside emergency department complaining of headache and ascending weakness. Due to the progression of his symptoms, he was urgently transferred to our institution. Upon arrival, the patient became more lethargic and began to desaturate requiring emergency intubation. A computerized tomography (CT) scan and computerized tomography angiogram (CTA) of the head and neck were performed which did not demonstrate any acute disease. A CT scan of the cervical spine demonstrated multilevel degenerative changes without evidence of canal compromise. There was initial clinical concern that this may represent a Guillain-Barre syndrome for which the patient underwent a lumbar puncture by the neurology team demonstrating an elevated protein and mild glucose elevation. A CT scan of the cervical spine demonstrated a slight grade 1 anterolisthesis of C2 on C3 and mild loss of C6 vertebral body height.

On examination, she was afebrile and normotensive but tachycardic with pulse of 100. Abdominal examination revealed mild epigastric tenderness. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis with white cell count of 15,600 per mcL and a normal comprehensive metabolic panel and lipase. A CT abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast was unremarkable and showed normal colon, small intestine, liver, and gall bladder. The stool studies including fecal leukocytes, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, ova, and parasites were normal. However, stool Clostridium difficile toxin test was positive. The patient failed to improve from the initial treatment with metronidazole and was switched to oral vancomycin, to which she responded well with resolution of diarrhea. She was discharged home on a probiotic (Saccharomyces boulardii 250 mg twice daily). A few weeks later she was hospitalized again with a recurrence of C. difficile diarrhea and was treated with a 2nd course of vancomycin with symptomatic improvement. About 2 months later she had her 3rd episode of C. difficile diarrhea for which was prescribed vancomycin with a prolonged taper. The patient continued to have abdominal discomfort and diarrhea even on vancomycin and because of multiple recurrences of C. difficile, she was being considered for a fecal transplant. However, the repeat C. difficile toxin was negative; hence the fecal transplant was not performed.\nThe patient had an extensive evaluation to determine the cause of persistent diarrhea with urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and chromogranin A, esophag",

She noted that she had been jet-skiing the previous day in brackish water and had sustained a small laceration on her left posterior calf.\nUpon awakening, the leg was examined by patient's mother who reported minimal inflammation surrounding the area of injury. Because she could not walk, an ambulance was called and the patient was taken to a local emergency department (ED). She was triaged as having cellulitis and it was determined that she did not need to be seen emergently. While still in the ED waiting room, the patient's pain rapidly increased and she developed nausea and lightheadedness. As per her mother, the patient's ED triage vitals showed that she was afebrile and her blood pressure was within normal limits. Because of incessant pain and long wait, the patient was transferred directly by her mother to a different ED at a tertiary medical center.\nOn arrival, the patient's mother noted increased swelling over the left lower extremity. Physical exam performed in the ED revealed a woman in modest distress. She was afebrile but tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats/minute. Bilateral lower extremity examination revealed limb symmetry with chronic venostasis. A small abrasion over the left calf with associated erythema and tenderness was noted. This area was outlined with a skin marker. Of note, no vesicles, bullae, petechiae, or purpura was initially noted. There was no evidence of an ankle effusion or any ascending lymphangitis.

She suddenly developed a severe headache accompanied by vomiting after severe coughing. Her headache was alleviated within approximately minutes, but severe back pain suddenly developed. She visited the orthopedic department of our hospital, and analgesic drugs were prescribed. Improvement of her back pain with analgesic drugs was temporary, and her headache with nausea exacerbated and became progressively worse. She visited the neurology department 6 days after the onset. Computed tomography of her brain showed no abnormal findings, but a lumbar puncture revealed bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). She was immediately admitted to the neurology department of our hospital with the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage. She had no history of trauma and had not been prescribed anticoagulation agents. Her blood pressure on admission was 149/67mmHg. No neurological deficits were found except for meningism. There were no clinical features suggesting BD, including a positive pathergy test result or the presence of typical genital or ocular lesions. Hematological and coagulation function test results were normal. The test results of antinuclear antibodies and anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid were negative. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of her lumbar spine taken on day 1 were reviewed retrospectively. A sagittal T1-weighted MR image showed a diffuse isosignal intensity in the subarachnoid space; therefore, no normal-appearing thecal sac or nerve roots were observed (Figure A). Sagittal and axial T2-weighted MR images showed a high signal intensity, which was slightly lower than the signal intensity of CSF per se, from L1 to L2, in the ventrolateral subarachnoid space (Figure B and C). These findings were indicative of acute hemorrhage. Digital subtraction angiography on day 7 disclosed no abnormal findings. MR images of the lumbar spine on day 8 showed high signal intensity on T1-weighted images, and a low signal intensity on T2-weighted",

In light of worsening abdominal distention with concern for abdominal compartment syndrome, biopsy and drain placement of the mass was performed on hospital day 7. Over the next several days, persistent sanguineous drain output and resultant anemia were concerning for hemorrhage. CT revealed an infrarenal IVC thrombus (see ) and near-occlusive embolus distal to the left pulmonary artery. TTE was obtained revealing compression of the distal IVC at the right atrial junction with normal biventricular function and no evidence of elevated right heart pressures. Although heparin was initiated, there was significant difficulty in maintaining therapeutic anticoagulation in light of the underlying hemorrhagic liver mass as well as coagulopathy in the setting of synthetic liver dysfunction.\nOn hospital day 15, the patient underwent right hepatectomy with caudate lobe resection. In light of the patient's coagulopathy, IVC thrombus, pulmonary embolus (PE), and the anticipated use of intraoperative TEE, a pediatric cardiac anesthesiologist was requested. In addition, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, a perfusionist, and the cardiac surgical team were also on standby. Blood products were placed on hold, and a rapid transfusion device was readied in the OR. The patient arrived to the OR with a double lumen PICC and two 20-gauge PIVs in situ.

She denied any bowel symptoms. The patient had been diagnosed with a large multi-fibroid uterus whilst living in the USA, however, due to a lack of health insurance and high medical costs, surgical treatment had not been sought. She had received two blood transfusions in 2018 due to anaemia. Due to the coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic she decided to return home to Australia and upon her return presented to the emergency department seeking treatment. Her body mass index was 36 and she had iron deficiency anaemia secondary to heavy menstrual bleeding. She had no past surgical history. She had never been pregnant and desired preservation of her fertility. She was on oral iron supplementation.\nOn examination, her vital signs were within normal limits. Her uterus was palpable to just below the xiphisternum and her abdomen was mildly tender. A full blood count was performed which showed haemoglobin of 91 g/l with a mean corpuscular volume of 73 fL. Renal function was normal. A pelvic ultrasound revealed a uterus that was grossly enlarged by multiple fibroids, extending above the level of the umbilicus and into the right hypochondrium. The largest fibroid was a broad-based right fundal exophytic subserosal fibroid measuring 147 \u00d7 114 \u00d7 180 mm. There was a large posterior intramural fibroid measuring 124 \u00d7 111 \u00d7 103 mm, in addition to multiple other fibroids. The patient was further assessed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; ), which re-demonstrated marked uterine enlargement secondary to the fibroids, some of which demonstrated areas T2 hyperintensity reflecting cystic degeneration.

The patient had a known history of breast cancer diagnosed 10 years ago, and was coded status post mastectomy and radiation. On physical examination, she had 4/5 bilateral lower extremity weakness and diminished sensation below the T4 spinal level.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 1.6 \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 9.7 cm large enhancing extradural mass in the dorsal aspect of the spinal canal extending from T4 to T11 (fig. ). There was near-complete effacement of the spinal cord resulting in SCC. Large bulky enhancing bilateral paraspinal masses were also seen in addition to multiple masses in the lungs and liver that were compatible with metastatic lesions.\nGiven the patient's neurological deficits and MRI findings, a T4\u2013T8 laminectomy was performed to decompress the spinal cord and resect the lesion. Intraoperatively, the bone was noted to be very soft and the marrow appeared grossly abnormal. The epidural lesion was encased within a capsule, allowing improved resection. The spinal cord itself was significantly compressed and deformed from the mass effect of the lesion. After resection of the lesion, the spinal cord was noted to pulsate, which indicated adequate decompression. An initial frozen section of the bone revealed marrow elements with trilineage hematopoiesis, and a frozen section of the lesion itself revealed a hypercellular lesion.\nMicroscopic examination revealed the resected mass to be composed of densely cellular hematopoietic marrow showing trilineage hematopoiesis with marked erythroid hyperplasia. Immunohistochemical stains confirmed the presence of all three hematopoietic lineages (fig. ). There was no evidence of any metastatic tumor, lymphoma, or leukemia.\nThe patient recovered well from surgery, and her lower extremities returned to full strength several days following surgery.

The patient had suffered from occasional and transient episodes of abdominal discomfort during the last year. At the day of presentation the patient first experienced diffuse upper abdominal discomfort with later sudden pain in the right lower abdomen. The patient had palpable tenderness in the right lower quadrant, without signs of peritoneal irritation. The patient was afebrile and had a hemoglobin level of 145 g/l and a white blood cell count of 10.7 E9/l. The level of C-reactive protein was normal. Urine analysis was negative as well as analysis for human chorionic gonadotropin. The patient responded poorly to analgesic medications and a gynecological consultation was requested to exclude torsion of the ovary. Vaginal ultrasonography revealed a regular cystic mass between the uterus and the right ovary. This finding was verified with transabdominal ultrasonography, which showed a tubular mass of unknown origin. In order to characterize the finding further an MRI of the lower abdomen was performed. On MRI a fluid-filled appendiceal mass (8x3x3 cm) with relative wall-thickening was observed. The surrounding structures showed inflammatory changes with edema of the appendiceal mesentery. Abrupt tapering of the appendix was seen at the base of the mucocele (Figure \n). Based on the imaging results and acute clinical presentation a laparoscopic appendectomy was performed immediately the following working day. A distended and necrotic appendix was observed with a 720 degree clockwise torsion of its base (Figure \n). The abdominal cavity was otherwise macroscopically normal, with no signs of dissemination.

No bleeding-promoting drug was used before and after the surgery.\nSixteen hours after the surgery, he complained of severe bilateral lower leg pain and swelling. Initial evaluation of lower extremities revealed foot drop, swelling and tightness of the anterolateral aspects, and stretch pain on passive ankle planter flexion. No remarkable finding was appreciated on the posterior aspects of his lower legs. Serum creatine kinase was elevated to at 28000 U/l. The compartment pressure was measured by an arterial line set with simple 18-gauge needle under the diastolic blood pressure of 98 mmHg. The measurement was performed at three places of each compartment, and the average value was recorded. The anterior and lateral compartment pressures in both legs had increased to 200 mmHg despite normal posterior compartment pressure (35 mmHg) or thigh compartment pressure (35 mmHg). Contrasting computed tomography (CT) showed swelling of the bilateral muscles in the anterior and lateral compartments without contrasting effect compared to the posterior compartments ().

    "original_text": "An 80-year-old male (77 kg), operated 4 years previously with resection of the sigmoid colon because of a T3N1M0 adenocarcinoma, had been lost to follow up after the colonic surgery. When returning he presented with elevated CEA and a workup including CT scan of the abdomen revealed a 95 mm tumour in the right liver lobe. The tumour was located mainly in segments 5 and 6 (), but it was extended towards the portal branches to segments 7 and 8. He was presented at a multidisciplinary tumour board. A decision was made to start chemotherapy in order to downsize the tumour. The left liver lobe was noted to be small (348 mL, <20% of total liver volume). A follow-up CT scan after 2 months of chemotherapy showed little or no reduction in tumour size. The strategy was changed to a preoperative right-sided PVE followed by a right-sided hemihepatectomy. A new CT scan, after PVE, revealed a 42% growth of the FLR, but it was still only 23% of the total liver volume. As the patient had received chemotherapy, this was found to be insufficient for resection. To further stimulate the growth of the FLR, ISS between segment 5/8 and segment 4 was done and vessel loops were placed around the right portal pedicle and the right liver vein at the first operation that lasted 164 minutes with estimated blood loss of 300 mL ().

The patient described the pain as radiating and achy. On the physical exam, the patient had decreased sensation in the lateral aspect of the right lower extremity. Radiological findings demonstrated multilevel central stenosis and neuroforaminal narrowing with a degenerative scoliotic deformity of the lumbar spine (Figures , ). A conservative trial for up to a year with physical therapy, chiropractic and interventional pain modalities provided partial and short-lasting relief. As the pain continued to progress, the patient decided to proceed with surgery.\nVarious surgical options were considered. Eventually the patient underwent an ALIF at the L3-S1 levels using a retroperitoneal approach followed by a T10-pelvis posterior spinal fusion and a right L4-L5 laminotomy and decompression in two stages (Figure ). The post-operative course was complicated by abdominal distention that occurred on post-operative day eight. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a large collection of retroperitoneal fluid measuring 11 x 9 x 22 cm in the left pelvis and left flank area with mass effect on the left kidney and ureter causing hydronephrosis (Figure ). After a consult with the general surgery team and the approach surgeon, the patient underwent ultrasound-guided drainage of fluid with temporary drain placement.\nThe fluid was serosangionous in nature with a high output of greater than 1500 cc/day. Fluid gram stain showed no organisms and cultures also revealed no growth. He was discharged home with the drain in place for a total of 22 days after which the drain was discontinued upon clinic follow-up.

Since the past 8\u20139 months there were gradual changes in his moods in the form of increased irritability. He had been indulging in SIB which included banging his head against the wall, slapping his face, and biting his hands and forearms.

There was no recurrence of symptoms and he did not seek any further medical attention locally. The foreign body was the entire prosthetic vascular graft [] with sutures at either end and was easily identified as the graft of a Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt.\nThe patient was diagnosed to have tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) at birth and had undergone BT shunt procedure for recurrent spells at the age of nine months. Subsequently, corrective surgery for TOF was done at the age of 2 years. The BT shunt was occluded by ligating in the middle, as is routinely done at the time of corrective surgery. At the postoperative follow up 6 months later, right pulmonary artery stenosis was identified that required a balloon dilatation with relief of gradients. The right ventricular systolic pressure fell to 60 mmHg (from 100 mmHg), and the relief was maintained at further evaluation 6 months later. The patient was lost to follow up thereafter, but was asymptomatic until the present episode. His present physical examination showed heart rate of 84 /min, blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, and a precordial ejection systolic murmur. The chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly, dilated pulmonary artery segment, and normal lung fields. The echocardiogram was consistent with the postoperative TOF but showed significant pulmonary regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation, smaller right pulmonary artery, and mild right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction.\nA CT angiogram documented normal right subclavian artery, smaller but normal right pulmonary artery with no focal stenosis, or pseudoaneurysm.

She was working as a full-time bank employee, and hindfoot pain on standing and walking was making her train commute to work difficult. She had no significant medical, family, or psychosocial history. Ankle range of motion (ROM) was limited to 10\u00b0 for dorsal flexion and 40\u00b0 for plantar flexion. Physical examination revealed diffuse ankle swelling, Achilles tendon stiffness, and moderate tenderness to palpation. Despite this discomfort, she could walk stably without a limp and stand on her tiptoes. Radiographs revealed extensive Achilles tendon ossification and osteoarthritis of the ankle joint (Fig. , ). The length of the ossification was approximately 14 cm. She was prescribed oral anti-inflammatory agents. Ten days later, she felt a sudden pain in her right hindfoot while going up the stairs. The pain progressively worsened, causing her to limp. She visited our clinic several days after the incident. Ankle ROM was reduced to \u22125\u00b0 for dorsal flexion and 30\u00b0 for plantar flexion. Palpation revealed a severely tender defect 5 cm proximal to the Achilles tendon insertion. She could not stand on her right tiptoe and had a positive Thompson test. A radiograph of her right Achilles tendon showed a gap within the ossified mass, indicating FOAT (Fig. ).

    "original_text": "A 28-year-old female was being followed by the breast surgical team since the age of 22 for abnormal breast lesions. She had a complex medical history significant for autism, developmental delay, seizure disorders and encephalitis at age 1. She has been on OCPs for contraception for the past 10 years. Her medications included Risperdal, Topamax, Klonopin and Trileptal. Family history was negative for any breast lesions or ovarian cancers.\nShe was first seen by the surgical team for left breast fibroadenoma that was removed at age 22. The team continued to follow the patient, and at age 24, a bilateral excisional breast biopsy was conducted. Pathology showed benign mammary tissue with lobular hyperplasia and adenosis. No further intervention was required and the patient was followed with US imaging at regular intervals.\nAt age 25, she presented with a palpable left and right breast lump. US found a Breast Imaging Reporting and Database System score (BIRADS) 3 lesion showing a right breast hypoechoic lesion at the 4 o\u2019clock position that was approximately 1 cm in size with ill-defined margins.

At the age of 7, the first symptom of dystonia appeared as clumsiness of the hands; when he started to attend elementary school, he experienced difficulty with schoolwork because of an abnormal handgrip during writing. He was also noted to have difficulty playing with small objects such as building blocks or certain musical instruments such as a flute or piano. At first, the condition progressed very slowly. At the age of 10, the patient\u2019s father became aware that his son\u2019s hand clumsiness was not correlated with his age and development, and sought medical help. The boy visited a rehabilitation clinic for the hand clumsiness and underwent a series of rehabilitation treatments without obvious improvement. He also visited a pediatric neurologist for evaluation, but the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed only a parapineal arachnoid cyst, and no specific diagnosis was made at that time. However, when the patient was 11 years old, scoliosis appeared that mainly involved the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spine and abnormal posture, which rapidly deteriorated in the following 6 months. His gait and stance became severely impeded due to the severity of the scoliosis. He visited orthopedic doctors at the local hospital and received various medications, botulinum toxin injection, a back brace, and different types of physical therapy based on an initial suspicion of adult idiopathic scoliosis. None of these treatments were effective for the scoliosis. Muscle biopsy was performed but the results were normal. He was finally referred to a pediatric neurologist (WTL) at our center. Levodopa was given as a trial but had no effect. Laboratory biochemical tests showed no abnormalities and medication-induced and acquired dystonia were excluded.

This difficulty was associated with slippage of footwear from the right foot, with his being aware of it. Despite the weakness, the patient was able to walk with support and had no disability in terms of activities of daily living. On lying down, the patient had spontaneous involuntary painful drawing up of legs, in response to noxious or non-noxious stimuli. He noted these abnormal movements six months after the onset of the illness and since the last two months, these movements were frequent enough to disturb his sleep. The patient also had increased frequency, urgency and incontinence of urine for the past one year. There were no sensory complaints. There was no history of headache, vomiting, seizures, head or back trauma or fever. There was history of low backache for the last two years, which was intermittent, radiating along the back of right thigh, not increasing on straining or with change in posture and which used to respond to analgesics.\nThe patient was of average build, with normal results on general physical examination. Neurological examination revealed normal higher mental functions and cranial nerves.

The pain, described as an \u201celectric shock.\u201d was also irradiated to the lateral surface of the leg. He then underwent ultrasonography, with a first diagnosis of subcutaneous cyst; subsequently, he was submitted in another institution, under local anesthesia, to an attempt for surgical removal by a dermatology specialist; however, the procedure was aborted due to the onset of acute pain. A first MRI [ and ] was, therefore, performed in November 2018, depicting a homogeneous lesion of about 12 \u00d7 13 mm at the branching point between the left common peroneal and sural nerves. Surprisingly, the patient was not evaluated by a neurosurgeon at that moment. He was instead evaluated by another physician in an outpatient clinic and submitted to 5 mL intra- and perilesional injection of ozone-oxygen mixture. The procedure caused a dramatic, intense, and durable local pain in addition to the previously experienced radiating pain to the lateral leg surface.

She had a limping gait and complained of a limited walking ability of 5\u201310 minutes with a cane because of pain. She originally had limited walking ability due to a cerebral infarction 10 years prior that was classified as least-limited community walker according to the classification by Perry et al. []; however, she had been able to walk without a cane for 30 minutes prior to symptom onset. An examination revealed bilateral hindfoot valgus and flatfoot deformities, and both feet were rigid and not reducible. The physical examination revealed localized swelling and tenderness on the distal fibula about 5 cm proximal to the tip of the left lateral malleolus.\nAn anteroposterior (AP) weight-bearing view of the left ankle joint revealed the fracture of the distal fibula, valgus talar tilt with joint space narrowing at the lateral tibiotalar joint, and collapse of the lateral talar dome (). An AP weight-bearing view of the right ankle joint revealed similar findings on the contralateral side excluding the fracture of the distal fibula (). Lateral weight-bearing views of both feet demonstrated severe arch collapse and increased radiodensity of the body of the talus (Figures and ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left ankle revealed a vertical crack in the talar body extending from the center of the talar dome to the subtalar joint and a lateral talar body fragment with low signal intensity on both T1-weighted and short T1 inversion recovery images suggestive of osteonecrosis (Figures and ). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the left ankle clearly demonstrated that the fracture lines extended from the talar dome to the subtalar joint with the comminuted lateral talar body fragments and the fracture of the distal fibula with callus formation (Figures and ). MRI of the right ankle also revealed",

He was diagnosed 5 years ago and was on maintenance treatment with sodium valproate but had poor compliance to medication. During this index presentation, he was placed on olanzapine 10 mg daily and sodium valproate 400 mg twice a day. One week into admission the dose of olanzapine was increased to 20 mg daily because of increasing restlessness and grandiose delusion. About 1 month into admission, he was in remission but was noticed to have swelling of both legs and hands. The patient was not a known hypertensive or diabetic. There was no history of use of alcohol but used cigarette and cannabis before presentation. The patient did not report any change in his dietary and fluid intake. He was not on any drug known to cause edema such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, antihypertensive, or immunosuppressive agents.\nOn examination, he had a nonpitting pedal severe edema while that of the hands were mild based on the classification of severity of edema.[] Blood pressure, cardiac, and abdominal examinations were normal. The urea, creatinine, electrolytes, thyroid function test, liver function tests, and serum proteins were normal. Urine test, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram and abdominopelvic ultrasound were also normal.\nWhen the above investigation turned out to be normal olanzapine was stopped, based on emerging evidence of rare association of olanzapine with peripheral edema.[] One week after discontinuation of olanzapine, edema was moderately severe and therefore, frusemide 5 mg was introduced and within 2 weeks swelling completely resolved. He was then placed on risperidone 4 mg daily and sodium valproate. This patient had used sodium valproate without a report of edema in the past. The adverse effect was scored using the Naranjo's algorithm for adverse drug reaction probability scale,[] and a score of 7 was obtained which indicate strong association of edema with olanzapine.",
