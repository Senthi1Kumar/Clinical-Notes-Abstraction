Her husband had died 2 years back. Patient was P4L4Ao, one male, and three female children. All the deliveries took place at home and were uneventful. Patient gave history of being pregnant approximately 36 years back and had visited rural health care center for decreased fetal movement where fetal demise was diagnosed. Patient was discharged against medical advice and went to a quack for treatment.\nShe gave a history of reduction in abdominal girth thereafter. The patient discontinued the treatment from the quack.\nHer blood investigations revealed low (6.9 g%) hemoglobin with RBCs showing anisocytosis and mild hypochromia. Urine routine examination was normal. Kidney function tests were within normal limits.\nOn examination, abdomen was soft and nontender.

On physical examination, tenderness was elicited in the right upper quadrant without rebound or guarding. Laboratory testing revealed an international normalized ratio of 3.2 and normal liver chemistries. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a 15-cm expansile cystic lesion replacing the left lobe of the liver with mild heterogeneous attenuation and thin internal septations (Figure ). Because of ongoing concerns for malignant transformation, a laparoscopic left hepatic segmentectomy with cyst resection was performed. The cyst contained about 1.5 L of bile and blood (Figure ). Histopathologic evaluation revealed a benign hepatic cyst with chronic inflammation, organized hemorrhage, hemosiderin encrustation, and calcification with surrounding normal liver parenchyma.\nSimple hepatic cysts are believed to arise from congenital bile duct malformations that fail to communicate with the biliary tree. The prevalence of simple hepatic cysts ranges between 5% and 15% depending on the imaging modality and increases with age. Hemorrhagic hepatic cyst (HHC) is a rare complication of simple cysts, with less than 40 cases reported thus far. The clinical presentation is not a reliable indicator of active bleeding in simple hepatic cyst. However, it is essential to consider hemorrhagic rupture when patients present with severe abdominal pain. Abdominal ultrasound findings such as hyperechogenic septa, a thick wall, and mural nodules suggest hemorrhage. Accurate diagnosis of the primary etiology of the HHC by imaging studies is challenging because cystic neoplasms such as biliary cystadenomas or cystadenocarcinomas share the same findings as HHC. Magnetic resonance imaging shows hemorrhage as high-intensity areas on T1- and T2-weighted sequences without enhancement of mural nodules after contrast. CT scan showed heterogeneous attenuation raising concerns for malignancy; hence, the patient was offered surgical resection.

The patient also complained of nasal regurgitation of food and hypernasality of voice. At the time of presentation, the patient was demoralized and psychologically unstable. The maxillectomy adversely affected the patient\u2019s psychological state as she failed to communicate and follow commands, along with unintelligible speech.\nOn extraoral examination, facial asymmetry was found. Her past medical history revealed that the patient had uncontrolled type II diabetes mellitus for which she had been on medication for the past 15 years. The patient was malnourished and was taking nutritional supplements for the same. The patient was diagnosed with mucormycosis of the left maxillary sinus a year earlier for which she underwent surgical debridement one month prior to presentation. Intraoral examination revealed a completely edentulous maxilla and mandible and an oronasal fistula on the left side of the maxilla. The oral side of the defect extended into the buccal vestibule and lateral to the left hard palate with an adequate amount of alveolar ridge overlying the defect (Figure ).\nProsthodontic intervention\nAfter discussing the possible treatment options with the patient, considering her age and medical condition, fabrication of a conventional complete denture prosthesis that would restore aesthetics and function, as well as obliteration of the fistula, was planned. A maxillary and mandibular preliminary impression was taken with irreversible hydrocolloid using a stock tray (after packing the defect with gauze to prevent impression material from entering the nasal cavity).

The specimen consisted of a polypoid mass measuring 2.5\u00d7 2.3 cm. The histopathological examination showed malignant melanoma and a clear resection, and the HMB-45 immunohistochemical stain result was positive. She visited our hospital for consultation about possible remnant tumor and the risk of recurrence. Therefore, we performed a series of tests to identify the stage of the disease.\nColonoscopy confirmed no evidence of residual tumor, and there was a previous operative scar at the dentate line. Five biopsies were performed, all of which were negative for anorectal carcinoma. MRI of the rectum showed 2 residual lymph node metastases in the left lateral pelvic sidewall along the internal iliac axis and 2 other lymph node metastases in the left obturator and lateral sacral area. No demonstrable residual primary lesions were seen in the rectum. Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT showed a focal fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the anal canal, which was attributed to postexcisional inflammatory change, and 2 round nodular lesions in the left perirectal area and left presacral pelvic with no discernible FDG uptake.\nAfter consultation at a multidisciplinary team meeting, we decided that she would undergo laparoscopic ultralow anterior resection (ULAR) with coloanal anastomosis and diversion ileostomy, and she had an uncomplicated recovery. Gross examination showed a small scar located at the dentate line which corresponded to the lesion from the first transanal operation. The histopathological report showed no residual malignant melanoma and metastatic malignant melanoma in 1 out of 42 regional lymph nodes in the following location; left internal iliac (0 of 5), inferior mesenteric artery (0 of 4), left common iliac (0 of 9), left obturator (1 of 9) and regional (0 of 15).

Tooth #48, which was horizontally embedded, was extracted in August 2010, but the pain continued. In August 2015, she presented at the Department of Oral Surgery of another hospital with a purulent discharge from the pocket of tooth #47. Intraoral radiography showed insufficient root canal filling in the distal root and a foreign body, suspected to be extruded gutta-percha, outside the apex of the mesial root of tooth #47, accompanied by bone absorption around both roots (Fig. ). Two months later, she underwent extraction of tooth #47, removal of the foreign body, and curettage of the periapical lesion, resulting in the disappearance of the pain. However, she noted expansion of the right posterior mandibular bone in March 2016 and was thus referred in May 2016 to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan. Her health and nutritional status were good in spite of a low body mass index (17.0). Both a blood test and a chest X-ray showed normal findings. She had neither lymphadenopathy nor paralysis of the mental/lingual nerve. The right inferior border of the mandibular bone slightly bulged. The socket of tooth #47 was epithelialized, and tooth #46 was vital, with a pocket depth of 3 mm. There was no sinus tract. Panoramic radiography revealed new bone formation at the equivalent sites of teeth #48 and #47 and a radiolucent region around the distal root of tooth #46 (Fig. ).

Careful evaluation did not identify any extra-renal malformations. The child was maintained under conservative therapy with nutritional management and dietary phosphate and potassium restriction, dietary phosphate binders, calcitriol, and folic acid, with dose adjustments according to blood chemistry results.

At first, she underwent a 72-hour monitored fast and biochemical testing for endogenous hyperinsulinism, which proved positive. Once the other causes of spontaneous hypoglycemia were excluded, we started the process of localization of insulinoma. Then the patient underwent endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) of pancreas with the find of hypoechogenic, well demarcated, hypervascular tumor in the head of pancreas size of 12.4 \u00d7 10.5 mm (). Computed tomography (CT) examination of abdomen followed up and tumor of pancreatic head, corresponding with the diagnosis of insulinoma, was found (). It was located nearby pancreatic and biliary duct. Because of serious clinical symptoms, an early surgical treatment was indicated. Based on the evaluation of the surgeon to perform the less radical surgery, it was suggested to enucleate the tumor with preoperative stenting of pancreatic and biliary duct. Two days before the surgery, ERCP with insertion of pancreatic and duodenobiliary stent was performed (). With regard to the patient's preference and overweight, laparotomic approach was selected. Determination of the exact position of tumor was difficult, insulinoma was hardly palpable. We used intraoperative ultrasonography to identify the exact location of tumor (). Then the surgeon palpated the inserted stents and the insulinoma was identified intrapancreatically, 3\u20134 mm nearby pancreatic and bile duct. Enucleation of tumor was performed by harmonic scalpel (). During the surgery, the right position of stents was verified by touch. After enucleation, there was no presence of bleeding, the defect was filled with tissue glue (). Macroscopically, tumor was round shaped, well capsulated, size 1 cm (). During postsurgery period, the patient was stable and with no signs of complication. On the sixth postoperative day, endoscopic removal of pancreatic stent was carried out. Patient was discharged from the hospital on the eight postoperative day. Duoden",

He also had a history of multiple hospitalizations for congestive heart failure. Our patient presented to us with worsening leg edema and weight gain. He had no fever, headache and denied other symptoms. However, he was noticed to have a foul smelling discharge from the right nostril. Upon further assessment, he mentioned that he had this symptom for years, but never complained about this and he never had a work-up for this nasal discharge. On physical examination, he had a temperature of 97.3\u00b0F, blood pressure of 110/65 mmHg, and heart rate of 75 beats per minute. He had a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.

This patient had no previous injuries to the knee and was otherwise medically fit, with a known diagnosis of EDS. He had a MRI scan in February 2012 which demonstrated a full thickness tear of the ACL, with a typical pattern of bone bruising of the lateral femoral condyle and posterior aspect of the lateral tibial condyle (Figures and ). The posterior cruciate and collateral ligaments were normal. He was subsequently reviewed in the senior author's clinic in April 2012. At this point, the patient had received no treatment and had symptomatic instability and occasional pain. Clinically, the knee had marked anteroposterior laxity. Following discussion, and in light of his significant symptomatic instability and high level of preoperative activity, the option of surgical reconstruction was chosen.\nIn July 2012, he underwent an arthroscopic ACL reconstruction along with a notchplasty. The notchplasty was performed because hyperextension of the knee in EDS is more common and thus may cause impingement of graft against notch. Additionally, a tight notch may have been the reason for failure of the original ACL. The graft was a combined ipsilateral hamstring autograft (two strands) and LARS ligament (two strands), measuring 9 mm in diameter with endobutton suspensory fixation proximally and interference screw fixation distally after tensioning. Postoperative laxity and pivot shift correction were excellent. Standard physiotherapy protocols were followed.\nAt one year after reconstruction his knee on examination was stable and he had resumed sporting activities. MRI scan at 16 months showed the reconstruction to be intact, well-tensioned and with no signs of complications (Figures and ). Two years postoperatively, the patient scored 90 out of 100 on the Lysholm Knee Scale, and he has returned to playing soccer, tennis, and cricket.",

The gastrohepatic ligament, phrenoesophageal membrane, esophagus, and crura of the diaphragmatic were dissected, with inferior sectioning of the crura to enable the arcuate ligament to be viewed. Relief of celiac trunk compression was achieved by sectioning the arcuate ligament by electrocautery and the crura were drawn back together to prevent gastroesophageal reflux.

Specifically, he described intermittent disorientation and difficulty concentrating at work with brief amnesic spells. At home, he would episodically speak to his wife in an incoherent manner. In retrospect, his symptoms went back 7 to 8 years, although these initial episodes were more often preceded by hunger, blurred vision, and occasionally paresthesias. Further history taking revealed that all episodes happened after a prolonged fast or in the absence of food for at least 4 to 5 hours. The symptoms would predictably and almost immediately resolve with eating food or drinking juice. He had no associated tremor or diaphoresis. He did not report any history of seizures or syncope. Notably, he had experienced a weight gain of almost 10 pounds over the last year. He also complained of persistent abdominal discomfort and bloating.\nHis past medical history included lymphedema, gout, and intraocular lens replacement. He was not receiving any prescription medications. He was taking supplements of vitamin D, fish oil, vitamin B complex, and probiotics. His family history was significant for pancreatic cancer in his mother.\nPrior to his referral to endocrinology, he was also being investigated for vague abdominal symptoms. During a lactose tolerance test, he began having a symptomatic episode and was found to have a very low serum blood glucose of 1.2 mmol/L. The lactose tolerance test checks for glucose levels rising as lactose breaks down. After being provided a glucose meter to check his blood sugar, he recorded many days of consistently low fasting morning capillary glucose readings ranging between 2.2 and 3.2 mmol/L.

Seven months after the initial surgery, the patient was referred to a multidisciplinary surgical oncologic team of a tertiary liver center.\nHe was referred because at follow-up, the ultrasound of the liver showed two hyperechoic lesions with a hypoechoic halo around them. This is known as the bulls-eye aspect and made us suspect a malignant lesion (fig. ). Besides the liver lesions, some abnormalities of the gallbladder were found. In the fundus of the gallbladder, a polyp-shaped mass was detected. The gallbladder wall at this point was not distinguishable from the mass, and there was a second small thickening of the gallbladder wall in the body of the gallbladder (fig. ). The patient had no symptoms at the time of the abdominal ultrasonography.\nA complementary MRI without contrast was performed and showed multiple abnormalities: two well-circumscribed lesions in segments 6/7 and 5 of the liver with a hypointense signal intensity on the T1-weighted image, a slight hyperintense signal intensity on the T2-weighted image and a slightly restricted diffusion in the edge of the lesions. These signal characteristics matched the characteristics of colorectal metastases (fig. ) []. The mass in the gallbladder was a thickening of the wall of the fundus, with a slight hyperintense signal on the T1-weighted image and a partly hyperintense partly isointense signal intensity on the T2-weighted image. There was a minimally restricted diffusion.

A baseline, pretreatment multigated acquisition scan demonstrated normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 64%. The patient was started on cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg intravenously daily for 4 days with mesna protection for hemorrhagic cystitis. By day 4, she became thrombocytopenic and neutropenic prompting the initiation of filgastrim. On day 5, she developed clinical heart failure with rapid deterioration over the next 24 hours. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with no other abnormalities. Biochemistry showed a troponin I elevation to >30 mmol/L. Urgent echocardiography found severe thickening of the myocardium, a significant pericardial effusion, and evidence of tamponade with right ventricular diastolic collapse and marked variation of right ventricular outflow tract flow during respiration ( and ). Despite urgent pericardiocentesis, there was no improvement in her hemodynamic status, and she progressed to pulseless electrical activity. Following initial resuscitation, she was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. On day 6, signs of neurological recovery were seen and a Levitronix CentriMag (Levitronix, Waltham, MA) biventricular assist device was implanted providing successful mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to decision. Although she remained hemodynamically stable on mechanical circulatory support, her renal function did not recover, requiring continuous renal replacement therapy. The patient went on to develop a large area of ischemic colitis resulting in her death on day 19.\nCardiac autopsy revealed diffuse geographic areas of ischemic necrosis and multifocal thrombosis involving capillaries and larger muscular arterial branches ( and ). Frequent contraction bands were seen. The adjacent myocardium showed reactive changes with myocyte swelling, interstitial edema and hemorrhage, and a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes.

The fractures were managed surgically with closed reduction and 3.0 mm intramedullary elastic nailing of the ulna and open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the radius with a 3.5 mm dynamic compression plate (DCP). Follow-up at two months confirmed satisfactory progress and radiological evidence of the union. The patient was scheduled for elective removal of the elastic nail at three months.\nOne week prior to metalwork removal the patient tripped and fell onto his outstretched left hand. He presented with severe clinical deformity of the forearm and severe distal neurovascular deficit (Figure ). The hand was pale with an absent radial pulse, prolonged capillary refill time (CRT) and no digital signal on pulse oximetry. Furthermore, both sensory numbness and motor weakness in the distributions of both median and ulna nerves were noted.\nEmergent closed reduction in the emergency department was only partially successful in restoring alignment, with restoration of the CRT but persistent neurological deficit. Post-reduction radiographs revealed persistent angular deformity of sixty degrees. Re-fracture of the ulna with plastic deformation of the flexible nail was again noted, as was a periprosthetic fracture at the distal margin of the radial plate (Figure ).\nIn view of the persisting neurological deficit, the patient was taken to the operating theater expediently. Further attempts at closed manipulation under general anesthesia were unsuccessful. The IM nail- though deformed- was intact allowing successful removal via the routine method from the proximal ulna entry point; however, satisfactory reduction could still not be gained.

She had initially presented with several weeks of malaise after being started on methimazole for her Graves disease, and she had taken this medication for only 4 days. Initial laboratory findings included markedly elevated liver transaminases, and her international normalized ratio (INR) was also high (Figures and ).

This led to urgent endotracheal intubation to ensure airway protection. To evaluate her confusion, an magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was obtained which did not show any acute intracranial pathology but noted findings suggesting chronic small vessel ischemic disease and mild diffuse cerebral atrophy.

The expected time for labor was October 1st 2011. First ultrasound screening at 12\u201313 weeks of gestation showed a 1.9mm nuchal translucency thickness. Simultaneously, a double test was also undertaken and demonstrated a trisomy 21 risk of 1/61000 and a trisomy 18 risk of 1/100000. Based on the fetal ultrasound exam, clinicians discovered a small cystic mass on the anterior abdominal wall whose nature remained unknown. No specific interventions were made and clinicians intended to keep observing the cyst. The next ultrasound exam at 16 weeks of gestation demonstrated a well-developing fetus with an enlarging cystic mass. However, its nature still remained unidentified due to lack of experience on image observation. Discrimination between allantoic cyst and pseudo-cyst presented a significant challenge for most of the ultrasonographists as well as clinicians at that time. Therefore, they decided to scrutinize it for one more month before deciding on a therapeutic intervention, especially since the triple test also showed low risk of trisomy 21, 18 and 13.\nThe morphology ultrasound at 20 weeks of gestation on the fetus showed the presence of a single umbilical artery (\n) and a cystic mass (dimensions = 29mm \u00d7 25mm) at the root of the umbilical cord, connecting to the urinary bladder and no bowel contents enclosed within (\n and\n). Doppler velocimetry revealed flows around this cyst (\n). Other structures remained normal. Amniocentesis was indicated later and the result revealed a normal XY karyotype.

    "original_text": "Filipino male, 38 years old, non-smoker, presented to the general surgery clinic at our institution with intermittent right upper quadrant pain since two months radiating to the right shoulder and associated with vomiting. He had history of gallstones and a previous episode of acute cholecystitis 6 months prior that was treated conservatively. No past medical or surgical history, and no history of hemolytic disease. On examination, he had normal vital signs, and no abdominal tenderness. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed a distended gallbladder with thick wall and large calculus (about 5\u202fcm), with few sludge balls. No evidence of pericholecystic fluid or cholecystitis. Patient was diagnosed as chronic cholecystitis and admitted for elective LC under general anesthesia. At surgery, he was placed in supine position, and a supra umbilical camera port was inserted in addition to another 3 working ports. After entrance to the peritoneal cavity, there were adhesions between the greater omentum and gallbladder. Gallbladder was distended with thick wall.

He was discharged one week prior with an upper gastrointestinal bleed due to a 2 cm duodenal ulcer and was discharged with pantoprazole and sucralfate. However, over the next week, he became unable to walk no more than 15 feet without experiencing excruciating abdominal pain localized to his periumbilical region. During his initial presentation to the emergency department, his abdominal examination demonstrated right lower quadrant tenderness. His emergency department laboratory results were noncontributory. Computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed air in the intrahepatic bile ducts and a radiodense mass in the distal terminal ileum consistent with a stone. There was also proximal dilation of small bowel consistent with obstruction (Figures , ).\nOn the subsequent day, he underwent exploratory laparotomy to remove the gallstone. A midline laparotomy incision was made in the periumbilical region. Sharp dissection was used to carry it down to the level of the peritoneum. Large dilated small bowel loops were immediately encountered, and they were followed to the impacted gallstone which was noted 6 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. This was elevated into the wound and the stone was easily dislodged from its impacted site. The site where it was lodged was noted to have ecchymosis on the bowel wall with inflammation, but no evidence of perforation or necrosis was noted. Additionally, there was some inflammation in the surrounding mesentery in this region.

At the age of 70, he had undergone thoracic esophagectomy trans right thoracic approach with gastric tube reconstruction via the antethoracic route. The follow-up upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a Type 0-IIc lesion measuring 30 mm in length in the lower part of the gastric tube (Fig. ), and histopathological examination of biopsy specimens revealed features consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The primary lesions could not be detected by computed tomography (CT), and there was no obvious lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis. We made the diagnosis of gastric tube cancer, B-12-O, Type 0-IIc, T1b, N0, M0, cStage IA (Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma). Ideally, total resection of the gastric tube would have been indicated for the lesion, as it was a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with submucosal invasion. However, because of the advanced age of the patient (82 years), high surgical invasiveness of total resection of the gastric tube, and relatively early stage of the diagnosed cancer, we considered distal gastric tube resection with preservation of the RGEA as a potentially suitable surgical strategy for the patient. To examine the feasibility of performing such a surgical procedure, we repeated the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and clipped the oral side of the tumor to confirm the location and extent of the lesion (Fig. ). Thereafter, an upper gastrointestinal series was performed to reconfirm the location of the clip, and we recognized that distal gastric tube resection could be surgically performed (Fig. ). 3D-CT angiography showed that the dominant region of supply of the RGEA was distributed towards the upper part of the gastric tube (Fig. ).

On examination the vital signs were stable, and her abdomen was mildly distended but no tender and no palpable masses or hernia was detected. The rectal examination was also normal. The only symptoms evident prior to the operation were for headaches and dizziness; she never had abdominal surgery in the past. The plain abdominal X-ray revealed the presence of a round calcified image in the left pelvis. Computed tomography demonstrated extensive sigmoid diverticulosis and the presence of a 3,5 cm stone impacted in the sigmoid colon (), in addition to a separate 3 cm stone within the gallbladder lumen. There was fistulous communication between the gallbladder and the colon with resultant pneumobilia (). Due to her advanced age the patient was unfit for major surgery (i.e., laparotomy and enterotomy to remove the stone) and endoscopic intervention was recommended. The patient provided informed written consent prior to the procedure. In the endoscopy suite, under conscious sedation (Midazolam 2 mg), the patient was placed in the supine position. An Olympus videoscope (GIF 1TQ160 Olympus) with 11.3 mm body and a 3.7 channel was introduced transanally. We used CO2 insufflation during the procedure. The stone was found to be embedded above a 15 cm long area of narrowing, likely from prior diverticulitis (). A 3 cm \u00d7 6 cm 10 French lithotripsy extraction basket (FS-LXB-3X6 Cook Medical) was passed through the biopsy channel of the videoscope. Due to the large basket size it was possible to catch the stone and perform lithotripsy (). Smaller stone fragments were removed using the same basket and the obstruction was relieved.

    "cleaned_text": "a 94-year-old female was admitted to the hospital with a 5-day history of obstipation associated with vomiting and abdominal pain. on examination the vital signs were stable, and her abdomen was mildly distended but no tender and no palpable masses or hernia was detected. the rectal examination was also normal. the only symptoms evident prior to the operation were for headaches and dizziness; she never had abdominal surgery in the past. the plain abdominal x-ray revealed the presence of a round calcified image in the left pelvis. computed tomography demonstrated extensive sigmoid diverticulosis and the presence of a 3,5 cm stone impacted in the sigmoid colon (), in addition to a separate 3 cm stone within the gallbladder lumen. there was fistulous communication between the gallbladder and the colon with resultant pneumobilia (). due to her advanced age the patient was unfit for major surgery (i.e., laparotomy and enterotomy to remove the stone) and endoscopic intervention was recommended. the patient provided informed written consent prior to the procedure. in the endoscopy suite, under conscious sedation (midazolam 2 mg), the patient was placed in the supine position. an olympus videoscope (gif 1tq160 olympus) with 11.3 mm body and a 3.7 channel was introduced transanally. we used co2 insufflation during the procedure. the stone was found to be embedded above a 15 cm long area of narrowing, likely from prior diverticulitis (). a 3 cm \u00d7 6 cm 10 french lithotripsy extraction basket (fs-lxb-3x6 cook medical) was passed through the biopsy channel of the videoscope. due to the large basket size it was possible to catch the stone and perform lithotripsy (). smaller stone fragments were removed using the same basket and the obstruction was relieved. during hospital stay the patient was fed intravenously until recovery. the patient was not considered a candidate for further surgical or endoscopic treatment and recovered without any complications related to the",

Lymphovascular invasion was indeterminate and perineural invasion was not identified. All deep and peripheral margins were free of invasive carcinoma. The closest margin from the left tonsil resection was 0.5 mm and was associated with a deep soft tissue margin on the lateral aspect.

Ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a 9.5 \u00d7 8.6 \u00d7 10.5 cm, heterogeneous, hypervascular mass adjacent to the spleen and abutting the stomach wall and tail of the pancreas. Fine-needle aspiration guided by endoscopic ultrasound revealed cytologic evidence of a neuroendocrine tumor. The patient proceeded to a distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, wedge resection of the stomach, and partial resection of the left adrenal gland. Pathology demonstrated a 13-cm, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas with perineural invasion, but no vascular invasion and negative margins. It was found to be adherent to both the spleen and the stomach, but did not invade either. Two lymph nodes were removed, and both were negative for metastases. It had a mitotic rate of 2 mitoses/high-power field and a Ki-67 index of <2%. There were no signs of metastatic disease on staging.\nTwo months postoperatively, the patient was found to have 4 subcentimeter hypervascular lesions in the liver which were 111In octreotide scan negative. Over the following 9 months, the patient developed 8 new lesions, while the original lesions increased to a maximum size of 1.2 cm. Therapy with octreotide LAR 20 mg intramuscularly once monthly was initiated but discontinued after 9 months due to progressive hepatic disease. The patient subsequently underwent a bland embolization of the right hepatic artery. A CT scan of the liver performed 3 months after embolization demonstrated a mixed tumor response with the overall impression of progressive disease and development of new liver metastasis.\nThe patient was presented with the option of systemic therapy with everolimus, shown in phase III trials to improve progression-free survival in patients with well-differentiated pNETs []. Due to the absence of extrahepatic metastasis, liver-directed therapy with 90Y embolization was also offered, which the patient chose to proceed with.
