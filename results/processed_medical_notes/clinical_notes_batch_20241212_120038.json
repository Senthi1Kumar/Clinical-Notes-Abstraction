Six months following the index surgery, she had a recurrence treated with repeat curettage, liquid nitrogen local adjuvant, and placement of bone substitute graft.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large soft-tissue mass surrounding the first metatarsal circumferentially and abutting the second metatarsal (). There was high T2 signal with no T1 signal changes at the base of the second metatarsal.

He was unable to bear weight on his left leg and had a stiff left knee. He had sustained a left frontal extra-dural hemorrhage with depressed frontal bone fracture and an open fracture of his left proximal tibia in a road traffic accident five weeks ago. He was treated elsewhere with excision of the depressed skull bone fragment and evacuation of the extra-dural hematoma. Open reduction and internal fixation of the proximal tibia fracture with a medial locking compression plate (LCP\u00ae; stainless steel) was performed on the same day using a \u2018Mercedes-Benz\u2019 incision. Post-operatively, he was given a knee brace. Our patient developed pus discharge from the surgical wound in the proximal third of his leg three to four days after surgery. As the infection could not be controlled with antibiotics, he was referred to us for further management.\nOn examination, there was a Y-shaped scar over the left knee reaching up to the middle third of the leg with three sinuses on the suture line. There was an infected wound of size 4\u00d74cm over the proximal third of the leg exposing necrotic, infected patellar tendon. The medial LCP\u00ae implant was also exposed (Figure\n). The left knee was mildly subluxed posteriorly and he had a 10\u00b0 fixed flexion deformity of his left knee with minimal further flexion. He also had an equinus contracture of his left ankle. A pus sample was sent for culture and sensitivity testing and it showed heavy growth of Pseudomonas, sensitive only to imipenem and meropenem. We decided to perform a single stage debridement, with removal of the exposed LCP\u00ae implant, reconstruction of the extensor mechanism and fracture stabilization with a knee-spanning external fixator. He was counseled about the need for surgery and the proposed treatment plan and the prognosis was also discussed.",

This was associated with pain-related decreased mobility of the hip. The patient was unable to walk. Plain radiography of the left hip in the frontal and lateral views showed an extensive osteolytic lesion in the proximal metaphyseal femur and femoral neck with thin sclerotic margins, with no invasion of the growth plate (). Magnetic resonance imaging and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the hip showed the presence of an ABC in the proximal third of the left femur, with no extension in the adjacent soft tissue. Selective arterial embolisation was performed to devascularise the tumour, promote healing, and decrease the risk of high bleeding during the biopsy procedure. For this purpose, absorbable gelatine sponge particles were used. A biopsy was achieved through a lateral approach centred on the greater trochanter.

She had no significant past medical history of note and her only regular medication included a statin for cholesterol. She was a non-smoker and drunk only minimal amounts of alcohol. X-rays on admission demonstrated severe osteoporosis with multiple collapsed lumbar vertebrae. Whilst awaiting a brace and social support she developed diarrhoea and vomiting. An initial stool sample was negative for clostridium difficile serotoxin. Over the next few days her clinical condition deteriorated and by day 6 her C-reactive protein was 357. She developed abdominal distension, pain and a plain x-ray showed centralised dilated small bowel loops. A subsequent CT scan of her abdomen revealed small bowel obstruction together with mural thickening of the distal ileum (see Figure ).\nFollowing CT the patient developed signs of localised peritonitis and underwent a laparotomy. At surgery necrosis and ischaemia was seen in a large portion of mid-ileum together with large quantities of pus and a localised perforation. A small bowel resection of 60 cm was performed. Histology revealed an acute gangrenous ileitis. Blood, urine and stool cultures were all negative but reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of stool cultures revealed Norovirus genogroup II. Immunoassay of the stool was negative for rotavirus and adenovirus. No specific testing for astrovirus was performed. Immunological testing of the histological specimens was not performed.\nThe patient had no prior history of vascular disease to suggest the cause of the ileitis was ischaemic enterocolitis. Furthermore despite the patient's back pain she had been mobilising around her bed in the hospital therefore it is unlikely that the cause of the ileitis was paralytic ileus secondary to immobility. The patient received only as required opiate analgesia and this was co-administered with appropriate laxative cover to avoid constipation. A diagnosis of acute gangrenous ileitis secondary to Norovirus was therefore made",

There was jugular venous distension and bilateral pedal edema. Cardiac auscultation revealed a pansystolic cardiac murmur in the aortic region and along the left lower sternal border suggestive of aortic and tricuspid regurgitation.

There was severe aortic and tricuspid regurgitation.\nContrast-enhanced CT of the thorax was performed to delineate the anatomical relation of the aneurysmal sac and its level of origin. CT showed a large aneurysmal vascular structure measuring 11.8 \u00d7 10.1 \u00d7 9.2 cm arising from the right coronary sinus. The lumen of the aneurysm was partially opacified by the contrast, with a large eccentric non-enhancing thrombus noted along the dome of the aneurysmal sac []. There was associated thin peripheral rim of calcification around the wall of the aneurysmal sac. The aneurysmal sac was causing marked compression and attenuation of the RVOT and the main pulmonary artery. The aneurysm was extending along the right atrio-ventricular groove.

The patient did not have unusual headaches or vision problems. Three months prior to discovery of the sellar mass, she was diagnosed with stage IIb mucinous adenocarcinoma of the cervix and was treated with chemotherapy. At the time of neurosurgery clinic presentation, she was neurologically intact, including full visual fields. Laboratory work-up demonstrated pituitary insufficiency with central hypothyroidism.\nThe initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 1.8 \u00d7 1.1 cm contrast-enhancing mass within the sella, with extension to the suprasellar cistern and optic chiasm abutment. Preoperative imaging obtained the following month in preparation for surgery demonstrated that the mass had grown to 2.2 \u00d7 1.5 cm ().\nThe patient underwent an endoscopic endonasal approach for resection of the intradural sellar mass. Intraoperative findings demonstrated a very firm, infiltrative, vascular mass with dense adherence to surrounding structures, including the dura, medical cavernous walls, and diaphragma. Intraoperative frozen section pathology was consistent with metastatic carcinoma.

    "original_text": "A 30-year-old man presented to our ED by ambulance after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision. On arrival, he was intubated and mechanically ventilated as he was unstable with a head injury. Initial physical examination revealed a visible deformity of the right lower extremity, with an approximately 10-cm laceration along the medial aspect of his ankle and a totally extruded and rotated talar body through the skin (Figure ). The patient was diagnosed with a Type III open fracture and a right-sided total talar extrusion. The distal vascularity of his right foot was intact, and there were no associated fractures in both upper and lower limbs.\nAfter closed reduction failed, the open fracture was initially irrigated with normal saline and splinted with sterile dressing. In addition, he was started on preventive antibiotics and given a tetanus toxoid booster. He was scheduled for open reduction and intraoperative irrigation as soon as possible.\nHis general condition did not allow initial radiographic and CT scanning of his extremities. Because the patient had a severe traumatic brain injury, with trauma brain CT showing an acute subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage, he was taken immediately to the operating room to undergo an urgent decompressive craniotomy, and open fracture management and dislocation reduction. The patient was placed under general anesthesia and administered another dose of prophylactic antibiotics. After preparing and draping the patient's open wound, his extruded talus was cleaned and irrigated copiously with sterile normal saline. Devitalized tissues were debrided, with intraoperative radiological and clinical evaluation showing the talus was completely extruded from its articulation without any significant fracture. However, the inferior surface contained a small area of articular cartilage injury, loosely held by a few strands of the deltoid ligament, which were preserved.

They did not opt for preimplantation genetic screening. The embryo was originally frozen in 2013, 2 years before the first identification of a Zika case in Haiti. Embryo transfer occurred in April of 2016. Her husband was actively traveling back and forth to Haiti for work before and during the pregnancy.\nHer history of two mid-trimester losses was managed with an abdominal cerclage placed pre-pregnancy. She was treated with prophylactic low molecular weight heparin for APLS and insulin for her type two diabetes mellitus. She received betamethasone in the early third trimester for an episode of threated preterm labor. At delivery she was euglycemic.\nEndemic Zika was identified in Haiti per the CDC early in the epidemic []. When recommendations were issued regarding the possibility of sexual transmission of Zika virus in August 2016, her maternal fetal medicine provider counseled her to use condoms or refrain from intercourse with her husband, whose business travel continued through the pregnancy []. She herself never left the greater Boston area prior to or during the pregnancy. She had not been to her native Haiti in over 10 years. There has never been any local transmission of Zika virus in the state of Massachusetts. Additionally, interview with the couple after delivery confirmed that neither of them ever experienced any symptoms of Zika infection.

The patient went to the emergency room, where he received a consultation from an otorhinolaryngologist and a primary care physician. The medical team diagnosed the patient with left orbital fracture, which was reduced and surgically treated with bone plating and screws.\nFollowing surgery, the patient complained of unilateral left-sided jaw and neck pain along with mild swelling for a duration of 3 weeks. The patient reported constant, dull, pressure-like pain that transformed to sharp pain on percussion. The pain was elicited by chewing, swallowing, and lateral neck movements. These sharp pain episodes lasted for a few minutes, and the patient reported that cracking his neck relieved the pain. The patient experienced swelling and tenderness in his left cervical area, which was also associated with similar pain episodes occurring for the past few months. Due to this pain, the patient revisited the otorhinolaryngologist at the local hospital. He was sent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine. MRI showed intact vertebrae with mild degenerative changes, as well as mild canal stenosis. In addition, a parotid salivary gland biopsy and submandibular fine needle aspiration were performed on the left submandibular salivary gland tissue. These procedures were done because it was thought that the pain originated from the salivary glands, specifically the left parotid, as the pain was radiating to that region.

Elbow and wrist range of movements were normal, pronation and supination were restricted due to pain, no distal neurovascular deficiency was noted. The plain radiograph of the forearm in two perpendicular planes revealed a permeative destructive lesion with a wide zone of transition involving the middle and lower third ulna with periosteal reaction and cortical breach []. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the involvement of almost the entire ulna except for the proximal part sparing the olecranon and articular surface (T1-weighted images). It was associated with a large soft tissue component with the displacement of ulnar vessels (T2-weighted images) [ and ].\nThe clinico-radiological diagnosis of Ewings sarcoma was confirmed histopathologically with core needle biopsy. The patient was staged with computed tomography of the chest, a bone scan and multiple-site bone marrow aspiration, which did not reveal metastasis. The patient was evaluated in a multidisciplinary clinic and was started on multi-agent chemotherapy. He was reassessed after induction chemotherapy with plain radiography and an MRI of the forearm for planning local treatment []. The MRI revealed a substantial decrease in the soft tissue component of the disease. Local treatment options (limb salvage surgery with complex reconstruction vs definitive radiotherapy) were discussed with the patient and attendants, who opted for surgical treatment.\nA limb salvage surgical procedure was planned with wide excision of the ulna except the proximal 2 cm, which includes partial articular surface as this was uninvolved by the disease. This ensured a narrow 1 cm tumor-free margin proximally.

    "original_text": "A 31-year-old Korean female visited complaining of an abnormal facial sensation due to previous mandibular angle contouring facial plastic surgery at a local plastic surgery clinic. On panoramic view, the inferior alveolar canals on each side of the mandible did not look normal after both mandibular angle reduction procedures. The canal was cut from the area below the left mandibular second molar with discontinuation in the left mandible. The right inferior alveolar canal was intimately contacted to the inferior border of the mandible without marked mental foramen.()\nWe tested the degree of IAN injury using the nerve mapping method suggested by Lee et al., which consists of five checkpoints including the contact threshold, direction, two-point discrimination, pin prick, and thermal discrimination. The patient showed abnormal sensation in both the lower lip and chin areas as expected. She had mild to moderate paresthesia in both sides of the mandible, thus we predicted there was direct damage to the axon and epineurium, with a diagnosis of axonotmesis in the left mandible. Some damage to the epineurium in the right side resulted in a diagnosis of neuropraxia, which is a first degree injury according to Sunderland's classification.\nThe patient received facial contouring surgery with bilateral zygoma reductions and both angle reductions with mandibular shaving five years previously. She did not have any antipathy to the clinic nor to the surgeon.

The abdominal pelvic ultrasound revealed a 60 mm hypoechoic and heterogeneous mass in the right iliac fossa. The abdominal pelvic computed tomography showed a tumor measuring 50 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 48 mm, attached to the anterior wall of the cecum and the right colon (Fig. ).\nThe multidisciplinary meeting decided to perform a diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy. The laparoscopic exploration showed a 70 mm tumor of the small bowel, 70 cm upstream the last ileal loop. The tumor was extracted through a small suprapubic incision, without the use of a wound protector. It was resected with a safety margin of 2 cm and an end-to-end anastomosis was performed. The postoperative course was marked by an infection of the extraction\u2019s site. The pathology specimen findings revealed a stromal tumor with a high aggressive potential (five mitosis per field), positive to CD117 at the immunohistochemical examination. An Imatinib adjuvant therapy was indicated, but the patient did not receive it because of financial considerations.\nThe patient had a postoperative follow-up (clinical examination, abdominal ultrasonography and abdominal computed tomography alternately) every 3 months during the first year, then every 6 months during the second and the third year. After that, the patient stopped her follow-up on her own.\nSeven years after the surgical resection, the patient was hospitalized for a pelvic mass underneath the old scar. The abdominal examination found a mass measuring 60/70 mm.

Upon admission, the patient was agitated, disoriented, and in intense respiratory distress. Examination revealted that the patient\u2019s airway was clear, but there was a bilateral absence of breath sounds and hyperresonance on percussion. The patient was hemodynamically stable. He was intubated due to respiratory failure. Bilateral chest tubes were inserted based on a high clinical suspicion of pneumothorax. Thereafter, the patient developed a large subcutaneous emphysema, despite the fact that the chest tubes were functioning with his severe air leakage. Past medical history was unremarkable with no previous formal depression diagnosis. A social history check showed daily marijuana and tobacco use.\nThe patient was sent for a head, neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis CT scan. The scan revealed giant bullous emphysema on the superior lobes bilaterally, right pneumothorax with a collapsed lung, along with multiple rib fractures, and lung emphysema (, ). A hip dislocation was detected, and closed reduction was performed.\nThe patient was sent to the ICU, where he improved clinically after conservative treatment with continuous negative pressure suction using a 20 cm water column.

Serum amylase and lipase, and tumour markers [CA 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)] were within normal limits. The patient was subjected to a CT examination. On unenhanced CT image, a poorly defined soft tissue mass was seen in the pancreaticoduodenal (PD) groove with a hypodense cystic lesion within the mass (). On post-contrast study, the lesion showed minimal enhancement in the portal venous phase ( and ), but delayed imaging at 2\u20133 min showed mild persistent enhancement of the lesion compared with the pancreatic parenchyma that was consistent with scar tissue () and a non-enhancing cystic lesion within the lesion. The lesion showed poorly defined fat planes with the adjacent second part of the duodenum on its right side and pancreatic head on the left side. Mild thickening of the wall of the second part of the duodenum adjacent to the lesion with variable luminal narrowing was noted. The common bile and pancreatic ducts appeared grossly normal. The pancreatic body and tail were normal. In order to clearly delineate the ductal system and the periampullary region, and to know the extension of the lesion, the patient was also subjected to an MRI examination. Axial two-dimensional fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition () sequences showed soft tissue signal intensity lesion in the PD groove with a cystic lesion within the lesion and the aforementioned CT scan findings. MR cholangiopancreatography sequence () revealed smooth and regular tapering of the pancreatic and common bile ducts. The gallbladder was distended and the cystic duct was normal.

The patient presented with a complaint of a diffuse swelling on the left side of the mandible, large enough to cause her aesthetic anxiety. She had mild tenderness on palpation of the swelling and slight discomfort in the last molar region of the affected side while chewing. History revealed nothing of significance. At the time of clinical examination, the swelling was of two weeks duration. On examination, the swelling was circumscribed, bony hard, and roughly about 6 \u00d7 5 cm in size at the angle of the mandible. The swelling showed diffuse borders. The skin overlying the swelling was of normal color but had a glossy appearance, probably due to tautness of the skin over the swelling (). Intraorally, the swelling was evident on the mandibular buccal vestibule adjacent to the second molar. There was apparent expansion of the buccal cortical plate. Lingual cortical plate also showed expansion but to a lesser extent. The mandibular third molar was missing, and the patient explained that both her mandibular wisdom teeth were extracted due to recurrent infection a couple of years ago.\nPremolars and the first molar on the affected side were healthy with no carious or periodontal involvement. The second molar showed grade I mobility. Bidigital palpation did not reveal any lymph node enlargement anywhere in the cervicofacial chain.\nPanoramic and lateral oblique views of the mandible were ordered. The orthopantogram showed a large radiolucency at the angle of the mandible on the left side, involving the second molar ().

She had two previous spontaneous vaginal deliveries and had no history of abdominal pain, dyspareunia or infertility. She was not using any form of hormonal contraception. Her medical history was not significant and she never had any abdominal surgeries.\nClinical examination revealed that the patient had a 2 cm \u00d7 2 cm firm nodule at the umbilicus, which appeared to be covered by a reddish brown discharge. Suspecting that she had an infection, the patient was swabbed and given a five-day course of oral broad-spectrum antibiotics. She showed up on check up two months later with no relief of symptoms.

The girl had been diagnosed with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) 4 years previously, remaining clinically well until four months prior to referral, when she presented with a history of weight loss (approximately 10% of her weight). During an assessment at her local hospital it emerged that an antitissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG) blood test (a screening test for CD) performed at the initial presentation of her IDDM, had been positive. Now presenting with weight loss, she was referred urgently for further investigation.\nThe patient had no overt gastrointestinal symptoms, but interestingly did have a 4-month history of lymphadenopathy. She also had a recent infected insect bite on her arm, lived with cats and had had contact with a family member with suspected tuberculosis (TB). The lymphadenopathy, located in her left groin, was nontender, varied in size, and had improved when treated with antibiotics at her local hospital. An ultrasound scan performed at her local hospital was suggestive of infected lymph nodes. Clinically the patient had no other palpable nodes, and there was no hepatosplenomegaly. The initial differential diagnosis included borrelia, bartonella, and TB.\nThe case was complicated by the patient's significant needle phobia and it was decided that all haematological investigations would be performed whilst the patient had an upper GI endoscopy under general anaesthesia. An ultrasound scan was repeated, confirming the enlarged nodes in her groin, and also demonstrating para-aortic lymphadenopathy. A subsequent CT scan also demonstrated cervical lymphadenopathy as well as the abdominal lymphadenopathy, and at this stage a diagnosis of lymphoma was considered.\nDuring the general anaesthetic, a groin lymph node was removed for histopathology.

One-year prior, she reported experiencing \u201clightning bolt\u201d pains across the right side of her face. She was referred to a neurologist who did not note any abnormality of facial sensation or motor function at that time; a brain MRI was obtained and was unremarkable (this study was not dedicated to the fifth nerve, and no comment was made on structures inferior to the skull base in this report). She was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia and treated with carbamazepine. Subsequently, she noted a decrease in visual acuity and was evaluated by optometry where a serological workup for temporal arteritis was ordered and returned negative. She went on to develop right hearing loss and noticed right temporal wasting. She developed a right-sided facial paralysis and returned to her neurologist who now documented right fifth and seventh nerve palsies. As a result, she underwent a lumbar puncture with normal protein and cell counts as well as negative results for HSV, West Nile, and tuberculosis. At this time, her ophthalmologist independently documented right facial weakness, decreased facial sensation, and neurotrophic keratitis consistent with fifth and seventh nerve palsies. The patient was told her symptoms were a result of Bell's palsy. No repeat neuroimaging was obtained after the onset of her facial weakness. She was treated with pressure patching of the affected eye but, due to a lack of resolution, was ultimately referred for management of the neurotrophic ulcer.\nOn presentation to the oculoplastic service, visual acuity was count fingers and she demonstrated 6 mm of lagophthalmos, a poor Bell's reflex, and a large central corneal epithelial defect (Figure ) Incomplete facial and trigeminal nerve palsies were diagnosed on the basis of lagophthalmos and reduced corneal sensation, and additional workup with neuroimaging was urgently obtained to determine the underlying etiology.
