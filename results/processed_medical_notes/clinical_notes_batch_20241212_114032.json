The epidural catheter was inserted via the T7\u2013T8 interspace, and passed upward to the upper thoracic levels. During insertion of the catheter he felt a shooting pain over the right lower leg, which disappeared immediately. Five milliliters of 2% lidocaine was injected as a test dose. Five minutes after the test-dose injection, 15 mL of 2% lidocaine (with adrenaline 1:200,000) was given incrementally, obtaining a T4 sensory level. The operation was uneventful. At the end of surgery, the epidural catheter was removed.\nOn the fifth postoperative day, the patient complained of numbness and a paresis of the right leg, which spread to the left leg. Thereafter he was evaluated by an anesthetist and a neurologist. Neurologic examinations showed that sensory deficit was below the T7 level, muscle power was grade 2/5 over the right lower limb and 4/5 over the left lower limb, deep tendon reflexes of both lower limbs were increased, and the Babinski sign was bilaterally positive.

At 1 wk before admission, he was unable to answer questions and developed an eating difficulty, incontinence, fever (T \u2264 38.2 \u00b0C) and severe weight loss. Chronic diarrhea was absent.\nThe proband is the 4th child of 5 in a non-consanguineous Chinese family. His family history was negative for symptoms related to neurological disorders. He was divorced twice and had no children, and did not have a history of smoking or drinking. The proband\u2019s parents had died and his mother had a history of uremia.

He had been complaining of 4 months of increased pain in his right knee. An aspiration had been attempted, yielding 1 mL of sanguinous fluid which had not been sent for analysis. The patient continued to have swelling and increased pain in the knee, and an MRI was obtained demonstrating \u201cpseudotumor\u201d (Figure , A\u2013C). He was then referred to our orthopaedic oncology office for further evaluation and management.\nAfter review of initial radiographs (Figure , A and B) and CT (Figure , A\u2013C), the patient underwent an open biopsy of his right tibial lesion adjacent to the tibial baseplate one week after presentation to the office. Pathology from his initial biopsy was consistent with GCTB. One week following his open biopsy, the patient underwent a complex reconstruction of his proximal tibia as well as patellar tendon (Figure , A and B).\nIntraoperatively, complete destruction of the medial cortex of the tibia was noted, with the area infiltrated extensively by tumor. After the initial anterior exposure through the previous TKA incision, the area was extensively curettaged. A high-speed burr and argon beam coagulator was then used to complete the resection at the edges of the cavity. Following the removal of the mass, we noted that the tibial baseplate was mechanically stable even after the extended curettage. An intraoperative determination was made to preserve the primary arthroplasty components and to reinforce the tibia with cement and Steinmann pin fixation. Steinmann pins were fired distally into the tibia, which allowed buttressing of the tibial baseplate proximally.

Pneumonia was suspected, and the patient received intravenous antibiotic treatment. During the patient's second night in hospital, he was found groggy and walking near his room by the nurses. They took him back to his room and connected a new antibiotic dose to his venous catheter. A few hours later, he was found unconscious, lying on the floor next to his bed. His peripheral venous catheter was connected to a nasal cannula delivering O2 from the wall, with a flow rate of approximately 2 L/min, and the antibiotic dose was found in the garbage can. As post-mortem lividity was present, no resuscitation attempts were performed by the clinicians and the death was pronounced. The body was immediately brought to the University Center of Legal Medicine (Lausanne, Switzerland).\nBefore any manipulation of the corpse, a native CT scan was carried out at around 10 h post-mortem using an eight-row CT unit (CT LightSpeed 8, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). All scanning parameters are detailed in . A forensic pathologist immediately viewed the native CT images. To evaluate the distribution of gas because of physiological changes in the body after death, the radiological alteration index (RAI) was used as proposed by Egger et al. [].

An open lesion characterized by yellow, non-purulent drainage was noted in the left lower quadrant. CT imaging of abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed a multiloculated large cystic mass in the left inguinal canal measuring 11 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7.7 cm () along with a similar soft tissue nodule in the right inguinal area. A right retroperitoneal soft tissue mass in the mid abdomen was also identified, measuring 3.3 \u00d7 4.2 \u00d7 5.7 cm (). Changes of prior left nephrectomy and orchiectomy consistent with treatment of previous left-sided testicular cancer were also noted.\nBiopsy of right retroperitoneal mass revealed squamous cell-lined cystic lesion followed by left lower quadrantabdominal mass excision and complex wound closure. An elliptical incision was made in the left groin incorporating the lesion, and subcutaneous flaps were created. Dissection was carried down to fascia where the mass extended into inguinal ring and the lower edge of the external oblique aponeurosis, extending into the abdomen.

Her perinatal history was unremarkable. A preliminary work up for her past symptoms in another hospital revealed that she had a suspected left sided eventration as seen on the chest X-ray []. On examination, the child was lethargic, obtunded, had cold peripheries with tachycardia, hypotension, and feeble pulse. Her abdomen was distended, tense and tender especially in the upper half.

A skiagram [] at this stage revealed a gastric bubble, with a paucity of distal bowel gas and a raised left hemi diaphragm.\nAfter adequate resuscitation, the child was explored, and the intra-operative findings revealed a mesoaxial gastric volvulus. After successful reduction, it was noted that the stomach was grossly healthy except the greater curvature, which was congested. There was a large defect in the posterolateral aspect of the left hemi-diaphragm, which was covered with a sac and the diaphragm had a reasonably well-developed rim of muscle along the anterior segment [].\nTo repair the defect the sac was excised and it was noted that the cephalic surface of the sac had a lobular 6 cm \u00d7 3 cm fleshy pedicled mass flimsily attached to it [].\nThe pedicle of the blood supply was traced and it was found to be entering the mediastinum.

Two weeks after surgery, he vomited several times due to DGE, and a nasogastric tube was inserted into the stomach. On the 32nd POD, however, DGE improved and the nasogastric tube was removed, as dysphagia persisted. On the 41st POD, gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed, revealing stricture of the middle esophagus. PPI did not improve esophageal stricture; the patient then underwent balloon dilation on the 70th POD, but the esophagus was perforated. The esophagus recovered with fasting, antibiotics, and PPI without surgical treatment. As the stricture still remained, he was referred to our hospital for further treatment on the148th POD.\nThe upper gastrointestinal series revealed a long stricture extending from the middle esophagus to just above the cardia portion, the length of which was approximately 10 cm, and the sliding esophageal hiatal hernia (Fig. ). Gastrointestinal endoscopy showed circumferential stricture of the middle esophagus with longitudinal esophageal ulcer scars (Fig. ). The narrow lesion was biopsied, and the result showed no malignancy. Preoperative gastrointestinal endoscopy before PpPD revealed a sliding esophageal hiatal hernia and mild esophagitis (Fig. ). We speculated that postoperative DGE, hiatal hernia, and gastric hyperacidity exacerbated the patient\u2019s reflex esophagitis. The patient was treated with an H2 blocker for 2 weeks just after the surgery and with PPI from the 14th POD until the 140th POD. PPI was replaced to the H2 blocker due to the decreased numbers of white blood cells to less than 2000/\u03bcl from the 141th POD. The number of white blood cells recovered to normal level soon. Severe extensive stricture remained observed. We suspected that this patient had resistance to PPI; thus, we performed simultaneous 24-h pH and bilirubin monitoring to estimate the extent to which gastric acid secretion was inhibited by omeprazole (20 mg/drip/",

She was admitted to our hospital on February 19, 2017, with no history of trauma, nipple discharge, fever, or weight loss. On physical examination, enlargement of the left breast with one palpable mass was observed (Fig. ). The mass was about 6 \u00d7 6 cm, movable, solitary, firm, and well defined. It was not tender and did not adhere to the skin or the underlying structures. The local temperature of the overlying skin was normal. There was no axillary lymphadenopathy.\nBreast ultrasound demonstrated a homogenous, hypoechoic solid mass with no phyllodes. Mammography showed a large mass with high density and well definition (Fig. ). Based on the clinical and experimental findings, the mass was considered a giant fibroadenoma. Due to the history of progressive enlargement of the left-sided lesion, she underwent an excision biopsy instead of needle biopsy. To avoid a disfiguring scar, we planned to use the 8-gauge Mammotome to shrink the mass and then perform the lumpectomy through a tiny circumareolar incision.\nLocal anesthesia (200 mg of 2% lidocaine, 75 mg of ropivacaine, 0.5 mg of 1:1000 epinephrine, and 20 mL of sodium chloride injection) was given in the operation area. A 3-cm circumareolar incision was made, which allowed the surface of the tumor to be separated. Under ultrasound monitoring, the tip of 8 G Mammotome needle was placed in the center of the tumor.

His initial vital signs were unremarkable (blood pressure = 130/70 mmHg, pulse rate = 76 beats per minute, oxygen saturation = 98% at room air, and temperature = 36.5\u00b0C). At the first encounter, he was underweight with a BMI of 17 kg/m2. On examination, there was reduced air entry in the left upper lung. The abdomen was soft and nontender. His sputum sample was sent for tuberculosis workup; however, the results were negative. Routine blood investigations including full blood count and urine profile were within normal limits. The inflammatory makers were not elevated with a white cell count of 11 g/dL. His past medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia and remote history of healed scrotal abscess.\nThe initial chest radiograph revealed fibrotic lung changes in the upper zones, more so on the left than the right. Subsequently, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the thorax with high-resolution CT reconstruction was performed and showed extensive scarring in both apical regions, again more so on the left. In addition, there were nonconfluent clusters of micronodules () in the right lung with a few smaller regions of tree-in-bud nodularity. There was no significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. In the upper part of the abdomen included in the CT, there were also incidental findings of the partial duplex system of the left kidney with mild-to-moderate hydronephrosis in the lower moiety with proximal hydroureter ().

Pneumonia was suspected, and the patient received intravenous antibiotic treatment. During the patient's second night in hospital, he was found groggy and walking near his room by the nurses. They took him back to his room and connected a new antibiotic dose to his venous catheter. A few hours later, he was found unconscious, lying on the floor next to his bed. His peripheral venous catheter was connected to a nasal cannula delivering O2 from the wall, with a flow rate of approximately 2 L/min, and the antibiotic dose was found in the garbage can. As post-mortem lividity was present, no resuscitation attempts were performed by the clinicians and the death was pronounced. The body was immediately brought to the University Center of Legal Medicine (Lausanne, Switzerland).\nBefore any manipulation of the corpse, a native CT scan was carried out at around 10 h post-mortem using an eight-row CT unit (CT LightSpeed 8, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). All scanning parameters are detailed in . A forensic pathologist immediately viewed the native CT images. To evaluate the distribution of gas because of physiological changes in the body after death, the radiological alteration index (RAI) was used as proposed by Egger et al. [].

He presented a left upper limb trauma when he was 12 years old that was orthopedically treated by a cast during 3 weeks. Since then, he presented pain in his wrist, especially at sport and when he was leaning on his left hand. His pain was quoted at 7/10 (visual analog scale) and he reported a severe handicap at sport. Clinical examination showed a normal range of motion of his wrist with a normal but painful pronosupination motion. It revealed distal radioulnar instability with a protrusion of the ulnar head () without instability of the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon. The radioulnar ballottement test of the radioulnar joint, the fovea sign, and the chair test were positive. The clunk test was negative. The symptomatology was marked by a severe functional concern when leaning on his hand during gym classes or when playing basketball. The patient-rated wrist evaluation (PRWE) score was at 51/100 (pain = 31, function = 20), the QuickDASH score was at 43/100. The pain was specifically localized on the ulnar side of the wrist by the patient. No nerve compression or vascular signs were detected. X-rays of the wrist revealed a shortening of the radius with a high radioulnar index (11mm on the anteroposterior view) and an ulnocarpal impingement (). This was highlighted on the magnetic resonance imaging T1sequence of the wrist that revealed overpressure cysts of the triquetrum (). The radioulnar joint surface on the radial side was flat[].

She had undergone excision of a uterine adenomyosis 3 years previous. Her latest pregnancy resulted in the delivery of a full-term baby 1 year previous. The physical examination was otherwise normal. Pelvic ultrasonography showed focal thickening of the endometrium. She received endometrial curettage with a clinical diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia. A serum \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) measurement was performed 1 week later because an IT tumor was suspected after pathologic examination of the endometrial curettage specimen. The \u03b2-hCG level was not elevated (1 mIU/ml; reference range: 0 ~ 5 mIU/ml). The abdominal and pelvic computed tomographic scans exhibited an enlarged uterus with an irregular contour and heterogeneous contrast enhancement without para-aortic or pelvic lymphadenopathy. No metastatic lesion was detected on a chest x-ray. She underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy. Neither postoperative chemotherapy nor radiotherapy was given. She was alive with no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis 30 months after the hysterectomy.\nOn macroscopic examination, the uterus measured 9.0 \u00d7 8.3 \u00d7 4.2 cm and was slightly enlarged.

The mass was hard and fixed and extended from the glans proximally up the shaft. He also had bilateral palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy. There were no associated constitutional symptoms. Given there was a high suspicion for malignancy, the patient underwent partial penectomy within a month of presentation. Biopsy results confirmed a pT2 tumor with invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated, and tumor size of 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2.5 cm, with corpus spongiosum and lymphovascular involvements.\nFollowing the procedure, the patient had PET-CT for staging, and imaging revealed enlarged hypermetabolic bilateral axillary lymph nodes concerning for metastatic disease. In addition, there was a large centrally necrotic lymph node conglomerate in his left groin that had increased FDG avidity. The patient had left inguinal and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissections revealing metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in multiple lymph nodes. The left inguinal mass was also found to be metastatic well-differentiated SCC. His diagnosis was staged at T2N3M0.\nAfter his surgical procedures, patient was started on adjuvant chemotherapy. He began first line chemotherapy with paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (TIP). He underwent 4 cycles of TIP but eventually developed disease progression on repeat imaging. At this point, the patient was started on cetuximab given EGFR amplification on tumor analysis with the FoundationOne testing platform. However, the patient had an allergic reaction to cetuximab, so his treatment was changed to panitumumab.

The procedure was operated elsewhere and presented with a complaint of a bulge in the abdomen along a previous scar site. He did not have any complaints of altered bowel and bladder habits. He did not have any other specific complaints. On evaluation, he gave history of surgery 1 year back. One year ago, he underwent Millins procedure for benign prostatic enlargement (BPE). This procedure involves removing part of the prostate using a transcapsular retro pubic approach (extra peritoneal) through a cut in the abdomen. Two weeks after the surgery, he developed abdominal wound dehiscence. Once the wound granulated well, he underwent secondary suturing of the abdominal wound after 2 months of surgery. He developed incisional hernia 3 months later. He continued to have protuberant abdomen with visible bowel peristalsis. He was reassured and advised to wear abdominal binder. On examination, his general condition was good. There was a bulge of size ~25 \u00d7 10 cm projecting from his anterior abdominal wall at the site of the previous scar ().\nA palpable midline rectus defect of 10 cm was noted. Visible bowel peristalsis was seen. Other system examinations were normal. Routine laboratory investigations were normal, and he did not have any comorbid illness. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen confirmed thinning of the rectus sheath with focal outpouching of rectus in the infra-umbilical region and herniation of small bowel loops with loss of domain (LOD) ().\nHe was planned for surgical exploration.

    "original_text": "A 15-year-old male patient presented to the trauma emergency room intubated in the field with multiple gunshot wounds. On the primary survey, the patient was tachycardic and intubated. The patient's heart rate ranged from 100 to 120 bpm, sinus tachycardia, and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg. In the secondary survey, the patient had multiple gunshot wounds to the chest, abdomen, bilateral lower limbs, and left upper extremity. The patient had palpable pulses in the bilateral lower extremity and left upper extremity. In the trauma emergency room, the patient had left tube thoracostomy for a left hemothorax performed bedside. The patient underwent computed tomography imaging suggestive of pneumoperitoneum, an X-ray and angiogram of left upper extremity suggestive of left upper extremity comminuted humerus fracture and left upper limb ulnar artery injury (Figures , ). The patient underwent damage control exploratory laparotomy. Diaphragmatic injury and bladder injuries were repaired primarily, small and large bowel left in discontinuity, and for pelvic wall bleeding, preperitoneal packing was performed. Abdomen fascia was left open with temporary closure performed using the wound VAC (vacuum-assisted device). For left humerus fracture with an expanding hematoma fasciotomy of the left upper limb was performed. On completion of the left upper limb's fasciotomy, there were no radial or ulnar pulses for Doppler signals.\nAn exploration of the brachial and ulnar artery revealed a disruption in the ulnar artery with a 5-cm arterial segment loss secondary to the gunshot and bullet fragments.

    "original_text": "A Caucasian male infant was born by cesarean delivery to a 33-year-old mother at 34 weeks of gestational age. The pregnancy was complicated by the presence of insulin-dependent gestational diabetes and the prenatal diagnosis of bilateral ventriculomegaly. Further prenatal evaluation with fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study revealed the presence of right open-lip schizencephaly with bilateral ventriculomegaly. Furthermore, her last pregnancy was complicated by shoulder dystocia, and given this history, along with the macrocephaly noted in this pregnancy with concerns for cephalopelvic disproportion, a decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery. The cesarean delivery was uncomplicated, and the infant needed routine care with no resuscitation. On postnatal physical examination, the infant was noted to have macrocephaly with a head circumference measuring 36 cm, which was at >99th percentile for the gestational age. Anterior fontanel was very wide open. In addition, significant sutural diastases were also noted on physical examination. Even though the infant appeared non-encephalopathic, the presence of generalized axial and appendicular hypotonia was noted.

His blood type was \u201cO\u201d. Complete SI without other abnormalities was identified when he was a teenager. Following splenectomy and hepatectomy due to hemorrhage after hepatitis B related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma respectively, he underwent LTx from a deceased donor with situs solitus because of tumor recurrence in 2005 at the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, Shanghai, China. Since half a year after LTx, he suffered episodes of biliary complication characterized as jaundice and fever. Bile duct stents were inserted several times. The total bilirubin fluctuated between 70-200 \u03bcmol/L and it was gradually elevated to about 400 \u03bcmol/L before he was listed for re-transplantation. He had severe skin pruritus and sporadic slight hepatic comma.\nThe donor was a 32-year-old male who suffered brain injury in a motor vehicle accident and was pronounced dead shortly after admission. Image studies showed that he was situs reversus. His blood type was \u201cB\u201d. Given the organic situs match, the donor liver graft was then allocated to the recipient. No technical difficulties were encountered during the procurement. The liver graft showed completely inverted structure but without vessel anomaly after trimming the excess tissue on back table (Figure ).\nAfter careful laparotomy in recipient, a normal oriented liver was transplanted showing deeply bilious appearance with blunt right lobe and shrunken left lobe. The whole graft was severely rotated to the left upper quadrant. Excision of the original liver graft was performed with preservation of recipient inferior vena cava (IVC). The new liver was then brought onto the field as its original position.

One glomerulus was globally sclerosed and the remaining glomeruli showed membranoproliferative pattern with thrombi in one glomerulus.

Three glomeruli were present for immunofluorescence studies. At least two glomeruli showed segmentally positive staining for fibrinogen (2+) and IgM (1+). The remaining staining including IgG, IgA, C3, C1q, kappa, and lambda was negative. C4d stained sections showed strong positive staining in 80% of the peritubular capillaries, consistent with antibody-mediated rejection.

The headache was worst in the morning and was localized in the frontal and occipital region. The patient also mentioned two episodes of vomiting and phonophobia along with the headache the last week. Physical examination was normal, however the patient complained for mild unsteadiness and recent memory loss. No loss of bladder control or urgency to urination was mentioned. As far as the patient's past medical history is concerned, an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infectious mononucleosis was described. The rest medical history was unremarkable. For evaluation of her symptoms the initial workup included a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which revealed significant ventricular dilatation of lateral, third and fourth ventricles with subependymal edema, without any gadolinium enhancement of the ventricular system or obvious obstruction. A T2W TSE study was also performed and demonstrated a turbulent flow of cerebelospinal fluid (CSF) in the fourth ventricle and back flow of CSF through the Monro's foramen to the lateral ventricles (). The patient had also undergone fundoscopic examination that showed bilateral papilledema.\nBased on the above findings a decompression on the foramen magnum was decided having established an obstruction at that level. The patient underwent a suboccipital craniotomy with C1 laminectomy. An occlusion of Magendie's foramen by a thickened membrane was recognized and the membrane was incised and removed, thus restoring the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid between the fourth ventricle and the cerebellomedullary cistern ().\nThe postoperative course was uneventful. The new fundoscopic examination in two weeks revealed a reduction in papilledema and the second MRI scan showed a marked decrease in the size of the ventricles, showing therefore that cerebrospinal fluid flow through the ventricular system and subarachnoid space was restored ().",
