    "original_text": "This patient is a 29-year-old white woman from the USA with a medical history significant for severe IBS-D (diagnosed at age 12) and anxiety disorder. In July 2015, she presented with severe bleeding hemorrhoids secondary to IBS, which required hemorrhoidectomy and anal sphincterotomy in August 2015. The week before the surgery she developed pharyngitis and was treated with azithromycin, which resulted in mucousy diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. She tested negative for C. difficile antigen and toxins at that time.\nA week after surgery, she developed a perirectal abscess that had formed at the site of the sphincterotomy and was prescribed orally administered ciprofloxacin. Despite moderate symptom improvement, in September 2015 she required an abscess incision and drainage procedure and Penrose drain insertion. Prior to the surgery she was given a single dose of clindamycin. An additional 2-week course of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole was then prescribed. In late September 2015 she was admitted to the hospital for two nights due to further complications related to the abscess and was then diagnosed as having a perianal fistula.\nIn November 2015, she was prescribed clindamycin for an episode of group C streptococcal-positive pharyngitis. In late November 2015, she was also diagnosed as having Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome, which according to her medical record may partially explain the poor wound healing from the perirectal abscess. In December 2015, her fistula required an anus seton placement. She was treated with multiple courses of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole off and on from December 2015 to January 2016.\nIn January 2016, following up on her recurrent pharyngitis, she was diagnosed as having chronic tonsillitis which led to tonsillectomy. In February 2016, 2 weeks after the surgery she was prescribed clindamycin. At the beginning of March 2016, she was diagnosed as having bacterial vaginosis and was prescribed orally administered metronidazole. A week later she was diagnosed as having vaginal candidiasis and was prescribed orally administered fluconazole. In April 2016, she complained of dysuria and",

The gallbladder was also palpable to the right iliac fossa. The white cell count was mildly elevated at 13.2, while there were no electrolyte abnormalities and no renal or liver function derangement evident on blood tests.

Anticoagulation therapy was initiated for the patient, but due to the high Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index score and evidence of right ventricular dilatation with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) of 50 to 55 mmHg, the patient was taken to the catheterization laboratory []. A catheter-directed infusion of alteplase was performed []. After completion of the infusion, anticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin was continued, and there were no complications. Four days later, a repeat ECG was performed, and a persistent right ventricular strain with right ventricular dilation and an increase in PASP to 70 to 75 mmHg were shown. Based on this, a percutaneous thrombectomy of the right pulmonary artery was performed. This has led to successful recanalization of the pulmonary artery and resulted in a significant reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure.

He was posted for emergent tracheostomy under local anaesthesia with monitored anaesthesia care. On examination, the patient was conscious (GCS of 15), in respiratory distress and there was a bruise extending from the left shoulder to right across the neck in the front. On examination of the neck, crepitus and tenderness were present on the anterior part of the neck. Computed tomography (CT) scan of neck revealed a tear on the anterior tracheal wall extending from C6 to T1 vertebrae level with loss of anterior tracheal wall and surgical emphysema into the surroundings []. Routine investigations and surveys of other body parts were grossly normal.\nIn the operating room, baseline values in the form of a heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg and a respiratory rate of 36\u201338/min with use of accessory muscles. Significantly the oxygen saturation was only 86\u201388% on oxygen supplementation by polymask. After administration of the local anaesthetic agent (lignocaine 2%), surgical tracheostomy was commenced with oxygen supplementation (100% oxygen by Bain's circuit). Dissection revealed a tracheal rent on the anterior tracheal wall, measuring 2 \u00d7 1 cm was observed at the site where the stoma should have been made []. Initially attempts were made to pass the tracheostomy tube through this tracheal rent. Further, failure of such attempts and an impending cardiorespiratory arrest situation prompted the passage of an endotracheal tube after direct laryngoscopy. Post intubation, the oxygenation of the patient improved, ventilation was partially effective due to leak of air from the tracheal rent.

Initially, he noticed a small tender mass in the left buttocks approximately 4 weeks ago. He also described that during his exercise in the gym 4 days prior to arrival he felt like mass was ruptured and reduced in size giving him slight relief in pain. Yet over the period of 4 days, he has worsening of pain and gradually he has decreased in the range of motion at the left hip joint. The patient\u2019s home medication includes self-administered intramuscular testosterone injection usually to his either of buttocks for at least the past 3 years. Complete review of the system was negative for pain at another site, loss of sensation in left extremity, knee pain or ankle pain, skin rash or color change, fever, swelling of left hip or knee joint. Vitals and labs were within normal limits. On physical examination, he was in moderate distress, left thigh was tender to touch, and the patient experienced pain out of proportion on passive extension of the left thigh, with tense anterior thigh muscles, raising the suspicion of compartment syndrome. On admission, a Computed Tomography scan of the left hip showed a left gluteal fluid collection, and a 2 \u00d7 2.7 cm cystic mass (). Left knee synovial fluid was collected and results ruled out infectious processes.\nOrthopedic surgery had high suspicion for ACS; therefore, the patient underwent urgent fasciotomy of the left anterior thigh compartment with excision debridement of the left lower extremity including skin, subcutaneous tissues, fascia, and muscle with the placement of wound vacuum-assisted therapy. After 6 weeks, when the patient was seen in the clinic, he had no symptoms and a full range of motion was achieved. Interim he also went through rehabilitation and physical therapy. The patient was educated to refrain from further self-intramuscular testosterone injection.",

The proximal anastomosis was done with end-to-end configuration just below the superior mesenteric artery, and left renal artery bypass was established with the saphenous vein.

The patient had two episodes of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding within 1 year, which was treated by sclerosing of gastric varices in a primary hospital. An important note in his medical history was a splenectomy 6 decades before after splenic rupture by blunt abdominal trauma. Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract showed isolated gastric fundus varices with the absence of oesophageal varices (). To identify the source of the gastric varices, an enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen was performed and surprisingly demonstrated an 8 cm in diameter mass, mimicking an accessory spleen which\nwas located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, nearly adherent to the stomach and a moderate variceal conglomeration in the fundus of the stomach (). Liver cirrhosis or portal vein occlusion and other inflammatory or malignant diseases could be excluded from CT imaging. In addition, a CT scan was able to show clearly that the arterial blood supply of the accessory spleen is derived from the short gastric arteries. Splenic artery and vein could not be delineated. The patient was subsequently presented to our Department of Visceral Surgery. We decided to perform laparoscopic accessory splenectomy to relief the regional hypertension of the short gastric veins.

Initial chest x ray revealed widened mediastinum, opacification of left hemithorax & rightward mediastinal shift (Fig. ). CT chest revealed crescentic aortic IMH and large left sided hemothorax (Fig. ). Subsequent aortic dissection protocol CTA confirmed a focal dilation of distal transverse aortic arch (maximum diameter of 3.7 cm), a focal intimal irregularity in the distal transverse aortic arch and leaking IMH extending from the origin of the left subclavian artery to the origin of celiac artery without any evidence of active extravasation (Fig. ). There was no CT evidence of active aortitis or atherosclerosis. The patient was hemodynamically stable. Patient was urgently taken to an interventional radiology suite with an intention to perform an endovascular repair of this contained aortic rupture.

Eight years priorly, he was hospitalized for lower GI bleeding. A colonoscopy performed at that time revealed the presence of a soft and friable rectal mass 2 cm proximal to the anal sphincter. He subsequently underwent transanal endoscopic sphincter-sparing surgery. Histology revealed the presence of a GIST. The patient remained free of disease for 3 years, when routine surveillance revealed local recurrence.

He was the fourth child of young parents, born from the fourth pregnancy, which ended at week 42. During the first 4 weeks of life, he did not show any symptoms of a congenital defect or any significant comorbidity.\nOn admission to the emergency department of a regional hospital, he was anxious and crying which was followed by a deep coma with a Glasgow Coma Scale score decreasing from 7 to 3 points. Anisocoria, bradycardia of 80\u2013100 beats per minute, and bradypnea of 15 breaths per minute were also observed. Laboratory investigations revealed severe anemia and significant coagulopathy. No traumatic event or external action involving another person was reported in the anamnesis. Computerized tomography of the head revealed an intracranial hemorrhage and mass effect due to severe epidural hematoma of 0.11 cm with disseminated ischemic foci. The patient underwent urgent extensive frontoparietal craniotomy performed as a life-saving procedure by surgeons in the regional hospital. Broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis was considered and ceftriaxone seemed to be the best choice. Ceftriaxone was administered intravenously at a dose of 100 mg/kg once a day. When the patient\u2019s clinical condition was deemed to be compatible with stabilization of the respiratory and circulatory systems, he was transferred to the University Hospital for Children to continue advanced intensive neurosurgical treatment.\nOn admission to the pediatric intensive care unit, the severity of the neonate\u2019s illness was assessed at 20 points according to PRISM (Pediatric Risk of Mortality), with a predicted risk of death of 34.4%.

He stated that his pain initially began as indigestion while he was leaning forward getting out of bed and progressed to a constant aching pain with associated nausea. He stated that bending forward exacerbated the pain. He denied prandial pain, melena, hematochezia, or recent change in bowel habits. History was notable for hypertension which was being managed without need for antihypertensive medications. Surgical history was not significant for any prior abdominal surgeries. His social history was significant for tobacco abuse which consisted of a half pack of cigarettes a day for 25 years. Initial vital signs were significant for hypertension. Physical exam on presentation was significant for minimal epigastric tenderness with normoactive bowel sounds without rebound or guarding. Lab analysis was not significant for elevated lipase, liver function abnormalities, anemia, or electrolyte abnormalities. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was performed which showed a filling defect in the celiac artery. Due to concern for dissection, a CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis was performed. The CT angiogram showed a 40.1 mm dissection from the celiac origin into the hepatic artery as well as a 37.9 mm dissection from the celiac origin into the splenic artery (Figures and ). He was also found to have a beaded-appearing left main renal artery, raising concerns for fibromuscular dysplasia.\nThe patient was admitted for observation, given 1000 mL unfractionated heparin bolus, and started on an unfractionated heparin infusion. The patient was evaluated by vascular surgeons and gastroenterologists. When given the choice for stenting the lesion for symptomatic control, he elected not to have the lesion stented.

There was no external wound except for bruises over his right knee. The hip was in abduction and external rotation while the knee was sagging posteriorly. His distal pulses, including popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses were not felt though femoral was palpable. Plain radiography showed an anterior dislocation of the right hip without any acetabular fracture but a posterior dislocation of the knee [].

Patient denied vomiting, fever, weight loss or change in bowel habits or urination. Only significant past medical and surgical history being prostate cancer treated with radiation. On examination, the patient appeared in mild distress and vital signs within normal limits. Physical exam revealed a moderately distended abdomen with an initially incarcerated umbilical hernia. The hernia was able to be manually reduced, which resulted in slight decrease of pain. Hematological and biochemical studies were within normal limits, and a computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated borderline dilated loops of proximal small bowel; however, no transition point was identified. After discussion with a radiologist, a partial small bowel obstruction secondary to possible LPDH was confirmed (Fig. ).\nThe patient was taken to the operating room within 12 h of hospital admission where a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed. While running the bowel, a hernia sac was discovered arising from a defect to the left of the fourth part of the duodenum, consistent with a LPDH (Fig. ). An aggregation of intestinal loops was herniated through the defect into the fossa of Landzert. The bowel was then easily reduced using bowel graspers, and a scar was noted to be tacking the orifice to the mesentery, trapping the first part of the jejunum. The bowel was intermittently dilated and compressed. Due to a section of reduced bowel remaining visibly dusky, a small midline laparotomy was performed to allow tactile examination of the bowel. After the mild ischemia was observed to have reverted and no further obstruction was ensured, the bowel was returned to the abdominal cavity and the LPDH orifice was closed primarily by fixing the root of the mesentery to the posterior parietal peritoneum.",

    "original_text": "An 18 month old boy presented to our ocular oncology referral center with the diagnosis of leukocoria in the left eye. He had no other past medical or past ocular history and family history was negative for retinoblastoma. Upon initial examination, there was no light perception (NLP) vision in the left eye. The patient was able to fix and follow normally with the right eye. Intraocular pressures were within normal limits in both eyes. Ocular examination was normal in the right eye. In the left eye, the retina was visible on external examination through the pupil (Fig. ). Fundus exam through the pupil revealed a total, exudative, retinal detachment with diffuse retinal telangiectasias, leading to a diagnosis of Coats' disease. Given the stage of the disease and poor prognosis, the family agreed to defer treatment and chose comfort care only for the left eye.\nTwo weeks after his initial presentation, the child returned to the hospital with a red, painful, left eye. His family denied any other changes systemically. External ophthalmic examination at this time revealed conjunctival injection and xanthocoria (yellow pupil), both new findings (Fig. ). Slit lamp examination revealed an anterior chamber occupied by a turbid, yellow, proteinaceous fluid. The material was reflective and filled the entire anterior chamber, completely obscuring any view to the pupil or the posterior segment. These findings were consistent with an interval development of anterior chamber cholesterolosis. The intraocular pressure at this time was 52 mmHg.

In October 2012, she experienced sudden, severe pain in her left hip without any antecedent trauma or episode. The pain affected her not only when she moved the hip but also when she was at rest. Her condition had been diagnosed at another hospital as synovial osteochondromatosis of the hip, for which she was given an anti-inflammatory drug (loxoprofen, 60 mg, three times daily for 10 days).

    "original_text": "A 76-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a mass occurring on the skin of her right chest wall. She had been diagnosed with right breast cancer (T1N0M0, stage I) 9 years previously and had received breast-conserving surgery, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy for the residual whole right breast at a previous hospital. She then developed pigmented skin on her right breast 6 years after surgery, and this lesion was diagnosed as an angiosarcoma. The patient underwent a breast mastectomy to treat for RAAS. Following this, however, the angiosarcoma on her chest wall recurred three times within 2 years. The angiosarcoma was resected each time, and she received radiation therapy to her chest wall after the third operation. Four years after the first occurrence of RAAS, we observed light pigmentation and a dark red tumor (gross diameter of 5 mm) on her right chest wall (Fig. ). Clinically, recurrence of RAAS was suspected, and recurrence of angiosarcoma was diagnosed by biopsy. We considered that it was necessary to remove the irradiated skin as much as possible in order to cure the RAAS. After extensive resection of the irradiated skin and tumor, new skin collected from her right thigh was grafted to the site (Fig. ). Pathologically, the tumor size was 6 mm and the surgical margin was negative. Histologically, there were many spindle cells and dilated vascular channels. Immunostaining showed that the tumor was CD31-positive and mildly positive for CD34 (Fig. ). Ki-67 index was also high. It was revealed that there is no inconsistency as recurrence of RAAS is pathological. After the operation, the patient was hospitalized for 30 days and did not experience any complications.

Significant medical history included diabetes mellitus type 2, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diastolic heart failure. The patient's last dose of apixaban was 48 hours prior to surgery. Other than moderate anemia (hemoglobin 8.8 g/dL), all laboratory studies, including a coagulation profile, were normal.\nPrior to surgery, the patient was offered a sciatic nerve catheter and an adductor canal block as part of a multimodal postoperative analgesia strategy. Because of her many, serious medical conditions, we concluded that a peripheral nerve block offered the best opportunity to provide satisfactory postoperative analgesia. Specifically, we were concerned that the postoperative pain management primarily with opioid medications would pose increased cardiopulmonary risk to the patient. We were careful to explain the risks associated with peripheral nerve blocks, including the risk of bleeding and hematoma formation, and verbal consent was obtained.\nThe surgery was performed under general anesthesia and her intraoperative course was uncomplicated. Upon arrival to the recovery room, our acute pain service was contacted to evaluate her for peripheral nerve blockade. We positioned the patient in the lateral decubitus position and placed a sciatic nerve catheter. Though technically challenging due to body habitus, this sciatic nerve block was performed successfully and without any complication.

She had regular menstrual cycles before pregnancy. She had dyspnea, chest pain and fatigue with mild physical exertion. She also had trouble lying down in a supine position.\nDuring the examination, her electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and right atrial and right ventricular hypertrophy. Her heart rate was 115 beats per minute. Her symptoms were suggestive of an unrepaired ECD. She had severe left and right common valve insufficiency. Color flow imaging and pulsed wave Doppler demonstrated bidirectional cardiac shunting with dominant left-to-right shunting. Her left and right heart pressures were nearly equal. Based upon the natural history of an unrepaired ECD, we suspected that our patient had severe pulmonary hypertension.\nBecause of the extreme high risk of mortality for our patient, the obstetrician, cardiologist and anesthesiologist of our hospital offered to terminate the pregnancy. Our patient\u2019s family refused the advice and insisted on continuing the pregnancy. Our patient was also advised to stay in our hospital for close monitoring and proper treatment, and again her family refused our advice.\nOur patient returned at 33 weeks and six days of pregnancy because of lower abdominal pain accompanied with vagina fluid outflow for two hours. Her physical examination on admission showed a temperature of 35\u00b0C, pulse of 130 beats per minute, blood pressure at 140/80mmHg, respiration 33 breaths per minute (provided with 5L oxygen per minute), severe dyspnea, cyanosis, lower extremity edema, grade three to six heart murmur at her left intercostal space, and grade two to three systolic murmur at the apex of her heart.

On admission, the patient was confused, agitated, and had automatism in his lips and mouth. There were no obvious signs of head trauma. Vital signs were stable, and lung and abdominal exams were normal. The brain computed tomography (CT) scan showed large amounts of air in it (). Thus, we transferred the patient to the intensive care unit (ICU) and administered high doses of oxygen (10 Liter/min) with mask, while laying him in the trendelenburg position. Consciousness of the patient improved rapidly with these treatments. Although primary lung examination revealed no abnormal findings, the patient gradually went into respiratory distress. A lung CT scan uncovered that a tension pneumothorax has been developed (). A subsequent thoracotomy was performed, during which tearing of a large branch of the left bronchial tree was detected and sutured. A thoracostomy tube was then established to evacuate the excess air from the pleural cavity. A second brain CT scan showed that all the air bobbles were gone. After one week, the patient was discharged in good condition. In this case, after bronchial tear, intra-pleural pressure was increased and led the air to pulmonary veins, the heart, aorta and finally the cranial arteries.\nCerebral air embolism is a threatening condition that could be caused by isolated penetrating chest injury. After chest injury, air may be introduced into the pulmonary arterial system. If the arterial gas embolism occurs, the smaller arteries or arterioles will be obstructed by air bubbles. This leads to ischemic and hypoxic changes. In addition, air bubbles may induce some inflammatory reactions. Loss of consciousness and convulsion are two of the most severe symptoms that could happen. CT scan reveals the bubbles in the brain. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is recognized as a useful way to decrease bubble",
