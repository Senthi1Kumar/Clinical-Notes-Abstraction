The enhanced contrast abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a massive retroperitoneal hematoma around pancreas and a PDA aneurysm on pancreas head (A). A sagittal view of the CT angiography revealed extrinsic compression of the root of the CA by the MAL (B). His diagnosis was determined as MALS with a ruptured PDA aneurysm. His vital signs were within normal limits, therefore, we performed endovascular treatment for a ruptured PDA aneurysm at first. The angiography of the CA showed no antegrade blood flow to the proper hepatic artery (A), and that of the SMA revealed the retrograde flow via the pancreaticoduodenal arcade in addition to the replaced right hepatic artery (B). The ruptured PDA aneurysm was treated by transcatheter arterial coil embolization (C, D). 5 days after the treatment, he was discharged with no complication. Although he had no symptom caused by MALS after the treatment for a ruptured PDA aneurysm, there was always a risk of reformation of the PDA aneurysms.

The patient's hemoglobin was 136 g/L, creatinine was 68 \u03bcmol/L, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 88 mL/min. Urine sediment was normal. Abdominal ultrasound examination revealed a large retroperitoneal mass around the left kidney with heterogeneous echogenicity of the lower pole of the left kidney. For further evaluation, computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast was performed, revealing a large left perinephric hematoma that distended the renal fascia and displaced the peritoneal and retroperitoneal structures. The estimated size of the hematoma was 15 cm in the cephalocaudal, 4 cm in the anteroposterior, and 7 cm in the transverse dimensions. In addition, a hypodense mass without calcification was detected in the lower pole of the left kidney that was poorly marginated from the perinephric hematoma (). These findings were highly suggestive of the rupture of the angiomyolipoma of the left kidney with massive retroperitoneal hemorrhage, a condition known as WS.

On examination, active ankle sprain dorsiflexion toe dorsiflexion and eversion were normal and there was no sensory impairment as well. Only left toe extension impairment was noted. The ultrasound was done to evaluate the soft tissue injury of the ankle. Initially, we focused on the ankle area for a sprain. When comparing the bilateral peroneus longus muscles, we found the loss of normal muscular echogenic appearance over the entire left side. Tracing this back to the origin of peroneus muscle, we found a hypoechoic cyst with a well demarcated margin neighboring the left peroneal nerve just posterior to the fibula head []. Lower limb nerve conduction and electromyography study for peroneal nerve were done. The left common peroneal nerve injury over the fibular head area was found (conduction velocity: 37 ms, normal value: More than 41 ms; peak amplitude: 1.7 mV, normal value: More than 2.0 mV in nerve conduction velocity (NCV) study; only increased polyphasic motor unit action potential was found in electromyography study). In order to more thoroughly evaluate the origin of the mass lesion and adjacent structure, a knee MRI was done. The MRI showed a 33 mm synovial cyst as originating from the proximal tibiofibular articulation with neither rupture nor regional infiltration []. A left PTFJ synovial cyst with extraneural compression over the common peroneal nerve was diagnosed.\nSurgery was performed and the synovial cyst was exposed in the PTFJ area. Compression of the common peroneal nerve by the synovial cyst at fibular head and neck was found during surgical exploration. The compressed nerve was thin by about 60% in diameter when compared to the noncompressed area. Total excision of the synovial cyst was performed and a synovial cyst with a fibrous wall was confirmed on histopathology.

Urgent chest computed tomography revealed AAD (DeBakey type II) from the level of the Valsalva sinuses to the distal ascending aorta involving the right coronary orifice, without mediastinal hematoma or pleural effusion. The diameter of the ascending aorta was 52 mm at the sinotubular junction, and the annulus of the aortic valve was 33 mm (). On transthoracic echocardiography, the ejection fraction was 65% and moderate aortic regurgitation was observed. The fetal sonography was normal. Emergency operation with the fetus in the uterus was decided upon. Under general anesthesia, cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted by draining blood from the right atrium and perfusion into the femoral artery. The intraoperative finding was that the thin adventitia was bearing the vertically dissected aortic wall, involving the right coronary orifice (). A modified Bentall procedure was performed with fetal heart monitoring simultaneously.

As there were no malignant findings, surgery was not performed during the pregnancy (Fig. ). There were no symptoms and no change in the size of the cyst during the pregnancy. To prevent a post-term pregnancy, induction of labor by oxytocin was started on the morning of the 41st week and 4th day of pregnancy.

Therefore, we do not perform epidural analgesia for this patient.\nThe oxytocin infusion was discontinued in the evening because no effective labor was achieved despite rupture of the membranes 5 h after labor induction. After the oxytocin infusion was stopped, the uterine contractions continued at 2-min intervals. The patient had difficulty walking on her own, but this was diagnosed to be due to the labor pain.\nThe following morning, delivery progressed to 9 cm of uterine cervix dilation.

General examination showed there was no abnormality but the patient complained of decrease 5 kg of total bodyweight. The local state of the left elbow shows fixed, solid mass on the posterior aspect of the elbow, with the size 14x12cm, 30 cm circumferentially (contralateral 27 cm) (). The range of motion of the left elbow joint could not be measured because of pain. On radiographs obtained at the first examination, an osteolytic lesion and periosteal reaction of the distal humerus was observed (). On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a low intensity was observed on T2-weighted imaging (). Computed tomography of the chest showed that there was no abnormality. The patient underwent histopathological and immunohistochemistry examination, with the result of conventional osteosarcoma ().

He was evaluated to undergo living unrelated donor kidney transplant. The donor was a 54-year-old female with unremarkable past medical history. She was medically and surgically cleared after full assessment. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) angiography for the donor revealed a small complex cyst (Bosniak IIF), a short right renal vein (2 cm), and a right renal artery with an early bifurcation of an upper pole artery. Surgical approach deemed best by the living donor selection committee was to remove the right kidney with the complex cyst via laparoscopic approach.\nThe risks of surgery and potential complications were explained to both donor and recipient. Written informed consent was obtained prior to surgery from both patients.\nA standard hand-assisted laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy (LLDN) was performed to retrieve the right kidney and the right ovarian vein for reconstruction. The length of the donor renal vein was reduced by 10-15 mm due to the standard use of vascular stapler device to control the renal vein stump.\nStatus after procurement upon visualization in the back table is that the length of the donor renal vein was 3 mm. In order to elongate the vein, the donor ovarian vein was dissected and used for reconstruction. It was opened longitudinally, folded over, and anastomosed to the donor renal vein using end-to-end anastomosis with an 8-0 Prolene ().\nThe donor kidney had a renal artery with early bifurcation of an upper pole artery. After mobilization of the inferior vena cava as much as possible, the endovascular stapler was placed after the bifurcation from the renal artery and the length of the vessel was reduced by 10-15 mm. At the back table the donor kidney presented two individual arteries: the main renal artery and the short upper pole arterial branch.

The surgery was performed under conscious sedation and analgesia procedure which is routinely preferred by the anesthetists for minor surgeries. The patient experienced sudden, severe hemodynamic deterioration after undergoing this minor surgical procedure. Spontaneous breathing was maintained by continuous infusion of propofol at a rate of 100 \u03bcg/kg/min to achieve conscious sedation after administering fentanyl 100 \u03bcg intravenously. During surgery, the patient remained hemodynamically stable. Patient had nausea and vomiting in the early postoperative period, which were treated with 4 mg of intravenous ondansetron. A few minutes later, the patient experienced hemodynamic instability with sinus tachycardia and hypotension. Her heart rate was 122 regular beats/minute, and the blood pressure was 50/30 mmHg. The oxygen saturation had decreased to 80% as recorded by pulse oximetry, despite oxygen supply through face mask. She was immediately treated with intravenous dopamine and dobutamine as well as with ventilator support due to acute respiratory failure. The arterial gasometry showed oxygen pressure 40 mmHg and carbon dioxide pressure 49 mmHg; the electrocardiogram monitor showed sinus tachycardia. The signs of heart failure (HF) were found in the bedside digital X-ray of chest and emergency transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed severe biventricular dysfunction with global hypokinesia. The LVEF was 42%. Coronary angiography showed no coronary lesions. An intra-aortic balloon pump was introduced for counterpulsation. The repeat TTE revealed LVEF 32% and a left ventricular extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) device was inserted to assist the impaired clinical course of the patient. The LVEF gradually improved and on the 5th postoperative day the ventilatory support and circulatory perfusion assistance were removed. Troponin T and C reactive protein levels remained within normal limits.

This resulted in a coma and massive cerebral oedema requiring ICU admission and treatment with mannitol. During childhood he had several similar episodes of seizure-associated encephalopathy, for which no cause was found. None of these subsequent episodes resulted in cerebral oedema.

There had been no injury associated with the pain. He denied systemic symptoms, including fever, chills, night sweats, or malaise. Past medical history included asymptomatic severe mitral valve regurgitation secondary to bileaflet mitral valve prolapse, for which he underwent robot-assisted minimally invasive mitral valve repair and prosthetic ring placement approximately 6 months prior to presentation. There was also a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He lived in the central United States with his wife and was employed as an attorney. He consumed approximately two alcoholic drinks per night, was a never smoker, and had no history of intravenous drug use. There were no other significant exposures or travel documented.\nThe patient recovered from his mitral valve repair, had stopped anticoagulation after 6 weeks, and had returned to walking and/or running 3\u20135 miles per day. A transthoracic echocardiogram that was done approximately 2 months postoperatively demonstrated a normal functioning valve, with only trace regurgitation.\nHe was initially treated with symptomatic pain relief with hydrocodone-acetaminophen but had no improvement in the left popliteal fossa pain and was therefore referred to an orthopedic provider. A plain radiograph demonstrated Baker's cyst and he was treated with a cortisone injection. Due to persistence of symptoms, he was subsequently evaluated for possible deep venous thrombosis via venous ultrasound which indicated a left popliteal thrombus and aneurysm. As a result of this finding, he was admitted to an outside hospital for further evaluation.\nAt the outside facility, he underwent MRI of the left knee, CT angiogram with bilateral extremity runoff, and transthoracic echocardiogram. These studies revealed left popliteal aneurysm with occlusive eccentric thrombus and incomplete clot of a right renal artery branch. The following day, a transthoracic echocardiogram was done and showed a highly mobile mass attached to the anterior mitral valve leaflet, measuring approximately 1.5 cm",

She was diagnosed with Primary Hyperoxalosis for which she underwent same setting liver and kidney transplant. A few years afterward, she was diagnosed with intestinal type diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. After that, she had an ileocecal mass that obstructs the bowel lumen and required oncological resection with right hemicolectomy and anastomosis which was further complicated by anastomotic leakage, wound dehiscence and intra-abdominal sepsis thus requiring emergency exploratory laparotomy and Hartmann's procedure with end ileostomy. The patient then underwent laparotomy, Hartmann's revision and ileostomy site closure. For the purpose of graft preservation, the patient was on long-term immunosuppressants.\nAfter more than a year from the last surgery, she developed a central abdominal bulge at the site of her laparotomy scar; she had midline incisional hernia. Due to the long history of laparotomies and multiple surgical procedures, a multidisciplinary approach was necessary, and a surgical treatment plan was set.\nAn enhanced CT scan was performed and showed thinning of the anterior abdominal wall muscles with severe atrophy of the left rectus abdominis muscle with rectus diastasis of around 10 cm distance (Figure ).\nThe injection was performed by the interventional radiologist with the patient in supine position under ultrasound guidance (Figure ). Injection sites were marked at the anterior axillary line between the costal margin and anterior superior iliac spine according to the technique described by Smoot et al. The area was prepped and draped in a sterile technique which was followed by application of local anesthesia in the form of 1% lidocaine at the skin of injection sites.

These symptoms had first appeared at 28 weeks of gestation, and gait imbalance and difficulty with speech also occurred a few days before referral. On examination, her Glasgow Coma Scale score was E3V5M6, and she exhibited a tremor in her left upper limb. She had experienced repeated nausea and vomiting, which had led to 3 kg of body weight loss within one month. Her vital signs were normal, and laboratory data showed no significant changes. Because the symptoms had lasted for two weeks and were accompanied by a change in her level of consciousness, a neurological disorder was suspected. A brain MRI was performed to search for an intracranial lesion, and a mass was found on the left cerebellopontine angle nearly obstructing the fourth ventricle (A,B). Although the patient was prescribed steroids and osmotic diuretics, her symptoms caused by increased intracranial pressure remained unchanged. Obstetricians and neurosurgeons discussed her condition, which was considered to have a potential risk of obstructive hydrocephalus, and decided that the patient\u2019s pregnancy should be terminated to proceed with treatment of the brain tumor. Cesarean section under general anesthesia was performed at 32 weeks of gestation, and the patient delivered a 1532-g female infant with an Apgar score of 4/7. One week after delivery, total removal of the tumor was conducted. A lateral suboccipital craniotomy was performed, with the dura incised along the sigmoid sinus. The tumor was detected after opening the lateral cerebellomedullary cistern. The floccular part of the fourth ventricle was assumed to be the tumor\u2019s origin as the tumor adhered to that part.

She mostly suffered from vertigo at night with multiple vomiting spells and bilateral tinnitus, which would last the entire night. During the period of vertigo, she also had a headache at the right temporal site, which was present a kind of pulsatile pain and could last several hours; this caused nausea and the inability to fall asleep. Prior to the onset of the vertigo and headache, she also had a visual aura with wave sight that lasted 10 min. Approximately 10 of these attacks were trigged by loud noises or bright lights, accompanied with symptoms such as chest tightness, tachypnea, and blushing. The migraine attacks were mostly accompanied by vertigo, becoming more severe during vestibular episodes. Those symptoms continued to worsen over the next week from the initial onset. During this time, the patient suffered from vertigo for several hours daily, and also suffered from repeated vomiting, numbness on the right side of the face, and tinnitus in the ear. The attacks of vertigo had no connection to changing body position. The headache occurred on the right side with visual aura expressing as fortification spectrum during vertigo. Physical examination found dysesthesia around the right side of the forehead and unsteady gait.\nThe patient\u2019s clinical history revealed a more frequent occurrence of migraines during the period of pregnancy.

Transthoracic echocardiography revealed d-TGA with intact ventricular septum, left aortic arch and a 4mm patent ductus arteriosus. Medical therapy with prostaglandin E1, dopamine, oxygen and antibiotics was initiated. The following day, owing to hemodynamic instability, urgent corrective cardiac surgery was necessitated. The intra-operative findings included the following. The sinus 2, according to the Leiden convention [], presented two coronary ostia: one giving off a branch as the right coronary artery, and the other one originating at a long left main coronary trunk and passing directly backward in close relation to the pulmonary artery, then curving around its posterior aspect to reach the atrioventricular groove, from whence it bifurcated into the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries. An additional branch originated from sinus 1 as a conal branch, giving rise to the septal branches. Translocation of the coronary arteries was performed. The new pulmonary trunk was reconstructed to avoid compression of the coronary artery and distortion of the great arteries. Immediately after surgery, the patient was unstable hemodynamically, as demonstrated by left ventricular (LV) failure and persistent pulmonary edema requiring inotropic support and mechanical ventilation. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed the presence of an anomalous accelerated Doppler flow localized at the left side of the heart, precisely at the aortic arch level. This Doppler image gave rise to our suspicion of an anomalous shunt between the systemic and pulmonary circulation. The hemodynamic study demonstrated a unique supra-aortic anomalous vessel originating from the left subclavian artery. The anteroposterior projection demonstrated an anomalous vessel originating from the inferior wall of the left subclavian artery, from whence it divided into two branches supplying both lungs as BAs (Figure ).

    "original_text": "A 51-year-old female patient was transferred to our institution in May 2011 with a known carcinoid tumor, progressive dyspnea (NYHA III) and progressive peripheral edema for the last two years. The neuroendocrine tumor of the ileum was first diagnosed in 2008. Midgut resection was performed in 2008 and liver metastases were verified by CT. Sandostatin therapy was induced postoperatively. Significant coronary artery disease requiring intervention was ruled out by angiography. The TTE revealed a severe tricuspid valve insufficiency and a pressure gradient of the pulmonary valve of 13/8 mmHg. Diagnosis of Hedinger\u2019s syndrome was confirmed and tricuspid valve replacement was performed in June 2011 with a Medtronic Hancock\u00ae (27 mm). At time of discharge the tricuspid bioprosthesis presented a regular function and clinical condition showed significant improvement with dyspnea NYHA I and no peripheral edema. In September 2011 the patient was transferred again to our institution due to recurrence of dyspnea and peripheral edema. The TTE presented a regular function of the tricuspid valve bioprosthesis but a severe insufficiency and a moderate stenosis of the pulmonary valve with a pressure gradient of 23/12 mmHg. After recompensation the patient could be discharged. In June 2012 the patient presented again with right heart failure. Leading clinical symptoms were dyspnea, peripheral edema and additionally severe ascites. The echo now revealed a moderate insufficiency of the tricuspid valve bioprosthesis and the pulmonary valve was severely insufficient and moderately stenotic. The right heart function was reduced (Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion [TAPSE] of 8 mm). Implantation of a Medtronic Melody\u00ae valve through right heart catheter was terminated due to a rather small annulus diameter of the pulmonary valve (23 mm).

    "original_text": "Our patient is a 61-year-old 90 kg 177.8 cm male with a history of coronary artery disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis who was admitted to the intensive care unit for ventilator support. On arrival to the emergency department he was profoundly hypoxic and was emergently intubated. He was subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit. On initial evaluation the patient was alert and was able to follow commands and communicated via writing. His overall strength was poor, 2/5 in both his hands and feet with minimal ability to lift his proximal arms and legs. His cranial nerves were all grossly intact. His level of function prior to admission was heavily dependent on assistance for activities of daily living. He was, however, able to talk and swallow without difficulty and was receiving no respiratory support.\nSubsequent to his admission to the ICU he met parameters for extubation during a trial of spontaneous breathing, and the endotracheal tube was removed. He failed spontaneous ventilation and was reintubated within 2 hours following extubation. Over the next three days, multiple attempts were made to wean the patient from the ventilator; however, he failed multiple trials of spontaneous breathing and could not be extubated. The decision was made among the ICU team, the patient, and the family to proceed with tracheostomy insertion. The Oral Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) service was then consulted.

D. a 78 year-old right handed Caucasian male, a retired physician, had experienced, for the 3 years prior to his hospital admission, recurrent episodes of transient visual symptoms. These consisted exclusively in the occurrence of colorless mesh-like flickering lights in his right homonymous visual fields. These photopias were not induced by any particular stimulus, showed no movement, but their light intensity pulsated in a rhythmic pattern. These were not associated with auditory phenomena, nor were they preceded, associated with or followed by headache. These episodes lasted for 1\u20132 min and cleared spontaneously only to recur after variable periods of time. Because these episodes were not associated with any change in his visual acuity nor with the perception of a visual field defect A. D. did not seek, during that period of time, an ophthalmological evaluation. Only when the patient's wife reported some personality changes consisting in sleepiness and unusual sudden mood changes together with a mild gait imbalance, a cerebral MRI with Gadolinium was done and demonstrated an intraventricular meningioma in the right lateral ventricle, associated with edema in the right parietal lobe ().\nThe patient was admitted to a neurosurgical referral center. There his general physical and neurological examinations, including visual field testing by confrontation, detected no abnormalities. A chest x-ray, EKG, complete blood count, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, liver function tests, and coagulation profile were all within normal limits. He was then brought to the operating room where a right posterior parietal craniotomy was performed in the prone position. A transcortical approach to the right lateral ventricle with image guidance assistance was carried out and a Vycor tubular retractor was positioned into that tract.

In his medical history he was operated due to clear cell carcinoma of the right kidney three years ago. The pathological examination of the kidney was revealed as pT3N1M0, Grade 2. Then the adjuvant chemotherapy and the interferon treatment were planned but he refused any treatment and he has been followed after the operation by routine examinations such as liver functions (SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, GGT, bilirubin levels), urea, creatinine levels, abdominal ultrasonography, bone scintigraphy, chest X-ray.\nDuring that follow up period, the patient had no symptoms and routine tests were within normal limits. The physical examination after three years revealed solitary nodule on the right lobe of the thyroid that were thought to be an adenoma or a nodule of colloidal goitre. A fine needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid revealed some mildly pleomorphic and hyperchromatic cells and due to this suspicious ctyological finding consistent with malignancy, bilateral near total thyroidectomy was performed.\nThe pathological specimen measured 5.5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3 cm and showed two nodules, each of them located at different lobe and measured up to 2.0 cm in the greatest dimension. A microscopic examination showed the diffuse proliferation of acinary structures and large sheets of neoplastic cells in the adjacent acini with the extension into the thyroid follicular tissue.

Emergent brain CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were normal and one hour later she walked to her car. However, 15 min thereafter her consciousness declined again. She arrived at our hospital by ambulance 5 hr after the initial symptom onset, 45 min after her consciousness decreased for the second time. Neurological examination showed left hemiparesis and she was comatose. Her body temperature was 38.2\u00b0C and she was coughing. Blood test revealed a white blood cell count of 10.80 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL and C-reactive protein of 1.89 mg/dL. Emergent brain CT images revealed air inflow in the cortical veins in the bilateral frontal and parietal areas (Figures and ). MRI scans were performed 30 min later. T2-weighted images showed tortuous air inflow in the bilateral frontal areas; it was less than what had been observed on the CT images (). DWI revealed the cortical areas with restricted diffusion near the air ().

He was assessed to have normal visual acuity and extraocular movements. He had a history of severe ankylosing spondylitis for which he was taking a TNF inhibitor, adalimumab. His blood tests showed a slightly raised C-reactive protein of 82 mg/l but otherwise no abnormality. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on the day of admission and noted significant left frontal sinusitis complicated by a defect of the frontal cortical bone as well as oedema and enhancement consistent with a Pott\u2019s puffy tumour (). There was also an abscess of the periorbital soft tissue. Immediate treatment was given in the form of phenylephrine nasal decongestants and intravenous antibiotics (amoxicillin with clavulanic acid), and the patient was transferred to a tertiary centre with ear, nose and throat surgery capacity.\nWithin 24 hours of arrival at the tertiary centre, an incision and drainage of the soft tissue abscess and periosteal abscess was performed. At the same time the sinuses were debrided via endoscopic approach and a wide maxillary antrostomy and sphenoidectomy was performed. It was discovered that the frontal recess was completely occluded by a bony wall (). A cannula was placed into the frontal sinus for regular irrigation during the post-operative period with the other sinuses irrigated via nasal douche. Intravenous antibiotics and regular irrigation were continued for a further 5 days, and the TNF inhibitor was withheld on the advice of a rheumatologist. After this time the frontal sinus cannula was removed and the patient was discharged home.

Visual examination revealed red-brown erosion on the glans penis around the external urethral orifice (). Physical examination showed no definite inguinal lymph node swelling. A diagnosis of penile BD was made with a penile skin biopsy. The patient was referred to our department to evaluate the involvement of BD in the distal urethra.\nVisual examination and cystoscopy revealed no definite tumorous lesions in the urethra or urinary bladder. Urine cytology was negative. No definite BD lesions in the distal urethra were expected to be found in this case; therefore, local tumor resection with skin grafting from the femoral skin was performed (). The superficial region of the glans penis, with a margin of 5 mm from the visual lesions, was resected, together with the external urethral orifice.\nAlthough the peripheral surgical margin of the glans penis was negative, a positive urethral margin of the tumor was revealed upon histopathological examination. Since the degree of urethral involvement of penile BD could not be estimated with any clinical observation, the patient received a glansectomy 2 months after the initial surgery. The decision to completely resect the carcinoma was confirmed by the intraoperative frozen section analysis. Histopathological examination revealed the growth of stratified squamous epithelial cells with nuclear atypia in all layers of the urethral mucosa; hence, the patient was diagnosed with urethral BD. A tumorous lesion in the distal urethra, 7 mm from the external urethral orifice, was found. The patient recovered well, with no definite recurrence of BD up to 13 months after the glansectomy.
