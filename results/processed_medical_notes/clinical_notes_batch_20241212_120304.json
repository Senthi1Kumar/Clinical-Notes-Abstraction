The space between the vocal cords was too narrow due to the presence of the polyp for an endotracheal tube to be inserted. In addition, a surgical procedure could not be performed if the polyp moved into the trachea after endotracheal intubation.

He was fully informed about the study and written consent was obtained from him prior to examination. In his medical examination he explained that his gums started bleeding at a very early age. At age 24, he started to smoke since he thought smoking would help to stop bleeding. Currently, he smokes 1-1.5 packs a day. At age 30, he started to experience difficulty in eating and complained of tooth mobility and gum bleeding. He claimed that his teeth ached a lot and as a result the teeth were extracted by a non-dentist or himself. Consequently, at the age of 50 to 60, he lost most of his teeth. At age 25, he was diagnosed with periodontitis. Nonetheless, he had not seen a dentist for this problem or performed any personal oral hygiene.\nOur patient complained of pain in the oral cavity especially on the tongue, buccal mucosa and had difficulty in chewing and swallowing solid food for six months.\nHis past medical history was significant for a tonsillectomy as a child. All the symptoms in his medical reviews were negative. Spirometric pulmonary tests were normal. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed minimal emphysematous areas over both apices and non-specific sequelae (Figure ). Head and neck examinations were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the tongue revealed no sign of abnormality. He underwent extensive tests to identify the etiologies associated with systemic amyloidosis. Tests such as rectal biopsy, bone marrow biopsy, echocardiogram, abdomen tomography, serum and urine protein electrophoresis as well as liver function test were all normal. However, our patient was diagnosed as chronic renal failure with proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia (Table ).

    "original_text": "An 88-year-old woman had suffered from a cough for the past 2 years and had recently felt dysphagia. The dysphagia progressed to the extent that she was unable to tolerate solid foods. She also reported an episode of regurgitation of a mass into her mouth. Three months before, she was diagnosed with cervical esophageal cancer at the clinic near her home, at which point she was admitted to a local tertiary medical center. On the further examination, she was diagnosed with cervical esophageal cancer invading the hypopharynx (Figures and ). A histopathological examination revealed squamous cell carcinoma. Computed tomography and positron emission tomography (PET) revealed no lymph nodal metastasis or distant metastasis. She was recommended to undergo total pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy or chemoradiotherapy. However, she was elderly; she refused these invasive treatments and hoped to preserve her voice and swallowing function. She was therefore referred to our hospital for a second opinion. The present patient received a transnasal endoscopic examination. We have routinely performed the trumpet maneuver using transnasal endoscopy for patients with esophageal cancer since 2009, using the following procedure. First, the patient is asked to bow the head deeply in the left lateral position. We then place a hand on the back of the patient's head and push it forward. To examine the hypopharynx and the orifice of the esophagus, the patient is asked to blow hard and puff the cheeks while the mouth remains closed (trumpet maneuver).

She was found by the nurses of the ward, prone on the floor, unresponsive and presenting diffuse muscular jerks. This episode had spontaneous resolution in a few minutes and the patient completely regained consciousness. No signs of sphincters relaxation or secondary trauma were evident. Her vital parameters never got altered during and immediately after the seizure and she had normal blood pressure and body temperature. The nurses reported appearance, a few hours before the seizure, of a brief, sudden episode of diminished awareness of environment and inability to respond to external stimuli; this was erroneously blamed to tiredness and lack of sleep.\nNeither medical therapy at home nor voluntary drug abuse or toxin exposure were reported. She never had epileptic events or other neurological symptoms before. In her past clinical history no significant diseases could be found, except for a surgical intervention of saphenectomy in February 2008.

The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes and preeclampsia for which the mother had been placed on bedrest during the final trimester.

The donor tissue was negative for Epstein Barr Virus (EBV serologies, while the recipient was positive for EBV IgG Antibodies only. She was managed on chronic immunosuppression with a combination of azathioprine and prednisone.\nThe patient presented initially after an exacerbation of chronic lower back pain following a non-traumatic injury while dancing. Radiographs and MRI of the lumbar spine were performed as part of the initial work-up. Radiographs were negative for acute injury. MRI of her L-spine incompletely captured irregular marrow signal at her left ischium and right sacral ala.

He had no pathological antecedents and did not present any history of past surgery or trauma. He was unable to recall the exact mechanism of the injury. An initial clinical examination found that he was hemodynamically stable. An examination of his right upper limb showed a significant edema and a clear deformation at the dorsal face of his right hand with no signs of nerve compression. A vascular examination was normal. Radiographs of his hand showed a divergent CMC fracture-dislocation of the last four fingers, as well as associated fractures of the head of the second and the base of the fifth metacarpals. The last three metacarpals had palmar displacement while the second metacarpal was dislocated posteriorly (Fig. ). He was immediately admitted to our operating room and underwent open reduction with dorsal approach under aseptic precautions. Two longitudinal incisions were made in the second and fourth web space addressing adjacent respective joints. CMC joint and fractures were exposed and reduction was visually achieved using external maneuvers (traction in the axis of each finger with pressure on the base of the luxated metacarpal) followed by an axial pinning of the second, third, and fifth CMC joints under fluoroscopic control (Fig. ). Additional plastered immobilization by an intrinsic plus splint was applied for 6 weeks. Our patient underwent physiotherapy and assisted active exercises to increase strength of grip. Pins removal was done at the eighth week; approximately 10 weeks after removal of the cast, he returned to work. Clinical and radiologic examination at the 24-month follow-up visit showed no recurrence of the dislocation or arthritic phenomena.

She had a background of primary lung adenocarcinoma, for which she had completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy 5 months ago. Surgery was abandoned after repeat staging PET/CT scan revealed sacral metastases. Her other medical comorbidities included thalassaemia, osteoporosis, and previous transient ischaemic attack. Her surgical history included an abdominal hysterectomy which was complicated by rectal injury requiring a Hartmann's procedure that was subsequently reversed. Her regular medications were erlotinib 150 mg daily, Asasantin SR, and alendronate. On examination, she had a low grade tachycardia of 90 bpm and blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg. Her abdomen was grossly distended and peritonitic with a palpable hernia containing bowel in the left lower quadrant. Urgent abdominal CT (computed tomography) was performed, which indicated a severe large bowel obstruction secondary to herniation of transverse colon into an incisional hernia at the previous colostomy reversal site (). The proximal large bowel was dilated up to 54 mm and the caecum was dilated up to 93 mm in maximum diameter (). Distal small bowel loops were also prominent. Given the CT findings of a markedly dilated caecum with clinical features of peritonism the risk of caecal perforation was extremely high. Therefore, an urgent needle decompression of the caecum was performed in the emergency department. Using sagittal and axial CT images, the vertical distance from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and the anterior abdominal wall skin to the caecum was measured ().

The patient underwent surgical resection of the primary and adjuvant therapy (4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin/vinorelbine). Two years after the resection of the tumor, the patient developed distant metastatic disease (Fig. ) and was eventually biopsied at the right iliac bone for pathological evaluation and genetic testing of druggable targets. We employed combined testing for fusions and mutations as described previously [], and detected fusion of EML4 exon 13 with ALK exon 20, which is one of the most common fusion variants in lung adenocarcinomas (variant 1) []. Consistent with this result, we neither detected mutated EGFR or KRAS, or fusions involving ROS or RET. In parallel, IHC staining for ALK was applied. While massive parallel sequencing showed 4163 fusion reads indicating expression of the fusion gene (Fig. ) IHC staining was largely negative except for very few intermingled cells that may show exceedingly faint ALK expression at high magnification, which cannot be reliably subtracted from background signal in routine diagnostics (Fig. , ). Repeated IHC staining for ALK yielded similar results (data not shown) and orthogonal FISH analysis showed impaired hybridization with only very few cells exhibiting probe signals including splits at low intensity (Fig. ). As the current guidelines require that at least 15% of the tumor cells show split (or single red) signals [, ], FISH data of the biopsy specimen were inconclusive and thus non-informative. HE-stained slides suggested crush and thermal artifacts that are known to influence IHC performance. These divergent findings prompted us to perform additional molecular profiling of the primary tumor (Fig. ) that was resected two years earlier. In keeping with the results observed in the biopsy specimen, we detected the very same gene fusion at even higher read counts (9639 fusion reads; Fig. ).",

He does not smoke tobacco; he has a history of arterial hypertension grade I to II and coronary heart disease. His mother died from myocardial infarction due to occlusive coronary artery disease. He was diagnosed as having CML in 2006. The treatment was initially started with imatinib (Glivec, Novartis) 400 mg administered orally once daily. Imatinib 400 to 800 mg per day was taken for 53 months. He lost major molecular response (MMR) and imatinib therapy was replaced with dasatinib 100 mg orally administered once daily and after 6 months MMR was achieved. He was also using torasemide 20 mg orally administered once daily and metoprolol succinate 50 mg orally administered once daily. In April 2015 he developed increasing dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and peripheral edema. He consulted his family physician, and a chest X-ray was done, confirming pleural effusion. On admission his heart rate was 97 beats per minute and blood pressure was 143/90 mmHg. Fever was not present. He presented with peripheral edema and diminished breath sounds. Pleural friction rub was present. Deformity of the spine accompanied by lower back pain was noted during neurological check-up. The pleural fluid was drawn out several times via thoracentesis (1.5 to 2 liters of exudate in total) but cytological analysis excluded malignancy, a GeneXpert\u00ae tuberculosis test of a bronchial smear was also negative, therefore, the pleural effusion was suspected to be caused by congestive heart failure. A complete blood count was normal, but his creatinine levels were elevated (Tables and ). Over the course of the next 4 months his general condition deteriorated as he experienced multiple recurrences of pleural effusion requiring drainage of the built-up fluid (Table ).

Twelve years later, at age 37, she was diagnosed with stage IIA carcinoma of the left breast. She presented for bilateral mastectomies with immediate autologous tissue reconstruction. She had completed four cycles of neoadjuvant dose-dense adriamycin and cytoxan chemotherapy 2 months previously. Following her chemotherapy, her platelet counts ranged from 332 to 424 K/cmm. Her medical history was significant for obesity (BMI 40.4) and asthma. The patient had smoked 1 pack per day for 15 years, but had discontinued that practice during her chemotherapy treatment.\nIn 2006, she underwent a bilateral mastectomy with immediate bilateral ipsilateral single pedicle transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap reconstruction. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis was provided intraoperatively and during her hospital stay via sequential compression devices (SCD). Although not a routine component of our customary reconstructions, fluorescein was utilized intraoperatively to confirm the viability of the mastectomy flaps prior to final insetting of the TRAM flaps. The patient did well during the procedure and suffered no intraoperative or postoperative hypotensive episodes. On postoperative day 1, her wounds looked well and her platelet count was 374 K/cmm. She was discharged on postoperative day 4 with slight epidermolysis in the abdominal flap just cephalad to the mid-line sutures. Over the next 2 weeks, both the mastectomy and abdominal skin flaps underwent progressive necrosis as the platelet count rose to 1390 K/cmm. The patient's hematologist/oncologist was consulted at this point. The consultant's opinion was that this was a reactive phenomenon and required no additional testing or intervention.

    "original_text": "We present a case of a 51 year-old white female with a 5-year history of ulcerative colitis. She has been taking mesalamine 1.2 gram (2 tablets two times a day) for 1 year with no complications that were reported. No history of allergies and no history of smoking or alcohol abuse were present. Past medical history was only remarkable for ulcerative colitis and there was no significant past surgical or family history. Around March 2018, she started having increased watery diarrhea with occasional blood (10-12 bowel movements per day from a baseline of 1-2 bowel movements per day) as well as cramping abdominal pain. She went to see her gastroenterologist in clinic. On physical examination, she had diffuse tenderness to palpation of her abdomen. Stool studies including stool cultures, stool ova, and parasites were sent which were negative. ESR and CRP levels were elevated. Therefore, she was thought to be in a moderate to severe ulcerative colitis flare based on the current criteria and was prescribed budesonide multimatrix (MMX) 9 mg once daily.

One year before presentation, she underwent a trochlear osteotomy of the left knee for recurrent patellofemoral instability with signs of trochlear dysplasia (Figure ). There was no patella alta. Conservative treatment with physical therapy, activity modification, and taping had failed to relieve the patellofemoral instability. There was no history of any previous surgical procedures or trauma. In reviewing the operative records no complications during or directly after trochlear osteotomy were noted. Trochlear osteotomy was performed through a lateral parapatellar approach with the knee in full extension, allowing the patella to be retracted medially. After incomplete subchondral osteotomy of the anterior aspect of the lateral condyle with curved osteotomes, the articular cartilage of the anterior aspect of the lateral condyle was elevated in one piece to a height of 8 mm. Height was maintained by inserting a wedge shaped bone graft from the iliac crest and osteosynthesis with 2 screws. Patellofemoral stability was assessed through a full range of motion, and considered adequate. The synovial lining and lateral retinaculum were closed. No additional medial soft tissue surgery was performed. Direct postoperative partial weight bearing was advised with crutches, after 6 weeks full weight bearing was allowed.\nFive months later she still had persistent pain on the anterior aspect of the left knee without a history of trauma or patellar dislocation since the procedure. Radiographic examination demonstrated nonunion of the trochlear osteotomy with dislocation of subchondral bone resulting in an irregular patellofemoral joint (Figure ). Arthroscopy was performed with removal of the screws.

The pain began when he washed his face after getting out of bed in the morning. The patient felt a tightening pain in the chest, through the back, and in the area between both the scapulae. The patient was taking aspirin 100 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, and metformin 500 mg for hypertension and diabetes. He visited the hospital one year prior for a similar pain and underwent a stent insertion in the left anterior descending coronary artery for ST elevation myocardial infarction. When the patient visited the hospital this time, the pain was rated as an 8 out of 10 and continued even after sublingual administration of the patients own nitroglycerin. Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 166/88 mmHg; pulse rate, 72 beats/min; respiratory rate, 15 breaths/min; and body temperature, 36.7\u00b0C. Sinus rhythm and first-degree atrioventricular block were observed on electrocardiography. Bedside echocardiography showed similar results with the previous one, except for a decrease in ejection fraction to 38%. Laboratory data including hemoglobin, platelet count, white blood cell, blood chemistry, and cardiac enzyme test as well as urinalysis were normal. Thirty minutes after the hospital admission, the chest pain was relieved; however, the pain through the scapula remained. Therefore, aortic dissection was suspected and an aortic dissection computed tomography was obtained. The computed tomography showed multiple dissections at an infrarenal level. Since the patient had slipped and fallen 3 days prior, spinal radiography was performed and revealed an acute compression fracture at T8. Four hours later, he complained of numbness in the entire left leg below the knee.

    "original_text": "A 61-year old man presented with a left upper quadrant abdominal mass after experiencing several intermittent episodes of nausea, vague abdominal discomfort, and mild acid reflux. He also reported a nine kilogram weight loss over the prior six to eight months. Physical examination revealed a large mass in his upper abdomen.\nAbdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 21 \u00d7 12 cm heterogeneous mass occupying his mid and left upper quadrants (Figure ). Based on its location and imaging characteristics, the mass was hypothesized to be a GIST. The differential also included lymphoma, retroperitoneal sarcoma, and, less likely, a pancreatic neoplasm. To establish the diagnosis, an endoscopic ultrasound was performed and a core biopsy of the mass was obtained. The pathology of the core biopsy classified the mass as a spindle cell neoplasm that stained positive for CD117, consistent with a GIST.\nGiven the size and location of the lesion at the time of initial evaluation, resection of the mass would likely have necessitated a multi-visceral resection. Based on recent reports of effective preoperative imatinib therapy, a trial of neoadjuvant imatinib was felt to be the optimal treatment strategy to down-stage the tumor and minimize the extent of resection [].\nThe patient was treated with imatinib and tolerated the therapy well, with the exception of developing mild periorbital edema, the most commonly reported side effect of imatinib [].

Her medical history and family history were non-contributory. No abnormality detected on extraoral examination and intraoral examination revealed a single growing exophytic lesion which was oval-shaped pedunculated with stalk, non-tender, reddish in color with smooth surface, which was measuring approximately 1.5 \u00d7 1 cm in upper right back tooth region, and it was attached to the alveolar mucosa in-between the right primary molars with no signs of lymph node enlargement ( and ).\nThese findings were confirmed by palpation of the lesion. Furthermore, there were no caries and absence of mobility of the involved teeth.\nOral hygiene status was fair. The blood picture showed that all the values are within the normal level.
