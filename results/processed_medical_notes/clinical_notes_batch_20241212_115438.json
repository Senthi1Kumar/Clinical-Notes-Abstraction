Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a pancreatic duct dilated throughout its course to a maximum size of 8 mm without a discrete pancreatic mass in the head of the pancreas.

    "original_text": "A 56 year-old female was transported to the emergency department by EMS after physically threatening her husband with a knife. According to the patient, she experienced altered sensorium for one week prior to presentation, primarily resulting in suicidal and homicidal command hallucinations instructing her to overdose on NSAIDs and kill her husband. She denied any headaches, vertigo, fevers, head trauma, urinary symptoms, or use of illicit substances. There was no history of psychosis, schizophrenia, mania, or depression and a review of her medication list for any potential hallucinogenic agents did not indicate a pharmacologic etiology. Her past medical history was comprised of two prior strokes, the most recent being two years ago that involved the right frontal lobe. MRI of the brain at the time also showed evidence of an old right parietal lobe infarct. An echocardiogram during that hospitalization revealed a severely decreased left ventricular function and the patient was initiated on warfarin for anticoagulation. Since the two prior cerebral infarcts, the patient and her husband denied noting any behavioral changes, cognitive impairment, or any focal neurologic deficits. On presentation, she appeared disheveled and exhibited a flat affect with minimal verbalization. Physical examination revealed only a left hemianopia without hemiplegia. All cranial nerves were evaluated as well as gait, cerebellar function, and proprioception, which were all found to be normal. The patient was alert and oriented with intact mentation.\nShe was initially admitted to the psychiatric unit for further evaluation where the patient participated in daily activities and reported no symptoms. Given the acute onset of her symptoms, laboratory studies and brain images were obtained in order to rule out an organic etiology. A complete blood count was normal and a basic metabolic panel revealed normal electrolytes and renal function.

Her family history included a brother with a diagnosis of sarcoma and two other non-first-degree relatives with primary brain malignancies.\nFine needle aspiration confirmed the diagnosis of medullary thyroid cancer, and in July 2002, she underwent total thyroidectomy with left-sided modified radical neck dissection and central compartment clearance.

In order to maximise local disease control, she received adjuvant radical radiotherapy delivering 60 Gy to the thyroid bed.\nTwo years after completion of treatment, in February 2004, follow-up repeat imaging reported a recurrent nodule at level 4 of her neck. Subsequent resection confirmed this to be recurrent medullary thyroid cancer with no evidence of distant spread at the time. She continued to be monitored at the oncology clinic and remained disease-free until four years later, in May 2008, when computer tomography (CT) imaging revealed new pulmonary parenchymal metastases.

The patient was diagnosed as a case of incomplete abortion in another hospital, where she was given one dose of misoprostol and passed the tissue (the histopathology was not documented). The patient had a follow-up due to her persistent vaginal bleeding and was found to have a low hemoglobin level, for which she was given a blood transfusion. Ultrasound was done twice before presentation to our hospital. The first ultrasound showed a bulky uterus with an endometrial thickness of 18 mm, no intrauterine tissue, and normal adnexa. The second ultrasound showed a bulky uterus with an endometrial thickness of 15 mm, well defined cystic lesion measuring 5 mm inside the uterine cavity, which appears as a gestational sac of the retained product of conception.\nThe patient presented to our clinic six months later with continuous heavy vaginal bleeding with passage of clot. She denies any passage of tissue or abdominal pain. She had symptoms of anemia but no symptoms of infection. Her examination was unremarkable, apart from mild vaginal bleeding. Her pregnancy human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was negative. Endometrial biopsy was done to prove the presence of trophoblastic tissue. The endometrial biopsy showed benign weakly proliferative endometrium with focally embedded necrotic chorionic villi with no hyperplasia or dysplasia identified.\nUltrasound in our hospital showed an endometrial thickness of 0.4 cm. There was an endometrial polyp 1.5x2.0 cm with a large single feeding artery. Minimal free fluids in the pouch of Douglas were noted.

    "original_text": "A previously fit and well 38-year-old man was presented to the emergency department with immediate extreme pain in the left arm after twisting it at home that day. Plain radiographs of the left upper limb showed a fracture of the left proximal humerus associated with a lytic lesion (Fig. ).\nAn urgent staging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left humerus demonstrated a fairly well-defined destructive lesion of proximal left humerus, which measured ~6 cm craniocaudally (Fig. ). Both the cortex and the marrow were diffusely infiltrated and there was a small extra-osseous tumour mass anteriorly. Computed tomography (CT) scan of thorax/abdomen/pelvis with contrast could not identify a clear primary source of malignancy but it showed an enlarged right lobe thyroid gland with retrosternal extension (Fig. ).\nThe thyroid lobe was investigated 6 years before where a multi-nodular goitre (MNG) with a dominant solitary nodule on the right thyroid lobe was discovered. Ultrasound did not show any suspicious characteristics. A fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) specimen of the solitary nodule was reported as a Thy2 with features consistent with a simple nodule. The investigations were arranged by the patient's general medical practitioner who reassured the patient without the input of secondary services.\nFollowing the finding of the CT scan, the patient was referred to the local ENT department, where ultrasound of the neck and core biopsy of the thyroid nodule was conducted.

    "original_text": "A 31-yr-old female visited our department in October 2002. She had a history of endotracheal intubation for a week to maintain her airway after an inhalation burn, and she then developed dyspnea after the treatment. Prior to the inhalation injury, she had no family history of disease or any notable medical conditions. On physical examination, the mobility of both vocal folds was found to be intact; however, we observed upper tracheal stenosis. The patient's airway was severely compromised with less than 30% of the normal function due to the stenosis. A neck computed tomography (CT) scan showed a tracheal stenosis lesion around the 6th cervical spinal level. The narrowest diameter of the lesional trachea was about 0.7 cm and the lesion length was about 3cm. Slight enhancement was also visible on the stenotic lesion, which most likely due to granulation tissue. We performed bronchoscopy and balloon dilatation procedures. The 10 mm balloon dilatation was initially successful, but further procedures could not be performed because of the patient's unstable vital signs. We decided to perform a resection with end-to-end anastomosis in November 2002.

During a control visit in January 2016, the patient had reported irritating symptoms of eye discomfort, described as burning, itchiness, and feeling sand, mainly in her right eye (RE), over the last six months. The situation had been managed with the use of several types of tear substitutes, none of them successful in symptom relief. Symptoms were scored in the RE as OSDI of 74 out of 100 and a VAS score of pain of 85 mm out of 100. In the left eye (LE) the symptoms were defined by the patients as light and acceptable: OSDI score was 22 out of 100 and VAS 21 mm out of 100. Slit lamp evaluation had not shown epithelial damage, and there were no signs of inflammation, but only a reduced Tear Film Break-Up Time (TFBUT) of 4 seconds in RE and 8 seconds in LE had been recorded. A therapy with hyaluronic acid (HA) based tear substitute to be administered 4 times/day in both eyes was prescribed.\nIn March 2016, the patient was proposed to receive in her RE a treatment with topical CBS, as a compassionate unconventional therapy, with the aim to reduce the pain symptoms for which the previous therapeutic attempts had turned to be unsuccessful.

    "original_text": "A 19-year-old man was referred from general surgery. He was a soccer player and had been playing for several years. He had experienced insidious dull and diffuse pain in his left groin area, which was aggravated during sports activity for a month. The subject assumed his pain originated from an inguinal hernia and went to a surgeon first. However, his abdomen and pelvis CT showed normal posterior inguinal wall contours without any other abnormalities (). A professional radiologist performed an ultrasonography; however, no significant findings were detected. Thinking it was unrelated to hernia, the surgeon referred him to the rehabilitation center.\nWe carried out a detailed physical examination. The insidious onset, gradual worsening with activity and diffuse nature of the groin pain proposed non-traumatic pathology. We asked the patient to identify the areas of pain by shading them on a pain diagram (). On inspection of both groins, there was no definite swelling or sign of injury on either side. Scrotum was normal in size and looked symmetrical. With the patient lying supine, we let him raise his both legs gradually to make an eccentric contraction of the lower abdominal muscles. This action produced unbearable pain to the subject.\nFor further evaluation, we performed an ultrasonography examination. Having the patient lying in supine position, we used a 5-MHz high-frequency transducer and explored both sides of groin and scrotal region. During the initial investigation with the patient in a recumbent position, we failed to find any evidence of pathology; however, we found significant clues through dynamic investigation. We detected an incipient direct bulge of the posterior inguinal wall after the patient contracted his abdominal muscles by raising both his legs to about 30\u00b0 and fully inhaling ().

    "original_text": "A 7-year-old girl presented with a history of breathlessness on exertion and mild exercise intolerance over a period of 2 years. On clinical examination, she was normotensive with normal heart rate. She had a hyperdynamic right ventricular impulse, normal heart sounds, and a soft ejection systolic murmur over the pulmonary area. Echocardiography (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with right axis deviation. Chest radiograph showed a prominent right descending pulmonary artery. Laboratory data were normal. Preoperative ECG evidenced a coronary sinus type of interatrial communication measuring 10 mm \u00d7 16 mm with left to right shunting []. The subcostal view was most useful in defining the interatrial shunting characteristic of this defect. The right-sided heart chambers and the pulmonary artery were marginally dilated. The absence of a left superior vena cava was documented. Intraoperatively, we encountered a pure coronary sinus type of interatrial communication measuring 1.5 cm in size and a normal coronary sinus ostium []. She underwent successful pericardial patch closure of the defect. To avoid atrioventricular block, sutures were placed close to the rims of the defect. The postoperative course was uneventful, and at 1-month follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic.\nUnroofed coronary sinus, an unusual form of interatrial communication, is a rare cardiac anomaly accounting for <1% of lesions associated with interatrial shunting. It is not a true defect of the atrial septum and is an uncommon variety of interatrial communication through the mouth of the coronary sinus.[] Such defects are often difficult to diagnose and may even be overlooked during surgery for complex congenital heart disease.[] In this defect, the coronary sinus forms initially within the left atrioventricular groove.

She was referred to us for identification of effective treatment. At the first visit, she complained of progressive distension of the abdomen and abdominal fullness leading to gradual decrease in body weight without shortness of breath. Her liver function was quite normal; hence, we decided to observe the patient regularly without considering palliative surgery or liver transplantation. Medical treatment with somatostatin analogue was not considered primarily due to the high medical cost as well as the undetermined therapeutic efficacy.\nDuring the outpatient clinic follow-up for 1 year, we recognized that she had barely maintained her ability of function in daily activities due to progressive worsening of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Finally, she complained of shortness of breath even in a resting state. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status worsened from 2 to 3 during observation for 1 year. Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) score also deteriorated from 75 to 44 during observation for 1 year. Physical examination revealed that the liver was prominently bulged out of the abdomen, but leg edema was absent. Liver and kidney functions were still quite normal. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed progressive enlargement of multiple liver cysts with smooth and regular walls (), which was regarded as type III according to Gigot's classification (), grade 4 according to Qian's classification (), and type C according to Schnelldorfer's classification (). Magnetic resonance imaging study revealed water-filled multiple liver and kidney cysts ().\nAfter obtaining consent of the patient on the uncertain effect of fenestration treatment as well as high risk of disease recurrence, the patient underwent surgical fenestration treatment.

Intravenous contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed in January 2016 raised the possibility of cirrhosis; however this was not biopsy-proven.

Concern for hepatic encephalopathy was raised when she had her first episode of confusion in December 2016. At that time CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated strong radiographic suspicion for cirrhosis together with prominent vessels surrounding the urinary diversion site suspicious for portal hypertension. Despite not having a tissue biopsy, she was diagnosed clinically with cryptogenic cirrhosis in May 2017 during a hospitalization for fatigue, anasarca, and altered mental status. An upper endoscopy performed in June 2017 demonstrated portal hypertensive gastropathy but no esophageal varices.\nUpon presentation to the Emergency Department in July 2017 she had significant hemorrhage from her stoma resulting in hemodynamic instability.

Her mother stated that during these episodes she was fully conscious, but half of her body was paralyzed, and she had difficulty in speaking. The paralysis was characterized by recurrent episodes of transient hemiplegia alternating in laterality or affecting both sides simultaneously. There was no associated or preceding vomiting, fever, seizures, loss of consciousness, or headache. The episodes lasted from few hours to few days and recurred every 10\u201330 days without leaving any residual deficit. The paralysis disappeared after a good sleep and reappeared within half an hour after awakening. She was dysarthric when the episode was unilateral and mute when it was bilateral. The child became ataxic with deterioration of cognitive and intellectual functions after seven years of disease onset. She also lagged developmentally behind her chronological age. She was a product of a nonconsanguineous marriage at 39 weeks of gestation following a spontaneous vaginal delivery. The pregnancy and neonatal period were uneventful. There was no family history of a similar disease including migraine. Her neuroimaging was normal on several occasions. At the age of 14, she developed sudden onset of a partial motor seizure of the face with secondary generalization and status epilepticus. The seizures were difficult to control, lasted several hours, and necessitated an admission to the intensive care unit with intubation and mechanical ventilation. The final diagnosis was AHC with status epilepticus and catastrophic cortical necrosis due to severe hypoxic brain insult. is showing her magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) few months following discharge from the hospital on multiple antiepileptic drugs. She was mute, quadriparetic, and psychotic.

The fracture was initially treated in another institution by reduction and percutaneous pinning using Iselin\u2019s technique. Three weeks later, the patient developed an inflammatory reaction around the entry point of the distal pin, at the second metacarpal. A purulent discharge led to early removal of the distal pin. The isolated organism was a methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Regular topical treatment was given, and antibiotic therapy was initiated for five weeks based on laboratory results. Bone healing of the Bennett fracture was obtained in the sixth week after the accident, and the proximal pin was removed.\nThree months later, the patient was referred to us by his doctor because of persistent pain at the second right metacarpal, accompanied by attacks of inflammation and intermittent purulent discharge. Standard hand X-ray demonstrated the presence of an area of osteolysis surrounded by osteocondensation at the second metacarpal, indicating a focus of osteomyelitis along the path of the distal pin (). An MRI was performed on the hand. It confirmed the diagnosis, revealing the extent of the focus of osteomyelitis, the path of the fistula, and the inflammatory extension into neighboring soft tissues ().\nSurgical treatment called for the induced membrane technique.\nThe first stage included a segmental resection of the area of osteomyelitis through a dorsal approach with excision of the reformed tissue while preserving the index finger extensor tendon.\nThe second metacarpal was stabilized with a mini external fixator, and a cement spacer was interposed ().\nAntibiotic therapy was initiated for six weeks based on sensitivity testing.

    "original_text": "A 31-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presented to our emergency department complaining of a constant headache for the previous 4 days. The headache had begun approximately 6 h after receiving epidural anesthesia for labor. The documentation from the anesthesia service that day reported the use of a 17-gauge Touhy needle to enter the subdural space in the lower lumbar spine and the placement of a 19-gauge epidural catheter. No complications were reported with the procedure, and specifically, there was no mention of inadvertent dural puncture. The patient had an unremarkable delivery of a healthy infant at 38-weeks gestation later that day.\nThe patient described the headache as constant and occipital with some radiation to the frontal area. The headache was worse when upright and partially relieved in the supine position. She reported taking acetaminophen/butalbital/caffeine and ibuprofen with little relief. She had no associated vomiting, fever, or changes in her hearing or vision. She denied any photophobia or focal weakness or numbness. She was afebrile on physical exam, with pulse and blood pressure within the normal range. Her exam was notable for a normal neurologic exam including cranial nerves and no neck stiffness. The patient was tentatively diagnosed with a PDPH. After evaluation by the anesthesia service, she was admitted for pain control and possible placement of an epidural blood patch the next day. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her head was obtained prior to admission to evaluate for other possible causes of the headache (Fig. ). This CT identified bilateral parafalcine subdural hematomas measuring 7 mm in thickness on the left and 3 mm thickness on the right. There was no associated mass effect.\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and started on levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis.

There was no other symptom and his general physical examinations were completely normal. Physical examination showed a 35 \u00d7 30 mm mass in left parotid gland that is partially mobile and painless and covered with normal skin. The facial nerve functions were normal on clinical evaluation. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) result was nondiagnostic and complete blood count was normal.\nIn magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) a homogeneous 30 \u00d7 20 mm lesion was detected in superficial and deep lobes of left parotid gland spreading to anterior of masseter muscle which is hypointense in T1A sections and hyperintense in T2A sections and with intense contrast enhancement (Figures and ).\nA parotidectomy was planned for the patient. During the operation firstly the main trunk of facial nerve was identified. The main part of the tumor was a 20 \u00d7 20 mm reddish, bright lesion with a thin capsule around the temporofacial branch of facial nerve anterosuperior to main trunk. The lesion was encircling the temporofacial branch of the facial nerve and advancing forward through the peripheral branches. At this point we could not follow the nerve, so we referred to frozen section. The result was reported as \u201cmesenchymal lesion.\u201d When we stimulated the lesion with the nerve stimulator we got an answer from the muscles that were innervated by that branch and because of the frozen section result we thought that the lesion might be a tumor of the nerve itself.

    "cleaned_text": "a 55-year-old male patient complaining of a painless mass in the left preauricular area that had been present for 3 months was admitted to our clinic. there was no other symptom and his general physical examinations were completely normal. physical examination showed a 35 \u00d7 30 mm mass in left parotid gland that is partially mobile and painless and covered with normal skin. the facial nerve functions were normal on clinical evaluation. fine-needle aspiration cytology (fnac) result was nondiagnostic and complete blood count was normal.\nin magnetic resonance imaging (mri) a homogeneous 30 \u00d7 20 mm lesion was detected in superficial and deep lobes of left parotid gland spreading to anterior of masseter muscle which is hypointense in t1a sections and hyperintense in t2a sections and with intense contrast enhancement (figures and ).\na parotidectomy was planned for the patient. during the operation firstly the main trunk of facial nerve was identified. the main part of the tumor was a 20 \u00d7 20 mm reddish, bright lesion with a thin capsule around the temporofacial branch of facial nerve anterosuperior to main trunk. the lesion was encircling the temporofacial branch of the facial nerve and advancing forward through the peripheral branches. at this point we could not follow the nerve, so we referred to frozen section. the result was reported as \"mesenchymal lesion.\" when we stimulated the lesion with the nerve stimulator we got an answer from the muscles that were innervated by that branch and because of the frozen section result we thought that the lesion might be a tumor of the nerve itself. in this occasion we cut the temporofacial branch of the nerve from the main trunk and excised the tumor totally with branches (zygomatic, temporal, and buccal branches) surrounding the mass medially (figures , , and ). a weakness was detected in left eyelid postoperatively. the patient was able to close his eye with effort so no additional intervention was considered afterwards. the weak",

She underwent total meniscectomy for the lateral meniscus at another hospital 8 years ago. Physical examination showed mild effusion, no joint line tenderness, and negative McMurray test. Her knee was stable and showed a full range of motion. Radiographs and MRI showed a displaced, large osteochondritis dissecans in the lateral femoral condyle. Autogenous osteochondral grafting using multiple plugs was performed immediately, and lateral meniscal transplantation was undertaken 5 years after the osteochondral grafting.\nFor meniscal transplantation, the patient was positioned supine on the operating table and the right knee was placed in the figure-of-4 position. The size of the meniscal allograft was measured using the radiographic method proposed by Pollard et al. After thawing the lateral meniscal allograft, redundant soft tissues of the allograft were excised carefully and a 9-mm bony bridge connecting the anterior and posterior horns of the lateral meniscal allograft was prepared. A 1-mm wire was bent along the medial border of the bony bridge and the periphery of the lateral meniscal allograft (). The prepared wire was introduced through the lateral mini-arthrotomy while the patellar tendon was retracted medially. The straight part of the wire was placed along the lateral tibial spine (). However, some portion of the round part of the wire was extruded from the anterolateral margin of the lateral tibial plateau. The straight part of the wire was moved more medially and rotated internally. The round part of the wire was placed accurately along the anterolateral margin of the lateral tibial plateau ().

The patient was never smoker, without family history of cancer and without comorbidity. The cytological diagnosis was made using a CT-guided fine needle aspiration of the primary tumor and revealed an adenocarcinoma of the lung (TTF1+, CK7+) with the EGFR ex19del mutation. A PET-CT demonstrated the presence of liver and bone metastases and a nodule in the right breast, confirmed as a metastasis by fine needle aspiration. The patient received zoledronic acid 4 mg every 28 days and gefitinib 250 mg daily since November 2012 obtaining a partial response (PR). In August 2013, a disease progression (PD) was documented, with an increase in size of the primary tumor and size and number of liver metastases. A brain MRI revealed the presence of two cortical nodules, which were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy. The patient was enrolled in the IMPRESS trial and received 6 cycles of cisplatin and pemetrexed plus gefitinib obtaining again a PR that lasted until June 2014. Thereafter, a new lung metastasis appeared in the superior lobe of the left lung and the mammary nodule increased in dimensions. From June 2014 to December 2014 the patient received erlotinib 150 mg daily obtaining an initial stabilization of the disease (SD); however, within 6 months, she experienced again a PD with the increase of the mammary nodule and the appearance of a new bone metastasis in the sacrum.

Intravenous contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed in January 2016 raised the possibility of cirrhosis; however this was not biopsy-proven.

The mass had been noted by the patient 8 years ago and had progressively grown in size. A computed tomography (CT) of the neck was obtained, which demonstrated a 3.5 \u00d7 2.3 \u00d7 4.6 cm lesion deep to the left sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle in addition to a smaller 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1.8 cm left posterior neck-enhancing mass. A fine needle aspiration (FNA) had been performed 2 years prior at an outside hospital with pathology indicating a low-grade spindle cell proliferation. She was thus referred to our institution for further evaluation. At the time of initial presentation to our group, the patient had noted dysphagia, left ear ache and tinnitus, and neck pain localized to the two masses. A positron emission tomography (PET) CT was performed, which demonstrated increased fluoro-2-deoxy-\nd\n-glucose uptake in the high cervical mass and, to a lesser degree, in the mass located within the posterior triangle of the neck (\n). The outside tissue blocks were reviewed at our institution and felt to be consistent with a peripheral nerve sheath tumor compatible with schwannoma from both lesions. Because of the patient's ongoing symptoms and because malignancy could not be completely excluded based on the results of the prior FNA, the decision was made to proceed with surgical excision of both lesions. Prior to proceeding, a magnetic resonance neurogram was obtained (\n). Tractography demonstrated that the two lesions appeared to originate from the spinal accessory nerve and that apparent diffusion coefficient values were elevated in both masses, supporting the diagnosis of a less aggressive tumor (\n).\nThe patient was taken to the operating room for surgical resection.

    "cleaned_text": "this case is of a 55-year-old female who initially presented with a palpable left neck mass. the mass had been noted by the patient 8 years ago and had progressively grown in size. a computed tomography (ct) of the neck was obtained, which demonstrated a 3.5 \u00d7 2.3 \u00d7 4.6 cm lesion deep to the left sternocleidomastoid (scm) muscle in addition to a smaller 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1.8 cm left posterior neck-enhancing mass. a fine needle aspiration (fna) had been performed 2 years prior at an outside hospital with pathology indicating a low-grade spindle cell proliferation. she was thus referred to our institution for further evaluation. at the time of initial presentation to our group, the patient had noted dysphagia, left ear ache and tinnitus, and neck pain localized to the two masses. a positron emission tomography (pet) ct was performed, which demonstrated increased fluoro-2-deoxy-\nd\n-glucose uptake in the high cervical mass and, to a lesser degree, in the mass located within the posterior triangle of the neck (\n). the outside tissue blocks were reviewed at our institution and felt to be consistent with a peripheral nerve sheath tumor compatible with schwannoma from both lesions. because of the patient's ongoing symptoms and because malignancy could not be completely excluded based on the results of the prior fna, the decision was made to proceed with surgical excision of both lesions. prior to proceeding, a magnetic resonance neurogram was obtained (\n). tractography demonstrated that the two lesions appeared to originate from the spinal accessory nerve and that apparent diffusion coefficient values were elevated in both masses, supporting the diagnosis of a less aggressive tumor (\n).\nthe patient was taken to the operating room for surgical resection. the patient was positioned with her head turned slightly to the right with the neck extended (\n). the smaller lesion was approached first through the posterior triangle of the neck. stimulation mapping of the tumor was conducted.",

There was no evidence of fluctuating neurological signs. His higher mental functions were intact throughout his hospital admission. The electrocardiogram confirmed sinus rhythm at 60 beats per minute. The chest X-ray was unremarkable.\nHe was admitted and underwent an urgent computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain. The initial CT (Figure ) was performed 6 hours after the collapse. The hospital had access to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner once a week and the next available slot was 6 days later. During the weekend following admission he was transferred to the stroke unit and reviewed twice daily. His neurological deficits deteriorated stepwise with 2/5 power in his right arm and leg at 36 hours progressing to 0/5 with mild slurring of speech around 72 hours post admission on Monday. There were no features suggestive of raised intracranial pressure. He had no altered sensorium. His case was discussed with the radiologist and the medical physician on call during the weekend. It was felt there was no need for an urgent repeat scan and all agreed the progression was likely to be due to the stroke. The radiologist reviewed the initial scan over the weekend and had no concerns about the calcified area, which was judged less likely to be a bleed, although this could not be ruled out.

A huge abdominal mass was palpated, and she was referred to the gynecology department to search for a tumor of uterine origin. She was premenopausal and had no significant past medical history. Physical findings revealed a large elastic hard mass extending from the xiphoid to the pubic bone. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed a huge tumor on the uterine corpus, and a number of dilated vessels were observed between the tumor and the myometrium. Therefore, the tumor was suspected to derive from the uterus. The tumor showed an uneven signal on T2-weighted sagittal section (), and the enhanced MRI study showed that the tumor edge but not the center was enhanced (). As such, necrosis was suspected to have occurred in the center of the tumor. Uterine sarcoma was primarily suspected due to the large size, degeneration, and necrosis on MRI imaging. Computed tomography (CT) examination showed no lymph node swelling or distant metastasis. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed anemia (hemoglobin level, 5.6g/dl). We transfused 18 units of RCC before surgery. CT examination and ultrasonography on lower extremities indicated an absence of thrombosis. Preoperative serum levels of CEA, CA 19-9, CA 125, and LDH were within normal limits. A biopsy of the endometrium was not collected as the sounding examination of the endometrium was unsuccessful due to a deviated uterine cervix. At this point, preoperatively, we suspected the tumor was a leiomyosarcoma or leiomyoma with degeneration.\nThe patient underwent laparotomy, where we identified a huge tumor occupying a space from the pelvis to the diaphragm.
