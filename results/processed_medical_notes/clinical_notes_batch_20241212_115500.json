The patient was lying comfortably with no symptoms of respiratory distress or any obvious active bleeding. Vitally the patient was stable. There was slight blood staining of the upper garment with an obvious breach.\nOn examination a 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm entry wound at the left 3rd intercostal space in the mid clavicular line was identified. The chest and abdomen were otherwise unremarkable. Normal vesicular breathing was appreciated on chest auscultation. On palpation the abdomen was soft with no peritoneal signs.\nChest radiograph demonstrated clear lung fields with no indication of injury. The abdominal radiographs (Figures and ) displayed a bullet in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen lateral to spine. The radiographs were otherwise unremarkable for any other abnormality.\nWith this evidence of the bullets entry at 3rd intercostal space laterally to the mid clavicular line and its lodgment in the abdomen just lateral to the spine, the bullets trajectory was estimated to have encountered the left lung, left dome of the diaphragm, stomach, left lobe of the liver, splenic vessels, body of the pancreas and the left kidney. Despite this trajectory, the patient was clinically stable with no signs of either respiratory distress or any other visceral injury.

She stated that earlier in the day she was experiencing a migraine and took her home medication of Treximet 85/500 mg with good relief of her symptoms. The patient stated that she occasionally gets migraines and on occasion uses Treximet to relieve her symptoms, however has not had to take the medication in quite some time. The patient claimed that a few hours after her migraine had resolved she began to experience non-radiating, left sided, substernal chest pressure with associated paresthesia in the lower extremities and some non-descriptive nausea. This prompted her to seek medical attention at a local urgent care facility. She was seen and assessed by a physician and had an ECG performed which demonstrated no significant issues so she was discharged home with an antacid and told to follow up with her primary physician as an outpatient. The patient stated that the chest pain never really dissipated however she went to sleep that night without issues. The next morning, she woke up with continued chest pressure, yet, decreased in quality from the previous day.

She first noticed the swelling eight months ago, and it had gradually progressed in size. The patient reported that the swelling increased in size during menses and was interfering with her daily activities. The associated pain was moderately improved after the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, there were no changes in the overlying skin and she reported no history of bowel or bladder symptoms.\nThe patient underwent a cesarean section two years before the presentation due to fetal distress. Otherwise, she did not have any remarkable past medical history. She was not taking any medications. Her menstrual periods were regular and were not associated with menorrhagia. She did not have any prior history of gynecological conditions.\nPhysical examination revealed a well-defined firm mass to the right of the midline. The mass had a smooth surface but limited mobility after abdominal wall muscle contraction, suggesting an infiltration of the underlying muscular structures. Basic hematological and biochemical laboratory investigations were within normal limits.\nIn light of the aforementioned clinical information, a contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) was planned for further characterization of the abdominal lesion. The CT scan demonstrated a large lobulated mass with heterogenous enhancement, measuring 17 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 10 cm and infiltrating the underlying muscular structure, confirming the diagnosis of abdominal wall endometrioma. The mass lesion was noted to displace adjacent structures.\nThe patient underwent surgical resection of the abdominal wall endometrioma along with a part of the underlying rectus abdominis muscle. It was noted that the endometrioma had risen at the site of the previous scar of the cesarean section. There was minimal blood loss. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged seven days after the operation. The patient was followed up in the outpatient department for six months and reported major satisfaction and complete resolution of her symptoms.",

She did not smoke, but she had a habit of consuming a small amount of alcohol a day. Laparoscopic hysteromyomectomy was performed under general anesthesia for treatment of uterine myoma. In laparoscopic surgery, we took pneumoperitoneum at 15 to 20 mmHg for one hour. Around 2:00 am on post operative day (POD) 4, sudden chest and back pain and bilateral lower limb paralysis appeared. The discharge schedule was canceled because it became impossible for the patient to stand on both sides. The obstetrics and gynecology on-duty doctor then requested our department to perform a closer examination.\nAt the time of the examination, chest and back pain had alleviated, and motor paralysis was also improving, with the patient able to kneel on the right side to an extent. However, she was unable to kneel on the left side and her manual muscle test (MMT) score was 2/5. About 1 hour later, headache appeared and a head CT scan was performed.

The patient was never smoker, without family history of cancer and without comorbidity. The cytological diagnosis was made using a CT-guided fine needle aspiration of the primary tumor and revealed an adenocarcinoma of the lung (TTF1+, CK7+) with the EGFR ex19del mutation. A PET-CT demonstrated the presence of liver and bone metastases and a nodule in the right breast, confirmed as a metastasis by fine needle aspiration. The patient received zoledronic acid 4 mg every 28 days and gefitinib 250 mg daily since November 2012 obtaining a partial response (PR). In August 2013, a disease progression (PD) was documented, with an increase in size of the primary tumor and size and number of liver metastases. A brain MRI revealed the presence of two cortical nodules, which were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy. The patient was enrolled in the IMPRESS trial and received 6 cycles of cisplatin and pemetrexed plus gefitinib obtaining again a PR that lasted until June 2014. Thereafter, a new lung metastasis appeared in the superior lobe of the left lung and the mammary nodule increased in dimensions. From June 2014 to December 2014 the patient received erlotinib 150 mg daily obtaining an initial stabilization of the disease (SD); however, within 6 months, she experienced again a PD with the increase of the mammary nodule and the appearance of a new bone metastasis in the sacrum. In December 2014, EGFR ex19del and T790M mutations were detectable in a new needle biopsy of the primary tumor; only at this time a digital PCR-based method was available for the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).

Physical examination showed swelling and widespread tenderness over the left thigh. He had sustained a direct impact injury on his left thigh over the ground. No open wound and other evidence of associated injuries in the affected extremity were observed. There was no central or peripheral nerve injury. On the radiographs, a transverse fracture of the distal femoral shaft was found (Fig. ) (AO type: 32-A3). Subsequently, an immediate internal fixation was performed with a reamed retrograde locked intramedullary nail after complete pre-anesthetic checkup; the femoral nail was inserted through a split tendinous approach. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\nThe patient was progressively rehabilitated without complications in our hospital for 7 days postoperatively and only bedside activities were instituted in his daily life for 1 month.

He developed pain and progressive limitation of active and passive knee extension causing restriction of activities of daily living. He became accompanied by the Knee group from IOT-HC/FMUSP in December 2008, at that time four years and nine months after arthroplasty. On physical examination the patient had restriction on knee extension with lag of 40 degrees in active extension and 20 degrees in passive extension. The patient only walked with the aid of a walker, with no load on the compromised member. He did not show any ligament instability. Radiographs showed loosening of the tibial component with significant tear of the polyethylene insert. The inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP) were normal and bone scan was not suggestive of an infectious process. In April 2009 the patient underwent revision arthroplasty and allograft extensor mechanism transplant. The graft consisted of quadriceps tendon - patella (full) - patellar tendon - anterior tibial tuberosity (ATT). The graft was obtained from the IOT-HC/FMUSP Tissue Bank, having been previously prepared and frozen, without viable cartilage. The graft placement was based on the lower pole of the patella, which was kept 2.5 cm above the joint line. A pin in the tibia was inserted in the topography of the anterior tuberosity, where the previously molded plug bone allograft (ATT) was fitted under pressure and fixed with a large fragments screw. The articular surface of the patella graft was not replaced for being insensitive; replacement could be an unnecessary source of complications (such as fracture). The quadriceps tendon graft was then sutured to the patient's quadriceps, tensing toward the graft proximal and distal quadriceps, through Kracow technique with high strength nonabsorbable multifilament wire, keeping the knee in full extension.

    "original_text": "A 56 year-old female was transported to the emergency department by EMS after physically threatening her husband with a knife. According to the patient, she experienced altered sensorium for one week prior to presentation, primarily resulting in suicidal and homicidal command hallucinations instructing her to overdose on NSAIDs and kill her husband. She denied any headaches, vertigo, fevers, head trauma, urinary symptoms, or use of illicit substances. There was no history of psychosis, schizophrenia, mania, or depression and a review of her medication list for any potential hallucinogenic agents did not indicate a pharmacologic etiology. Her past medical history was comprised of two prior strokes, the most recent being two years ago that involved the right frontal lobe. MRI of the brain at the time also showed evidence of an old right parietal lobe infarct. An echocardiogram during that hospitalization revealed a severely decreased left ventricular function and the patient was initiated on warfarin for anticoagulation. Since the two prior cerebral infarcts, the patient and her husband denied noting any behavioral changes, cognitive impairment, or any focal neurologic deficits. On presentation, she appeared disheveled and exhibited a flat affect with minimal verbalization. Physical examination revealed only a left hemianopia without hemiplegia. All cranial nerves were evaluated as well as gait, cerebellar function, and proprioception, which were all found to be normal.

In addition, her routine investigations done at a community hospital revealed a hemoglobin value of 10.8 g%, a random blood sugar value of 132 mg%, a blood count value of 10,600/cumm. No abnormality was detected in the routine urine examination. On the basis of investigation reports, she was discharged home on the same day by the primary care physician after the routine examination. In spite of taking the prescribed medication, no clinical improvement occurred and fever could be controlled only intermittently by administration of antipyretics. However, after completion of the prescribed duration of antibiotic therapy, fever remained persistently high in the range of 100\u2013102 \u00b0F. The pregnant state, persistent fever refractory to treatment, discomfort, and resulting anxiety were the main decisive factors, which forced the primary physician to refer the patient to a higher center instead of going for the battery of tests for PUO during the follow-up visit.

    "original_text": "A 76-year old man presented with a four month history of penile pain and erythema to the urology department. Symptom progression over the preceding months included burning with urination and difficulty retracting foreskin. Initial treatment with a two-week course of nystatin-triamcinolone cream was unsuccessful. Physical exam demonstrated a two-centimeter large fungating mass on the ventral surface of the distal shaft, which appeared to originate from the glans. Digital rectal exam revealed an enlarged, firm, and nodular prostate. The remainder of the physical exam was within normal limits. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy, no focal spinal tenderness, and a normal neurological exam without focal or gross motor weakness. Given the suspicious features of the mass for SCC, particularly the fungating and superficial nature, a discussion with the patient was made regarding management options including biopsy for definitive diagnosis versus partial penectomy. The patient opted for surgical treatment and tolerated surgery well. Pathology following treatment demonstrated Gleason 9 prostate cancer. CT scan of the pelvis was performed following penectomy to assess treatment response, and demonstrated a stable sclerotic lesion on the iliac bone with potential sclerosis inferior to this known lesion and no lymphadenopathy. Bone scan at this time demonstrated no definitive evidence of metastatic disease.\nPast medical history is significant for Gleason 9 prostate adenocarcinoma diagnosed two years prior. Workup at the time included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate which demonstrated a Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System (PI-RADS) 5 lesion, mildly enlarged pelvic lymph nodes, and a small sclerotic focus of the left iliac bone. Bone scan did not demonstrate evidence of osseous metastatic disease, and CT scan of the chest was normal.

The chief complaint of the patient was the mass on the right eyelid. She had a proptosis of the right eye and an orbital mass; however, there were no signs of headache, nausea, vomiting, or double vision. The medical history of the patient demonstrated that she had hypertension and coronary artery disease, and had undergone angioplasty. However, she had no history of undergoing radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The result of the brain MRI in May 2015 demonstrated a mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus. A soft tissue with a slightly lobulated surface was observed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The ventricles, subarachnoid space, and brain stem demonstrated normal appearance, and there was no evidence of mass lesion or midline shift. The MRI with and without contrast, performed 2 months later, revealed a tissue measuring 5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1 cm and weighing 12 g in the right orbital mass. The microscopic findings demonstrated a benign lesion composed of a mixture of angiomatous tissue and lobulated fatty tissue connected with skeletal muscle tissue, which was suggestive of hemangioma. The brain computed tomography (CT) findings showed that there were no abnormalities in the brain structure. There was diffused skin and subcutaneous soft tissue edema in the cranial area, which was more pronounced in the radiation therapy site. The ultrasound reviewed an inflammatory soft tissue in the right frontotemporal region progressing to the ear.

Furthermore, the patient diagnosed with many chronic conditions, such as metabolic syndrome, obesity with BMI 33 and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Currently, with an exercise dyspnoea for about 2 years, intensifying in recent weeks, she was hospitalized in the Cardiology Department for further diagnostics. The transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed non dilated left ventricle with a normal systolic ejection fraction of 60%, and no evidence of segmental wall motion abnormalities, severe MR with the prolapse of the A2 segment and systolic restriction of the posterior leaflet. Colour Doppler showed a highly distinctive eccentric turbulent jet directed towards the lateral wall and the base of the left atrium with ERO 0.6cm2 and regurgitant volume of 60 ml.

He did not report any recent history of fever, dyspnea, night sweats, hemoptysis, ear or throat pain, abdominal pain, weight loss or recent alterations in his bladder and bowel habits. There were no known recent contacts with people presenting with infectious diseases, including tuberculosis. He recalled having had a fall and having landed on his left side while playing football 1 week prior to the onset of the symptoms. His family medical history and his past personal medical background was unremarkable except for an episode of acute bronchiolitis and an episode of community-acquired pneumonia that required hospitalization at the age of 2 years. He maintained a regular follow-up in the immunoallergology outpatient clinic due to a history of allergic rhinitis. His vaccine schedule was updated according to the national vaccination programme.\nThe adolescent denied alcohol or smoking habits and recreational drug use.\nOn admission at his first visit to the emergency department, he was afebrile, with no signs of respiratory distress, but with diminished breath sounds on the left side.

In the anamnesis, the patient reported not having any systemic problems, not continuously using any medication, and not being a smoker. A clinical examination confirmed the presence of an excessive exposure of the gingiva in the upper arch of teeth 14 to 24 (). The periodontal examination, which consisted of an analysis of gingival marginal bleeding, bleeding on probing, periodontal probing depth, and gingival margin position using a millimeter probe, confirmed that the periodontal tissues were in a healthy condition. In addition, conical beam tomography with an oral retractor was ordered to evaluate the bone and gingival tissue associated with the upper anterior teeth, and molding and photographs were also ordered.\nThe tomography showed that the bone tissue was at the level of the enamel-cementum junction and that the gingival tissue covered part of the anatomic crown (). Virtual planning was also performed using DSD, which showed the need to increase the size of the clinical crowns for better aesthetics (). With these data, it was shown that the patient suffered from altered passive eruption and, therefore, would need an osteotomy to enlarge the clinical crown. After this diagnosis, a flapless, minimally invasive surgical technique with piezoelectric ultrasound to perform the osteotomy and a mockup to guide the removal of soft tissue was proposed for the patient.\nSurgical planning was performed by DSD with the patient's smile photos and crown measurements using an 80% width to length ratio. After design of the optimal teeth, the distance from the cementum-enamel junction to the top of the bone crest and the position of the gingival margin in relation to the enamel-cementum junction was measured by tomographic analysis ().

    "original_text": "A 57 -year-old female presented with incidental ultrasonic evidence of left upper pole renal mass in Nov. 2001. Further evaluation with abdominal Magnetic Resonance Imaging revealed a mass in the upper pole of the left kidney with radiologic characteristics of renal cell carcinoma (). Left radical nephrectomy was performed sparing the left adrenal gland. The pathology specimen analysis showed a cystic mass 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 cm with yellowish friable tissue. Sections showed malignant epithelial cells, arranged in sheets. The picture was consistent with renal cell carcinoma, Grade II Fuhrman nuclear characteristics, confined to the capsule, neither pelvicalyceal nor vascular invasion was found (pT1bN0M0). Postoperatively she did not receive immunotherapy or chemotherapy. Apart from her hypertension which was well controlled with amlodipine and valsartan, subsequent clinical and radiological follow up showed no local or metastatic recurrence till 5 years after the operation then she stopped her visits. On October 2016 an incidental mass was found in the right adrenal gland during a checkup visit for the status of her right solitary kidney. Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan was done, revealing a well-defined mass with a smooth outline in the right adrenal gland measuring 54 \u00d7 48 \u00d7 39 mm with a central necrosis. The density of the solid component was 38 HU. In dynamic study the solid component showed significant enhancement after intravenous contrast administration ().

Physical examination showed bilateral neck asymmetry, the trachea was deflected to the left, the carotid pulse was normal, approximately 6 \u00d7 5 cm solid masses were felt in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. The tumor mass border was unclear with smooth surface, and the tumor moved up and down with swallowing. The left lobe of the thyroid gland had no palpable mass and the neck had no palpable swollen lymph nodes. Accessory examination of neck color Doppler ultrasound at our hospital showed increase in size of the right lobe of the thyroid gland, which had abnormal shape. The upper right pole of the thyroid gland had an approximately 5.6 \u00d7 6.0 \u00d7 4.2 cm sized mass, with unclear margin, and multiple cystic nodules in the thyroid. The CT of thyroid showed increase in size of the right lobe of the thyroid gland, and an approximately 5.6 \u00d7 6.0 \u00d7 4.2 cm sized mass, the trachea was compressed and deflected to the left, the thyroid cartilage was compressed, deformed and reached the right subglottic region. The right thyroid lump had multiple calcifications, indicative of a tumor (Fig. ). Electronic laryngoscope examination showed ventricular bands thickening, the right ventricular bands compartment showed a rice-like projection, arytenoid region movement was poor (Fig. ). Thyroid function test was 5.07 mIU/L. The patient underwent subtotal thyroidectomy and excisional biopsy of neck mass under general anesthesia.

She was deemed to be well before labour with an uncomplicated pregnancy having walked to the delivery unit that morning. She had a normal blood pressure throughout pregnancy as well as in the postpartum period.\nDuring labour, it was noticed that the patient was becoming increasingly confused but hours later she underwent normal vaginal delivery. She was however noted to be still confused by her husband. Twenty-five minutes after delivery, her first generalised tonic-clonic seizure occurred, lasting about 5 minutes before spontaneously resolving. Despite being given magnesium sulphate for possible eclampsia at that time, she remained confused and had a further seizure within 3 hours. A further infusion of magnesium was administered unsuccessfully, thus the patient was given intravenous anti-convulsants causing a decrease in consciousness requiring subsequent intubation for airway protection. She had a one-off elevated blood pressure of 160/102 during fitting, and at all other times she was normotensive. Her urinalysis showed a trace of protein after delivery. Eclampsia was subsequently thought to be unlikely. At the time of the mother's second fit, the newborn baby also had a seizure. Further information from the partner suggested that the couple normally drank a lot of water between them, with the mother drinking up to 4 litres of water a day. The mother had recently been drinking more than this because of the recent hot weather.

A huge abdominal mass was palpated, and she was referred to the gynecology department to search for a tumor of uterine origin. She was premenopausal and had no significant past medical history. Physical findings revealed a large elastic hard mass extending from the xiphoid to the pubic bone. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed a huge tumor on the uterine corpus, and a number of dilated vessels were observed between the tumor and the myometrium. Therefore, the tumor was suspected to derive from the uterus. The tumor showed an uneven signal on T2-weighted sagittal section (), and the enhanced MRI study showed that the tumor edge but not the center was enhanced (). As such, necrosis was suspected to have occurred in the center of the tumor. Uterine sarcoma was primarily suspected due to the large size, degeneration, and necrosis on MRI imaging. Computed tomography (CT) examination showed no lymph node swelling or distant metastasis. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed anemia (hemoglobin level, 5.6g/dl). We transfused 18 units of RCC before surgery. CT examination and ultrasonography on lower extremities indicated an absence of thrombosis. Preoperative serum levels of CEA, CA 19-9, CA 125, and LDH were within normal limits. A biopsy of the endometrium was not collected as the sounding examination of the endometrium was unsuccessful due to a deviated uterine cervix.

After being on hemodialysis for less than a year, he received a directed related deceased donor kidney transplant from a 21-year-old male first cousin known to have ADPKD and who died from a motor vehicle accident. The donor/recipient human leukocyte antigen mismatch was reported as 3/6. The recipient received induction immunosuppression with corticosteroids (only induction agent available at that time). Ten years later, the recipient underwent a right native nephrectomy followed by a left nephrectomy for significantly enlarged and symptomatic kidneys as well as a significantly enlarged polycystic liver. Over the course of 20 years, the recipient was maintained on cyclosporine and prednisone and enjoyed a stable renal allograft function with a serum creatinine of 1.5 to 1.7 mg/dl without any episodes of rejections or urinary tract infections. His renal allograft function declined rapidly with several episodes of acute kidney injury in the setting of new-onset severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 36% and severe mitral valve regurgitation. He also developed significant hypervolemia and ascites. At that time, his serum creatinine was as high as 3.2 to 4.1 mg/dl in the setting of aggressive use of a combination of thiazide and loop diuretics along with aquapheresis. He was quite symptomatic due to the enlarged cystic liver. In addition, he had significant abdominal fullness and ascites contributed partially by the cardiac failure. The distribution of the cysts in the liver was such that he was not a candidate for aspiration foam sclerotherapy, cyst fenestration, or surgical resection. He was treated conservatively for his heart failure due to the underlying comorbidities, including severe polycystic liver disease. To improve his kidney allograft function, the cyclosporine was switched to sirolimus without improvement of his kidney allograft function. He subsequently died at the age of 64 years from complications related to decompensated heart",

Radiographs confirmed a displaced and malrotated fracture pattern (Figures \u2013) with suspicion of acute on chronic injury.\nUnder general anesthetic, a volar approach to the scaphoid was used to expose the fracture. Direct intraoperative visualization of the fracture site demonstrated central comminution with no signs of healing. There were significant cystic and fibrous changes at the fracture site with sclerotic changes at the proximal pole consistent with fracture nonunion. The nonunion site constituted the central 1/3 of the length of the scaphoid. The fracture nonunion site was debrided until punctuate bleeding was visualized in both proximal and distal poles. This debridement was performed using a combination of curette and burr with copious saline irrigation to minimize the chance of thermal necrosis. Upon completion of debridement it was noted that there were longitudinal fracture lines in the proximal scaphoid pole, as well as a significant bony void secondary to the significant fibrous and sclerotic tissue. Ultimately this was concerning for the potential for propagation of these fracture lines if a headless compression screw was used for fixation.\nAfter debridement of the proximal and distal ends, a corticocancellous iliac crest autograft bone graft strut was harvested using a standard anterior approach to the pelvic brim with the incision centered 2 cm inferior and 2 cm posterior to the anterior superior iliac spine.

She was found to have sensorineural deafness in her left ear. Two weeks later, she developed fever with chills. A chest radiograph revealed infiltrates in her right lung and an elevated ESR. She was treated with oral antibiotics which relieved her symptoms. Then she developed gingival hypertrophy and a CT scan of the paranasal sinuses revealed subcutaneous soft tissue thickening of the right buccal area suggestive of an inflammatory process. She was treated with ibuprofen and felt better. Her past medical history was notable for hypothyroidism for 20 years and she as well was maintained on 50 mcg of thyroxin daily. She had undergone hysterectomy for uterine fibroids 15 years ago. She reported no recent travel history. Of note, she revealed contact with sick animals. She nursed her paralyzed pet dog and also had cats. She was treated with antibiotics yet continued to spike fever and came to our center for comprehensive evaluation. On examination, she appeared weak and ill.

Her medical history was negative until three years before, when she began to complain of left hip pain during walking, movement limitation, and pain at rest. After one year of unsuccessful prior rehabilitative and analgesic treatment, she underwent total left hip replacement. The results of a pre-operative chest X-ray and blood tests were normal; however, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated (94 mm/hour). The post-operative period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged five days after surgery. She remained in good clinical condition until about 16 months after surgery, when she began to feel pain and movement limitation at the prosthetic site. Two months later, a hip computed tomography (CT) scan showed a suspect iliopsoas abscess, which was confirmed by peripheral blood mononuclear cells marked with 99 mTc. Her clinical conditions worsened because of increasing local pain and an irregular mild fever. She was admitted to an orthopedic unit for needle aspiration of the abscess (102 \u00d7 53 mm) under ultrasound guidance. Culture of the needle aspiration and blood cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were performed, and empiric antibiotic therapy was started with intravenous linezolid (600 mg twice a day). Her fever increased, and all cultures were negative. After one week of unsuccessful medical treatment, the surgeon decided to perform surgery to inspect and clean the infected site.\nA pseudocyst containing dense material was found just near the prosthesis. A complete aspiration with culture of dense and cloudy liquid, including biopsies of the wall of the cyst and the surrounding tissue, was performed. Intravenous antibiotic therapy with 400 mg of teicoplanin, 160 mg of gentamicin, and 800 mg of ciprofloxacin was started.

On local examination, there was no active bleeding.\nPatient was hospitalized. For control of blood pressure, she was started on oral methyldopa 250 mg thrice a day and labetalol 100 mg thrice a day. She was kept on conservative management and was evaluated further for heart disease and diabetes. Echocardiography showed trace tricuspid regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery hypertension with normal left ventricular function. No active intervention was advised by the cardiologist. She was also diagnosed as gestational diabetes mellitus controlled on diabetic diet and insulin therapy. Ultrasonography complete placenta previa. She also received steroid cover for fetal lung maturity. At 32 weeks period of gestation by date of embryo transfer, she had another bout of bleeding; therefore, emergency lower segment cesarean section was performed. A male child with birth weight 1650 g was born with an APGAR score of 9, 9, 9. Most of the placenta was adherent with no plane of cleavage and hence cesarean hysterectomy was performed. She received two units of packed cells blood intraoperatively. Postoperatively, the patient was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for 24 h. Baby was shifted to neonatal ICU for observation. In ICU, her systolic blood pressure ranged 190\u2013220 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure ranged 110\u2013130 mmHg. Nitroglycerin drip was required for blood pressure control on postoperative day 1",

He underwent a minimally invasive right lower lobectomy for lung adenocarcinoma (pT2aN1M0) and chemotherapy 2 years ago. He exhibited no specific symptoms until he was admitted to hospital due to progression of a severe cough with fever, 12 months after lung resection. Although his fever was relieved by antibiotic administration and insertion of closed thoracic drainage, his cough continued and a large volume of air leaked into the chest tube. A physical examination revealed a uniportal incision and a chest tube in the right thorax (Fig. A). Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a simple empyema cavity containing a pleural effusion and a tube in the right lower thorax (Fig. B). Based on his clinical symptoms and these imaging findings, we diagnosed the patient with right lower bronchial stump fistula with empyema after lobectomy. Bronchoscopy confirmed a fistula of approximately 5 mm in diameter between the right lower bronchial stump and pleural cavity, and endoscopic placement of covered bronchial stent (Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, MA) was performed. After that, air leakage was lessened but discharge of purulent fluid from the tube continued at about 60 mL/day. Due to the inadequate outcome, rib resection thoracostomy was recommended. After the sixth and seventh posterior ribs were partially resected, purulent pleural effusion was observed in the thoracic cavity, which was cleaned to remove debris and necrotic tissue by debridement and washing. Two drainage tubes were inserted into the cavity and the wound was closed. The pathogen identified via pus culturing was Klebsiella pneumoniae. After irrigation of the right intrathoracic space with antibiotic solution for 14 days, his condition improved. When cultures confirmed there was no infection in the thoracic cavity, he underwent surgical intervention. During operation, a 15 cm \u00d7 11 cm latissimus dorsi muscle flap was harvested, the tip of the pedicled muscle flap was sutured and fixed to",
