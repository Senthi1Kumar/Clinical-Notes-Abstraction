A nasopalatine foramen was found adjacent to the apex of the maxillary left central incisor [].\nThe maxillary left central incisor had a root fracture and required extraction. After a careful consultation about various treatment options, the patient desired implant treatment.

There was no resorption of the labial bone and an implant (TiOblast, Astra Tech, M\u00f6lndal, Sweden, \u00f8 4.5 mm, length 13 mm) was placed into the fresh extraction socket with good primary stability.

The patient had previously undergone a classic pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple) procedure with concurrent hemicolectomy 6 years prior (in 2011) for a T3N0M0 adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head that had invaded the mesentery of the proximal transverse colon. After the 2011 surgery, pathology revealed a poorly differentiated PDA along with a PanIN grade 2. The final pathology showed negative surgical margins, positive perineural spread, and 0/33 specimen lymph node involvement. From June 2012 to October 2012, the patient underwent and completed adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine, capecitabine, and radiation at an outside hospital. She was carefully followed by her medical oncology team with serial CA 19-9 monitoring and abdominal MRIs on an ongoing basis. Due to her young age, in 2011, she underwent genetic screening and no germline mutations were identified. Since the time of the primary resection, the patient had been high functioning and healthy, with the exception of some problems of early satiety and recurrent cholangitis. These sequelae were attributed to close proximity of the gastrojejunostomy and hepaticojejunostomy, with possible reflux of intestinal contents up the afferent limb, all partially managed by diet changes.\nIn 2017, a biannual screening MRI with intravenous contrast showed a new pancreatic lesion measuring 2.3 \u00d7 2.2 cm in the tail of the pancreas (). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy identified it as a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. From 2011 to 2017, she had had close followup with serial CA 19-9, and a measurement of this marker after identification of the lesion on MRI showed an elevation, which was confirmed on repeat testing (61 and 55 U/mL; normal <37 U/mL).

Pure tone audiometry (PTA) in both ears was 5 dBHL; she had no tinnitus. The patient denied any previous history of related problems, although her mother was suffering from migraine headache. The patient was hospitalized three days, where she received intravenous steroids and antiemetics. Inner ear and cerebellar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were normal. She began vestibular rehabilitation treatment, with a progressive exercise regimen. Initially, she performed gaze stability and balance exercises 3\u20135 times a day in her home, for a total stimulus time of 20\u201340 min daily. The gaze stability exercises included the x1 and x2 paradigms for both near and far target distances. The balance exercises were provided to improve her use of vestibular information to maintain balance. We progressed these exercises by reducing the base of support, altering vision, and proprioceptive input (eyes open or closed; standing on a firm or soft surface). The gait exercises included walking in tandem, with eyes closed, with cephalic movement in the sagittal and horizontal planes. Habituation exercises were indicated based on the result of the 16 movements from the Motion Sensitivity Quotient []. The habituation movements included 4 repetitions, 4 times a day, until the exercises did not generate any symptoms for 48 hours, at which time the patient suspended them.

Further evaluation revealed a very high IgG level, elevated M protein band, and a kappa/lambda ratio <0.01 (normal 0.26-1.65). A biopsy from the soft tissue mass revealed a plasmacytoma. Radiation therapy was initiated for 10 days. She received three cycles of bortezomib and dexamethasone followed by two cycles of bortezomib, dexamethasone, and lenalidomide. Her disease progressed, and a subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed hypercellular bone marrow with 70% atypical plasma cells. The patient subsequently received seven cycles of carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. She was not a candidate for bone marrow transplantation given the high plasma cell burden.\nOn her current presentation, the pain was sudden in onset, intermittent, worse with eating, and without radiation.

The patient had been discharged from followup in 2005 with no evidence of recurrence. On representing in 2009, a CT scan showed evidence of local recurrence with left-sided pleural lesions and an enlarged left hilar lymph node, as well a solitary 4.7 cm splenic lesion ().

However, increased activity was demonstrated in the left acetabulum, which was thought to represent bony metastasis. An ultrasound guided percutaneous biopsy of the splenic lesion diagnosed a low-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma in keeping with metastasis of the resected lung primary (chromogranin, cam 52, panCK, MFF116, synaptophysin, CD56 positive: no necrosis; no mitoses; Ki67 labelling index < 5%).

Onset was gradual and the problem progressed slowly until the patient was bedridden. The boy was a product of a full-term uneventful pregnancy who was delivered through spontaneous vaginal delivery. There was no history of trauma, fever, weight loss or any developmental delay during infancy. Dietary history was significant in that he was drinking only milk during the last 3 years. His past medical and surgical history was unremarkable. He was conscious but irritable and resisted examination, lying on the couch with his legs flexed at hips and knees (). There were no rashes, petechiae, hematoma, or gingival bleeding. During the neurological examination, power in the lower limbs could not be assessed as he refused to exert at all. Reflexes were found to be exaggerated and plantars were bilaterally flexors. Upper limbs were normal. Cardiovascular examination was normal and there was no organomegaly.

Results of an initial laboratory evaluation (Table ) were normal as well.\nAn abdominal radiograph performed on admission did not reveal any abnormality. A computed tomography (CT) scan of his abdomen (Figure , , Figure ) was done, given the palpable mass; the CT revealed an ovoid heterogeneous mass with intralesional enhancement and calcification in the right iliac fossa. It appeared to have a tail superior-posteriorly and was located along the course of the right lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, raising the possibility of a schwannoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen was done for further evaluation and revealed an ovoid mass measuring approximately 4.6 cm x 4.2 cm x 5.7 cm at the level of L3 - L4 with a tail-like appendage to the proximal and distal parts with features highly suggestive of an ancient schwannoma (Figure ). A CT-guided biopsy was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis of schwannoma. The histopathology of the mass revealed the schwannoma to be benign.

    "original_text": "We describe the case of a 56-year-old Caucasian woman who presented acutely with left arm numbness and pain lasting for nearly eight hours. She had had similar episodes of numbness a few days previously, but these had lasted for only five to 10 minutes each time.\nShe smoked 20 cigarettes/day. Her heart rate was regular, although her blood pressure was lower in the left arm than in the right arm (103/80 mmHg vs. 170/80 mmHg, respectively). Her left arm looked pink but cool, with no palpable brachial, radial or ulnar pulse. There was decreased sensation over the forearm, though there was no motor deficit.\nHer chest, cardiovascular and abdominal examinations showed no other abnormalities. She underwent urgent computed tomography, which showed an acutely thrombosed left subclavian artery.\nShe was put on an intravenous heparin infusion and magnetic resonance angiography was arranged (Figure ). Initial angiograms obtained through the femoral artery in the groin showed a tight stenosis which was right at the origin of the subclavian artery. As a result, a guidewire could not be passed through the groin puncture despite several attempts. The brachial route was therefore chosen. A guidewire was passed using a left brachial artery approach through the narrowing. A 5 mm \u00d7 4 cm stainless steel stent Genesis (Cordis Endovascular, Warren, NJ, USA) was subsequently deployed and, when ballooned, although it clearly had eliminated the atherosclerotic lesion, the diameter was less than the diameter of the native normal vessel.

He developed lymphadenopathy at age 3 leading to an excisional biopsy of an axillary node, which showed normal lymph node tissue. His mother denied noticeable persistent lymphadenopathy. At age 9, he developed autoimmune anemia and thrombocytopenia responsive to IVIg and steroids. Lymphadenopathy was not documented at this time. This led to a work up for autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). He was found to have normal numbers of double negative alpha/beta T cells with no B220+ DNT cells. He had two subsequent episodes of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The most recent occurred at age 11 and he was treated with a 4-week course of rituximab. Between episodes, he was asymptomatic and was taking no medications. The patient had no history of significant or severe infections.\nAt age 13, the patient developed back pain, fever, shortness of breath, and cough. He did not improve despite multiple rounds of antibiotics for presumed pneumonia. He was admitted for IV antibiotic treatment. A chest CT showed mediastinal adenopathy and irregular nodular pulmonary infiltrates. A sputum culture was positive for Candida and the patient was treated with antifungals. In total, he received 29 days of amphotericin and micofungin. A bronchoscopy culture was negative for bacteria and fungus. A lung biopsy showed an atypical interstitiital lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, suggesting an underlying lymphoproliferative process. Bacterial and fungal cultures of the lung were also negative. During his admission he was noted to have IgG < 155 mg/dL (low), IgM 354 mg/dL (high), and IgA 8.7 mg/dL (low). His hypogammaglobinemia was treated with IVIg.

MRI revealed a macroadenoma (23 \u00d7 21 \u00d7 16 mm) that had invaded the right cavernous sinus (Figure ). TSS was performed in January 2011 with a subtotal resection of the tumor, leading to visual improvement. Pathological test results indicated that the Ki-67 index was greater than 3%. In April 2011, the patient again experienced hemianopsia in the right eye, and MRI scan showed that the tumor had recurred with infiltration of the cavernous sinus (22 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 17 mm) (Figure ). A second surgical intervention was performed to partially resect the tumor using a transcranial approach (Figure ), resulting in visual improvement. Pathological tests revealed that the Ki-67 index was greater than 10% (Figure ). However, five months after the second surgery, MRI revealed regrowth of the residual tumor with invasion of the suprasellar cistern and left cavernous sinuses (Figure ). In January 2012, the patient presented with typical Cushing syndrome, and his ACTH and serum cortisol levels had increased to 119 pg/mL and 49.5 \u03bcg/dL, respectively. Tumor recurrence (30 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 23 mm) was detected by MRI scans in April 2012 (Figure ). In October 2012, a third TSS was performed and the tumor was partially resected (Figure ). Pathology revealed strong ACTH-positive immunostaining in 90% of the cells and a Ki-67 labeling index (LI) of greater than 10%, and weak immunoreactivity for p53 was observed in almost 5% of tumor cells (Figure ).

He also reported a 10-year history of tremors in his upper extremities that also worsened in severity over time. Family history was positive for tremors in his maternal aunt and 2 of his 3 brothers, and cramps in his third brother. Examination at the time of presentation was remarkable for obvious gynecomastia, mild periorbital facial weakness, possible wasting of the sternocleidomastoid muscles, fasciculations in multiple muscles of the face and arms, and a 10 Hz postural tremor in the arms. Of note, mental status, reflexes, strength, sensation and gait were all normal. Curiously, electrodiagnostic testing showed evidence of a generalized sensory neuropathy with absent left sural, median, ulnar and dorsal ulnar cutaneous nerve sensory responses and a slightly reduced superficial radial nerve sensory amplitude and conduction velocity. Electromyo graphy showed evidence of acute denervation in the left lateral gastrocnemius and extensor digitorum brevis and evidence of chronic denervation in multiple muscles of the left upper and lower extremities. DNA testing for Kennedy\u2019s disease confirmed the diagnosis revealing an expansion of 47 CAG repeats (normal being <33). The patient declined treatment for his tremor.\nThe patient continued to be seen in clinic on an annual basis, with slowly progressive disease with increasing difficulty climbing stairs and squatting. He was still able to continue working full time, however. At age 54 the patient reported new hoarseness and mild dysphagia which slowly worsened over the next year. He denied any heartburn or regurgitation. Videofluoroscopic evaluation of his swallowing revealed mild oropharyngeal dysphagia as well as evidence of esophageal reflux, but no laryngeal penetration or frank tracheal aspiration. Follow up",

Pathologic examination revealed an HCC, composed of a necrotic tumor that measured 10.5 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 11 cm. In addition, there were three daughter nodules with diameters of less than 1 cm each. The residual nodular tumor without necrosis was Edmondson grade II to III with nuclear atypia, and was moderately differentiated. Invasion of lymphatic and vascular channels was not obvious. Exposure to the surface of the liver capsule was not found. A single lung metastasis and a single mediastinal lymph node metastasis were found in a chest CT scan performed 18 months after the liver lobectomy (Figures and ). Final diagnosis was made based on the elevated levels of two tumor markers for HCC: \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) (4869 ng/mL) and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonists II (PIVKA-II) (>20,000 mAU/mL).

    "original_text": "An 85-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to hospital following three collapse episodes with transient loss of consciousness at home. Each episode was short-lived lasting several minutes. Apart from mild abdominal generalized discomfort, there were no other symptoms. There was no history of recent trauma. He had no history of similar episodes but was known to have severe aortic stenosis, type 2 diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension and a previous duodenal ulcer bleed.\nAt that time, he was taking aspirin, bisoprolol, omeprazole and ramipril. He lived with his daughter and was independent with his activities of daily living. He had not smoked for 35 years and his alcohol consumption was minimal.\nOn examination, he was apyrexial, oxygen saturation was 100% on air. His blood pressure was 80/40 mmHg. He was persistently hypotensive despite aggressive fluid resuscitation. There was an ejection systolic murmur on cardiac auscultation. His venous pressure was not elevated and there was no leg edema. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Upper and lower limb pulses were equal bilaterally. Examination of his abdomen revealed mild epigastric discomfort, but there was no rebound or peritonism and bowel sounds were present. Per rectal examination was normal.\nInitial blood results showed a hemoglobin of 11.3 (13-18 g/dL), white cell count of 11 (4-11 \u00d7 109/L), and platelets of 136 (150-450 \u00d7 109/L).

The patient had no congenital swelling of the left buccal mucosa at birth and no history of systemic disease or relevant family history. The patient had undergone maxillary molar restoration treatment 2 years earlier, after which she reported biting regularly on her buccal mucosa. On most occasions, the wound had healed within a week, so she had not sought medical treatment. An extraoral examination revealed no facial swelling or asymmetry. However, an intraoral examination revealed an area of diffuse swelling on the left buccal mucosa measuring about 15 mm \u00d7 30 mm and containing a papillary lesion with multiple red, blue, and clear pebble-like vesicles (Figure ). On palpation, the lesion was nontender and soft. The swelling had not expanded to the veins and was pulsatile. An orthopantomogram confirmed that the adjacent bone was intact. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a soft tissue mass with a clearly distinguishable outline of the buccinator muscle (Figure ). The lesion was surgically excised under local anesthesia with a margin of 3 mm and a depth of 2 mm via the inside surface of the fascia of the buccinator muscle. The outcome was favorable. Pathologic examination of the specimen revealed expanded lymphatic vessels lined by thin endothelial cells and containing lymphatic fluid. A diagnosis of lymphatic malformation was confirmed on histopathology and immunohistochemical studies. Immunohistochemistry was negative for vascular markers such as CD31 and CD34, and the lymphatics stained specifically for D2-40 (podoplanin) (Figures , , ).

The patient underwent initial treatment for her life-threatening conditions, including thoracic drainage and distal radius fracture fixation with plaster. Five days after the injury, the patient\u2019s condition was no longer critical, and she underwent the definitive treatment of open reduction and internal fixation of the fractures of her clavicle and distal radius under general anesthesia. We had planned to fix the distal radius fracture using the usual FCR approach and a special plate designed for a volar rim fragment of the distal radius. We could not identify the absence of the FCR tendon preoperatively because of severe swelling of the distal forearm. At first, we wrongly identified the palmaris longus (PL) tendon as the FCR because it was the tendinous structure at the most radial location of the volar distal forearm. When we found the median nerve just radial to the PL tendon, we were then able to identify the anatomical abnormality described in this case (Fig. A, B). Therefore, we changed the approach to the classic Henry\u2019s approach after we had identified and gently protected the PCB. When we exposed and protected the radial artery through the same incision, we noticed another abnormality when dissecting the deep layers of the volar distal forearm (Fig. C): after retracting the flexor pollicis longus tendon to the ulnar side, we found that an abnormal muscle existed just radial to the pronator quadratus (PQ) muscle (Fig. D).

On day 9, his clinical course was complicated by a pulmonary hemorrhage, requiring re-intubation. He was given another dose of surfactant and stabilized on high-frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV). The chest radiograph showed extensive bilateral pulmonary interstitial emphysema, with the left side more extensively involved in comparison to the right. A hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus was treated by intravenous paracetamol. The baby's condition did not improve, and he was selectively intubated into his right main bronchus. The position of the endotracheal tube was radiologically confirmed, allowing the right lung to be oscillated while the left lung was rested. The baby was nursed on his left side for a period of 36 hours, after which the endotracheal tube was retracted into the trachea and secured in that position. The baby's ventilatory status subsequently improved, allowing for extubation on day 7 after the relapse. On day 28 of life, he presented with severe stridor, requiring re-intubation. Difficulty during intubation suggested that subglottic stenosis might be present. One week after this re-intubation a flexible bronchoscopy was performed, which revealed two major findings.

Physical examination revealed a hard, tender, and 25-mm mass in the upper outer quadrant of her right breast and a palpable lymph node in her right axilla. Mammography indicated an indistinct mass on the mediolateral oblique view and the craniocaudal view. Ultrasound (US) showed an 18 \u00d7 16-mm, irregular-shaped, and hypoechoic mass with a suspicion of a spread to the nipple inside the duct (Fig. a) and several swollen lymph nodes in levels I to II (Fig. b). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected enhancement of a 17 \u00d7 17-mm indistinct mass surrounded with a non-mass enhanced segmental lesion toward the nipple side spreading a maximum of 74-mm range, which had no interaction with the chest bone, muscles, and breast skin, in the right breast tissue (Fig. ). Invasive carcinoma with multiple axillary lymph node metastases was strongly suspected on clinical examination and imaging.

She was born with a mild ventricular septal defect and a patent ductus arteriosus that failed to close with two trials of indomethacin and required surgical ligation. After birth, she spent four months in the neonatal intensive care unit, requiring supplemental oxygen and placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube for feeding. She was diagnosed with esophageal glycogenic acanthosis (Figures \u2013) found on upper endoscopy performed at age twenty-two months for symptoms of reflux and feeding difficulties. She had retinopathy of prematurity that was treated with laser surgery and strabismus that was treated with botulinum injections. Macrocephaly, global developmental delays, and a limited attention span were present in early childhood. MRI of her brain at age 7 years showed signs of mild periventricular leukomalacia and no other abnormalities.\nOn exam, the patient was developmentally delayed for her age, and her head circumference was 56.4 cm, which is macrocephalic for age (98th percentile for head circumference in a 9-year-old girl is 55 cm) []. Skin exam showed well-healed scars from prior surgeries but no lipomas or other mucocutaneous features of Cowden syndrome. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.\nDue to her clinical symptoms, upper endoscopy was performed, and a variegated fungating mass with very prominent lymphoreticular nodularity and friability was found along the medial aspect of the lesser curvature of the stomach at the juncture of the body with the antrum. The size of the mass was difficult to estimate on endoscopy but appeared to be 2 cm in width and 3 cm in length on a pedicle that was about 1.5 cm at the base (Figures \u2013). Biopsies",

He had had a renal transplant eight months earlier for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney-related renal failure. He received two doses (20 mg) of interleukin receptor-2 antibodies (Simulect\u00ae, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Surrey, UK) at induction and on the fourth postoperative day. This was followed by tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone for immunosuppression. During the follow-up period, his tacrolimus level was kept within the therapeutic range (5 to 8 ng/ml). He was cytomegalovirus (CMV) negative and had received a kidney from a CMV-negative deceased donor. He had immigrated to the United Kingdom from Bangladesh twenty-five years ago and had last visited there eight years ago. There was no past history of trauma to the knee.\nHe was started on flucloxacillin and the course was extended for a period of 14 days. In spite of antibiotic therapy, the lesion progressed significantly and reached 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm (Figure ) and became cystic in nature. The lesion was confined to the skin and subcutaneous tissue with no deep extension to bone or lymph node involvement. The surface of the lesion had multiple small sinuses showing a dark-brown discharge, which was sent for microscopy.\nDuring this period, he did not show any systemic symptoms and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein) and his white cell count were both normal. Because of the failure of antibiotic therapy and the fast growing nature of the lesion an incisional biopsy was performed.\nHistological examination of the specimen showed marked epidermal hyperplasia and abundant fungal spores with hyphae.

He was given another dose of surfactant and stabilized on high-frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV). The chest radiograph showed extensive bilateral pulmonary interstitial emphysema, with the left side more extensively involved in comparison to the right. A hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus was treated by intravenous paracetamol. The baby's condition did not improve, and he was selectively intubated into his right main bronchus. The position of the endotracheal tube was radiologically confirmed, allowing the right lung to be oscillated while the left lung was rested. The baby was nursed on his left side for a period of 36 hours, after which the endotracheal tube was retracted into the trachea and secured in that position. The baby's ventilatory status subsequently improved, allowing for extubation on day 7 after the relapse. On day 28 of life, he presented with severe stridor, requiring re-intubation. Difficulty during intubation suggested that subglottic stenosis might be present. One week after this re-intubation a flexible bronchoscopy was performed, which revealed two major findings.

He did not have saddle anesthesia or urinary or fecal incontinence. He was initially seen in a primary care clinic and was diagnosed with sciatica. As symptoms continued to worsen, he underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the lumbar scan as an outpatient that was concerning osseous spinal metastasis. He was started on prednisone 10 mg daily and was referred to the oncology clinic at our center. Prednisone gave him minimal symptomatic relief. While waiting to be seen in the oncology clinic, the patient had an episode of leg weakness with near-fall prompting him to present to the emergency department of our hospital and was admitted for further evaluation. His vital signs were stable. He had no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymph nodes.

He was diagnosed with IgG kappa multiple myeloma four years prior to presentation. He was initially treated with bortezomib/dexamethasone with monthly zolendronic acid with good response initially; however, a year after diagnosis, he was found to have disease progression which manifested as a right radius fracture. His regimen was switched to lenalidomide with dexamethasone with good response and clinically depressed levels of paraproteins. After completion of 9 months of therapy, he underwent autologous stem cell transplant with high-dose melphalan. 7 months after bone marrow transplant, his disease progressed with involvement of pericardial fluid. Salvage therapy was initiated with pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone which was discontinued a year later due to peripheral neuropathy; however, at the end of treatment, there was no evidence of ongoing disease.\nWhen the patient presented to our hospital, he had an acute abdomen. Initial blood work revealed a normocytic anemia with hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dl and elevated ESR of 44. He also had acute kidney injury with creatinine of 3 mg/dl (baseline of 1.9 mg/dl). CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed extensive stranding seen throughout the abdomen within the peritoneal space with edema in the mesentery ().\nHe underwent an exploratory laparotomy which revealed induration of the entire base of the mesentery and retroperitoneum. He had an IgG level of 4407 units with predominantly kappa light chains whose level was 4833 units (kappa to lambda ratio 540). Pathology revealed extensive mesenteric infiltration by kappa restricted plasma cells positive for CD138 on immunohistochemistry, without evidence of amyloidosis.

    "cleaned_text": "a 69-year-old caucasian male was referred to our hospital with 3 weeks of abdominal distension and worsening right lower quadrant pain. he was diagnosed with igg kappa multiple myeloma four years prior to presentation. he was initially treated with bortezomib/dexamethasone with monthly zolendronic acid with good response initially; however, a year after diagnosis, he was found to have disease progression which manifested as a right radius fracture. his regimen was switched to lenalidomide with dexamethasone with good response and clinically depressed levels of paraproteins. after completion of 9 months of therapy, he underwent autologous stem cell transplant with high-dose melphalan. 7 months after bone marrow transplant, his disease progressed with involvement of pericardial fluid. salvage therapy was initiated with pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone which was discontinued a year later due to peripheral neuropathy; however, at the end of treatment, there was no evidence of ongoing disease.\nwhen the patient presented to our hospital, he had an acute abdomen. initial blood work revealed a normocytic anemia with hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dl and elevated esr of 44. he also had acute kidney injury with creatinine of 3 mg/dl (baseline of 1.9 mg/dl). ct scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed extensive stranding seen throughout the abdomen within the peritoneal space with edema in the mesentery ().\nhe underwent an exploratory laparotomy which revealed induration of the entire base of the mesentery and retroperitoneum. he had an igg level of 4407 units with predominantly kappa light chains whose level was 4833 units (kappa to lambda ratio 540). pathology revealed extensive mesenteric infiltration by kappa restricted plasma cells positive for cd138 on immunohistochemistry, without evidence of amyloidosis. bone marrow biopsy revealed a 30% involvement by plasma cells (figures \u2013). cytogenetics showed 1q22 duplication, trisomy 7 and 15, and gain of 8q24.1. the skeletal survey revealed lytic lesions in the left femur and skull (fig",

Because of acute postoperative bleeding, the aortic graft was replaced by a composite graft equipped with a mechanic aortic valve. On postoperative day 19, the patient developed a systemic inflammatory response syndrome with fever, leukocytosis, and tachycardia. The focus of infection appeared to be a sternal osteomyelitis with delayed healing of the sternotomy wound, purulent secretion, and perifocal erythema. Blood cultures and wound swabs were collected before empiric antibiotic therapy with cefepime was started. Growth of Staphylococcus aureus (sensitive to oxacillin) was found in all specimens. Sternal debridement was performed and the antibiotic therapy was changed to a combination therapy (flucloxacillin, rifampicin, and an aminoglycoside). A prosthetic valve endocarditis could not be excluded, although no typical vegetations were seen by the transesophageal echocardiography. After 2 weeks, a second sternal debridement was necessitated because of persistent wound secretion and dehiscence. The wound closure with a VAC (KCI International, the Netherlands) system was performed by the cardiovascular surgeon and an antibiotic therapy with only flucloxacillin and rifampicin was continued. Nevertheless, the patient developed fever and elevated white blood cells counts (Table ). At this point, the removal and replacement of the probably infected composite graft was discussed and the plastic surgery team was consulted. The treatment strategy agreed upon consisted of a radical debridement and the introduction of well-vascularized tissue around the graft and the sternal wound (1) to fill dead space and (2) to increase the effect of antibiotics locally.\nThe preparation of the pectoralis muscle flaps as a turnover flap on the right side pedicled on the basis of perforators from the internal mammary artery, and an advancement flap pedicled on the thoracoacromial vessels on the left side, was followed by a subtotal sternal debridement.",
