The right hip joint exhibited contracture at 20\u00b0 of adduction and 10\u00b0 of flexion. A plain radiograph revealed an intertrochanteric fracture and severe deformity of the right hip joint (). Indeed, the patient had undergone hip arthrodesis surgery 56 years previously for a right femoral neck fracture, which had necessitated bone transplantation and the use of a cast for 6 months. This treatment resulted in an ankylosed rather than arthrodesed hip joint. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the right hip joint revealed a displaced intertrochanteric fracture under the ankylosed hip joint and marked atrophy of the gluteus muscles (). Significant ectopic ossification and osteophyte development around the hip joint was suggested to be the cause of the limitation in the range of hip joint motion at all angles. Based on these findings and the radiographic images, he was diagnosed not with a simple intertrochanteric fracture, but an intertrochanteric fracture under an ankylosed hip joint. We carefully discussed the appropriate operative procedure for this condition in detail because there are few previous cases similar to this one. Gamma nail fixation was performed 8 days after the fracture. Preoperative fluoroscopic images with the patient under spinal anesthesia showed that the right hip joint was still totally immobile and fixed in adduction at 20\u00b0 and flexion at 10\u00b0.

    "original_text": "A forty-year-old male welder with no past history of knee injury presented to another institution with left knee pain in September 2000. He underwent an arthroscopic partial menisectomy of the medial meniscus. In December 2004, 4 years after the primary surgery, he had a second arthroscopic partial menisectomy of the medial meniscus. However his left knee pain was not reduced. The radiographs of his left knee revealed a narrow medial joint space, femorotibial angle of 178 degrees, and posterior tibial slope [] of 9 degrees. In January 2005, when he was 44 years old, he received an opening-wedge HTO using a Puddu plate with a 15-mm opening block and osteochondral transplantation of the medial femoral condyle. The femorotibial angle was corrected to 170 degrees after the osteotomy, while the posterior tibial slope increased to 20 degrees. The Puddu plate was removed at 18 months after the osteotomy; however, he still had severe knee pain.\nIn January 2007, the patient first visited our institution for a second opinion, because he was recommended for another revision surgery to convert to total knee arthroplasty by the former hospital. He was unable to walk without a cane due to the left anteromedial knee pain. Physical examinations revealed quadriceps atrophy and no ligamentous laxity of the left knee. The range of motion was 140 degrees of flexion and -20 degrees of extension in the left knee, and 150 degrees of flexion and 0 degree of extension in the right knee. Severe left knee pain was observed with extension. The radiographs demonstrated complete bony union at the osteotomy site, a femorotibial angle of 169 degrees and posterior tibial slope of 20 degrees on the left side (Fig. ), and 178 degrees and 8 degrees on the right side.

He was apparently working from the above height when he slipped and fell on a sharp piece of iron rod which penetrated deep into the right anterior neck. He quickly pulled the sharp iron rod out when he got up from the floor. According to him, the bleeding was not profuse and stopped when he arrived at the local hospital to search for remedy (). He did not have hemiplegia, paraplegia, or quadriplegia when we saw him. He is not known to be hypertensive. He did not take alcohol prior to the fall although he takes alcohol occasionally. He had a left femoral fracture at the age of 24 and a right femoral fracture at the age of 32; both incidences were operated on successfully. On examination at our facility we saw a middle aged man who was conscious and alert but however acutely ill with his neck fixed in cervical collar.

He had suffered an acute episode of myocarditis four years previously requiring hospital admission. He had no other relevant medical history and no family history of cardiac disease. He is a nonsmoker and consumed alcohol occasionally. Clinical examination was unremarkable and did not show any evidence of heart failure or systemic disease. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm without any ischemic changes, and chest X-ray showed no evidence of infection or heart failure. Routine blood tests including antinuclear antibody, creatinine kinase (CK), rheumatoid factor, and C-reactive protein were all within normal limits apart from an elevated cardiac troponin T with a peak value of 2700 ng/l (<14 ng/l). Further extensive inflammatory, viral, and autoimmune screening was carried out and found to be negative. Subsequent coronary angiogram showed normal coronary arteries, and transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >55% with trace mitral regurgitation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated extensive subepicardial and midwall late enhancement typical of myocarditis in the anterior, lateral, and inferior walls along with extensive fibrosis with normal LVEF ().\nA short course of steroids and anti-inflammatory medication as an inpatient resulted in the resolution of his myocarditis symptoms. The troponin T level normalized and the patient was discharged with a plan to repeat cardiac MRI in six months. On follow-up as an outpatient, it was decided to refer the patient to rheumatology for an opinion regarding ongoing immunomodulatory therapy. At this juncture, the patient stated that he also had symptoms of stiffness and aching in his calf muscles for quite some time but he did not consider it to be relevant.

The patient had a history of tobacco use during the last 50 years; at the time of reference, he smoked 10 cigarettes daily. He had no alcohol overconsumption. When referred, the patient had suffered from dysphagia for 2 months, and he only consumed fluids. Besides a weight loss of 8 kg (weight at referral 83 kg, weight loss corresponding to 9% of initial body weight), the first physical examination was unremarkable, as were the initial blood tests. The primary endoscopy revealed a mucosa covered with white plaques spreading from 30 to 40 cm from the incisors. In the distal part of the affected area, the mucosa protruded and covered almost 2/3 of the lumen and involved the entire circumference (fig. ). The finding was thought to be a candida infection. Biopsies showed severe acute inflammation with reactive changes but without dysplasia or malignancy. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a thickened wall in the distal part of the esophagus. Since no malignancy was found, the patient was discharged.\nFour months later, the patient was referred again due to a further massive weight loss of 25 kg; at this time he weighed only 58 kg (weight loss corresponding to 36% of initial body weight). Gastroscopy and blood test were performed again, and human immunodeficiency virus, herpes, and HPV infection were ruled out. To rule out achalasia of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction, a high-resolution impedance manometry examination was performed followed by a positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan, but neither could explain the condition the patient suffered from.

    "original_text": "A 31-year-old female presented to an orthopedician with bilateral leg pain since 1 year. Pain started in the right leg 6 months before the left leg, and at the time of presentation she had persistent pain on both sides, more on the right. She had no other site of pain. There was no history of fever, trauma or undue stress on the bones. There was no history of autoimmune diseases in her family. On examination, the patient did not have signs suggestive of vascular or muscular etiology of leg pain. There was no bony tenderness. She underwent a radiograph of both legs which showed cortical thickening of the diaphyses of both tibiae []. Keeping the differentials of shin splints/stress fracture versus chronic osteomyelitis in mind, she was referred for a bone scan. A three-phase 99mTc-MDP bone scan [] showed intense irregular uptake in the diaphyseal region of both tibiae in delayed static images. Increased tracer activity was also noted in blood pool images in both legs. There were no other sites of bone involvement.

However, despite having a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, he continued to have episodes of pancreatitis yearly for the next 3 years. Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a pancreatic duct dilated throughout its course to a maximum size of 8 mm without a discrete pancreatic mass in the head of the pancreas. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography confirmed a dilated pancreatic duct with a suspected filling defect of the common bile duct, after which the patient underwent sphincterotomy and stent placement.\nHe then presented to our institution for consultation. Further workup with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was performed, which also confirmed the dilated pancreatic duct, but noted irregular contour of the duct. In addition, free mucin was seen exiting the main papilla, and there was a papillary growth noted in the pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas, all of which was consistent with a main duct IPMN (). Preoperative laboratory values, including CA19-9, were within normal limits. Of note, it was unclear if the dilatation of the pancreatic duct was secondary to obstruction from the mass in the pancreatic head or due to main duct IPMN involving the entirety of the duct.\nHe was scheduled for surgical resection after the stated workup. He was planned for a Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) with possible total pancreatectomy if intraoperatively the main duct was found to be involved by IPMN with high-grade dysplasia. Transection of the pancreatic neck identified cells of high-grade dysplasia free floating near the margin (although exclusive of the margin).

    "original_text": "The patient was a 38-year-old nulliparous woman who suffered from infertility of unknown origin. She had been treated with assisted reproductive technologies including artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization for over four years. During her treatment for infertility, cytological review followed by colposcopic biopsy revealed an invasive nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A 1 cm mass was identified in the uterine cervix, but a pelvic MRI did not describe the cervical mass or parametrial invasion. Additionally, a submucosal leiomyoma of 15 mm in diameter was found in the uterus (). CT scans showed no signs of lymph node swelling or distant metastases. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed with stage IB1 cervical squamous cell carcinoma. We offered radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy as standard treatment although she strongly desired fertility preservation. The submucosal leiomyoma may have been the cause of her infertility, and she was keen to resect the myoma during the same procedure. Submucosal leiomyomas can usually be resected with hysteroscopy but was not advised in this case from the oncological viewpoint. As such, we obtained informed consent and performed an abdominal radical trachelectomy followed by abdominal myomectomy.\nDuring the surgery, we first drained the ascites in the pelvic cavity, resected bilateral pelvic lymph nodes, and sent them for intraoperative pathology. They were reported to be negative. The paravesical and pararectal spaces were then developed. The ureters on either side were resected to their insertion into the bladder. The uterine arteries were ligated and cut at the origin where they branched from the internal iliac arteries. Next, the uterosacral ligaments were divided. A colpotomy was performed circumferentially, and the cervical specimen was excised together with the parametrium at least 2 cm below the internal os.

Besides the increasing deformity, the patient had no complaints of pain or limitations. On physical examination, the patient was found to have a full and painless ROM and a normal carrying angle of the left elbow. The right elbow showed a cubitus valgus with clinically a carrying angle of 32\u00b0. The dislocated radial head was not painful on palpation.

Plain radiographic evaluation of the right elbow showed an anterior dislocation and deformation of the radial head, with a long narrow neck and a hypoplastic capitellum and an increased valgus angle (Figs. and ). The left elbow showed no abnormalities. Radiographs of both forearms show a mild ulnar bowing on the right side, as compared to the left side (17 and 12\u00b0) (Figs. and ).

CT imaging of the elbow showed the anterior dislocation of the radial head with an overgrowth of the radius of 8 mm and a normal ulnohumeral joint.

    "original_text": "A 54-year-old woman was referred to the University Hospitals Leuven with the preliminary diagnosis of a soft tissue tumor in the right upper leg identified as a mass of 43 mm \u00d7 62 mm on plain radiograph and echography. She had been complaining of irradiating pain on the lateral aspect of the right leg for 4 months and a one-week history of a palpable mass in the right thigh. There was no remarkable medical history and no recent significant trauma to the affected region.\nClinical evaluation revealed a well-defined nodular mass in the deeper aspect of the right tight, measuring about 5 cm. No concomitant tenderness, swelling, erythema, or other superficial skin lesions were found. The range of motion of the right hip and knee were unaffected and palpation for aberrant inguinal lymph nodes was negative.\nAt the time of referral, plain radiographs of the hip and pelvis showed crumbly calcification within a soft tissue mass posterior to the trochanteric region without a sign of bone erosion.\nEchography concluded on a non-growing, well-demarcated inhomogeneous muscular tumor without an argument for myositis (). Based on the clinic and first radiological characteristics, one decided for further investigation by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a diagnostic ultrasound-guided needle biopsy. T1 sequences showed a high-intensity signal equal to that of the subcutaneous fat, mainly present in the periphery, confirming the fatty characteristic of this lesion.

Three years back, the patient was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma involving the right lateral border of the tongue and just crossing midline in the anterior two-third of the tongue. The patient underwent anterior two-third glossectomy and neck dissection.\nThe patient had diabetes for the last 5 years and was under medication. Extraoral examination indicated that there was little collapse of soft tissue on the right cheek and the right side of the neck. The patient had adequate mouth opening (50 mm) as seen in . Intraoral examination depicted that the lingual sulcus was completely obliterated on the resected side. The patient was dentulous in both the jaws with few teeth missing [Figures and ]. The right-sided floor of the mouth is concave and essentially without function []. The floor of the mouth was reconstructed using a split-thickness skin flap from his thigh. The patient was wearing PAP for the last 1\u00bd years which had a broken clasp. The prosthesis had helped the patient in speech and swallowing to some extent. The prosthesis did not have the required stability and retention. It was flat on the oral surface as seen in and it lacked the contours required for phonetics.\nThe floor of the mouth had altered posture and restricted movements.

There was no history of any discharge per vaginum, loss of fetal movements, abdominal trauma, or any bladder or bowel disturbance.\nShe was gravida two with one spontaneous abortion at 3 months of gestation about one year back, for which a curettage was done. Rest of her medical and surgical history was unremarkable. Her present pregnancy had been uneventful till now and her early pregnancy scans were reported to be normal.\nOn admission, her general condition was poor, and there were signs of hypotension and tachycardia. Her upper abdomen was soft and non tender while there was guarding and tenderness in lower abdomen. Her uterus was 26 weeks gravid, with contour well made out. Fetal parts were made out with difficulty. The flanks were dull on percussion. Fetal heart sounds could not be auscultated. On per speculum examination, there was no bleeding. Her vaginal examination revealed a soft cervix with os closed, and a firm round nontender 4\u00d74cm mass in the anterior fornix toward the right side of cervix.\nThe patient had undergone an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) four days back as advised by the treating physician before presenting to this hospital. The MRI reported a didelphys uterus with a single fetus in left uterine body. The placenta was left lateral and there was no free fluid in abdomen []. It also reported the absence of left maternal kidney. Her blood reports at the time of admission showed mild anemia and normal platelet count. Ultrasound was done which showed a bicornuate uterus with a normal right horn and a live 26-27 weeks fetus in the left horn.

    "original_text": "A 56 year-old female was transported to the emergency department by EMS after physically threatening her husband with a knife. According to the patient, she experienced altered sensorium for one week prior to presentation, primarily resulting in suicidal and homicidal command hallucinations instructing her to overdose on NSAIDs and kill her husband. She denied any headaches, vertigo, fevers, head trauma, urinary symptoms, or use of illicit substances. There was no history of psychosis, schizophrenia, mania, or depression and a review of her medication list for any potential hallucinogenic agents did not indicate a pharmacologic etiology. Her past medical history was comprised of two prior strokes, the most recent being two years ago that involved the right frontal lobe. MRI of the brain at the time also showed evidence of an old right parietal lobe infarct. An echocardiogram during that hospitalization revealed a severely decreased left ventricular function and the patient was initiated on warfarin for anticoagulation. Since the two prior cerebral infarcts, the patient and her husband denied noting any behavioral changes, cognitive impairment, or any focal neurologic deficits. On presentation, she appeared disheveled and exhibited a flat affect with minimal verbalization. Physical examination revealed only a left hemianopia without hemiplegia. All cranial nerves were evaluated as well as gait, cerebellar function, and proprioception, which were all found to be normal. The patient was alert and oriented with intact mentation.\nShe was initially admitted to the psychiatric unit for further evaluation where the patient participated in daily activities and reported no symptoms. Given the acute onset of her symptoms, laboratory studies and brain images were obtained in order to rule out an organic etiology. A complete blood count was normal and a basic metabolic panel revealed normal electrolytes and renal function.

She was initially treated for respiratory tract allergic bronchitis for 3-4 months. Due to a lack of improvement and the recent development of shortness of breath at rest, a chest X-ray (CXR) was ordered demonstrating a globular shadow of pericardial effusion. The patient was then referred to a cardiologist who performed a subsequent echocardiogram to assess the etiology of the pericardial effusion. The echocardiogram demonstrated moderate-to-severe pericardial effusion and tamponade. The patient was immediately taken to the catheterization suite for percutaneous drainage of the effusion under fluoroscopy. At this time, the cardiologist noted that there was an intracardiac metallic foreign body located behind the sternum in the wall of the right ventricle, moving with each heartbeat (Figures -).\nCardiac surgery was consulted during the procedure and the decision was made to drain the effusion surgically via a subxiphoid approach under fluoroscopy and to assess whether the foreign body could be retrieved in the same manner. Preparations were made to convert to conventional median sternotomy under cardiopulmonary bypass if needed. After incising the pericardium from the subxiphoid incision and draining the hemorrhagic effusion, the surface of the heart was palpated under fluoroscopic guidance. We were able to visualize the tip of the foreign body that was emerging from the anterior wall of the right ventricle. The sternum was retracted superiorly to improve visualization and the surgeon used his index finger to press on the area around the tip of the foreign body in an effort to force it to protrude, so that it could then be grasped by forceps.

The patient showed an alert mental status and blood pressure in the normal range, with an elevated heart rate of 120 bpm. No dyspnea was present, and arterial oxygen saturation was 99%. Because a plain-film chest X-ray showed mild pneumomediastinum, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan was performed to identify potential injuries of the thorax, but no evidence of bronchial or esophageal injury was found in the unreconstructed axial CT images. Thus, oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula was planned for the patient without further examination. However, the patient suddenly developed severe dyspnea, and his arterial oxygen saturation decreased rapidly 1 hour after his arrival at the hospital. An emergency intubation was performed with single lumen endotracheal tube, but the decreased arterial oxygen saturation did not recover.

The woman had a significant past medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and her past surgical history included appendectomy 45 years ago. Her family history is negative for malignant ovarian and breast cancer in first-degree relatives. Previous screening for cervical cancer had not been performed.\nClinical and gynecological examination revealed no abnormalities, while transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) was performed and revealed a cystic lesion 10 \u00d7 7 cm in diameter on the left ovary and a cystic lesion 1 \u00d7 1 cm in diameter on the right ovary. She underwent colposcopic examination followed by punch biopsy and endocervical curettage. Histological analysis of punch biopsy and endocervical curettage revealed possible endocervical mucinous adenocarcinoma. The differential diagnosis included either endocervical gastric-type mucinous adenocarcinoma, or metastatic mucinous colorectal or ovarian adenocarcinoma. Pelvis magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 10 \u00d7 8 cm sized cervical mass () and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes.\nIn November 2019, the Council of Gynecologic Oncology decided that the tumor was inoperable, because it had a large diameter and there was a suspicion that the tumor had spread to the bladder.

The patient reported contracting a hepatitis B virus infection in her childhood from a blood transfusion after a spinal surgery for neuroblastoma. Consequently, she has been treated with tenofovir disoproxil over the course of 15 years. Furthermore, she also received a course of radio- and chemotherapy as a part of the treatment. In addition, medical history revealed an early colon cancer at the age of 25 years, which was treated by surgery and chemotherapy. A genetic testing for most common genetic causes of breast and colon cancer was declined by the patient. Laboratory records showed low iron levels, hypophosphatemia, and hypouricemia, as well as a high alkaline phosphatase. Further blood and urine tests performed at 2 and 3 months before admission in our institution also revealed glycosuria and proteinuria with decreased bicarbonate levels in presence of normal blood glucose levels (Table ). One year before the first presentation at our institute, the patient received oral vitamin D (cholecalciferol) and calcium carbonate substitution as well as one cycle of denosumab treatment, due to the sustained fractures. The antiviral therapy was stopped 3 months before the first presentation in our outpatient clinic and an oral phosphate substitution was then started.\nThe patient's mother had also sustained a femoral fracture in the past.

    "original_text": "A 61-year-old postmenopausal woman presented with right outer breast pain, redness and swelling of 3 days duration. Mammogram was essentially normal at that time. Ultrasound of her right breast revealed no masses but increased echogenicity and skin thickening in the outer half of her breast, likely due to inflammation. Clinical impression was that of right mastitis. She was treated with 1 week of oral antibiotics and responded with resolution of her symptoms. A follow-up ultrasound performed 1 month later showed improvement of the inflammatory changes in the right breast.\nThe patient then remained well until she presented 8 months later with another similar episode of right mastitis over the previously affected area. An ultrasound performed this time again showed skin thickening in the right outer breast with underlying inflammatory changes. No discrete nodule or collection was seen. The patient\u2019s symptoms again improved with antibiotics with complete resolution of the redness and swelling of her right breast.\nHowever, the patient returned 6 months later presenting with another similar episode of right breast redness, swelling and pain. Physical examination then revealed right nipple retraction and signs of inflammation over the previous area of interest. Repeat ultrasound (Figure ) showed marked inflammatory changes in the right breast with skin thickening, suggestive of an inflammatory process. Though the patient\u2019s symptoms again responded with antibiotics, an underlying breast malignancy, especially inflammatory breast cancer, needed to be excluded in view of recent nipple retraction.\nA skin punch biopsy and core biopsy of the inflamed breast tissue were carried out which revealed mild superficial dermatitis on skin biopsy.

The blood workup was normal including liver function tests. She was operated for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on an ambulatory surgery basis.

The patient reported of similar symptoms on the same side 8 years back. He had visited several dentists over this period of time with a complaint of mobility of teeth on both sides of the jaw and swelling on the left side. He was advised removal of 48, 47, and 38 followed 2 years later by removal of 37, 36, 35, and 34. Since the pain and mobility of the teeth did not subside, the patient reported to us. He did not carry any past histopathological records with him. His past medical history was unremarkable and his general physical examination revealed the presence of skin lesions on the forehead [].\nClinical examination of the head and neck region showed left facial swelling along with an expanded buccal and preauricular area leading to facial asymmetry. He denied any neurosensory problem associated with inferior alveolar nerve.\nIntraoral examination revealed a firm, hard swelling on the crest and buccal vestibule of left mandibular alveolar ridge, around 5 cm in the anterior\u2013posterior direction and overlying the crest of 36, 37, 38. There was no discharge intraorally. All other hard and soft tissue components of oral cavity appeared normal.\nThe OPG showed a multilocular radiolucency on the left side in the body of the mandible. One radiolucent lesion was seen extending from the condylar, coronoid processes up to the body of mandible on the same side.

The patient, an ex-smoker, with systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) and heart failure (Chagasic cardiomyopathy with implanted pacemaker) had been submitted to coronary angioplasty. On being admitted to the emergency room of the University Hospital de Base in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto, the patient reported he had pain in the right lower limb associated with edema, paresthesia, and coldness that had started suddenly. He also complained of pain in the left leg but said the pain was less intense. A duplex ultrasound of the iliac arteries showed total occlusion by an intraluminal thrombus on the right side with the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries occluded along their complete length. The popliteal artery of the left leg was also distally occluded (bifurcation). Bilateral embolectomy was performed without complications.\nOn the following day, he complained of \u201cburning\u201d pain and said that even the blanket on his legs bothered him. He had difficulty bending and straightening his knee and the sole of his foot. On physical examination, the patient had edema of the lateral and posterior compartments, and a lot of pain on compression, especially of the anterior compartment that was highly sensitive to slight pressure.\nThe chosen conduct was intermittent manual compression (massage) of the musculature of the compartments with the objective of stimulating lymphatic and venous return during the physical examination. The posterior compartment had a 100% improvement in the pain after 20 minutes of massage, the lateral compartment improved the pain completely after around 40 minutes, and the anterior compartment improved the pain by about 70% within one hour.

During the fall, due to other objects, the welding electrode in his left hand was inadvertently inserted into his brain. After the injury, there was bleeding at the location of foreign-body penetration. The patient reported dizziness and headache but no nausea, vomiting, bleeding from the ears or nose, poor physical activity or convulsions. The patient was admitted to the hospital 3 hours after the injury. The patient exhibited a normal body temperature, a Glasgow coma scale score of 15 points, clear consciousness and speech, and cooperation during the physical examination. The welding electrode was penetrating the brain from the outer sidewall of the left eye socket (Fig. A). Both pupils were equal and round, with a diameter of 3.0 mm, with direct and indirect light reflex intact. The muscle strength and muscular tension of the limbs were normal. Bilateral Babinski signs were not induced. The patient was given a preoperative test immediately after admission, as well as an intramuscular injection of tetanus antitoxin and an intravenous infusion of antibiotics. CT was performed and showed an object of metallic density penetrating the skull and entering the brain parenchyma in the frontotemporal region. The sagittal reconstruction of intracranial nerves and vessels was carried out according to the CT images of the head before operation, and whether the electrodes injured the intracranial nerves and vessels was determined.

Later, in August 2011 the patient presented to ED with complaints of melena. Her CT scan revealed a 9-cm mass in the tail of her pancreas with hepatic metastasis. Liver biopsy confirmed grade 2 neuroendocrine tumor (Ki-67 of 6%). The patient was initiated on Sandostatin LAR 30 mg every 30 days. She noticed rapid improvement in her energy level.

The patient had a stable course until December 2011, she had another episode of GI bleed. In January 2012 she underwent partial pancreatectomy, splenectomy, partial gastrectomy and left hepatic lobectomy.

She denied any headaches, vertigo, fevers, head trauma, urinary symptoms, or use of illicit substances. There was no history of psychosis, schizophrenia, mania, or depression and a review of her medication list for any potential hallucinogenic agents did not indicate a pharmacologic etiology.

An echocardiogram during that hospitalization revealed a severely decreased left ventricular function and the patient was initiated on warfarin for anticoagulation. Since the two prior cerebral infarcts, the patient and her husband denied noting any behavioral changes, cognitive impairment, or any focal neurologic deficits. On presentation, she appeared disheveled and exhibited a flat affect with minimal verbalization. Physical examination revealed only a left hemianopia without hemiplegia.

She was seen by her doctor who could not hear her left carotid, and she was also noted to have a grayish appearance.
