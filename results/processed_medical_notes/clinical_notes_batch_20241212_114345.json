Vital signs on admission were as follows: a blood pressure of 202/90 mmHg, a heart rate of 137 bpm, a respiratory rate of 20, and a temperature of 36.6 Celsius. Physical exam revealed Janeway lesions. She was found to have a neutrophilic leukocytosis, with white blood cell count at 20.4 cells/mm3 and neutrophils at 17.4 bil/L. Troponin was elevated at 1.85; this was deemed to be noncardiac in nature as the patient's pain was relieved with ibuprofen and her EKG showed no acute findings.

The patient was a nonsmoker and had no history of exposure to chemicals. Blood tests revealed no signs of systemic inflammation or renal insufficiency, only a moderate anemia was noticeable. We performed a cystoscopy, which brought no evidence of bladder pathology, but we noticed active bleeding from the right ureteral orifice. Sonography and an abdominal CT scan showed a hypodense mass with slow contrast enhancement, 80 mm in diameter and located in the upper pole of the right kidney and involving the pyelon. There was no evidence of metastases (fig. ). Suspecting an urothelial carcinoma of the right pyelon, we performed a retroperitoneoscopic nephro-ureterectomy.\nMacroscopic pathological evaluation revealed a right kidney weighing 300 g and measuring 12 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 cm.

The diagnosis of infectious keratitis was established one month prior to his presentation in an outside institution following an episode of acute corneal whitening, pain, and drop in visual acuity in his RE. A regimen of topical fortified antibiotics was implemented followed by a regimen of topical antiviral therapy with no improvement. The patient had a history of eye rubbing and progressive visual loss over the past year. However, no previous ocular examination was performed. At the time of presentation, the visual acuity in the RE was counting fingers near face (not improving with refraction) and the best-corrected vision in the left eye (LE) was 20/25 with a refraction of \u22126.75 + 4.75 \u00d7 55. The retinoscopy exam showed scissoring in the LE. However, retinoscopy could not be performed in the RE due to a poor red reflex. The slit lamp examination showed significant corneal protrusion with edema surrounding a rupture in Descemet's membrane in the inferior midportion of the cornea in the RE (). The cornea in the LE was clear. Anterior chamber was calm with no signs of infection. In both eyes, examination of the superior palpebral conjunctivae demonstrated mild generalized hyperaemia and a moderate papillary response, which were indicative of allergic conjunctivitis. Dilated ocular fundus examination confirmed normal posterior segment in the LE and was not visible in the RE.\nBased on clinical findings, acute corneal hydrops from advanced KC in the RE was highly suspected. Asymmetrical KC was confirmed with corneal topography (Pentacam 70700, Oculus, Germany) which revealed the presence of advanced KC in the RE and stage II KC (Amsler-Krumeich classification) in the LE (). To be noted, central corneal thickness was significantly reduced in the LE to 418",

    "original_text": "A 47-year-old man presented to our referral center in November 2017, with a history of EMC of the right shoulder improperly excised with unplanned microscopic positive surgical margins (R1). The patient underwent debulking of the primary mass in September 2017 in a non-referral center, without a preoperative core-needle biopsy. The histological examination diagnosed EMC. No post-operative treatments were provided. At our first evaluation, the patient did not show macroscopic residual disease or distant metastasis both at the clinical and the radiological assessment.

Metallic, hook-shaped foreign bodies were identified in both the main bronchi.\nThe right-sided FB was removed by fiber-optic bronchoscopy in the regional hospital, whilst the left-sided extraction failed with the left-sided FB persisting in the left main bronchus ().\nUpon urgent admission in a tertiary institution, extraction was attempted by rigid bronchoscope under general anesthesia. Bronchoscopic extraction failed, associated with some bleeding and subcutaneous emphysema immediately after the intervention. The increasing mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema raised suspicion about an iatrogenic airway lesion, so surgery was indicated. Esophageal injury was previously ruled out by esophagoscopy, revealing many metallic FBs in the stomach. At thoracotomy, a significant mediastinal emphysema (), together with diffuse adhesions, was noticed. After the lung liberation, a proximal 0.5 cm of the noncurved part of the metallic hook was found to protrude through the perforated membranous wall of the left main bronchus, 1 cm away from the descending aorta (, arrow). The part of the FB protruding outside the bronchus was grasped by the clamp and, by following the curved shape of the FB, gentle maneuvers were applied by pulling the sharp end (hook) of the FB in the direction outside the bronchus. The FB was removed from the bronchus (insert on ) without the need for additional bronchotomy. The remaining 10 \u00d7 1 mm defect in the bronchial wall, caused both by manipulations during a bronchoscopic extraction attempt and subsequent surgical extraction, was sutured by interrupted PDS 3-0 stitches, and the lung fully inflated.

At the time of admission she complained about an irritating feeling in her nose, which made her constantly grimace in the area around the nose. She was excessively worried about having a serious illness of her nose (secondary hypochondriacal delusions) and was suicidal as a consequence. Her belief persisted even after any underlying medical condition of the nose has been ruled out by extensive medical examinations. She also presented with disorganized behavior, stereotypical movements, emotional instability and lability, and a below average level of intelligence during hospitalization. On the PANSS, her symptoms scored 29/23/70 (for the Psychotic, Negative and General Psychopathology Scale, respectively). Brief neurological examination revealed no abnormal neurological signs. As ascertained by the history taken from the patient and her mother, she had a history of school phobia that began at the age of 12 years, emotional disorders, normal cognitive and physical development, and a three-year history of chronic headache. She managed to complete primary and secondary education with the help of school counseling services given to her on account of school phobia. She had not received any psychiatric care before the described admission. A diagnostic evaluation for chronic headache at the University Children\u2019s Hospital was undertaken a year before admission.\nCalcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone blood levels were normal.

    "original_text": "Diana (a pseudonym) is a young woman of 25 years old that reached the Eating Disorders Centre, Division of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, San Luca Hospital in Milan, following a dramatic weight loss. Diana reached the Centre with a BMI of 16.06 kg/m2 reporting several disruptions in her eating patterns and several distressful alterations in her body image perception. As reported in the clinical history, Diana\u2019s first eating related crisis was dated back 2 years before her current admission, with a subtle episode when she started a diet to lose some weight after health issues related to her thyroid. During that period, Diana was located abroad for work and \u2013 under moderate stress \u2013 she began a restrictive diet with a low caloric intake that brought her to lose 10 kg in 6 months. Diana\u2019s weight remained constant in the following months but she developed an obsessive attention to the caloric intake along with intrusive thoughts regarding her weight and regarding specific types of foods. Diana also reported body-related image distortions such as overvaluation of her weight, mirror and body checking, and avoidance of body exposure. Moreover, during the crises, she reported frequent crying spells observing her body in front of a mirror.\nIn the last year, Diana reported a stressful situation at the University that heightened her psychological symptoms.

Biopsies of the distal esophageal tumor confirmed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The patient was anemic with a hemoglobin of 89 g/L. Staging endoscopic ultrasound suggested a breach of muscularis propria and four enlarged paraesophageal nodes.

Palliative radiation therapy (RT) was recommended. The patient was also evaluated by a medical oncologist who advised that chemotherapy may be considered after assessing the response to palliative radiotherapy.\nFrom March 21, 2016 to April 5, 2016, the patient received palliative RT to the symptomatic primary tumor and closest adjacent nodes using a pair of anterior and posterior fields. A total dose of 30 Gray (Gy) was prescribed over 10 daily fractions. As the lymphadenopathy in the lower abdomen was not symptomatic, and would have contributed to increased toxicity, this region was deliberately excluded from the high dose RT volume (Figure ). Other than very mild odynophagia, the patient had no other RT-related side effects. On the first follow-up visit, one month following treatment completion, he had improved swallowing function and a weight gain of six pounds.\nFollow-up computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained on May 24, 2016 to evaluate",

In addition to the Jefferson fracture, the patient also sustained an unstable C6 facet fracture. This was treated with a C3-T4 posterior decompression and instrumented fusion two days after his initial injury by a separate surgeon.

Over the next 6 months, follow-up imaging noted continued nonunion and increased right-sided displacement (Figure ). The patient was seen for a second opinion because of his continued pain and torticollis and was subsequently offered surgical intervention. The patient was admitted the day before surgery and placed in 15 pounds of cervical traction with the goal of attaining improved alignment before surgery.

Her systemic condition was well controlled, according to her rheumatologist. A year earlier, she had undergone treatment for SLE retinopathy with intravitreal ranibizumab and pan-retinal photocoagulation in both eyes, elsewhere.

Soon after the accident he was resuscitated and taken for emergency laparotomy at the nearest Trauma Centre. A massive right-sided retroperitoneal hematoma was detected, with active haemorrhage from a severely disrupted pancreatic head, duodenum and lower biliary tract. An extended Kocher manoeuvre was performed while compressing the hepatoduodenal ligament for haemostasis. At that time a main pancreatic duct disruption was demonstrated, without any evidence of the portal or the superior mesenteric vein involvement. The patient was hypothermic and moderately acidotic, fostering a DCS.

Chest imaging revealed an anterior mediastinum mass with enlarged lymph nodes and a left pleura metastasis. A small needle biopsy of the anterior mediastinal mass revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the thymus (). Immunohistochemistry showed that 70% of the cells were positive for PD-L1. The patient was administered first-line treatment with paclitaxel liposomes plus carboplatin; however, the disease continued to progress. Next, immunotherapy was initiated with pembrolizumab as second-line treatment, and the patient showed progressive disease after 2 cycles of immunotherapy. Subsequently, the treatment was modified to include combination therapy with albumin paclitaxel as a third-line treatment, which led to significant disease remission after 2 cycles. Upon examination, the patient showed only slight progress after the 3rd cycle (), and was switched to treatment with pembrolizumab plus anlotinib, which subsequently resulted in progressive disease. This was followed by the introduction of palliative radiotherapy, and concurrent administration of targeted therapy with anlotinib. Combination therapy with anlotinib plus pembrolizumab was continued for 16 cycles as a part of a sequential regimen, resulting in the maintenance of stable disease until December 2019 (), when an enlarged pleural tubercle and new bone metastases were observed (). As a consequence of these findings, the third-line chemotherapy was judged to be ineffective, and the patient was switched to one cycle of combination therapy with pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine. To our surprise, the patient exhibited a partial response (). Furthermore, during the entire course of pembrolizumab immunotherapy and immunocombination therapy with albumin paclitaxel/anlotinib, the patient experienced only grade 1 nausea without any additional immunotherapy-related side effects.

At 7 days post-partum, her serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level was 12,656IU/L.

Her obstetric history was notable for two previous low-transverse cesarean section deliveries and two curettages were without any complication. The pathology report after curettage was confirmed to be decidual tissue.\nPhysical examination was normal. The gynecologic examination of the vulva and vagina was normal, the cervix was closed, the uterus was larger than normal at about 10-12 weeks of gestation, retrovert axis and she had mild bleeding. In the clinical test, her Hb was 12.4, U/A was NL (without hematuria), BHCG was 112 mUI/mL and other coagulation tests, hepatic and renal tests and electrolytes were normal. Transvaginal sonography was performed as requested: UT > NI, retrovert uterus, endometrial thickness = 2.6 mm, hypoechotic mass about 8 cm in the lower uterine segment with necrotic change and increased vascularity with low resistance was seen around it []. Differential diagnosis included invasive mole, chorio carcinoma and uterine tumors, including degenerating myoma. Total abdominal sonography and chest X ray were normal. Surgical intervention was suggested and arranged to confirm the diagnosis and to remove the lower uterine segment mass. Surgery was performed with the patient under general anesthesia and in the 15-degree Trendelenburg position. A Foley catheter was inserted preoperatively to empty the bladder. She received suction and curettage. After removing the debris and much necrotic tissue, vaginal hemorrhage could not be controlled during operation. The decision fell on laparatomy.

    "original_text": "A 32-year old man with no significant past medical history presented with a several month history of a non-healing ulcerative lesion under his right axilla. On examination, multiple palpable subcutaneous nodules were present in the axilla, groin, face, neck and chest wall. Excisional biopsy of the axillary lesion showed a poorly differentiated HA (). The diagnosis of carcinoma was supported by positive immunohistochemical staining for keratins (AE1/AE3 and CK7). In addition, the tumor was strongly positive for estrogen receptor (ER), but negative for Her/2neu overexpression. Staging with positron emission tomographic computed tomography (PET CT, ) scan showed multiple enlarged hyper-metabolic nodes in the right axilla and bilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes. A lytic lesion in the posterior right 5th rib was also seen. The patient was not thought to be a surgical candidate secondary to metastatic disease. A single case report in the literature found prolonged response to paclitaxel and carboplatin, and therefore, we offered our patient palliative cytotoxic chemotherapy with this regimen. The patient completed three cycles of chemotherapy and restaging scans revealed progressive disease in the bilateral axilla. Given the progressive disease, chemotherapy was stopped and the patient received palliative radiation to his bilateral axilla, to which he had a significant response.

She had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy and open appendectomy previously. She did not have any medical, family, or psychosocial history. She had missed her menstrual period without any other symptom and visited a private obstetrical clinic to confirm the pregnancy. However, she was diagnosed as having an abnormal pregnancy such as cervical or CSP by USG.\nAt our institution, she reported that her last menstrual period was just 5 to 6 weeks prior. However, USG revealed a gestational sac in the anterior lower uterine segment with a fetus measuring 4.83 cm crown-rump length (CRL) with positive cardiac activity, corresponding to 11 weeks and 6 days of gestation. Color/power Doppler images depicted a hyperechoic rim of a choriodecidual reaction with excessive vascularity (Fig. ). Although we could observe a definitive abnormally located gestational sac, our patient did not have any pain during the physical examination. She admitted that her last menstrual period was different from her usual menstrual periods. Because CSP or cervical pregnancy was suspected, we performed computed tomography (CT) for a definitive diagnosis. The CT scan showed an intrauterine gestational sac in the lower uterine segment bulging through the anterior uterine wall at the site of the cesarean scar. No invasion of the urinary bladder was observed (Fig. ). On presentation, her \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) level was 66,536.8 IU/L (Day 1). Initially, we injected 50 mg of methotrexate (MTX) mixed with 9 mL of normal saline in the amniotic sac through a 22-G needle transabdominally under USG guidance. Simultaneously, 2 ml of amniotic fluid was aspirated for termination of the pregnancy. However, fetal cardiac activity was still observed 2 days later (Day 3), without significant changes",

Thereafter, he showed an inability to control his emotions for some time, but this eventually resolved, and he lived a stable life without major problems.\nAt the age of 12 years, the patient passed an entertainment office audition and subsequently performed on TV programs and on the stage. During high school, he studied in Australia and obtained tattoos on his whole back, which is uncommon behavior for a Japanese student. During college, he was the captain of a dance team. At 21 years, he had a child. Thus, his behaviors from the ages of 12 to 21 could be interpreted as showing a disinhibited tendency. After college graduation, he initially worked on a motor race rescue team for 4 years before switching to work in his family\u2019s company. At 29 years, he experienced a problem with his relationship with his sister and became estranged from his family.\nThe patient began working as an apparel retailer and was taking lessons for Japanese classical dance and classical ballet. He frequently went dancing in nightclubs, reversing his day/night cycle. According to the patient\u2019s wife, the patient stated, \u201cI communicate with the universe\u201d during this period.

The patient met the criteria of ESUS, and a thorough examination was performed to determine the cause. Transesophageal echocardiography showed minor plaque formation in the aortic arch (a potential cause of aortogenic embolism) and absence of a patent foramen ovale (a potential cause of paradoxical embolism). The patient had the HAVOC score of 4 (hypertension, age). Although CPAF was not identified by telemetry at admission, it was suspected and we decided to implant an ICM device.

He initially presented with a two-week history of weakness and lethargy and a one-week history of vomiting, polyuria and polydipsia. He became acutely confused in the 24 hours prior to his admission to our hospital and registered 12 on the Glasgow Coma Scale. On examination he was normotensive with a regular pulse of 70 beats per minute. There was a left-sided mass in the anterior triangle of his neck measuring 3 \u00d7 3 cm. The mass was firm, regular, non-tender and mobile. See Figure and Table for results of the initial laboratory investigations.\nAn ultrasonography of his neck showed a 4 \u00d7 3 cm large cyst in the left lobe of his thyroid gland. His parathyroid glands were not visualised. A 99 mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy scan was performed, and no evidence of a parathyroid adenoma was found. An electrocardiogram revealed acute changes with ST depression in leads II, III, aVF and V2 to V6. An echocardiogram showed good left ventricular failure (LVF) with an ejection fraction of 63%.\nInitial management included aggressive fluid resuscitation, cardiac monitoring and the administration of intravenous bisphosphonates. A left thyroid lobectomy and left lower parathyroidectomy were performed. At the time of operation, a haemorrhagic cyst with a parathyroid gland within it was visualised. A biopsy was taken from the left upper parathyroid gland. Histology revealed a 4 cm parathyroid carcinoma within the cyst which was fully excised. The cyst had a macroscopic measurement of 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 cm. The wall of the cyst contained a well-circumscribed, unencapsulated soft tissue mass measuring 4 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 0.7 cm. It was light yellow-tan in colour and firm in consistency. There was a small amount of normal thyroid parenchyma within the specimen. The",

The patient had a history of prematurity (gestational age of 30 weeks) due to premature rupture of the membranes. Diagnosed with hydrocephalus in the early infancy, he had undergone ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting at the age of 6 months and had several shunt revision surgeries since then. The medical records including previous brain imaging and the reports of surgeries performed in other institutions were not available. There was no notable family history. Physical examination revealed delayed filling of the shunt's pump. Neurological examination was unremarkable.\nA brain MRI with and without contrast showed dilation of the cerebral aqueduct and enlargement of the fourth ventricle. A cystic area existed within the fourth ventricle, extending through the cerebral aqueduct toward the third ventricle. The cyst contained a fluid with the signal intensity similar to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and was not enhanced after administration of the intravenous contrast. These findings were compatible with an intraventricular arachnoid cyst.\nBased on these findings, we scheduled two procedures: Replacement of the pump of the shunt and endoscopic fenestration (ECF) of the cyst. A midline suboccipital craniotomy was made.
