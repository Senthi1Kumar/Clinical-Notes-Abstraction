He was the first-born child to unrelated healthy parents, born at 38 weeks of gestation after an unremarkable pregnancy. His birth weight was 3.5 kg, and meconium was passed on the first day of life. The patient had no history of meconium ileus or diabetes mellitus and lacked family history of CF. Tracing back his medical history, the patient was formula feeding but failure to thrive with a weight of 6.8 kg at the age of 8 months and had intermittent diarrhea. For further evaluation of the condition of growth and development, the patient was taken to a local hospital at the age of 8 months, and received complete blood count and liver function tests. And the results indicated liver involvement with slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) with values of 78 and 82 U/L, respectively. The patient suffered from recurrently and slightly elevated ALT levels ranging from 70 to 92 U/L and AST levels ranging from 80 to 90 U/L. In addition, the common etiologies that easily lead to increased levels of ALT and AST were also excluded, such as cytomegalovirus and hepatitis B virus infection.

A rectal digital examination of the prostate revealed an enlarged irregular prostate with right-side nodule. Laboratory tests including complete blood count, serum biochemical analysis, urine analysis, and urine culture were performed. All of the results of the tests were normal, except for his PSA value (23ng/mL). In response to the physical examination signs and PSA, he underwent a transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUSG) prostate biopsy. The pathologic examination of the prostate revealed a Gleason score of 3+4=7 adenocarcinoma of the prostate. After the pathologic result, a computed tomography (CT) of his abdomen with contrast agent and scintigraphy of his bones were performed to decide the stage of the carcinoma. The investigations showed stage T2N0M0 disease. He was diagnosed as localized PCa and treatment alternatives were explained and discussed with him. He preferred radiotherapy and was treated with radiation to his pelvic lymph nodes (46Gy in 23 fractions) and three-dimensional conformal boost of his prostate (24Gy in 12 fractions).\nThe recurrence of the carcinoma was not observed in the follow up and he was free of recurrence until 2009. Six years after initial diagnosis and when he was 80-years old, he had a complaint of palpable left-side 2\u00d72cm subcutaneous solitary mass, which localized just behind his scapula. He told us that he had noticed this mass for 2 months. The results of his laboratory tests including serum acid phosphatase and PSA were in normal ranges. The initial diagnosis was considered to be a lipoma and he was referred for a general surgery consultation. The general surgery department performed a diagnostic biopsy of the mass and totally excised the lesion.

    "original_text": "A 31-year-old female patient underwent left hepatectomy for an enlarging focal nodular hyperplasia tumor in April 2015. The diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, which clearly showed typical features of focal nodular hyperplasia. Nevertheless, the patient was accepted for surgery due to the significant growth of the tumor (up to 6 cm in diameter) which doubled its size within 2 years. Following surgery, the patient presented with increasing jaundice (bilirubin of 9 mg/dl on day 7.) and abdominal pain with vomiting. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed a large fluid collection that was adjacent to the liver transection plane and proved to be bilious in origin at percutaneous drainage. A drain was left inside the collection and a biliary leak of around 300\u2013600 ml/daily continued. At endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) which was performed twice, a slight leak combined with poor filling of the intrahepatic bile ducts was shown. At that time we believed the compromised filling of the intrahepatic bile ducts was due to the narrowing at the confluence. The common bile duct was stented endoscopically with a plastic (8.5 Fr) stent (day 8.) and as the leak continued, a self-expandable metallic stent (day 15.) was inserted. A few hours following the second ERC procedure, the patient presented with sudden abdominal pain, hypotension and a drop in hemoglobin from 12.2 to 6.6 mg/l due to a splenic rupture that was confirmed by the CT scan. An emergent relaparotomy was performed. During surgery, the patient required blood transfusion with inotropic support and her condition was unstable. In view of this, surgery was limited to splenectomy, abdominal lavage and drainage.

    "cleaned_text": "a 31-year-old female patient underwent left hepatectomy for an enlarging focal nodular hyperplasia tumor in april 2015. the diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, which clearly showed typical features of focal nodular hyperplasia. nevertheless, the patient was accepted for surgery due to the significant growth of the tumor (up to 6 cm in diameter) which doubled its size within 2 years. following surgery, the patient presented with increasing jaundice (bilirubin of 9 mg/dl on day 7.) and abdominal pain with vomiting. abdominal ultrasound confirmed a large fluid collection that was adjacent to the liver transection plane and proved to be bilious in origin at percutaneous drainage. a drain was left inside the collection and a biliary leak of around 300\u2013600 ml/daily continued. at endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (erc) which was performed twice, a slight leak combined with poor filling of the intrahepatic bile ducts was shown. at that time we believed the compromised filling of the intrahepatic bile ducts was due to the narrowing at the confluence. the common bile duct was stented endoscopically with a plastic (8.5 fr) stent (day 8.) and as the leak continued, a self-expandable metallic stent (day 15.) was inserted. a few hours following the second erc procedure, the patient presented with sudden abdominal pain, hypotension and a drop in hemoglobin from 12.2 to 6.6 mg/l due to a splenic rupture that was confirmed by the ct scan. an emergent relaparotomy was performed. during surgery, the patient required blood transfusion with inotropic support and her condition was unstable. in view of this, surgery was limited to splenectomy, abdominal lavage and drainage. considering dense adhesions within the hepatoduodenal ligament and no obvious source of a biliary leak visible, no intraoperative investigations of the biliary tree were pursued. following splenectomy the condition of the patient improved, however the biliary leak persisted. at this stage, it was thought to originate from the cut surface of the liver. therefore, the patient",

Her inflammatory markers were somewhat elevated, and an enhanced CT showed that one of the multiple spleens did not pick up the contrast (Fig. a). We diagnosed her with splenic infarction; however, the cause of the infarction was unclear, and torsion or embolism was considered possibilities. The patient was admitted and began conservative therapy, including fasting and antibiotic administration. However, neither her abdominal pain nor inflammatory marker levels improved (Fig. b). Hence, we performed a follow-up enhanced-CT scan, 2 days after admission, which showed that the splenic infarction had not improved and that ascitic fluid was present around the spleen and in the pelvic space (Fig. ). At this point, we decided to surgically remove the infarcted spleen. Considering that the patient was a young woman, we elected to perform a laparoscopic splenectomy after receiving informed consent.\nThe surgery was performed under general anesthesia, with the patient in a supine position and her legs spread apart.

He presented soon after the incident in the emergency room with swelling of the face and neck with the change in voice. He was not comfortable lying down and preferred to sit up. There was no evidence of external injury to the neck. He was hemodynamically stable and maintaining oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96-98% on room air. The anterior-posterior and lateral X-rays of the neck showed a rightward deviation of the trachea, evidence of soft tissue injury, and surgical emphysema []. The chest X-ray did not reveal any evidence of pneumothorax []. A computerized tomography scan of the neck could not be done as he was unable to lie down.\nHe was evaluated by the ENT resident who admitted him for observation in the general ward. Six hours later, the patient complained of difficulty in breathing and worsening of the surgical emphysema of the face and neck was noted. The SpO2 was 95% despite oxygen supplementation using a venture face mask set at FiO2 0.6. He was hemodynamically stable, alert, and talking. The anesthesiologist on call was requested to evaluate the patient. He immediately recognized the gravity of the situation and the possibility of blunt tracheal injury and decided that any further assessment and airway management was to be performed in the operating room (OR). The patient was shifted to the OR in the upright position on oxygen and a senior anesthesiologist was called in to help.

    "original_text": "The patient, a 30-year-old Tibetan man, was treated in the Lhasa Hospital for right tibiofibular fracture December 2012 (Fig. ). After the swelling subsided, he underwent right tibia fracture intramedullary internal fixation. Two weeks after the operation, the patient was able to walk with double crutches without load, and was able to walk without crutches and with some load 3 months after the operation. However, the patient complained of pain in his right lower extremity, especially when moving downhill or down stairs, and experienced a limping gait and obvious tenderness at the fracture end. Three years after originally presenting at Lhasa Hospital, the patient was experiencing persistent pain in the right lower extremity, and his daily activities were severely affected. Thus, he was re-diagnosed with nonunion of the right tibial fracture after internal fixation (Fig. ). The main causes of the nonunion of the fracture were considered to be the excessively thin intramedullary nails and unstable fixation of the fracture. The operation was repeated with replacement of the crude intramedullary nails and grafting of iliac bone (Fig. ). Three months after the operation, the tibial fracture had failed to heal, and further surgical treatment was performed. The proximal locking screw of the intramedullary nail was removed with an expectation to eliminate the stress shielding effect and to promote fracture healing by increasing the microdynamic force while retaining the static interlocking nail. Five months after the operation, the patient abandoned the crutches and was able to walk with a heavy load. Nevertheless, 2 years after the operation, active pain of the right leg persisted with some tenderness around the fracture, especially when moving downhill or down stairs. August 2018 the patient was admitted to our hospital.

The child had difficulty in having food and also had breathlessness.\nOn examination, a single swelling was seen in the floor of the mouth, measuring approximately 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 cm. The mucosa over the swelling was red in color and showed a bluish hue. The consistency of the swelling was soft and the borders were regular. The surface was smooth and nonulcerated. There was no pain or tenderness. Radiological findings showed no abnormality. The CT scan findings revealed a well-defined cystic lesion of approximately 4.9 \u00d7 3.1 \u00d7 3 cm in floor of the mouth with a small locule extending posteriorly and compromising anterior pharyngeal space []. There was no evidence of cervical lymphadenopathy nor did the swelling show any relation with the thyroid gland. Based on the above findings, a clinical diagnosis of ranula was given and surgical excision was planned. Hematological investigations were done and the results were in normal limits. Chest X-ray showed clear lung fields and normal cardiac size and configuration. An intraoral approach was taken for the surgical excision of the lesion.\nThe swelling was excised completely and sent for histopathological examination. On gross examination, the lesional tissue was creamish brown in color and measured 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1.8 cm in size, it was soft in consistency, with smooth borders and surface []. On sectioning of the specimen, a cystic cavity was seen containing a thick creamish brown cheesy material with a foul odor.

From the 5th day, the patient had complex signs and symptoms, including fever, shortness of breath, increasing sepsis, and a large volume of chest drainage. An oral methylene blue test showed that methylene blue drained into the chest tube. By a radiography swallow contrast examination, we found that all of the water-soluble contrast medium had extravasated into the pleural space and drained into the chest tube. The patient was initially managed conservatively after diagnosis of the leak. After strict conservative therapy, the patient showed an increasing amount of sustained sepsis and multiple organ failure. On postoperative day 14, we had to perform thoracotomy from the primary incision, and found two thirds of anastomosis dehiscence. Although the anastomosis dehiscence was large and all of the contents of digestive fluid went directly into the cavity, chest tube drainage was efficient, and thus the cavity infection was not serious. There was gastric outlet obstruction and high tension between the gastric conduit and esophagus. Primary anastomotic repair was difficult and high risk. Therefore we closed the gastric conduit with a linear cutter stapler and returned it to the abdominal cavity.

Abdominal pain was generalized, 6 by 10 in intensity on the pain scale, and dull in character. It was worsened by food intake and relieved by bowel movement. The abdominal pain was associated with fever, chills, nausea and vomiting. The patient also complained of painful rashes all over his body that had erupted suddenly about a week ago. The rashes were nonpruritic and had started on the dorsum of his hands and spread to involve his face, neck, chest and legs. He denied using any new creams, soaps, detergents or perfumes or any change in his bed sheets or clothing. He also denied contact with pets, recent travel, a similar rash in any other family member, or being bitten by an insect. He denied having had any similar rash in the past. He had a history of Crohn's disease for the past thirty years which had been in remission for several years, until the past few months when he began to have episodes of diarrhea and rectal bleeding. Colonoscopy two years ago had showed inflammatory bowel disease of segmental nature with rectal sparing and primarily involving the ascending and sigmoid colon. His medications included Asacol which he had been taking for past few months and azathioprine which was started two weeks prior to his admission. He had previously been on prednisone which was started two months earlier with his last dose being four days prior to admission. His vital signs on presentation were: Temperature 100.5\u00b0F, blood pressure 95/58 mmHg, heart rate 120/min and respiratory rate 21 b/min.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 60-year-old man who was the husband of the patient described above. He experienced lumbago on the same morning his wife was hospitalized. Fever and disturbance of consciousness occurred in the evening, and he visited the emergency room at another hospital. He had completed the course of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation for glioblastoma 6 years ago, and was able to carry out his daily activities independently. He had no medical history of pneumonia or a history of pneumococcal vaccination. Although right lumbar pain was observed, the origin of fever was unknown; antimicrobial treatment was initiated with 4.5 g piperazine/tazobactam every 8 h. The results of the blood test taken at hospitalization are shown in Table . Pneumococcus was detected in his blood culture as well, and the regimen was changed to 2 g ABPC every 6 h. There were abnormal findings in the lumbar MRI scan taken on hospital day 2. Nonetheless, the results of the spinal fluid test, head MRI, thoracoabdominal contrast CT, transesophageal echocardiography, did not reveal presence of infection at other sites. Because lumbago persisted, MRI was performed again on hospital day 9; the consequent MRI results revealed purulent spondylitis (Fig. ). The patient was transferred to our hospital on hospital day 9.

A conservative surgical curettage was listed as having been done under general anesthesia and the pathological diagnosis was reported as a benign fibro-osseous lesion.\nPresent clinical examination revealed a diffuse extraoral swelling on the left side of the face extending from the midline of the lower lip to tragus of ear anteroposteriorly and extending from ala-tragus line to submandibular region superior-inferiorly. Skin overlying the swelling was normal and tender on palpation. Intraorally it was extending from the lower right lateral incisor to left ramus of the mandible with the obliteration of vestibule. No mobility of teeth was detected and the oral hygiene status appeared to be well maintained. No neurological deficits involving mental or inferior alveolar nerve were elicited.\nOn radiographic examination, orthopantomograph (OPG) showed a large multilocular radiolucency with well-defined sclerotic borders with the expansion of the cortical plates []. Serum alkaline phosphatase level was elevated with the value of 209 IU/L. Routine preoperative investigations were within normal limits and following a preanesthetic evaluation the patient was posted for resection of the lesion under general anesthesia. Segmental mandibulectomy was done under general anesthesia with the preservation of about 3 mm posterior border of the ramus and it was stabilized using 2.5 mm reconstruction plates [].

    "original_text": "The second patient was a 5-year-old girl who presented to the office with a history of receiving a diagnosis of FSGS at the age of 3.5 after proteinuria was identified when she presented to her pediatrician experiencing new onset enuresis. The family sought care from the authors due to chronic symptoms and illnesses in all family members and history of exposure to water-damaged environments in past and current homes. Due to the father's work, the family has moved frequently. They recall evidence of water damage and mold in several of their previous homes and confirmed the presence of elevated levels of indoor mold in their current home. The patient's diet was typical for her age and did not include excessive consumption of foods known to contain elevated levels of ochratoxin.\nTesting indicated the patient did not have a genetic cause for FSGS. Upon diagnosis she was placed on a 6-week course of high-dose prednisone and has since used tacrolimus and enalapril as well as galactose. Her protein excretion in urine is followed regularly, and her mother reports an increased level of proteinuria upon moving to their most recent home.\nShe was born by NSVD at 39 weeks gestation.

Detailed examinations were consequently performed, and direct oral anticoagulant therapy was initiated to treat the inferior vena cava thrombosis.\nThe FDG-PET revealed an abnormal accumulation of FDG in the margin of the mass and the sigmoid colon, but not in any other organs.

Patellar tracking was normal. Simple X-ray of the knee showed no abnormalities and a discoid medial meniscus with peripheral and horizontal tear and the upper side of the meniscus folded in the intercondylar notch was found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with no other abnormalities associated ().\nAn arthroscopy of the right knee was performed with the thigh in a leg holder using standard anterolateral and anteromedial portals under general anesthesia. A complete medial discoid meniscus with a partial longitudinal tear in red zone of the body and posterior horn was found. Its upper side was folded to the intercondylar notch behaving as a bucket handle tear (). The tear was found to be reducible with a probe. It was refreshed with a shaver () and the meniscus was repaired using an inside-out technique with a specific suturing device () [] and number 2 Force-Fiber suture (Stryker Endoscopy, San Jose CA).

    "original_text": "The patient was a 60-year-old man. Abdominal ultrasonography indicated that he had an abdominal mass. He reported having perceived lower abdominal pain 7 months before the initial examination, but it spontaneously remitted. The patient had no fever nor any history of conditions such as hypertension. A blood test revealed that he did not have anemia, thrombocytopenia, or coagulation abnormalities. The patient demonstrated slightly elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (4.7 ng/ml) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (603 U/ml), tumor markers that are elevated in gastrointestinal cancers and malignant lymphoma. Contrast-enhanced CT showed a 33\u00d7 31 mm abdominal aortic aneurysm and a 106 \u00d7 81 mm mass peripheral to the abdominal aorta. The mass did not feature a contrast effect, and its margin was enhanced in the venous phase (Fig. ). Sigmoid wall thickening and inferior vena cava thrombosis were also observed (Fig. ). We suspected the patient had a neoplastic disease, such as a malignant lymphoma or sigmoid colon cancer. Detailed examinations were consequently performed, and direct oral anticoagulant therapy was initiated to treat the inferior vena cava thrombosis.\nThe FDG-PET revealed an abnormal accumulation of FDG in the margin of the mass and the sigmoid colon, but not in any other organs. Colonoscopy showed only mild inflammation in the sigmoid colon, and a sigmoid colon biopsy revealed no significant findings. Chronic inflamed fibrous connective tissue was harvested from the periaortic mass using CT-guided biopsy. There were no findings indicative of infection or neoplastic disease, thus precluding a pathological diagnosis.\nAt 1 month after the initial examination, intermittent claudication occurred, prompting the performance of follow-up contrast-enhanced CT scanning.

However, the pain experienced during the week preceding ED presentation was much more severe in character. Of note, he had been seen by his general practitioner in the week preceding ED attendance with intense right hip pain on weight-bearing and passive movement and had been referred to the elderly care team with a view to optimising pain management.\nPlain film radiography obtained in the emergency department () demonstrated a lytic lesion within the right femoral neck, intertrochanteric region, and proximal femoral metaphysis with evidence of cortical breach and progressive sunburst periosteal reaction.\nThe patient was admitted for further investigation and assessment. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis () confirmed a bony lesion affecting both the right acetabulum and proximal femur with pathological intertrochanteric fracture and abnormal surrounding soft tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) () findings were felt to be consistent with that of a primary bone tumor; tumoral necrosis was evident, and thigh muscles demonstrated oedema to the knee level. No lymphadenopathy was seen. Nuclear medicine scanning () demonstrated avid uptake in the right acetabulum and proximal femur with cortical breakthrough and marked extension to the surrounding thigh compartments but no uptake suggestive of distant disease.

The patient's relevant medical history included an open myomectomy 6 years ago with the removal of 4 leiomyomas, without the patient's knowledge of their location, and also a complicated appendectomy with peritonitis 1 year afterwards. She is programmed for laparoscopic myomectomy with previous bowel preparation and multidisciplinary evaluation in case of dense bowel adhesions. Bowel preparation was achieved with oral administration of sodium dibasic phosphate and 45 mL of sodium monobasic phosphate in half a glass of water, taking a separate, second glass of water 30 minutes later. Same dose was repeated 60 minutes later. Laparoscopy was performed placing an intraumbilical 5 mm trocar by direct vision and 1 accessory 5 mm trocar on the right and left lower pelvic quadrant, 3 cm above the iliac crest. Upon the introduction of the laparoscope multiple adhesions were observed (see ); the uterus was not visible upon initial evaluation. The left accessory trocar was placed and adhesiolysis was performed with ultrasonic energy instrument, in order to correctly identify and place the right accessory trocar. Once the adhesions were removed in the right lower quadrant of the pelvis, the accessory 5 mm trocar was placed as previously described. Removal of multiple adhesions from bowel to uterus had to be performed as well as from left and right ovaries and their respective Fallopian tubes (see ).

Gross hematuria was not reported. There is no family history of urinary tract malignancy. Family history is notable for pancreatic cancer and ovarian cancer in non-first-degree relatives. Her prior surgical history includes teeth extractions and arm surgery. The patient does not smoke, but her father does smoke outside home. An ultrasound of the pelvis was obtained during a hospital admission which showed a 7 mm echogenic focus along the posterior wall of the bladder. Urogynecology then evaluated her as an outpatient. On presentation to urogynecology with her mother (primary caregiver), patient was noted to be physically well developed and well-nourished and in no acute distress in a wheelchair. She had abnormal facies and mentation. General physical and abdominal examinations were normal. Patient was unable to tolerate a full examination in the office; therefore, the decision was made to proceed with an examination under anesthesia and cystourethroscopy. Cystourethroscopy revealed an estimated 1.5 cm papillary cauliflower-like lesion on the right bladder sidewall lateral to the ureteral orifice. Cytology revealed atypical urothelial clusters. Biopsy revealed low grade Ta urothelial carcinoma, negative for invasion of lamina propria, with muscle not present for evaluation. Immunohistochemical stains CK20 and P53 were negative. The pathology specimen was reevaluated and noted as low grade papillary urothelial cancer without identified invasion and without muscularis propria sampled. Patient was referred to urology for further evaluation and treatment. Urology performed a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor which was noted to be 1 cm on a narrow stalk. Complete resection of the bladder tumor was performed with mucosa around the stalk of the bladder tumor removed as well with no evidence",

    "original_text": "The first case we present is that of a 29-year-old woman who presented to the clinic with the complaint of an enlarging left breast mass. She first noticed that this mass almost 2 years ago and mentions that it has been growing in size and becoming more erythematous and tender. She did not report any recent weight loss or change in appetite. She is married with 2 children, and she does not have any illnesses. She smokes hubble-bubble almost 4 times per week and does not drink alcohol. Surgical history is significant for 2 previous Cesarean sections with no complications. History of her current illness dates back to June 2016 when the patient felt a mass in her left breast; upon further investigation, she was diagnosed with idiopathic granulomatous mastitis and later (December 2017) developed an abscess that drained on its own. She was initially treated with methotrexate and later switched to prednisone and mycophenolate with minimal improvement. At the clinic, her vitals were within normal limits, and on physical examination, there was a left breast lump found at the upper inner quadrant with some erythema and inflammation surrounding it. Moreover, there was some skin retraction in this area.\nCore biopsy done at an outside hospital in June 2017 revealed no granulomas. Ultrasound done at that time showed a persistent ill-defined hypoechoic mass that appeared initially subdermally and was spanning more than 4 \u00d7 1.4 cm. Moreover, multiple deeper masses were seen, one of which was not located within the breast measuring 12.3 \u00d7 8.5 mm.

    "original_text": "A 33-year-old woman had a history of recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). The first episode occurred at 28 years of age. Sudden onset of right-sided weakness occurred and recovered spontaneously after 2 hours. Further, when the patient was 29 years old, sudden aphasia occurred and subsided spontaneously later in the day. Moreover, when she was 30 years old, right-sided weakness and aphasia occurred simultaneously, and she visited Seoul National University Hospital for the first time. On cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a congenital left ventricular diverticulum (LVD) at the apical lateral wall of the left ventricle was discovered (). The LVD was 2.6\u00d73 cm in size, and the wall motion of the diverticulum was synchronous with that of the left ventricle. There was a possibility that the LVD was the source of the cardiogenic embolism that induced the recurrent TIAs. However, at that time, the patient did not undergo an operation and was just observed, with daily administration of aspirin (100 mg).\nWhen the patient was 33 years old, right-sided weakness and aphasia recurred. This time, brain MRI showed acute infarction in the left middle cerebral artery territory. Cardiac MRI showed no change in the LVD. Computed tomography (CT) angiography also revealed an LVD (). The patient recovered from the cerebral infarction after anticoagulation therapy. Although there was no definite evidence of a thrombus in the LVD, we decided to operate this time.\nThe operation was performed using standard cardiopulmonary bypass. Median sternotomy was conducted, and standard ascending aorta and bicaval venous cannulation was used. Several pieces of gauze were placed below the heart, and the apex was elevated.

The patient was on antihypertensive treatment and had received treatment for tuberculosis one year before. She had no history of smoking; however, she might have been exposed to passive smoking while working as a washroom cleaner. A 2 cm mass was observed in the upper lobe of her left lung and transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma.\nThe patient underwent a left upper lobectomy in March 2005 and her postoperative stage was determined as T2N0M0. After surgical resection, there was no recurrence for approximately one year. However, multiple growing nodules were detected in the remaining part of her left lung on a follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan performed in June 2006. Serial CT scans revealed that the slow, but continuously growing nodules were recurrent lung cancer.\nThe patient refused further surgical treatment or any invasive procedure. Therefore, first-line chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin was initiated in April 2007. Although a follow-up CT after two cycles showed stable disease (SD), administration of chemotherapy was ceased because she could not tolerate the drug toxicity.\nAfter five months of rest, a CT revealed growing nodules; hence, second-line treatment with 250 mg/day gefitinib was started in November 2007. A partial response was shown on follow-up CT in December 2007 (Fig ). The dose was adjusted depending on tolerability, and eventually decreased to 250 mg every third day because of grade 3 skin toxicity.\nThe lung nodules had started growing since May 2009. While Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) indicated progressive disease, she did not experience any worsening of symptoms; therefore, we continued treatment with gefitinib. Although a follow-up CT showed a smoldering progression of metastatic lesions (Fig ), continued treatment with gefitinib controlled the pulmonary adenocarcinoma for more than six years. Treatment with gefitinib was discontinued in April 2014 because she no longer received reimbursement from the health",
