Pain was acute in onset, continuous, severe in the beginning but later it was moderate and localized over the anterior aspect of left hip. It was aggravated by limb movement and relieved by rest. There was no radiation of pain. Pain was accompanied by diffuse swelling of the whole left hip region predominantly over the anterior aspect. On examination the swelling was diffuse, soft, localized to upper part of thigh, non-translucent, non-illuminant, non-fluctuant, non-pulsatile and not fixed to the bone. There was deep tenderness over the scarpa's triangle. Local temperature was slightly raised. Straight leg raising test was negative. Bitrochanteric compression test was positive, and there was supratrochanteric shortening of 1.5 cm on the left side. The limb was in flexion, abduction and external rotation. There was no deformity at the knee. There was painful restriction of all movements of the left hip joint.\nRoutine blood investigations were within normal limits. Plain radiographs of the left hip anteroposterior and lateral views were done. It showed complete separation of proximal femoral epiphysis of the head of the femur [Type I B fracture] and its gross displacement in the medial compartment of proximal thigh region. For further management Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI] of the left hip was done. It showed complete traumatic separation of proximal femur epiphysis and its gross displacement in the medial compartment of the thigh. The epiphysis was still viable. The patient was planned for surgery. In supine position the hip joint was opened by anterolateral [Watson Jones] approach. The epiphysis was located with blunt dissection and fluoroscopy. It was replaced back in the acetabulum and transfixed with the help of a k wire. Hip spica was applied.",

After the thymoma resection, he had been well without recurrence, and received no medical treatment. His family history was also unremarkable. Vital signs were normal except a mild fever (37.8 \u00b0C). His general condition was normal (height: 160 cm, weight: 60 kg).

The left cingulate lesion was partly demonstrated as high-signal intensity in both DWI and ADC maps, suggesting that the lesion contains vasogenic edema. CSF examination was unremarkable, and no elevation of IgG or myelin basic protein was found. EEGs were within normal limits. Because the patient\u2019s neurological findings could not be explained by the cerebral lesions identified in the MRI, we considered the possibility that brain dysfunction might be induced beyond the location of the lesion. Although the CSF findings were normal, acyclovir (10 mg/kg, three times a day) was empirically administered, and his fever and neurological symptoms fully recovered within a few days. However, 1 week after admission, the patient\u2019s symptoms deteriorated again. Neurological examination revealed a reappearance of motor aphasia and mild right hemiparesis. The MRI demonstrated that the lesion involving the left cingulate gyrus increased in size, and an abnormal signal intensity lesion in the left corona radiata, which was presumably the cause of his right hemiparesis, and edematous swelling of the bilateral medial temporal regions appeared (Fig. ). These lesions were not significantly enhanced by Gadolinium. Although a limbic lesion was demonstrated by MRI, he exhibited no cognitive or psychiatric manifestations. The patient was physically intact without lymphadenopathy. A multi-slice CT scan showed no abnormal findings in his chest and body",

    "original_text": "A 64-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital's gastroenterology department. The patient had no specific medical history, except for dyslipidemia, and complained of rectal tenesmus, lasting for 1 month, and anal pain, which had progressively worsened for 10 days. At the time of arrival, stool occult blood test was negative and no relevant findings in other laboratory results were identified. An 8-mm polyp in the ascending colon was detected during colonoscopy, and hyperemic mucosal swelling with nodularity was noted at 4\u201317 cm from the anal verge (Fig. ). Biopsies performed for each lesion indicated adenoma and chronic colitis, respectively. Diffuse swelling throughout the rectum was seen on CT, and engorgement of the superior rectal veins with early draining was also observed (Fig. ). AVM-related venous hypertension was suspected as the cause of symptoms, and angiography was requested. On angiography performed 3 days later, rectal AVM was identified at the inferior mesenteric artery just before the beginning of the superior rectal arteries and was drained via fine feeders into the inferior mesenteric vein with a large venous aneurysm (Fig. ). Venous regurgitation by venous hypertension was also clearly observed through the retrograde flow of the superior rectal veins (Fig. ). After an in-depth discussion with the patient about the options for surgery or other endovascular embolization, transarterial sclerotherapy using ethanol was decided.

He had transient incomplete intestinal obstruction and urinary retention for 2 weeks before admission. On arrival, the nature of the intercostal pain (T9\u201310 level) was prickling or cutting, which was initially improved with pregabalin. Thus, we suspected early herpes zoster virus-related neuralgia, which is the most common form of neuralgia in the Department of Neurology. He had smoked 20 cigarettes per day for over 20 years. He was diagnosed with AS 40 years ago. He had a history of hypertension and sequelae of cerebral hemorrhage for more than 20 years, resulting in impaired speech and right limb paralysis, and had been bedridden for many years.

At the age of 2 years, she had been found to have a brainstem tumour, which was neither biopsied nor removed due to its location. She had received treatment with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt and her health had subsequently stabilized. At the age of 7 years, she was found to have eosinophilic granuloma of the bone affecting her right humerus and left femur, both of which were successfully resected, raising the question of whether her initial brain lesion may also have been a Langerhans cell histiocytoma.\nThe patient was noted to have enjoyed stable health until December 2009 when she developed a blockage of her ventriculoperitoneal shunt. This was replaced successfully. However, her neurological recovery was slower than expected with subsequent cranial imaging demonstrating local haemorrhage around the area of shunt replacement with a small area of infarction in the right plantar occipital region. Her original brainstem tumour was noted to be of consistent size with no evidence of progression. Serial lumbar punctures were performed, which demonstrated no evidence of infection. Slowly her condition improved and she was transferred to her local hospital for rehabilitation.\nOver the ensuing period, the patient developed progressive renal dysfunction with serum creatinine rising from 99 \u03bcmol/L in December 2009 to 400 \u03bcmol/L by May 2010. Progressively worsening proteinuria was noted with a urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) of 319 mg/mmol in December 2009 increasing to 4020 mg/mmol in May 2010.

He had initially presented to the Emergency Department with acute-on-chronic pain in his leg following a fall from his bicycle. He had taken codeine 30 mg four times daily for 1 day before presenting to the hospital. He was given 30 mg codeine at 1400 h, 10 mg oral morphine at 1450 h and 15 mg oral morphine at 1555 h that day. He was diagnosed with a slipped upper femoral epiphysis and operated on by the orthopaedic team. On the day of his operation, he was given 3 mg i.v. morphine immediately post-operatively and then 60 mg oral morphine and 100 mg tramadol in divided doses throughout the day. On the following day, he continued to experience pain and was given 50 mg oral morphine and 100 mg tramadol throughout the day. On day 3 post-operatively, suspicions were raised as he appeared young for his age and was relatively old to present with a slipped upper femoral epiphysis. His basal pituitary function was assessed and found to be abnormal.

Most laboratory test results revealed normal limits except for elevated white blood count (11,170/\u03bcL) and serum C-reactive protein level (1.6 mg/dL). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (Fig. ) revealed intussusception at the ileocecal region, which appeared as a \u201ctarget\u201d sign with a tumorous oval mass of 56 \u00d7 41 mm as a leading point of intussusception. An urgent operation was performed because of the risk of colonic ischemia due to intussusception. At laparotomy, the bowels had already spontaneously reduced, and a mass was palpable in the ileocecal region. We performed an ileocecal resection, aiming to avoid the potential of relapse of intussusception due to the residual mass. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on day 16 postoperatively.

Postoperatively, the patient noticed minimal improvement in her symptoms with persistence of right nasal obstruction. She also noticed right nasolabial fold fullness for a year, which increased in size over time associated with right facial pain. Clinical examination revealed a swelling in the right nasolabial fold measuring 2 \u00d7 1 cm. It was tender to palpation, hard in consistency, but with normal overlying skin. Anterior rhinoscopic examination of the right nasal cavity revealed lateral nasal wall swelling obliterating 90% of the nasal vestibule with normal overlying mucosa and skin colour externally. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a well-defined subcutaneous soft tissue density measuring 1.6 \u00d7 1.6 cm located in the right nasolabial fold. The lesion demonstrated isointensity with no drop in fat saturation T1 but showed hypointensity on T2 and homogeneous enhancement postcontrast ().\nIn August 2014, the patient underwent surgical excision of the mass through a sublabial approach, and the mass was found to be encapsulated with no infiltration to surrounding tissues and was excised completely with its capsule with uncomplicated postoperative period. Histopathological examination of the mass revealed spindle cells proliferation, forming fascicles and whorls on a background of collagen fibres. The fascicles were associated with foci of mixed inflammatory cells infiltrate composed mainly of lymphocytes and plasma cells, along with scattered eosinophils and neutrophils. The lesion infiltrates the surrounding striated muscles and fatty tissue with no infiltration to cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue.

Her past medical history is significant for breast cancer for which she had surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy 10 years ago. She was diagnosed with mixed phenotype AML about two years ago and has been treated with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, doxorubicin, vincristine, and cytarabine for three cycles. As there was no morphologic evidence of leukemia, she was then placed on maintenance therapy with 6-mercaptopurine, vincristine, methotrexate, and prednisone (POMP) for one year. During the past year, she developed febrile neutropenia with pneumonia and sepsis which required her to discontinue POMP in the last three months. After a three-month hiatus in treatment, she was noted to have recurrent pleural effusions which showed relapsed mixed phenotype acute leukemia. She was admitted for chemotherapy initiation with intra-thecal methotrexate and blinatumomab two weeks prior to the ER presentation. During her admission, she had placement of pleural catheter for recurrent left-sided pleural effusions. She tolerated the procedure and concurrent chemotherapy relatively well.

He had been seizure-free for the past year with an enteric-coated delayed release formulation of VPA (375 mg every 8 hours). Thirty days prior to hospital admission, he was started on LTG 25 mg/day along with VPA, since his seizures were no longer under control with VPA. Two weeks later, the dose was increased (50 mg/day). His morning trough plasma VPA level was measured before LTG was added to the therapy yielding a concentration of 85 mg/L. On admission, he presented macular lesions on the front of the thorax that extend to the back, followed by bilateral eyelid edema and ulcerated lesions at the level of lips, jugal mucosa, and pharynx. He developed erythematosus conjunctivitis with ulcers. He presented skin rash with high fever (39\u00b0C) and respiratory failure type I. History revealed that no such lesions occurred earlier and that was the first time such rashes have occurred. Other personal and family history was not relevant. From a dermatologic point of view and based on the history and clinical presentation, a diagnosis of SJS was made. Since the presumptive cause was LTG, the drug was discontinued immediately.

He was diagnosed with sigmoid colon tumor after colonoscopy showed a protuberant mass occupying the lumen with stenosis, 30 cm proximal to the anus. The patient had a history of hepatitis B since 1979 and was treated by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) only. He was first rushed to hospital in emergency in 2009 with the complaint of right upper abdominal pain for 7 h. After a CT scan, he was confirmed to have the rupture and hemorrhage due to liver cancer, as well as cirrhosis and splenomegaly. Right hepatectomy was performed, and postoperative pathology showed a moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma 65 \u00d7 31 \u00d7 61 mm in size with nodular cirrhosis, but the status of the lymphatic or vascular involvement was not reported by then. After the surgery, entecavir was prescribed by a hepatologist to control the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In October 2010, intrahepatic nodules were found during regular follow-up and treated by interventional therapy. In April 2013, arterial blood supply appeared in two nodules near the diaphragmatic surface of the right lobe of the liver when doing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up, and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) was used. In August 2013, anti-HBV treatment was restarted when HBV-DNA copy soared to 3.46 \u00d7 105 IU/ml. For the coming four and a half years, no signs of recurrence or metastasis was found until February 2018, when the patient felt a growing mass on the left side of the abdomen, and his alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level went up to as high as 5.00 \u00d7 104 ng/ml. CT scans considered the mass in his left middle abdomen to be an intraperitoneal implantation metastasis, 200 \u00d7 150 mm in size, and MRI also showed an intrahepatic metastasis in the infero-posterior segment of the right lobe of the liver",

The patient was diagnosed with FOP at the age of four when a red, painful gristle appeared on her back, which later turned into bone (Fig. ). This was followed by progressive ossification of the paravertebral muscles, leading to kyphoscoliosis, making her unable to erect herself by the age of ten. During her teenage years, occasional use of etidronate and methylprednisolone seemed to somewhat slow down formation of new HO foci. However, at the age of 25 (year 2000), new HO occurred in her right arm and both knees, followed by development of eating difficulties due to the affection of masticatory muscles (Fig. ). The patient herself reported subjective improvement of HO shortly after diagnostic X-ray, which led to the decision to start radiotherapy treatment. At the age of 27, she received a dose of 10 Gy (delivered in five fractions) on her right arm and 8 Gy (delivered in two fractions) on both knees. This halted HO progression over the following 2 years, as confirmed by X-ray. Keeping with the progressive nature of FOP, in 2004 new HO foci started developing. Radiation therapy was again attempted several times until 2010 on her right femur, infraclavicular region, neck and right hemithorax, where she was treated with 2 Gy in two, 6 Gy in six, 4 Gy in four, and 3 Gy in three fractions. The patient positively responded to the therapy and was well over the period of 9 years. However, another flare-up event occurred in 2019, with swelling and HO in the anterior part of the neck.

Laboratory findings also showed an elevation of liver enzymes, immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin E, erythrocyte sedimentation late, and C-reactive protein. Rheumatoid factor was positive, while antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) were negative (). Although mild liver dysfunction was noted occasionally in the history, transaminase had been less than twice the upper limit of the normal. Transaminase test examined 4 months before admission revealed within normal limits. Acute exacerbation of liver dysfunction was found a few days before admission and it was parallel to increase of eosinophilic counts. On physical examination, there was no wheeze. Indeed, her asthma symptom was well controlled on admission. The patient felt difficulty in walking due to weakness in her legs. Grip strength was 13 kg and 14 kg in the right and left hands, respectively. Painful paresthesia in the distal legs was noted.

He also had history of syncope about 2 weeks prior to presyncope with trivial trauma to neck. He did not complain of any abdominal or chest symptoms, and there was no history of nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, blurring of vision, or focal neurological deficit. He first sought medical attention at secondary care center where he was detected to have sinus bradycardia (). He was diagnosed as a case of sick sinus syndrome and referred to our center for permanent pacemaker implantation. The past, personal, and family history was noncontributory. On general physical examination, the patient was seen to be anxious. The heart rhythm was regular with a rate of 40 beats/min (the patient was not on any prior negative chronotropic drugs); the blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg and respiration was abdomino-thoracic with a rate of 20 breaths/min. The patient was conscious, well oriented, and there was no focal neurological deficit or neck rigidity. Findings from review of the systems, other than as reported above, were normal. Patient was admitted in the intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU) and kept on low-dose isoprenaline infusion that increased his heart rate to 50 beats/min. During his hospital stay, he was evaluated and his echocardiographic examination showed mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, grade 1 LV diastolic dysfunction, and normal LV systolic function (LV ejection fraction = 65%). Next day morning, he complained of severe acute headache that was treated and responded to oral paracetamol.

    "original_text": "A 68-year-old male with a history of recent hospitalization due to duodenal ulcer bleeding presented to the hospital in cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation led to a return of spontaneous circulation. During intubation, blood was observed in the oropharynx and a large amount of bright red blood was noted upon placement of an orogastric tube. He was persistently hypotensive and required aggressive resuscitation with three units of packed red blood cells for initial hemoglobin of 5.2g/dL. He underwent an urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which demonstrated multiple, large, conjoined duodenal ulcers in a deformed duodenal bulb that extended into the descending duodenum. A profusely bleeding vessel was seen at the base of the proximal duodenal bulb ulcer (Forrest Class 1A). In addition, a luminal metal coil with an overlying clot and debris was visualized at the base of a more distal duodenal bulb ulcer that extended into the descending duodenum (Figure ). Successful endoscopic hemostasis was achieved with epinephrine injection and multipolar electro-cautery application. A hemoclip was placed on the visible vessel to mark the location for the radiologist. The exposed metal coil was left in place, as the immediate pressing matter was hemostasis. Due to the likely involvement of the gastroduodenal artery and the high risk of rebleeding, Interventional Radiology was consulted. An angiogram was performed, and no evidence of active extravasation was identified. However, multiple small left gastric artery branches appeared to feed the previously bleeding proximal duodenal bulb ulcer (Forrest Class 1A) identified by the presence of a hemoclip. Detachable embolization coils were placed in two branches of the left gastric artery. The angiogram also demonstrated an existing embolization coil in the gastroduodenal artery with no distal flow.

There was no history of trauma. Besides the discomfort in the left elbow, the patient had a history of lumbar disc protrusion and hypertension, which was well controlled with medication. No other medical related history could be traced. Physical examination showed a painless mass (about 1 cm*2 cm) in the ulnar side of her left elbow with no inflammation. Neurologic examination revealed light numbness on the ulnar side of her left hand and fingers. No pathological sign was detected positive. Electromyography (EMG) showed the ulnar nerve across the elbow was injured. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed a subcutaneous irregular abnormal signal in the upper ulnar side of left forearm, hyperintense on T1and T2-weighted image which was considered to be a benign lesion, and joint effusion in the left elbow (Fig. ). X-ray showed degenerated change in the left elbow joint. Laboratory studies revealed the routine blood test, tumor markers, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were all within normal range. The mass was considered to be a cystic form disease which compressed the ulnar nerve. With the guidance of ultrasound, we first located the cyst.

Because the patient was dependent on a temporary pacemaker, a dual chamber pacemaker was placed 2 days after the aortic valve had been placed. A day after the dual chamber pacemaker had been placed, the ventricular screw-in pacing lead became non-functional and a new, temporary ventricular lead had to be placed.

Her plain radiographs of the spine showed a thoracic scoliosis with a Cobb angle of 74\u00b0 (Figure ), suggesting the need for surgical correction.\nHer past medical history was remarkable in that the girl underwent total correction of Tetralogy of Fallot at the age of 8 year in another hospital. On clinical examination, the patient was found to be mentally retarded. Some sleep problems were reported by the parents, including snoring, shortness of breath, and gasping to awake. So, she was referred to the Department of Otorhinolaryngology in our hospital and found that she had obstructive sleep apnea, hypertrophy of tonsil, conductive hearing loss, and agenesis of epiglottis.

The Risser grade was I, indicating that the patient had a significant amount of remaining growth and this could result in further deterioration of her scoliosis. Computed tomography revealed a thoracic 5 and 6 vertebral body dysplasia and spinal stenosis during thoracic 1 to thoracic 5 (Figure ). An ultrasound of the kidneys and the abdomen did not elicit pathological findings. An electrocardiogram examination showed right bundle-branch block.

Abdominal erect X-ray showed dilatation of small bowel segments. Colonoscopy was requested by gastroenterologist for finding the cause and excluding colon neoplasm. Diagnostic colonoscopy showed one small ulcer (8 mm) with the pressure effect of mass like lesion at cecum and scope couldn\u2019t find the ileocecal valve. It was thought that a mass like lesion had caused the ileum obstruction. Colonoscopic biopsies were taken and histopathological examination revealed endometriosis.

Although the patient was in a coma at admission, his consciousness markedly improved after he received hypothermal therapy and brain-protecting drugs. He had been medicated for hypertension in another hospital and had never complained of chest symptoms. Several months before this event, he had experienced transient syncope without chest symptoms.

After he was admitted to our hospital, electrocardiography showed no abnormality (Figure ). Further, echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no wall motion abnormality and no structural heart disease. Delayed enhancement in the myocardium was also not observed in the cardiac MRI. Tc-99m myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed no perfusion abnormality, and quantitative gated SPECT revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction value of 66%. Holter recording and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring performed for >2 weeks showed no apparent ventricular arrhythmia. Myocardial imaging using I-123 MIBG was performed 20 days after admission. With the patient in the supine position at rest, 111MBq of I-123 MIBG was intravenously administered. An initial image was obtained 20 minutes after the intravenous injection, and a delayed scan was obtained 4 hours later. Decreased uptake of I-123 MIBG was observed in the inferolateral and anteroseptal walls of the left ventricle (Figure ); therefore, cardiac catheterization was planned. Coronary angiography did not reveal any severe organic stenosis in either the right or left coronary artery (Figure ). A spasm provocation test was subsequently performed. Ergonovine (10\u03bcg) was initially injected into the right coronary artery for 4 minutes",

Routine laboratory examination demonstrated normal liver function with no evidence of coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. Chest radiography showed no remarkable findings.

Examination of the serum tumor markers revealed a marked elevation of \u03b1-fetoprotein (3815.14 ng/mL). She was admitted to ICU for observation and further evaluation. The blood test to determine the risk of HCC which is related to virus infection revealed positive for hepatitis C virus antigen.\nDuring her second day in the ICU, her consciousness deteriorated significantly.

Emergency brain CT showed an enlargement of the left temporal SDH with significant mass effect (Fig. d) for which an emergency craniotomy for SDH evacuation and removal of metastatic skull tumor were performed. During the operation, a left temporal bone tumor was found to involve the dura causing a dural defect. These findings are compatible with tumor bleeding with hematoma ruptured into subdural space.

The man was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in a rural community hospital four years previously. Four months ago, he developed a 1 cm \u00d7 2 cm ulcer on the lateral side of his right lower leg with a small amount of fluid exudate.\nAt the time of admission, the patient was in an acceptable condition, with a temperature of 38\u00b0C, a pulse of 88 beats / min, a respiration rate of 22 breaths / min, a blood pressure of 130 / 70 mmHg, a height of 1.75 m, a body weight of 60 kg, and a BMI of 19.5 kg / m2. Abdominal shifting dullness was positive, both lower extremities were swollen, and multiple fractures were visible on the wound surface on the medial and lateral sides of the right calf and right ankle. The dorsal right foot ulcer was visible and measured approximately 7 \u00d7 8 cm. All ulcers had a significant amount of yellow liquid exudate and odor (Fig. ). The random blood glucose test revealed that his glucose level was 20 mmol/L.

Magnetic resonance angiography revealed that the right ICA was occluded from its origin to the intracranial segment. The patient reported taking aspirin, clopidogrel and atorvastatin, and was referred to the authors' center 2 weeks later. Physical examination revealed no obvious positive findings. Although a 2-month history of diabetes was recorded, there was no history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or smoking.\nThe initial CDFI was performed on day 1 of hospitalization, which revealed a patent right ICA with normal blood flow velocity (). However, CTA on day 2 indicated that the right ICA was occluded (). A repeat CDFI scan on day 4 of hospitalization revealed a hypoechoic mass [thickness 2.8 mm (suspected thrombus)] was attached to the anterior wall of the initial segment of the right ICA (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on day 6; T1-weighted imaging showed that the intracranial segment of the right ICA was invisible, indicating that the right ICA was occluded (). However, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) performed on the same day revealed that the right ICA was normal, with no significant stenosis in any segment ().\nCDFI findings were consistent with those of DSA, but nevertheless inconsistent with CTA and MRI. It was not advisable for clinicians to make a definitive diagnosis pertaining to the vascular lesions of the patient.

Due to incontinence, he began self-treatment by instilling superglue into his urethra for 2 weeks. The patient had no urination problem during the early days of insertion. After 4 days, he complained about oliguria and dysuria which emerged simultaneously. By the time of referral to our center (2 weeks later), he was suffering from urinary retention. There was no history of psychiatric disorders. On perineal examination, his penis had erected form. A FB was palpable within the penile urethra and brittle fragments of superglue were seen on the meatus. An abdominal ultrasound revealed bilateral mild hydronephrosis, with normal cortical thickness, and without any sign of stone in the bladder. Laboratory examinations were normal. The patient was taken to the operating room urgently. He underwent a cystoscopy however, it failed due to obstruction.\nSo the glance was incised in 2 cm length at 6 o'clock position ().\nThe urethra was then washed with 3 liters of normal saline for approximately 15 minutes. During that period we managed to make the solution permeate across the solid material by performing certain maneuvers thereby shedding the adherent layer off the urethral wall. Eventually, a 10 cm rod-shaped solid block of dried superglue () came out with the aid of forceps and was removed successfully. The incision was sutured with nylon. After surgery, urination was normal in caliber and direction and the patient was satisfied with urinary drainage. The urine analysis was normal and we did not have requirement for cystoscopy. A 16F Foley catheter was left in place for 10 days. Amikacin 500 mg BD and cefazolin 1gr QID were administrated and he was discharged on the 5th postoperative day without any complication. By",
