He had an upper respiratory infection one week preceding the motor weakness which started from the lower limbs. On day seven after the onset of motor weakness of limbs, the child developed significant bulbar weakness, difficulty in talking and could not move the tongue. He was totally anarthric. On day nine, he had significant respiratory muscle weakness requiring mechanical ventilatory support. On day fourteen, bilateral tongue atrophy without fasciculations was noticed []. The nerve conduction studies (NCS) were suggestive of severe demyelinating motor sensory polyradiculoneuropathy. The facial nerve conductions revealed facial neuropathy. His anti-ganglioside antibody panel in the blood showed positive IgM GM2, GT1b, IgG GM1,2,3 and GT1b antibodies. His CSF showed albuminocytological dissociation and his Antinuclear antibody was negative. His magnetic resonance image (MRI) brain was normal. He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin at a daily dose of 0.4 g/kg for five days. The child required prolonged ventilatory care for 22 days. He showed gradual improvement and started swallowing after eight weeks of the onset of illness. The wasting of the tongue also improved gradually at 3 months after the onset of illness []. At 6 months follow up, he was walking with support with residual bilateral foot drop.

A suspicion of myocardial infarction was not confirmed, and computed tomography (CT) showed a type A aortic dissection with a large intramural haematoma in the ascending aorta. Surgical repair was performed urgently with implantation of a biological aortic valve as a composite graft in the ascending aorta with reimplantation of coronary arteries by way of Bentall procedure. The surgery, performed with extracorporeal circulation, hypothermia, circulatory arrest, and retrograde cerebral perfusion, lasted for 21 min. At the end of surgery, the patient showed signs of right heart failure, possibly caused by air embolization to the right coronary artery. Extracorporeal perfusion was reinstituted, and a 14F venting catheter was placed through the apex of the left ventricle. The catheter was subsequently removed and the hole in the apex wall closed with a suture. The postoperative period was uncomplicated with the exception of a pacemaker implantation due to atrioventricular block II. Consecutive CT examinations, performed 1 and again at 2 months after surgery, showed slowly increasing size of the pseudoaneurysm extending from the apex of the left ventricle (Fig. A) and a minor septum defect.

    "original_text": "A cardiologist calls as they are planning a coronary angiogram for a 68-year-old trans woman and are concerned because the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is unknown. They are uncertain how to risk stratify her for potential contrast-induced nephropathy. She has a history of longstanding hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, vaginoplasty, and has been on various formulations of estradiol therapy for over 20 years. On review of her investigations, her serum creatinine is 109 umol/L (1.23 mg/dL) but her eGFR has not been reported for the last 18 months. Laboratory providers cannot report eGFR if a male or female marker is not provided on the request form, as this is required along with age to estimate eGFR. Using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula, if classified as female, the eGFR would be 45 mL/min/1.73m\nclassed as Stage 3 chronic kidney disease and would meet the guidelines for intravenous hydration prior to procedure. However, if classified male, the patient would have an eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73m\nwhich would be classed as Stage 2 chronic kidney disease and would not require prehydration. Which is the most appropriate eGFR to use?\nAccurately assessing renal function is essential for not only assessment of renal diseases, but also clinical situations that may potentially affect renal function (such as diabetes or radioiodine contrast administration) as well as considerations for medication dosing of renally cleared drugs.

Two months earlier he developed bilateral lack of vision and diagnosed ischemic optic neuropathy by ophthalmologist and hence started high dose corticosteroid treatment. Eye findings were improved by this treatment. On examination, the patient appeared well and his vital signs were normal. The temporal arteries were noted to be thickened, nodular, and decreased pulsation (). Temporal arteritis was considered because of these findings and methotrexate was added to the patient therapy. Temporal artery biopsy was not considered in consequence of receiving corticosteroid therapy for two months.\nDuring the followup, just after corticosteroid dose reduced, the patient was hospitalized to reevaluate because of recurrent complaints of increasing difficulty in walking, claudication, headache, fatigue, and rising again erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) values. In addition to the preceding findings, the patient presented with macroglossia, hard nodular structures of lips, buccal dryness, livedo reticularis in the back skin and apical systolic murmur. The result from a complete blood cell count was normocytic normochromic anemia. Renal function, albumin, globulin, and calcium levels were all within normal ranges. Ultrasonographic evaluation of the temporal artery and axillary and lower extremity arteries revealed thickened vessel walls. An echocardiogram demonstrated that biatrial dilatation, global ventricular hypokinesia. Cranial MRI taken because of syncope was compatible with subacute infarct.\nVascular deposition disease may be a consideration because of generalize vascular findings. Since the patient had macroglossia and buccal dryness, the lip biopsy was performed from nodular structures.

    "original_text": "A 53-year-old male diagnosed with OI type I was referred to our clinic for extraction of the remaining maxillary teeth and evaluation for full arch immediate load hybrid prosthesis. His clinical history included osteogenesis type 1, bipolar disorder, alopecia, and hypothyroidism. The patient presented with normal stature, measuring 170.18 cm and weighing 81.65 kg with characteristic blue sclerae of OI type I (Fig. ). Throughout his life, he has had multiple orthopedic fractures due to his OI. At the time of surgery, he was on Lamictal, Xarelto, Synthroid, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide.\nExtraoral, TMJ, intraoral soft tissue, and lymph node examinations produced no abnormal findings. An examination of the dentition revealed the maxillary teeth were in poor repair with a fixed bridge extending from site number 2 to site number 5 with site number 3 serving as the pontic abutment. Sites number 8, number 9, number 10, and number 11 have periodontal involvement as well as recurrent decay. He was edentulous on the posterior left maxillary arch. His lower dentition consisted of sites number 19 through number 27 with number 28 being edentulous and number 29 having a root fracture (Fig. ). The upper jaw had good ridge width with reproducible centric relation and centric occlusion.

He is a homosexual patient and AIDS was diagnosed at other center. The initial presentation of the abdominal pain was intermittent and localized around the umbilical area. However, the pain then soon turned to persistent and more severe that made him visited our emergency department (ED). In ED, physical examination revealed a diffused abdominal tenderness with rebounding pain and rigid abdominal wall. An emergent abdominal CT showed a big hypovascular tumor located in the lower abdomen, right hydronephrosis, and multiple enlarged para-aortic LNs (Figures and ). Under the impression of acute abdomen with intra-abdominal abscess, he was admitted for further treatment.\nHe was treated by IV antibiotics with Flomoxef first and reverse transcriptase inhibitors. However, the clinical conditions did not improve after empiric antibiotics treatment. He then underwent laparotomy with resection of a segment of small bowel, ascending colon with end ileostomy and end-T-colostomy owing to uncontrolled abdominal pain and persistent fever on February 09, 2006. The pathology revealed amebic enterocolitis with segmental gangrenous change and perforation. A percutaneous drainage was inserted postoperatively because of persistent large amount fluid discharge from abdominal cavity (). However, the following abdominal CT showed a suspicious urinoma nearby the right proximal ureter. The percutaneous drain turned dry after a percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) drain. Antegrade pyelography found an upper ureteral stricture with contrast leakage ().

She had no systemic disease and no relevant medical or family history. On physical examination, rhinoscopy revealed a polypoid mass in the right nasal cavity, which bled when lightly touched (). A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a dense soft tissue mass in the right paranasal sinuses and the right nasal cavity (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an enhanced right antral mass (3.2 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm \u00d7 2.2 cm in size) with a widened maxillary ostium that extended to the right nasal cavity (). The patient underwent endoscopic sinus surgery; however, the mass bled profusely and only a portion was removed for biopsy. Surgery was terminated after the bleeding was controlled. Because of such bleeding tendency, angiography accompanied by tumor embolization was performed prior to reoperation (). The pathologic report of specimen from primary uncompleted operation pointed to a case of the angiofibroma, which was consistent with the patient\u2019s clinical features. And we considered right endoscopic medial maxillectomy at revision operation.\nIn the revision operation the tumor mass was found to be dark greenish and yellowish fragile, filling middle meatus and extending to the nasal cavity. Bleeding was not severe due to the embolization. Its medial extent was to the nasal septum, lateral to the lateral wall of maxillary sinus, superior to middle of the ethmoid sinus, inferior to the inferior maxillary wall, anterior to the anterior maxillary wall, and posterior to the nasopharynx.

Nonenhanced computed tomography (CT) showed subtle signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with some frontobasal subarachnoid blood (). CT angiography revealed a 4-mm aneurysm of the left anterior cerebral artery (ACA). At admission her blood pressure was 128/55 mm Hg. On the first day of admission her mean arterial pressure (MAP) varied between 81 and 99 mm Hg, with a mean of 88 mm Hg. She had no history of hypertension, was no taking any medication, and exhibited a good neurological condition (Hunt and Hess grade of 1).\nThe aneurysm was coiled on the same day. The procedure took longer than usual (2 hours) because of the smallness of the aneurysm, which made it difficult to enter it safely with the microcatheter. During the procedure, both internal carotid arteries were catheterized to optimize depiction of the local vascular anatomy (). However, a microcatheter was only advanced in the left ACA to reach the aneurysm. According to the local protocol, 5000 IE of heparin was given during the procedure; no other medication was given during the procedure. The aneurysm was successfully packed with two small coils (3 cm long; 2-mm UltraSoft, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) using a left approach. No complications were noted and the patient experienced no focal neurological symptoms.\nAfter the procedure the patient developed periods of bradycardia with sinus arrest in the intensive care unit (ICU) but without clinical symptoms. There were assumed to be secondary to the SAH, and were treated conservatively.

She was examined at a nearby hospital 5 days before where plain CT scan and blood exams were performed. Her primary diagnosis was traction pain caused by a large uterine leiomyoma. Since her symptoms subsided with pain control medications, she was discharged from the hospital after 4 days of observation. However, she was referred to our facility the next day with complaints of a worsening abdominal pain. The patient had a medical history of an untreated large uterine leiomyoma diagnosed 25 years ago. She had stopped visiting her gynecologist after menopause at the age of 55. Although she felt a growing mass in her abdomen, it had been asymptomatic until the current episode, except for the sudden appearance of an umbilical hernia a few years ago. On admission, the patient was generally stable with normal vital signs. The abdomen was soft with no rebound tenderness or rigidity; however, a large mass in the left lower quadrant and an umbilical hernia were noted. Pain was localized over the abdominal mass, which was approximately the size of a second-trimester pregnancy and was easily movable by palpation. No vaginal bleeding was observed. Ultrasound imaging showed an abdominal mass > 10 cm in size and free fluid in the abdominal cavity. Blood exams () indicated signs of inflammation with elevated white blood cell (WBC) count (21500/\u03bcL) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (13.6 mg/dL), in addition to low hemoglobin levels (10.6 g/dL).

She did not smoke cigarettes and only drank alcohol socially.\nShe was referred to our hospital because of sudden anterior chest pain. Hematology, biochemistry and blood gas analysis were normal. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a ground-glass opacity (GGO) in her left S10 lung segment (Figure ) which was 1.3 cm in size, and a solitary small nodule of 5 mm in diameter localized in her left S4 segment (Figure ).\nFrom the beginning, we suspected lung carcinoma, but we could not get our patient's consent for performing bronchoscopic examination and surgical resection. Follow-up with CT showed that the GGO size had slightly increased and that the small nodule size had not changed. We suspected that the GGO was lung carcinoma, but it was difficult to rule out whether the small nodule was a lung metastasis. If this small nodule was not lung metastasis, the lung carcinoma could have been considered as being in the early stage. We considered that pathological examination by surgical resection was appropriate because it was also an approach for treating the lung carcinoma. We performed a left lower lobectomy and an upper lung partial resection in order to make a definitive diagnosis and to decide further therapeutic strategies. The pathological diagnosis of the GGO in her left S10 segment was primary lung adenocarcinoma(localized bronchioloalveolar carcinoma; Figure ).

    "original_text": "A 9-year-old boy was brought in by ambulance to the Children's Hospital at Westmead following a motor vehicle accident. He was an improperly restrained, back seat passenger. He presented complaining of abdominal pain. On arrival, he was hemodynamically stable, with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15. A seatbelt sign was identified across his lower abdomen. There was a tender fullness in the left flank, but it was difficult to decipher a clear mass or defect due to his high body mass index (>30). There was a laceration over his forehead extending to the hairline. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.\nThe plain abdominal radiograph showed an unusual gas shadow in the left lower quadrant. A focused abdominal sonography for trauma was positive with free fluid in Morrison's pouch and the rectovesical pouch. The diagnosis of TAWH was made by abdominal computed tomography (CT), which revealed a large left lower lateral abdominal wall muscle defect, spanning 120 mm anteroposteriorly and 70 mm craniocaudally []. Small bowel, mesentery, and a small portion of the distal transverse colon were herniating through the defect, with associated fat stranding in the mesenteric root.

He had no follow-up afterwards. He presented to us for metachronous tumor over descending colon complicated with large peristomal abscess (Fig. ). Contrast CT found mural thickening ~7 cm in span just proximal to stoma exit with adjacent 3.7-cm thick-walled rim-enhancing lesions around the stoma site. Another 3-cm thin wall fluid collection was noted at the anterior abdominal wall just inferior to the stoma site. Features were suggestive of inflammatory collection. There was an 1-cm left groin lymph node as well. There was no liver or peritoneal metastasis.\nColonoscopy was done via the colostomy showing circumferential stenotic ulcerative growth 3 cm proximal to stoma end and scope failed to negotiate through. Biopsy confirmed to be adenocarcinoma. Incision and drainage of abscess were performed. Intra-operation found 5-cm abscess cavity at 6 o\u2019clock of colostomy extending close to stoma with surrounding cellulitis. There was a circumferential tumor mass 3 cm proximal to stoma end. Tissue for histology confirmed adenocarcinoma. Excisional biopsy of the 1-cm left groin lymph node confirmed no malignancy. The wound was clean with granulation tissue after daily dressing for 2 weeks. The patient underwent wide resection, resiting of stoma and reconstruction of abdominal wall defect with a pedicled ALT flap in a joint-team approach.\nProcedure: The initial stage was preparation of the flap. ALT flap was designed along a line drawn between the anterior superior iliac spine and the superior lateral border of the patella, with the line midpoint located at the proximal portion of the flap to obtain more pedicle length. The surgeon localized the large caliber perforating vessels of the LCFA with Doppler ultrasound, and then mapped out the proposed flap on the skin of the ALT based on the anticipated size of the defect",

Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a heterogeneously enhanced mass lesion centered in the left nasal cavity [].\nShe was referred to our institute for surgical treatment of a nasal cavity tumor. On admission, she suffered from anosmia and diplopia. CT scan, performed 3 months after the first scan, demonstrated that the enlarged mass lesion breaking through the medial wall of the left orbit and pushed the eye laterally []. We considered this might be the reason for her diplopia. For tissue diagnosis, the patient underwent endoscopic exploration from the nasal cavity. Because of heavy nasal bleeding, we combined midfacial degloving approach. Although we could control the bleeding, we could not resect the complete tumor.\nHematoxylin and eosin-stained sections showed neoplastic cells forming small intracellular lumina that included red cells. The endothelium covering blood vessels was hyperplastic. No mitosis and necrosis were observed []. The Ki-67 labeling index was 28%. Immunohistochemical analysis was positive for factor VIII-related antigen, vimentin, CD34, and CD31 []. EHE was diagnosed on the basis of the aforementioned findings.\nMagnetic resonance images indicated that the tumor had invaded the anterior skull base dura matter []. Digital subtraction angiography indicated bilateral ethmoidal arteries as major feeding arteries to the tumor. Because of the aggressive nature of EHE, the cancer board of Tohoku University Hospital agreed radical surgery of the tumor utilizing anterior skull base dissection and endonasal endoscopic exploration.\nBefore the operation, spinal drainage was introduced to reduce brain retraction.

This lesion was associated with unintentional weight loss, left otalgia, and submandibular swelling. Bilateral nontender palpable lymphadenopathy in levels I, II, and III were present.\nPrior biopsies by an otolaryngologist in private practice did not demonstrate carcinoma but were otherwise inconclusive with reactive inflammatory changes. However, a positron emission tomography scan revealed hypermetabolic lesions of the anterior tongue as well as lymph nodes bilaterally in levels I, II, and III suggestive of malignancy (). The assessment was a likely T3/4N2cM0 tongue squamous cell carcinoma. He underwent a panendoscopy with biopsies and a physical examination under anesthesia for surgical planning. Biopsy results again did not yield carcinoma but showed granulomatous inflammation without organisms present.\nA multidisciplinary tumor board recommended a rheumatologic workup and an excisional lymph node biopsy. Lymph node biopsy results demonstrated noncaseating granulomatous inflammation with no malignancy (), while laboratory results demonstrated markedly elevated ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) levels. These findings suggested an atypical case of sarcoidosis, and the patient was referred for pulmonary consultation. The patient had developed scattered erythematous macules involving the extremities, palms, soles, and trunk. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated T pallidum immunoglobulin G antibodies present with a reflex RPR (rapid plasma reagin) titer of 1:512. The lymph node biopsy sample was then analyzed with immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealing spirochetes (). The patient was diagnosed with tertiary syphilis and started on doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 30 days because of a severe penicillin allergy.

Doppler ultrasound showed a highly vascularized tumor that splays the right carotid bifurcation. The distal common carotid artery and both internal and external carotid arteries were encircled by the tumor without causing any hemodynamic flow alteration. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of supra-aortic trunks confirmed the diagnosis of a carotid paraganglioma Shamblin III with skull base extension (). The preoperative study also included urine metanephrines that were negative. Preoperative embolization was performed; it was partial. Not all feeding branches were embolized because some of them were too small and short. Surgery was performed 48 h after embolization. We performed a submandibular transverse cervicotomy approach under electroencephalographic monitoring and general anesthesia. It allowed exposure of the entire tumor and proximal and distal neurovascular control. Osteotomy or subluxation of the mandible was not needed. The tumor was densely adherent to the walls of the vessels. We tried subadventitial dissection, but it was not possible without damaging the carotid arteries.\nTherefore, we performed ligation of all branches of the external carotid artery with the Ligasure\u00ae Small Jaw Instrument LF1212 system and used it throughout the procedure for most blood vessels (). A block resection was performed respecting cranial nerves and a carotid-carotid bypass with reversed saphenous vein. During the clamping and de-clamping, there were no electroencephalographic changes. Complete tumor resection was achieved; intraoperative bleeding was approximately 300\u2013400 mL. After surgery, the patient presented a psychotic break and a multifactorial respiratory insufficiency: right vocal cord paralysis and use of antipsychotic drugs to control schizophrenia, requiring temporary tracheostomy. After 1-year follow-up, the patient was neurologically asymptomatic and was speaking normally.

Physical examination revealed the following: enlarged heart on the left side, heart rate of 46 beats per min (bpm), low heart sounds with no obvious pathological murmur, and level III NYHA cardiac function. After admission, dynamic electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed: AF with the fastest heart rate of 93 bpm and the slowest heart rate of 36 bpm (average: 47 bpm), ventricular escape beats, and intermittent third degree AVB (Fig. A).

    "original_text": "A 65-year-old female was operated with left total knee replacement for painful disabling knee osteoarthritis, using posterior stabilized fixed bearing PFC Sigma total knee prosthesis. The operative procedure was performed with the use of tourniquet through medial parapatellar arthrotomy, according to standard surgical technique and without difficulties or complications. Synovectomy with removal of the fat pad and meniscal remnants were performed, along with excision of the soft tissue and exuberant bone around the patella, which was replaced with mild medialization. All components were cemented, and the prosthetic knee was intraoperatively stable without patellar maltracking. The wound was closed with intra-articular aspiration drain. Weight-bearing and knee mobilization with muscle strengthening were started after removal of the drain, two days post-surgery. At three months postoperatively, the patient complained of disabling painful left knee \"click\" while climbing stairs and standing up from chairs. Left knee physical exam demonstrated visible and audible painful \"clunk\" with \"jerk\" of the patella when the knee was moved from flexion to extension, at around 30 degrees from full extension, as well as when rising from sitting position from chair. Radiographic assessment showed a good position of the prosthetic components without any alarming signs. A diagnosis of PCS was established based on signs and symptoms, and the patient was operated four months after the index procedure. Repetitive medial parapatellar arthrotomy revealed two separate fibrous formations: one nodule was found at the junction of the proximal pole of the patella, with the undersurface of the distal quadriceps tendon completely obliterating the suprapatellar space, and the second nodule was found at the distal pole of the patella extending into the intercondylar box of the prosthetic femoral component (Figure ).

    "original_text": "A 49-year-old trans man who had been on testosterone therapy for 10 years presented to the emergency department with central chest pain. His high-sensitivity cardiac troponin was 24 ng/L (female reference range\u2005<16 ng/L, male reference range\u2005<26 ng/L). How should he be managed?\nCardiac troponin is released from damaged cardiomyocytes and is one of the most common biomarkers used in the prediction of myocardial infarction. There is considerable debate regarding the use of sex-specific reference ranges for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn), as there is uncertainty whether the use of sex-specific reference limits impact upon clinical management or outcome prediction (). However, as upper reference limits based on sex-specific 99th percentiles for hs-cTn are subtly higher for people recorded as males than those recorded females in population studies (), use of sex-specific cutoffs for hs-cTn assays have been endorsed by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (). The difference has been attributed to people presumed male at birth having a larger cardiac mass as well as subclinical coronary artery disease (). No studies have been performed to examine cardiac mass changes that may occur with masculinizing hormone therapy in people presumed female at birth. There are however data in polycystic ovary syndrome in which high testosterone concentrations are a clinical feature (albeit far lower than testosterone concentrations seen in transgender men). Polycystic ovary syndrome has been associated with higher left ventricular mass index and larger left atrial diameter over 5 years of follow-up, even after adjustment for blood pressure, body mass index, glucose, and lipids ().

    "original_text": "A 34-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presented with the chief complaint of left facial numbness, left ear pain and decreased hearing in the left ear of three years duration. The patient had also been experiencing sharp and shooting pain in different areas of her left thigh. The pain was not associated with any weakness, tingling or numbness. Besides mild fatigue she denied having any fevers, night sweats or weight loss. Neurological physical examination was grossly intact except for sensory loss in the V2 (maxillary) and V3 (mandibular) distribution of trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V). Abdominal exam was without evidence of lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Given deficits in the sensory distribution of trigeminal nerve, she was initially evaluated by ear, nose and throat (ENT) and underwent two sequential minimally invasive surgeries for nasal polyps without significant resolution of her symptoms. She was subsequently referred to a neurologist and had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain performed. Brain MRI revealed a soft tissue mass with expansion in the left Meckel\u2019s cave, measuring 22 x 16 x 12 mm (Figure ), raising concerns for a trigeminal schwannoma. She was evaluated by the neurosurgery and underwent an orbital zygomatic craniotomy and left trigeminal schwannoma resection. Pathology revealed deposition of abundant hypocellular eosinophilic material on light microscopy examination (Figure ). Congo red staining demonstrated characteristic 'apple-green birefringence' upon polarization (Figure ), consistent with diagnosis of trigeminal nerve amyloidoma. Unfortunately, no immune fluorescence or electron microscopy was done on the pathology specimen to determine the amyloid subtype. Postoperatively, the patient was referred to oncology to rule out systemic amyloid deposition. Basic workup including complete blood count was unremarkable except for hemoglobin of 12 g/dL with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 76 fL per cell. White blood cell and platelet counts were within normal limits. Comprehensive metabolic panel did not reveal any liver or renal abnormalities",

    "original_text": "A 67-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our emergency department after she had collapsed. She was found to be hyponatraemic. Her medical history consisted of hypertension, previous fractured left neck of femur and bilateral breast implants for cosmetic reasons. She had a 50 pack year smoking history but had given up six months previously. She described a more insidious history of tiredness and weight loss of 2 kg over the preceding few months, although she denied having coughs or haemoptysis. Physical examination of all systems including her chest was unremarkable.\nHer chest X-ray showed a large soft tissue density lesion in the right hemithorax, which included her bilateral breast implants (Figure ). A computed tomography (CT) of her chest showed a large mass, predominantly in the right upper lobe of the lung extending from the right hilum. The mass demonstrated a largely cystic appearance (Hounsfield unit 14) communicating with the sub-segmental dilated bronchi that gave a 'fingers in glove' appearance (Figure ). There was a notable mural enhancement of the medial aspect of this mass adjacent to the right hilum (Figure ). A bronchoscopy revealed a soft tissue lesion in the right upper lobe bronchus with the appearance of granulation or necrotic tissue (Figure ). At that time, a provisional diagnosis of complex bronchocele based on CT findings was made.\nA PET-CT scan was subsequently performed, which demonstrated fludeoxyglucose uptake within the medial side of the mass with an SUV of 4 to 5 (Figure ). No other abnormally active areas were identified in the chest or elsewhere (Figure ). The findings strongly suggested malignant pathology, so the patient was referred to cardiothoracic surgeons for an open lung biopsy. Operative findings revealed a complex cystic mass involving all three lobes of the right lung. Histopathology showed pools of mucin within the extracellular fibroconnective tissues with scattered pleomorphic malignant cells within the mucin pool.",
