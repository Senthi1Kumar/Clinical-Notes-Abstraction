His medical history included myocardial infarction, a cerebral insult, smoking-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and a long-standing history of leg ischemia with rest pain when sleeping. He had undergone several surgical procedures over the past few years, including a femoropopliteal bypass with a Propaten graft above the knee in his right leg 2 years before the INP-treatment.\nWithin a few months following surgery, the patient experienced acute thrombosis of the graft and embolism distally in the leg arteries. Subsequently, a leg ulcer appeared on the patient's anterior tibia. The ulcer was treated unsuccessfully with a partial dermal skin graft from the patient's left thigh.\nThe patient regularly visited the wound clinic at the University Hospital to receive conventional wound care for 2 years prior to participating in the study. His maximal claudication distance was 100 m at a self-selected pace due to severe pain in his right calf. The main concern was his poor arterial leg inflow. Upon vascular examination, the patient had intact femoral artery pulses bilaterally, but no pulses in the arteries of his right foot. Duplex color scanning revealed an occluded popliteal artery. Distally, the only open artery was the fibular artery, which was open in two-thirds of the upper leg. The patient was informed that if the pain and wound worsened or failed to heal properly, amputation of the limb might be indicated.\nAfter 8 weeks of INP-therapy 2 h per day, the leg ulcer almost healed (Fig. ), and the SPP measured on the patient's right anterior and posterior tibial artery angiosomes on his right foot changed from 51 to 72 mmHg and 14 to 11 mmHg, respectively. The patient's distal ankle PVR increased from 6 to 8 mm in the leg exposed to INP, but remained unchanged in the control leg. We also measured acute changes in transcutaneous oxygen",

The patient was admitted to the hospital for an elective one-vessel coronary artery bypass graft and placement of a bioprosthetic aortic valve. There were no intraoperative complications and the patient was extubated one day later. Four days after surgery, he developed worsening abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and inability to tolerate nutrition by mouth. Enteral nutrition was stopped, and a nasogastric tube on low intermittent suction was removed with over 1 L of bilious output daily. On postoperative day five, his abdominal pain progressed to focal peritonitis in the right lower quadrant.\nInvestigations\nComputed tomography with intravenous contrast on postoperative day five revealed thickened and moderately dilated loops of the proximal small bowel with a more prominent C-shaped loop of the small bowel and two transition points in the right lower quadrant, medial and posterior to the right iliac segment of the aortobiiliac graft (Figure ). The concern for nonviable or necrotic bowel prompted further investigation in the operating room.\nTreatment\nThe patient was taken emergently to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy. Upon entering the abdominal cavity, extensive adhesions were encountered and lysed. While examining the small bowel, a jejunal loop was found fixed deep in the right hemi-pelvis. Upon further dissection, a 28-cm jejunal loop was entrapped behind the right iliac limb of the graft, causing a closed-loop jejunal obstruction and bowel necrosis (Figure ). Extensive adhesions to the prosthetic graft were divided sharply. The jejunum was transected proximally and distally to the obstruction",

A left-sided temporary double-channel hemodialysis catheter (Quintiles, Durham, NC, USA) was inserted by using the subclavian vein, but it did not work well. This may have been due to inability of the patient to cooperate because she shook her body repeatedly during the puncture process. After the procedure, the patient developed dyspnea and felt pain on the catheter insertion site. Oxygen inhalation was immediately supplied to the patient, and the hemodialysis catheter was secured in place and covered by a sterile dressing.

CT showed that the hemodialysis catheter had perforated the subclavian vein, and it terminated in the anterior mediastinum with pneumatosis and hemorrhage (). However, the middle of the catheter and the left brachiocephalic vein were not clearly observed, and we could not determine if there was damage to the aorta.\nTo prevent hemorrhagic shock, the patient had a blood transfusion, and her hemoglobin level increased from a baseline level of 56 to 75 g/L.

He was referred to a physician for pyrosis, 1 week prior to presenting at the hospital, and was prescribed pantoprazole at 40 mg/day. He continued using diclofenac for the ongoing headaches. He started to experience pain in his leg muscles on the fourth day of the diclofenac and pantoprazole combination regimen and used two 50-mg doses of diclofenac to control the pain. The muscle pain became more widespread on the fifth day, and the patient also developed fatigue.\nAn examination revealed a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and a pulse of 76 bpm, full and rhythmic. Cardiac sounds were normal and the patient had no specific chest pain. Muscular strength was good; however, the patient complained of muscle tenderness upon palpation. Neurological and general system examinations were normal; no abnormal findings were seen in an electrocardiogram; and an abdomen ultrasound revealed no pathology, aside from an abdominal gas distention. A laboratory analysis revealed high levels of muscle destruction products, the foremost of which was creatinine kinase (Table ). Glucose, urea, creatinine, cholesterol levels, amylase, direct and indirect bilirubin, electrolytes, anti-streptolysin O, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, and thyroid hormones were all within their normal ranges.\nA cardiac pathology was excluded because the electrocardiographic assessments and cardiac sounds were normal, and because the patient did not describe any pain that would indicate an infarct, and test results and findings were stable on the following days.

In addition, the patient had an upper digestive tract endoscopy that revealed a tumor consisting of strands of black hair extending towards the antrum and blocking visualization of the pylorus.\nThe patient was slightly pale, this being the only abnormality found at physical examination. She had a history of slightly retarded neuropsychomotor development. The patient's mother admitted that she had a habit of pulling out her hair and secretly swallowing it. She was admitted to hospital for surgical treatment and psychiatric evaluation.\nA second endoscopy of the upper digestive tract was performed as part of the preoperative work-up, findings revealing a blackened, voluminous mass composed of strands of hair, fibrin and food residue in the stomach, located in the antrum and low body, extending towards the pylorus and blocking passage of the endoscope (Figures and ).

Emergency external ventricular drainage was performed (). He was referred to our hospital for comprehensive rehabilitation. Initially, he had zero grade in the left upper and lower limbs, according to a manual muscle test, and zero grade of spasticity by the Modified Ashworth Scale. The patient's Korean version of Modified Barthel Index score was 4 points and his Mini-Mental Status Examination score was 15 points. He required maximal assistance in mobility. In addition, he had neuropathic pain symptoms, such as numbness and tingling on the left hemiplegic side, suspected to be CPSP. He especially complained about neuropathic pain in the posterior thigh and lower leg. We performed a three-phase bone scan, confirming the presence of a complex regional pain syndrome involving the left arm. We therefore added 300 mg of gabapentin three times per day to the treatment to control neuropathic pain, which improved. He was discharged from our hospital at that time.\nHe was later readmitted to our department with persistent neuropathic pain in the left leg. We increased the dose of gabapentin to 600 mg twice per day, but the treatment did not relieve his neuropathic pain. He also suffered left hip pain and restricted ROM in the hip joint with flexion of 70\u00b0 and could not maintain a sitting posture for ambulation with a wheelchair.\nLeft-hip radiography revealed an osteophyte of the left femoral head (). We performed a nerve conduction study (NCS) and electromyography (EMG); the findings were compatible with left L5 radiculopathy. Sensory NCS showed normal findings in both sural and superficial peroneal nerves.

Vascular surgery was consulted and agreed with our decision to excise the pseudoaneurysm.\nThe patient was taken back to the operating room for exploration, excision, and ligation of the pseudoaneurysm. Preoperative CT angiography confirmed adequate collateral flow. The pseudoaneurysm was located so close to the second metatarsal artery and vein that there was not sufficient length of the branch to ligate it individually. Therefore, the second dorsal metatarsal artery and vein were ligated. The tourniquet was deflated with a total time of 18 minutes at 300 mm Hg, and hemostasis was observed. The incision was closed in standard fashion, and a sterile compression dressing was applied. Of note, we did not use heparin at any point during this surgery. Postoperatively she was admitted to the hospital and observed. She was commenced on DVT prophylaxis with 325 mg aspirin per day for 10 days starting on day 1.

She had received 1 ml of HA (Volbella\u00ae, Allergan, Dublin, Ireland) injections on each cheek for the treatment of wrinkles. It was her third HA injection and she reported satisfactory results without adverse events in the past. The patient was in good health and not known for any type of allergies. At day 1, the patient presented a sore throat without fever. At day 10, she observed pain, redness and oedema at multiple injection sites of the right cheek and consulted her injector physician. A swab test confirmed a streptococcal throat infection and the patient received a first treatment of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.

The patient had a history of surgical excision and full thickness skin graft for a forehead neurofibromatosis about two years ago. Subsequent to this, the tumor recurred and increased in size but was not associated with pain, headaches, epistaxis, nasal discharge or obstruction, or malodor. The patient did not report systemic symptoms such as fever or weight loss.\nOn examination, respective visual activity was 0.2 and 0.15 for right and left. His right eye deviation was to the inferolateral side with superior and medial gaze limitations. Diplopia was pronounced with upper gaze. The mass was about 5 \u00d7 6 cm in size, irregularly shaped, tender to palpation, and without overlying skin changes. On palpation, the mass was of mild tenderness, soft and fixed. No pulsation or bruits were observed (). He had caf\u00e9 au lait spots and multiple neurofibromatosis throughout the entire body. The patient did not have any familial history significant for neurofibromatosis.\nComputed tomography revealed the mass to involve the right orbital cavity as well as the frontal and ethmoid sinuses. The 4 \u00d7 4.5 cm mass was found to have a locally expansile effect, with partial erosion of the anterior, posterior frontal sinus wall, lateral ethmoid wall, and compressive right orbit. The lesion did not extend into the nasal cavity or intracranium ().\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient underwent a mass resection through the forehead scar from the previous operation. The mass was removed along with the skull base and lateral nasal wall, using suction and curettage.

The bullet had entered the left side of his back at the 10th intercostal space and passed upward and laterally to exit at the fifth intercostal space three centimeters medial to the anterior axillary line. The patient had sustained colonic perforation, left diaphragmatic, splenic and lung lacerations and left bronchial rupture. A left thoracostomy tube was inserted and the gunshot entrance and exit wounds were sealed. While supportive therapy was ongoing, he developed tachycardia and fever and was found to have diminished breath sounds and dullness to percussion over the left lower thorax. A chest X-ray revealed left pleural effusion, which proved to be an empyema. With suspicion of esophageal perforation, he was taken to the operating room on the third day of admission. After exploration, fecal material and displaced stomach were noted in the left chest cavity. The lacerated diaphragm was repaired, and a loop colostomy was performed. A splenectomy was also performed due to the splenic laceration.\nTwo weeks after the operation, there was a significant bleeding episode through the left chest tube. A chest X-ray revealed left lung collapse and left pneumothorax and hemothorax. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and bronchoscopy did not reveal the bleeding site. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed thick yellowish secretions in the left lower lobe bronchus. The chest bleeding stopped spontaneously. Later, a foul-smelling greenish secretion appeared in the chest tube and continued for two months. Aerobic culture of the secretion revealed Klebsiella, Escherichia coli and more than 15 species of Gram-positive bacteria (due to contamination).

She complained of recurrent fever and asymmetric edema of the lower extremities for over 1 month, as well as painful swelling both in the thyroid and labium majus for 2 weeks. In the previous hospital, due to the finding of multiple bilateral cysts which were palpable nodules in her thyroid gland by ultrasound examination, a left lobe thyroid puncture and drainage had been conducted and an aspergillus fumigatus infection was detected. She had a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis for 8 years, and received prednisone treatment for these diseases. But from November 2015, prednisone was switched to methylprednisolone, and hydroxychloroquine has been added because of lupus nephritis aggravation, and tacrolimus has also been added to the medications in the following month. She was also diagnosed with renal hypertension and diabetes induced by steroids, and received antihypertension and antihyperglycemic therapy. She had no history of pulmonary diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or any repeated infections, and had no addiction to drugs, smoking or alcoholism.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneous solid-cystic tumor mass with focal necrosis, measuring 9.6 cm in the greatest dimension. Tumor biopsy was performed. Histologically, the material comprised focally necrotic tumor fragments, composed of atypical spindle to polygonal cells showing high mitotic activity, forming fascicles with focal palisading ().

This was described as a dull \u201cliver pain\u201d in the right upper quadrant area. On physical exam, there was evidence of a midline scar, the abdomen was soft with mild tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant and the liver span was approximately 10 cm in the mid-clavicular line by percussion. A complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel were normal; however, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) showed a mild elevation of 66 U/L and 51 U/L, respectively. Serum bilirubin levels and alkaline phosphatase levels were within normal limits. Due to the reported complaint of right upper quadrant pain and the associated abnormal liver function tests, an abdominal ultrasound (US) was ordered. This showed fatty liver disease and a left liver lobe isoechoic liver mass. A computed tomography (CT) triple phase abdomen scan was done demonstrating a 2.5 cm exophytic mass in the liver in segment 2 (Figure ). The next day of admission, the patient\u2019s pain improved with analgesia. As no clear diagnosis was made, he was later discharged with an intention to perform an elective abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This MRI revealed a single mass in segment 2 of the liver, with features of a hepatic adenoma (Figure ). The surgical team was consulted and evaluated the patient and an elective percutaneous liver biopsy was performed. Examination of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections revealed histological evidence of splenic tissue with distinct red and white pulp areas, with evidence of passive congestion (Figure ).

She was noted to have increasing \u201cclumsiness\u201d in the months leading to her inability to walk. She was also noted to have chronic renal disease and liver disease with hepatomegaly and enlarged kidneys in the first 4 years of life. Her inability to walk was previously attributed to severe pain throughout her body.\nAt 6 years of age, she developed bilateral lower extremity fractures and an upper extremity fracture while attempting to stand. She was noted to have bowing of her lower extremities and elevated alkaline phosphatase and was subsequently diagnosed with rickets that was believed to be the result of chronic kidney disease. Shortly thereafter, she was referred to a local medical center where she underwent liver biopsy, kidney biopsy, and muscle biopsy. Her liver biopsy revealed cirrhosis with minimal chronic inflammation and her kidney biopsy revealed nonspecific glomerular and tubular changes with some parenchymal fibrosis. Her muscle biopsies revealed severe myopathic changes with myofiber atrophy. She was noted to have mitochondrial DNA quantification on her muscle biopsy which was reduced and less than 29% of controls. She was subsequently diagnosed with mitochondrial depletion syndrome.\nWhen her weakness and strength worsened further, she was referred to our institution\u2019s mitochondrial clinic where she underwent additional workup. Extensive metabolic evaluation revealed an elevated succinylacetone which led to a diagnosis of HT-1. Analysis of the FAH gene revealed a homozygous splice mutation known to be associated with HT-1.

    "original_text": "A 56-year-old female smoker had a history of a pleomorphic adenoma in the left parotid gland treated with a superficial parotidectomy at the age of 18. Nineteen years following that surgery, the patient presented with multifocal recurrence. Surgical exploration was undertaken and the tumor was found inseparable from the facial nerve. At that time, the resection was abandoned and the facial nerve was not sacrificed and gross disease was left in the parotid bed. The patient underwent external beam radiation therapy and the size of the tumor remained stable for 10 years on serial computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) monitoring. The patient had been clinically asymptomatic until she started developing intermittent ipsilateral hemifacial spasms occurring spontaneously and involving all portions of the left facial musculature, which prompted her to return for evaluation.\nRepeat CT scan showed enlargement of avidly and uniformly enhancing solid tumor without areas of necrosis or extracapsular extension with extension into the left stylomastoid foramen, along with suspicious changes in enlarged (15 mm) left level IV lymph node (Figure ). Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the tumor was suspicious for carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. After a negative systemic metastatic work-up, the patient was brought to the operating room for a radical parotidectomy with facial nerve sacrifice, ipsilateral selective neck dissection (levels I-IV), and a de-epithelialized anterolateral thigh free flap for volume restoration and to enhance wound healing. The vertical segment of the facial nerve in the mastoid was exposed.

Physical exam was remarkable for marked jugular venous distension, bilateral basal wet crackles, a distended and globally tender abdomen with positive fluid shift and positive hepatojugular reflex, as well as bilateral +2 lower leg edema. The patient's labs are shown in and were remarkable for anemia, elevated troponin, markedly elevated pro-BNP, transaminases, mildly elevated TSH, and CRP. ECG tracing showed atrial flutter with a ventricular rate of 126 bpm (). Chest X-ray showed a markedly enlarged cardiac silhouette with a water-bottle appearance suspicious for pericardial effusion (), for which an echocardiogram was done on hospital day 1, and confirmed the presence of a significantly dilated right ventricle, severe tricuspid, and moderate mitral regurgitation with no valvular structural abnormalities described. In addition, a moderately compromised left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (30\u201340%) and a large pericardial effusion () were shown. CT of the chest with pulmonary artery protocol was not supportive of pulmonary embolism as the underlying etiology. While the syndromic diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy with right sided heart failure was made, the etiology remained unknown.\nThe patient was started on beta-blocker and diuretic therapy, and with close monitoring began to improve from her heart failure. While aggressive medical management continued, an etiologic search for the underlying pathology began. Toxicology and infectious disease markers were negative. A viral panel was sent out, and later returned as unremarkable. A search for underlying malignancy also was negative.

In the first three episodes, the patient reported the semen being brown in color. On the fourth episode, there were distinct streaks of red blood within the semen.\nThe man was heterosexual, and this was his first and only sexual partner. His partner had no history of sexually transmitted infections (STI). The couple was sexually active and using barrier method contraception for family planning reasons.\nThe patient was otherwise fit and well with no past medical history apart from mild childhood asthma. He had no headaches or changes in vision. He had no cardiac or respiratory symptoms. There was no history of recent trauma. There were no changes in urinary or bowel habits. He had no pain, fever, sweats, weight loss, or fatigue. He had not travelled abroad recently. The patient had never smoked or taken illicit substances. His diet was reasonably healthy, and he walked approximately 5 km a day. He consumed approximately 32 units of alcohol per week and recognized that this as in excess of medical guidelines. There was no family history of inheritable diseases.\nOn examination, he was comfortable at rest and clinically euvolemic. His abdomen was soft and nontender. His kidneys were not palpable. There were no renal bruits. There was no enlargement or masses in the scrotum. A digital rectal examination was normal with no enlargement or nodularity of the prostate. Respiratory examination revealed normal breath sounds. Examination of the central and peripheral nervous system was entirely normal.\nOn cardiovascular examination, heart sounds were normal. There was no peripheral edema, and the jugular venous pressure was not raised. There was no radio-femoral delay, and fundoscopy was normal. His blood pressure was note to be 228/135 mmHg, and his heart rate was 90 beats per minute and regular. Pulse volume and character were normal. His",

    "original_text": "Patient 2 was a 74-year-old man suffering from heart failure, chronic atrial fibrillation, severe venous insufficiency, leg ulcers, type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive lung disease, and severe obesity (160 kg, BMI 49). At hospital admission the patient was confused with delayed response time. Furthermore he presented with atrial fibrillation (140 beats/minute), hyperthermia (39.0\u00b0C), and elevated blood levels of creatinine. He was tachypnoeic with low oxygen saturation (91%). A urine test strip showed presence of blood, protein, and ketone bodies. Initial treatment included fluid therapy and antibiotics on the suspicion of sepsis. The patient was transferred to telemetry in the cardiology department where treatment with digoxin was initiated.\nDuring the following days urine output increased, but his level of consciousness decreased and he developed myoclonia. Due to accumulation of carbon dioxide he was transferred to the ICU, where intubation and mechanical ventilation were initiated. At admission GCS score was 3, pupil reactions were sluggish, and muscle spasms in the upper body were observed. Blood tests were normal except an increasing INR.\nDuring the first days in the ICU the patient improved with decreasing demand of oxygen and cardiac inotropes. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid and a head CT were both normal. Microbiological tests showed no sign of infection. Despite fanning and cold fluids the patient still had an elevated temperature and cooling was intensified using a thermoregulatory device with cooling pads. On day 5 the patient's temperature normalized and he gained consciousness. On day 7 the diagnosis of HS syndrome was suspected. The patient stabilized and was extubated, but he still received intermittent cooling. The patient developed hypercapnia and was reintubated and later a tracheostomy was performed. Due to anuria dialysis was performed until he regained his kidney function on day 23. The patient was again stabile and interacting with family and staff. Unfortunately the patient was infected with pneumonia. His overall condition thereafter gradually declines and he died 55 days after",
