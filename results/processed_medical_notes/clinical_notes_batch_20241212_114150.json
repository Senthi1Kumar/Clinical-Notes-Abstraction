Her rectal examination revealed rectal stenosis and possible rectal cancer. Her subsequent barium enema examination showed rectosigmoid stenosis (Figure ), but no irregularities in her mucosa. Accordingly, a biopsy specimen was taken from her mucosa by lower abdominal gastrointestinal endoscopy, and showed no evidence of cancer cells in the area of the stenosis. Her blood tests revealed slightly elevated levels of the cancer antigens carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) and cancer antigen 125 (CA12-5), but all other values were within normal ranges.\nApart from thickening of her rectosigmoid wall in the stenotic region (Figure ), no other abnormalities were detectable in her abdominal and chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Full-length positron emission tomography (PET) was suggested as a non-invasive procedure for detecting the primary lesion, but she declined for financial reasons. Hence, an exploratory laparotomy was performed to identify the cause of her rectosigmoid stenosis.\nHer surgical examinations revealed nodules dispersed throughout her abdominal cavity, and additional stenosis in her rectum and ileocecum, suggesting peritoneal metastasis.

The lesion was excised with negative margins and pathology read as invasive high-grade squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Eight months post resection, the lesion recurred locally along with a palpable right posterior cervical lymph node (LN). A positron emission tomography (PET) scan at that time demonstrated hypermetabolic activity in the posterior occiput and in a posterior neck LN.

She had no history of developmental delay and ambulated easily and commonly ran without difficulty. In the ED, the parents reported that the weakness was progressing and the child was now even having difficulty crawling. They thought that the left leg was worse than the right and that she was also having difficulty grasping objects, again more so with her left hand.\nThe child was diagnosed with pneumonia three weeks prior to presentation to our ED and was treated with Cefdinir. Otherwise, her past medical history was unremarkable. She received varicella, hepatitis A, and influenza vaccinations four days prior to her ED presentation. On review of systems, the patient had not had a bowel movement for 36 hours, when normally she had a daily bowel movement. The family also denied any fevers. Immediately prior to the observed weakness, the child had been in the care of a babysitter; however, no history or signs of trauma were present. The child had no allergies, was not on any medications, was born at term with no complications, and did not have any past surgeries. The child lives with her mother, father, and four siblings. The only pertinent family history was a maternal grandmother with multiple sclerosis.\nIn the emergency department the child was smiling and was interacting appropriately.

Four years ago, the patient underwent colonoscopy in another hospital because of an anal bulge. A ring cavity neoplasm was observed in the rectum 5 cm to 8 cm away from the anus, accounting for two-thirds of the enteric cavity. The neoplasm was crisp and easily bled after contact. A biopsy of the neoplasm showed the pathology of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Rectal cavity ultrasound showed that the adenocarcinoma was 7 cm to 8 cm from the anus, with a size of 4.22 cm \u00d7 0.50 cm. The adenocarcinoma was relatively even in internal echo and had a relatively smooth surface, suggesting UT3N1. Neoadjuvant therapy was performed with 25 times of radiotherapy and two courses of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX) regimen. A review of rectal cavity ultrasound showed that the original lesion size was 2.42 cm \u00d7 0.68 cm, suggesting UT3N1. Therefore, laparoscopic radical resection of rectal cancer and transverse colostomy was performed between the navel and xiphoid. Post-operative pathology showed slightly poorly differentiated residual adenocarcinoma in the intestines, which invaded into the deep muscular layer. In the intestinal wall, a large number of foam cells with calcification were present, as well as multinucleated giant cells. No cancer was observed on the upper, lower and side incisal margins as well as another sampled specimen. The lymph nodes showed chronic inflammation. Post-operative recovery was smooth and the stoma defecation was smooth. Six-course XELOX chemotherapy was then applied.

The vertigos gradually increased in frequency and intensity since they started one month prior her admission. Physical examination revealed a discrete raised, painless mass occupying the left parotid area witch adhered to underlying soft tissue, extending approximately 2 cm in diameter in the sub- and retromandibular regions. There were no restrictions on the cranial nerves supplying this area. No odontogenic cause or any other inflammatory factors could be responsible for the parotid gland swelling. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy in the left neck. Blood pressure was 115/62 mm Hg and the heart rate was 63 beats per minute. Routine laboratory investigations were normal. 24-hour Holter monitoring revealed several episodes of sinus arrest. Ultrasonography showed a well-defined space-occupying lesion of about 31 mm in length and 17 mm in width, which was hypo echoic and located in the deep lobe of the left parotid gland. The rest of the gland showed a homogeneous parenchyma.\nComputerized tomography (CT) showed a large mass extending into the carotid space and protruding into the parapharyngeal space (Figure ).\nA left parotidectomy was performed. The resected gland was a hard mass, which had spread over the bifurcation of the left carotid artery without invading the vessel wall itself.

In January 2018, a routine gastrointestinal endoscopy found an ulcerative lesion of approximately 10 mm diameter in the greater curvature of the gastric body (Fig. ). An endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) of this lesion showed the first three sonographic layers were blurred, which suggested submucosal invasion.

Additional ultrasonography revealed a sessile polypoid lesion, and gallbladder stone and wall thickening were not observed.

She was transported from the trauma bay to the computed tomography (CT) scanner for trauma imaging workup. Her initial CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis with intravenous contrast revealed multiple thoracic injuries including a mediastinal and periaortic hematoma with several areas of contrast blushing, the largest adjacent to the azygos vein suggestive of venous hemorrhage (Fig. ). Additionally, a sternum fracture, multiple rib fractures, complex T4 and T5 vertebral body fractures with osseous fragment within spinal canal, and concurrent perched facets at this level with multilevel spinous process and transverse process fractures were found.

She had been diagnosed with CLL in July 2007, after presenting with splenomegaly and lymphocytosis. She had not been started on therapy, as she was asymptomatic. Her co-morbidities included osteoarthritis and hypertension. The medications she was regularly taking at that time included calcium, vitamin D, and hydrochlorothiazide. She had no previous history of atopy or angioedema.\nThe patient described the episodes beginning as a tingling around her face and mouth similar to a bee sting, swelling of her mouth and finally, a complete inability to breathe. There were no inciting episodes that the patient could point to that caused this to occur.\nIn April 2008, she again developed an attack of angioedema, necessitating another intubation and hospitalization for a few days. This time a complete workup to evaluate her angioedema was done. During her second episode, her C1 esterase level was 4 mg/dL (reference value, >11 mg/dL) and her C1 esterase activity was 5% (reference range, 68%\u2013200%). Her rheumatoid factor was elevated at 87. Her C1Q binding assay and complement 3 levels were normal, but complement 4 levels were noticeably low. Interestingly, when we repeated these studies one month later, her C1 esterase activity had risen to 53%, which may in part have been due to a tapering course of steroids that she received after her second episode.\nGiven the association between acquired angioedema and CLL, we decided to initiate chemotherapy, and repeat the C1 esterase levels after completion of six cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (R-CVP). Her chemotherapy was complicated by a severe reaction to rituximab during the second cycle and it was subsequently discontinued from the regimen.

    "original_text": "At the time of the patient\u2019s initial presentation to the office, the patient was a 44-year-old male who had long-standing low back following an injury that occurred seven years ago. He had undergone an unsuccessful micro-discectomy in 2005, followed by an L4-5 laminectomy and fusion with right iliac crest bone harvest later that year. His axial low back pain significantly improved following the fusion; however he developed severe pain over the iliac crest donor site, steadily worsening in intensity. He described a sharp, stabbing pain located over the right iliac crest and radiating to the buttock, unchanged by position or activity. There was no radiation of pain into the right lower extremity. He had tried physical therapy, as well as multiple oral medications, with no relief. Physical examination revealed tenderness to palpation over the top of the right iliac crest, just medial and lateral to the vertical donor site scar.

She complained of small nodules in the left parotid region that had developed over the course of 2 years. Her main complaint was of recurring periods of worsened symptoms characterized by the exacerbation and remission of gland volume that was possibly triggered by occasional otolaryngologic infections or unrelated to these infections. These symptoms suggest juvenile recurrent parotitis. Facial panoramic radiography revealed the presence of multiple circular radiopaque masses in the left parotid region (Fig. ). The ultrasound revealed increased volume of the left parotid, with imprecise borders, heterogeneous echotexture with hypoechoic and hyperechoic areas within it. These features were suggestive of an inflammatory process associated with calcifications in the parenchyma of the gland. CT scan revealed a dense mass in the left parotid; it was heterogeneous and included calcifications in its center (Fig. ). Because of the association between the patient\u2019s clinical history, her clinical presentation, and the imaging findings, the possible origin of the calcified materials was questioned. There was evidence of sialoliths or dystrophic calcification associated with recurrent inflammation/infection. Sialoliths are typically symptomatic because of their association with secondary bacterial infections, which are generally treated with systemic antibiotic therapy. Spontaneous remission of bacterial sialadenitis associated with sialoliths is not expected. In addition, sialoliths generally observed as oval-shaped calcified masses or fusiforms on imaging. Because of the pediatric nature of this case, the clinical conduct selected to treat this patient was clinical follow-up and the use of imaging and functional assessments of the gland affected every 6 months or when any signs and/or symptoms appeared. After 48 months, the patient is asymptomatic, without periods of exacerbation of the condition. Recent ultrasound (Fig. ) demonstrates an improvement in the inflammatory aspect of the gland.

He had a smoking history of one and a half packs of cigarettes per day for 17 years. One year prior to the current presentation, the patient had been diagnosed with primary lung SCC of the right lower lobe (Fig. a), and had undergone thoracoscopic lower lobectomy. This was staged as pT2aN0M0, stage IB according to the eighth edition of the UICC classification. He then proceeded with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of four cycles of uracil and tegafur.\nComputed tomography (CT) scan showed a gastric fundal mass located in the gastric cardia which measured 5 cm (Fig. b). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a 5 cm subepithelial and ulcerated mass located in the gastric cardia (Fig. c). Because the gastric biopsies had identified SCC, this tumor was suspected to be gastric metastasis from a primary lung SCC. CT scan just prior to surgery revealed remarkable growth of the tumor without any additional organ metastasis. The patient subsequently underwent proximal gastrectomy with resection of the diaphragmatic crus which was reconstructed by esophagogastrostomy one month after the diagnosis.\nThe gross appearance of the gastric lesion showed a hard mass with ulceration of 7.0 \u00d7 7.0 cm, which directly invaded the esophagus and diaphragm (Fig. ). The postoperative histopathological features of the tumor revealed keratinizing SCC with massive submucosal infiltration and major vascular invasion (Fig. ). A total of 17 lymph nodes were evaluated, and none showed any signs of malignancy.

    "original_text": "A nine-year-old boy presented to the clinic with a history of flank pain and hematuria for the past year. He was not known to have any medical illness and had normal developmental growth milestones. Physical examination revealed no evident abnormality. Routine laboratory workup showed a healthy complete blood count and renal function. On an ultrasound scan, left-sided hydronephrosis was seen. There was no evidence of cortical thinning, but the left ureter was dilated. This was traced to the mid-lumbar region. At that point, there was an oval-shaped isoechoic, mildly heterogeneous lesion within the ureter measuring 2.3 x 0.6 cm. This intraluminal lesion in the mid-left lumbar ureter was causing a mild hydroureter and hydronephrosis, suggestive of a fibroepithelial polyp. Assessment with color Doppler ultrasonography was difficult, but there appeared to be some internal vascularity within the lesion. The anteroposterior diameter of the left renal pelvis measured 2.2 cm. An intravenous pyelogram (IVP) was done and showed a left upper ureteric filling defect <1 cm (Figure ).\nThe patient underwent open retroperitoneal surgery with upper ureteral resection and end-to-end anastomosis. Creating a fish-mouth-like opening of the distal end of the ureter was done. Our intraoperative findings included a dilated upper ureter with no aberrant vessels. The fascia around the upper ureter was dissected, and transection was done between the proximal and distal parts of the polyp. Upon opening the ureter, a large ureteral polyp with smooth surfaces was seen (Figure ). Histopathological findings identified a fibroepithelial polyp.\nAn ultrasound scan four months following the surgery showed a significant improvement of the upper urinary tract dilation in comparison to the preoperative ultrasound.

This initial presentation to the ED revealed small lacerations to the face and a minimally displaced fracture of the left anterior seventh rib (). Further workup found no other serious injuries, personal or family history of bleeding diatheses, connective tissue disorders, or neurofibromatosis and after a total visit time of five hours he was discharged home from the ED with pain medications, incentive spirometry, and proper follow-up instructions. Ten days following initial presentation, the patient returned to the ED with complaints of acute onset severe left sided chest pain, dyspnea, and orthopnea that woke him from sleep with no inciting cause. Initial assessment revealed that the patient was tachycardic, tachypneic, and somnolent. Chest X-ray (CXR) was then performed revealing a large, left sided consolidation suspicious for a hemothorax (). A thoracostomy tube was placed immediately yielding 1,700 mL of bright red blood.

On examination she had an indurated, oedematous lesion of 210 \u00d7 120mm in diameter with central necrosis of 20 \u00d7 10mm diameter, classified as a WHO category 3 lesion (Figure ). She weighed 52kgs, and had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of approximately 60mLs/minute. A diagnosis of an oedematous BU lesion was made based on the clinical appearance of the lesion and a positive M. ulcerans PCR of a swab of the lesion.\nShe was commenced on rifampicin 450mg daily and ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily. As we were concerned she was at risk of further tissue necrosis, pre-emptive prednisolone of 30mg daily (0.5mg/kg/day) was initiated at the same time.\nAfter three days the induration associated with the lesion had reduced by 74% to 120 \u00d7 55mm in diameter and the size of the ulceration remained stable (Figure , Table ). Further reduction in induration had occurred by day 6 (Figure ) and after four weeks of prednisolone combined with antibiotics there was no induration associated with the lesion and the size of the ulceration remained stable (Figure ).\nThe ciprofloxacin dose was reduced at day 3 to 250 mg twice daily because of nausea potentially caused by relatively high systemic ciprofloxacin levels related to her advanced age and moderately reduced renal function, and after 26 days of antibiotics she developed a rash and the ciprofloxacin was replaced by clarithromycin 250mg twice daily. Antibiotics were ceased after a total of 56 days. The prednisolone was well tolerated and was initially weaned off over 44 days.

    "original_text": "A 78-year-old female presented at our hospital with discomfort in the inner portion of the lower lip since several months. The discomfort gradually increased, and the patient visited our hospital in June 2012 for a detailed examination. Her medical history included hypertension, and she was taking an antihypertensive drug for the same. She had a medium build and was short in stature. An extraoral examination revealed several elastic and hard lymph nodes on both sides of the neck. In addition, granular areas were observed roughly at the center of the vermillion. Intraoral examination revealed a superficial granular mass measuring 26 mm \u00d7 22 mm and extending from the inner cutaneous portion of the lower lip, which was connected to the vermillion [Figure and ]. No induration was felt on palpation. On the basis of these findings, we diagnosed lower lip cancer with metastasis to the lymph nodes on both sides of the neck.\nHistopathological examination of a biopsy specimen from the primary lesion revealed well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma []. Moreover, 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed increased FDG uptake by the primary lesion [Figure and ]. Several metastatic lymph nodes were also confirmed on both sides of the neck. A final diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (T2N2cM0) of the lower lip was made, and treatment was accordingly planned. First, excision surgery was performed.

The patient had left nephrectomy and left adrenalectomy in 2004, total thyroidectomy with neck dissection, and parathyroid re-implantation in 2017. Pathology of the latter was clear cell carcinoma with a small focus of follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma measuring 0.4 cm, negative lymph nodes. No metastatic lesions were documented in the left adrenal gland pathology. Furthermore, he had radiation therapy to the lung in 2017 followed by chemotherapy with pazopanib since March 2017. The starting dose was 800 mg orally daily and then it was decreased to 400 mg daily afterward.\nThere was no prior history of steroids, opiate, appetite stimulants like Megace, or new medications use since 2017. There was no history of trauma to the abdomen nor any history of autoimmune disease (personal or in the family). Interestingly, the patient had a prior history of type 2 diabetes diagnosed at age 54, requiring more than 50 units of insulin as a total daily dose. However, there was a significant improvement in his blood glucose levels in the past 6 months; hence, insulin was discontinued. Vital signs on admission showed a blood pressure of 115/55 mm Hg, a heart rate of 71 beats per minute, a temperature of 36.5 \u00b0C, and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Orthostatic vital signs were positive. Physical examination revealed diffuse skin hyperpigmentation with no significant abnormalities on the abdominal examination.

On the initial visit, the patient underwent catagmatic surgery for the open fracture. Slow wound recovery was observed because of a considerable volume of exudate and a hemorrhagic tendency. The coagulation-hemostasis test showed that the prothrombin time (PT) was 14.0 seconds, which was within the normal range (11.5 to 15 seconds), and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 180 seconds, which was longer than the normal range (28 to 45 seconds). The coagulation factor test performed in the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology showed that the activity of coagulation factor IX in the patient's blood was as low as 27%; therefore, the patient was diagnosed with hemophilia B. The wound management was performed by continuing to use a coagulation-hemostasis test, regular injections of vitamin K to enhance coagulation factor synthesis, proper wound disinfection, and antibiotics. The patient was preoperatively injected with recombinant coagulation factor IX (Wyeth Inc., Seoul, Korea; 40 IU/kg IV) one day before the operation. One hour before the operation, an injection with the same amount of recombinant coagulation factor IX was administered. Botropase (Hemocoagulase 1N1HU), a hemostatic, tranexamic acid, and vitamin K were also intraoperatively injected.

Her main complaint was of recurring periods of worsened symptoms characterized by the exacerbation and remission of gland volume that was possibly triggered by occasional otolaryngologic infections or unrelated to these infections. These symptoms suggest juvenile recurrent parotitis. Facial panoramic radiography revealed the presence of multiple circular radiopaque masses in the left parotid region (Fig. ). The ultrasound revealed increased volume of the left parotid, with imprecise borders, heterogeneous echotexture with hypoechoic and hyperechoic areas within it. These features were suggestive of an inflammatory process associated with calcifications in the parenchyma of the gland. CT scan revealed a dense mass in the left parotid; it was heterogeneous and included calcifications in its center (Fig. ). Because of the association between the patient\u2019s clinical history, her clinical presentation, and the imaging findings, the possible origin of the calcified materials was questioned. There was evidence of sialoliths or dystrophic calcification associated with recurrent inflammation/infection. Sialoliths are typically symptomatic because of their association with secondary bacterial infections, which are generally treated with systemic antibiotic therapy.

He was treated with sigmoid colon cancer radical surgery on 23 June 1997. Postoperative histopathological analysis revealed sigmoid colon cancer graded as Dukes C1 (Fig a). The patient did not receive any chemotherapy or radiotherapy after the surgery.\nIn October 2003, the patient again presented with abdominal pain and colonscopy revealed colon cancer. He underwent radial ascending colon carcinoma sugery in 08 October 2003. Histopathological analysis demonstrated moderately and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon invading to the outer membrane (Fig b). Following surgery, the patient was then treated with oral Carmofur 150 mg t.i.d.\nIn April 2009, the patient was admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine with gross hematuria, which was later diagnosed as bladder cancer. The patient underwent right pelviolithotomy combined with excision of the remaining right ureter and the bladder cuff. Postoperative histopathological analysis revealed (bladder, right ureter and right renal pelvis) multiple invasive stage II urothelial papillary carcinoma (Fig c). The patient was treated with infusion chemotherapy (Doxorubicin) following surgery.\nIn July 2010, the patient again complained of gross hematuria and was subsequently admitted to People's Hospital of Jinyun Town. He received a partial bladder resection and postoperative pathology subsequently indicated invasive high-level papillary urothelial carcinoma of the right wall of the bladder (Fig d).\nIn September 2011, a mass (2 \u00d7 2 cm) which was stiff and fixed in the left neck was discovered.

She had been treated at a local psychiatric clinic for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, and she had a relatively low body mass index of 18.44 kg/m2.\nWhile visiting the emergency room, her abdomen looked markedly distended. She suffered from nausea and retching but was unable to vomit. Her vital signs upon arrival at the emergency room were as follows: Blood pressure 128/83 mmHg, pulse 78 beats/min, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, and a body temperature of 36.8\u2103. Chest AP and simple abdomen flat upright view revealed that the stomach was full of food material with air-fluid level. Computed tomography showed a massive gastric overdistension with pneumoperitoneum (). A Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder cavity, and the amount of urine there was nearly zero (). Levin tube insertion revealed that the material in her stomach was incompletely digested and that drainage was not effective. The initial complete blood cell count was within normal ranges, including a hemoglobin level of 12 g/dl. Blood chemistry had no unusual characteristics except doubly elevated levels of amylase and lipase.\nWhile going through the various examinations, the emergency specialist noticed that her both lower extremities were turn to be cyanosis. The pulsation of both lower extremities could not be checked. Furthermore, her heart rate was changed to a tachycardic rate of 135-143 beats/min two hours after it was first checked.

As a result of cervical spinal cord injury, he was paralyzed in the lower body. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a late-onset traumatic diaphragmatic hernia with strangulated ileum (Fig. ). The small intestine, transverse colon, and omentum were displaced into the left thoracic cavity, and some portions of these organs showed a decrease in blood flow. Left lung collapse and a compressed right lung with mediastinal shift were evident. The patient underwent emergency surgery. After replacing the incarcerated organs to their original positions, scattered areas of necrosis were identified in the small intestine, transverse colon, and omentum (Fig. ). By using interrupted sutures with non-absorbable 1\u20130 monofilament, the diaphragmatic orifice was closed.

Moreover, CT imaging of the portal phase revealed a filling defect within the splenic vein where it was in contact with the tumor (). On magnetic resonance imaging, the tumor appeared as an area of signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images (). On positron emission tomography-CT scan, the tumor exhibited greater uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (). Although a definitive preoperative diagnosis could not be made, we suspected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and distal pancreatectomy with lymph node dissection was scheduled, without neoadjuvant chemotherapy, after obtaining consent from the patient. The pancreas was divided along the left edge of the GDA after mobilization of the artery; however, pathological examination of a frozen section of the pancreas stump was positive for PNET, and therefore a total pancreatectomy was performed ().

The swelling was initially small and painless to start with and was associated with fever and chills. She was seen at a local hospital, where a radiograph was taken which revealed a cystic and lytic lesion of the little finger proximal phalanx []. It was diagnosed as osteomyelitis, and she was treated with analgesics and antibiotics. As the swelling and pain progressed, she was referred to this institute. The swelling was 6 \u00d7 6 cm, tender, pulsatile and firm in consistency. The fresh radiograph showed a large soft tissue mass with some calcification within and complete destruction of the phalanx [Figure and ]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the hand revealed an ill defined expansible lesion in the proximal phalanx with marrow signal changes that were T1 hypointense and T2/Short tau inversion recovery hyperintense with juxtacortical soft tissue mass []. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the lesion was performed and reported as having features of \u201csmall blue round cell tumor.\u201d Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was normal. Axillary lymph nodes were enlarged, and FNAC had features suggestive of reactive lymphadenitis. The patient underwent wide excision with fifth carpometacarpal joint disarticulation. Histopathology of excised tissue showed small round cells with high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and coarse chromatin with occasional pseudorosettes, suggestive of Ewing's sarcoma. The cells were periodic acid Schiff positive and immunohistochemistry was positive for CD99 [Figure and ].\nThe patient was discharged and advised to review after 3 weeks for chemotherapy.
