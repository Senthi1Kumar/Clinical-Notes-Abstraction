She complained of recurrent fever and asymmetric edema of the lower extremities for over 1 month, as well as painful swelling both in the thyroid and labium majus for 2 weeks. In the previous hospital, due to the finding of multiple bilateral cysts which were palpable nodules in her thyroid gland by ultrasound examination, a left lobe thyroid puncture and drainage had been conducted and an aspergillus fumigatus infection was detected. She had a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis for 8 years, and received prednisone treatment for these diseases. But from November 2015, prednisone was switched to methylprednisolone, and hydroxychloroquine has been added because of lupus nephritis aggravation, and tacrolimus has also been added to the medications in the following month. She was also diagnosed with renal hypertension and diabetes induced by steroids, and received antihypertension and antihyperglycemic therapy. She had no history of pulmonary diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or any repeated infections, and had no addiction to drugs, smoking or alcoholism.

Pregnancy was uneventful, however fetal sonographic evaluation (2nd trimester) revealed enlarged cerebral ventricles. The child was born by C-section at 39 weeks, with an overgrowth of weight 5310 g (+5.3 SD), length of 57 cm (+4.3 SD), head circumference of 38 cm (+3.3 SD), and Apgar score of 8, with difficult respiratory adaptation immediately after birth. She presented with hypotonia and marked developmental delay (at 3 y 7 mo of age she could raise the head with difficulty, was able to sit with support, but spoke no intelligible words). Myoclonic jerks were noted from the first day of life and intensified after 1 y of age (with EEG expression). More complex seizures were noted after 3 years. The child was suspected of deafness at 2 mo, which was confirmed by ASSR with bilateral moderate sensorineural hearing loss. A hearing aid was inserted at 8 mo and frequent otitis media were recorded in time. No visual (object) reaction was noted at 2 mo, however the ophthalmologic examination was relatively normal (interpreted as cortical blindness). The child was diagnosed at 2 mo with a congenital heart defect. Oxygen desaturation during the night was observed after 1 y of age. Recurrent infections (without fever) in different locations were diagnosed over time (otitis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia). During an episode of pneumonia (at 1 y 3 mo) in the ICU, she was given several albumin infusions, and every time she developed a fever after a few hours.

Symptoms first presented as impairments in his ability to push off with his left foot during moderate exercise. He did not present with radicular symptoms but did have a previous X-ray of the lumbar spine, which showed no signs of stenosis or compression.\nUpon initial physical examination, the patient was found to have no tenderness to palpation of his lumbar spine. Tenderness was appreciated in the medial left glute and left posterior medial thigh down to the knee. No reproducible pain was noted below the knee, and no obvious foot deformity, erythema, or edema were present. He did endorse decreased sensation in the distal third of the plantar foot including the first metatarsal. The patient was unable to flex or extend his left first metatarsal. Left Achilles tendon reflex was 0/5, with a contralateral reflex of 5/5.\nThe patient was subsequently evaluated by a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist, who noted diminished left S1 reflex. He was able to stand in plantarflexion on the right, but was unable to flex to full height on the left. Also, weakness of the left flexor hallucis longus and digitorum longus with absent sensation on the plantar surface of the first metatarsal to pinprick and light touch was noted.

On physical examination, she was hemodynamically stable without any pathological finding. A chest x-ray was done and it showed mass-like opacities abutting the right heart (Figure ).\nTo have a better idea of the cause of opacity, a further assessment with computed tomography (CT) chest with contrast was ordered and it showed a large, well-circumscribed, heterogeneously enhancing mass of 10 cm with peripheral calcification in the right mediastinum.

She had previously been unsuccessfully managed with epidural steroid injections and multimodal analgesics. A nerve conduction study was unremarkable for any pathology. She was diagnosed with failed back surgery syndrome and counseled regarding her treatment options, including spinal cord stimulation. She elected to pursue spinal cord stimulation with the Nevro Senza HF10 system. As part of her evaluation for SCS placement, the patient was seen at the behavioral medicine clinic and underwent presurgical psychological testing and evaluation by a board-certified psychologist. Her psychological assessment profile suggested a high likelihood of a good postoperative outcome. She had a history of depression and anxiety, both of which were stable and under medical management. The patient underwent an uneventful SCS trial with near 100% relief of her back and leg pain and wished to proceed with permanent implant. Her permanent placement procedure was uneventful with leads placed at the same levels as her trial leads (.) with the tip of the right lead at the top of the T8 vertebral body and left lead tip at the mid T9 vertebral body. The device was activated in the post-anesthesia care unit with bipole setting on electrodes 10 and 11.\nThe first day following her procedure, the patient noted a buzzing or a chirping sound predominately in her left ear as well as vertigo, intermittent involuntary left facial twitches, and perioral numbness, all of which were new to her. She also reported nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which she has attributed to anxiety in the past.

Her past surgical history included a hysterectomy and a femoral neck fracture repair. She also suffered from hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Her body mass index was 18.2kg/m2 and her vital signs were all within normal limits. Physical examination demonstrated tenderness in the left lower abdomen without Blumberg\u2019s sign and with no demonstration of Murphy\u2019s sign. Laboratory data were all within normal limits including inflammatory response, liver function tests, and biliary enzymes. A CT scan of her abdomen at admission demonstrated an enlarged and wall-thickened gallbladder without gallstone, prominent small bowel gas, and mild intestinal dilatation and wall thickening (Figure a). The findings of ultrasonography were the same as those of the CT scan. Therefore, we diagnosed her condition as acute enterocolitis or subileus and began a starvation and transfusion cure. After a half day, she suddenly presented with severe right upper abdominal pain and vomiting. Conservative treatment, including a painkiller and antiemetic, was not effective so another abdominal CT scan was carried out. The second CT scan of her abdomen demonstrated a more distended and wall-thickened gallbladder that had rotated approximately 180 degrees and deviated to the midline of her abdomen compared with the CT images at admission (Figure b).

Taking these into account, we considered that her gallbladder was free hanging and a diagnosis of gallbladder torsion was clinically assumed. Therefore, the patient underwent an emergency laparotomy.

Examination showed lateral joint line tenderness without any ligamentous laxity. Plain radiographs of the knee were normal. Further imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed discoid lateral meniscus with a horizontal tear (\n). Diagnostic scope was done and we found an incomplete discoid lateral meniscus with complex vertical tear involving anterior horn with horizontal extension into the midbody (\n). Arthroscopic all-inside repair was done without any implant. Postoperatively, the patient's knee was protected with a brace. Postsurgery, 6 weeks, the brace was discontinued and the patient started full weight bearing without pain. At 6 months postsurgery, the patient was pain free and without any mechanical symptoms.\nThe position was supine, with the leg hung freely at the end of the table. A tourniquet was used to secure hemostasis. A standard anterolateral portal was used for diagnostic arthroscopy. The finding was an incomplete discoid lateral meniscus with peripheral vertical tear of the anterior horn and partial horizontal tear involving the mid body but not breaching the inner peripheries (\n). A standard anteromedial portal was made and the tear was further assessed using a probe. The tear site was prepared for repair. An additional far medial portal was made to allow arthroscopic instrumentation. A suture passer loaded with synthetic monofilament absorbable suture, introduced through far medial portal, while viewing through anteromedial portal (\n). The torn central fragment and the peripheral rim of the meniscus were penetrated and the tip of suture was pulled through using an arthroscopic grasper through anterolateral portal.

Until recently our patient had been physically active, including participation in marathon running and cross-country skiing. Two years ago he had experienced a cardiac arrest but was successfully resuscitated. Aside from that, he had been in good health. About one year ago he started to experience a progressive weakness of his right hand and arm. During the same period, cognitive deterioration and personality changes appeared.\nA neurophysiologic investigation including nerve conduction studies (NCS) and EMG were performed prior to his first hospital visit, including all four extremities, proximally and distally. The NCS showed normal sensory and motor conduction velocities. The EMG showed spontaneous denervation activity, fasciculations and neurogenic motor unit aberrations including polyphasia and reduced interference within all examined muscles (arms and legs, both proximal and distal). The conclusion of the neurophysiologist was that of a general motor neuron disease. The neurological examination showed a profound weakness of the right hand, a slight weakness of the left hand, and muscle atrophies in the hands, arms and shoulders. Fasciculations were widely spread over arms, shoulders, thorax and legs. The deep tendon reflexes were normal and both plantar reflexes reacted normal. The pain and touch sensations were normal. An MRI scan of the spinal canal showed no pathologic lesions of the spinal cord.\nA routine analysis of the CSF was normal with regard to cell count and protein concentration, and there were no signs of ongoing inflammation.

Skin of the breast above the lesions was clear and without any defects, nipple was without discharge. Subsequent core-cut biopsy from one of the lesions verified IDC. Results of the staging investigation, realized by computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and bones, were normal.\nIn the patient conservative surgery (biquadrantectomy) with sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed, followed by simple mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. Advanced surgery was realized after results of frozen section, which confirmed positive resection margins in specimen from quadrantectomy with finding of metastasis in two from three sentinel lymph nodes.\nIn the resection specimen there were found macroscopically two independent tumours, measuring 18 mm and 25 mm, and lying approximately 3 cm apart. Cut surface of the both lesions was distinct, smaller tumour was solid of yellowish colour, larger lesion contained cystic spaces with slurry staff inside. Microscopically, the larger tumour was diagnosed as conventional poorly differentiated IDC, with high degree of cytologic atypia, numerous mitotic figures, and widespread geographic necrosis as well as with signs of angioinvasion to the lymphatic vessels ().

On physical examination, she was hemodynamically stable without any pathological finding. A chest x-ray was done and it showed mass-like opacities abutting the right heart (Figure ).\nTo have a better idea of the cause of opacity, a further assessment with computed tomography (CT) chest with contrast was ordered and it showed a large, well-circumscribed, heterogeneously enhancing mass of 10 cm with peripheral calcification in the right mediastinum. Also, there was a dilated vessel along the posteromedial and inferior of the mass (Figure ).\nAfter the chest CT findings, the patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and cardiac consult was called. In order to differentiate if the mass was due to some tumor or some anomaly of the coronary vessel, coronary CT angiography with contrast was ordered. A subsequent coronary CT angiography (CCTA) showed a 9.7 cm aneurysm and an anomalous vessel emanating from the left coronary artery and the proximal circumflex, fistulizing into the right atrial appendage. CCTA also showed a dilated right atrium likely due to fistula formation (Figures -).\nWhen the right heart catheterization was performed, a rise in saturation was noted in the right side of the heart due to shunting of blood from the left side to the right side of the heart as a result of coronary cameral fistula formation between the right heart and the anomalous vessel originating from the left coronary artery and proximal circumflex artery. On transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), an enlarged right atrial chamber was noted due to the fistulous tract draining into the right atrium.

He had recently been detected to be hypertensive and was on antihypertensive medications. He had no other risk factors for stroke (diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, alcoholism, hyperhomocystenemia). He continued to have episodes of hemodynamic TIA despite best medical management. These were not related to exertion or valsalva maneuver and were thought to be postural, related to hemodynamic factors. While under evaluation in the hospital, he developed a major stroke involving the left upper and lower limbs from which he recovered only partially (power 3/5).\nRoutine blood investigations were normal. Computed tomography (CT) brain revealed multiple infarcts in the right cerebral hemisphere []. Echocardiogram and electrocardiography were normal. Color Doppler scan of the carotid arteries revealed total occlusion of the right ICA. This was confirmed with CT angiogram (CTA) and MR angiogram (MRA). DSA revealed total occlusion of the right ICA at its origin. There was poor collateral flow to the right hemisphere from the left ICA (across the anterior communicating artery) and from vertebrobasilar system due to an incomplete circle of Willis. There was no evidence of thrombus or embolus in any IC vessel []. This led to an inadequate perfusion of the right cerebral hemisphere resulting in recurrent TIAs. After the major stroke in the hospital, a repeat CT brain revealed a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarct.

He was born at 39 weeks + 4 days of gestational age and with birth weight of 3.2 kg. There were no definite abnormal signs such as prolonged rupture of membranes, asphyxia, pneumothorax or heart problem. There was no family history of mirror movements or neurological abnormality. His parents informed us that he had no definite sign of abnormal development, such as asymmetry or hand dominance at an early age (< 18 months), and no significant developmental delay. However, they pointed out that the patient suffered from manipulative inabilities, such as the handling of chopsticks and the use of a pencil, due to severe mirror movements. The patient had not been tested or treated for congenital mirror movements by any rehabilitative occupational or physical therapist. The patient's parents provided informed consent for his participation in this study.\nMRI was performed during the first visit to determine the presence of any specific brain lesion. A pediatric neuroradiologist found no evidence of abnormal signal intensity.

He has a previous history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease with coronary artery bypass grafting in 2015, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from tobacco.\nHe presented with progressive shortness of breath and underwent a workup with CT scan of the chest without contrast, which revealed two distinct appearing tumors, one in the right upper lobe with a tumor size of 1.5 cm and another in the right lower lung with a tumor size of 13 cm (see Figures and ). He underwent a right upper lobe wedge resection and a right lower lobectomy for these tumors. Pathology revealed two distinct neoplasms. The right upper lobe tumor was a moderately differentiated lung adenocarcinoma, stage pT2a (see ). Pathology revealed focal invasion of the visceral pleura, confirmed by elastic stain.\nThe pathology of the right lower lobe tumor was a SFT. This tumor showed a fascicular pattern of spindled cells with elongated nuclei (see ). The mitotic rate was significantly elevated at 13 mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields (see ). Multiple fields of necrosis were also identified. Immunohistochemical stains were performed, which revealed reactivity for CD34 and Bcl-2. The tumor was negative for pancytokeratin. This tumor did not extend beyond the lung parenchyma. A routine sampling of the right lower paratracheal (4R), subcarinal (7), paraesophageal (8), and right hilar (10R) lymph nodes was negative for metastatic disease from either tumor. The surgical margins were negative for tumor in both cases. Thus, no additional therapy was recommended at that time.

However, there was no enlarged regional lymph node. The mass showed mild FDG uptake on positron emission tomography. On fiber-optic bronchoscopy, a protruding mass with an irregular surface was found at the mid-trachea. The mass was hypervascular and fragile.

He was resuscitated as per the ATLS protocol at the hospital where he was initially treated and when he arrived at the casualty department of our hospital, he was conscious and all his vital parameters were within normal limits. He also gave the history that he was under treatment for segmental myoclonus which was characterised by semirhythmic involuntary muscle contractions.\nHis radiographs showed a left-sided posterior acetabular wall fracture (AO type 6 2 A1). He also had an ipsilateral femoral neck fracture with the femoral head displaced anteriorly (Figures and ) and also an associated middle-third fracture of the shaft of the femur (). He also had an extra-articular distal femur fracture on the opposite side (AO type 3 3 A1). On arrival, his serum lactate level was 1.9 mmol/l indicating that he had been adequately resuscitated.\nHe was taken for definitive surgery 9 hours after arrival. The patient was positioned in the lateral position and a posterolateral approach was planned to address the acetabular and femoral head fractures. Upon dissection, the femoral head () was found to have buttonholed and displaced anteriorly through the capsule which was found to be torn. The posterior wall of the acetabulum was addressed using two contoured reconstruction plates (). Using the trochanteric flip osteotomy, better access to the femoral neck was achieved and the femoral head was reduced anatomically and secured with K-wires. Then the femoral shaft fracture was reduced by opening the fracture site and held with a clamp.

He also gave the history that he was under treatment for segmental myoclonus which was characterised by semirhythmic involuntary muscle contractions.\nHis radiographs showed a left-sided posterior acetabular wall fracture (AO type 6 2 A1). He also had an ipsilateral femoral neck fracture with the femoral head displaced anteriorly (Figures and ) and also an associated middle-third fracture of the shaft of the femur (). He also had an extra-articular distal femur fracture on the opposite side (AO type 3 3 A1). On arrival, his serum lactate level was 1.9 mmol/l indicating that he had been adequately resuscitated.\nHe was taken for definitive surgery 9 hours after arrival. The patient was positioned in the lateral position and a posterolateral approach was planned to address the acetabular and femoral head fractures. Upon dissection, the femoral head () was found to have buttonholed and displaced anteriorly through the capsule which was found to be torn. The posterior wall of the acetabulum was addressed using two contoured reconstruction plates (). Using the trochanteric flip osteotomy, better access to the femoral neck was achieved and the femoral head was reduced anatomically and secured with K-wires. Then the femoral shaft fracture was reduced by opening the fracture site and held with a clamp.

A pedunculated polyp was detected in the duodenum (). The patient was referred to our hospital for further investigation and treatment of the polyp. The patient had been taking medication for hyperlipidemia but had no history of gastrointestinal diseases. A physical examination revealed no abnormalities, and there was no evidence of peripheral lymphadenopathy. Laboratory findings revealed an elevated level of total cholesterol to 254 mg/dL, but levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and blood cell counts were within normal ranges. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a pedunculated polyp in the duodenal second portion. The head of the polyp was approximately 20 mm in size (Figures and ). There were no erosions or ulcers in the polyp. The tumor had long stalk; therefore it easily migrated to the stomach (). Magnifying observation with narrowband imaging confirmed that the surface was entirely covered with intact duodenal mucosa, suggesting a subepithelial origin of the tumor (). Endoscopic ultrasonography visualized at least three cystic structures in the polyp head (Figures and ). Based on the macroscopic and ultrasonography features, Brunner's gland hamartoma was highly suspected.\nThe patient agreed to undergo endoscopic resection of the polyp to prevent duodenal obstruction due to impaction of the tumor. First, we repositioned the polyp from the duodenum to the stomach by traction with biopsy forceps. The stalk was then strangulated with a detachable snare (). Next, the polyp was successfully resected using snare polypectomy (). Although there was no bleeding from the resected section, the cut surface was closed with two metal clips ().

    "cleaned_text": "a 68-year-old japanese woman underwent barium follow-through examination for the upper gastrointestinal tract as part of a routine medical screening. a pedunculated polyp was detected in the duodenum (). the patient was referred to our hospital for further investigation and treatment of the polyp. the patient had been taking medication for hyperlipidemia but had no history of gastrointestinal diseases. a physical examination revealed no abnormalities, and there was no evidence of peripheral lymphadenopathy. laboratory findings revealed an elevated level of total cholesterol to 254 mg/dl, but levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and blood cell counts were within normal ranges. esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a pedunculated polyp in the duodenal second portion. the head of the polyp was approximately 20 mm in size (figures and ). there were no erosions or ulcers in the polyp. the tumor had long stalk; therefore it easily migrated to the stomach (). magnifying observation with narrowband imaging confirmed that the surface was entirely covered with intact duodenal mucosa, suggesting a subepithelial origin of the tumor (). endoscopic ultrasonography visualized at least three cystic structures in the polyp head (figures and ). based on the macroscopic and ultrasonography features, brunner's gland hamartoma was highly suspected.\nthe patient agreed to undergo endoscopic resection of the polyp to prevent duodenal obstruction due to impaction of the tumor. first, we repositioned the polyp from the duodenum to the stomach by traction with biopsy forceps. the stalk was then strangulated with a detachable snare (). next, the polyp was successfully resected using snare polypectomy (). although there was no bleeding from the resected section, the cut surface was closed with two metal clips (). the size of the resected specimen was 26 \u00d7 19 mm (). macroscopically, multiple cystic structures were observed in the head of the polyp, whereas no cyst was detected in the stalk (). pathological evaluation revealed a lobular arrangement of proliferated brunner's glands separated by fibromuscular",
