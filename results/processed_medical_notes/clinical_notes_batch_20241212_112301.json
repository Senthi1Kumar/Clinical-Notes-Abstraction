The results of a complete blood count, a blood chemistry panel, and electrolyte testing were within the normal limits, and no sign of infection was observed. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm, and a chest X-ray showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and mild bilateral pleural effusion. Echocardiography showed a very large cystic mass compressing the posterior wall of the left atrium, and a large amount of pericardial effusion caused a diastolic collapse of the ventricles that was consistent with cardiac tamponade. A computed tomography scan of the chest revealed a 9-cm, round, homogeneous cystic mass with well-defined margins in the subcarinal area. The cyst compressed the left atrium, left main bronchus, and pulmonary veins, and displaced the pulmonary veins (). An emergency right-sided thoracotomy was performed because of the sudden onset of atrial fibrillation, low blood pressure, and aggravated dyspnea. The cystic mass was located in the subcarinal area and compressed the left atrium anteriorly. After peri-cardiotomy and aspiration of the content of the cyst, the atrial fibrillation ceased, and the patient\u2019s blood pressure increased. The cyst was radically resected, but a part of the cyst wall remained that was densely attached to the left atrium and major vessels.

The lesions on his feet were painful and pruritic, limiting his ability to wear shoes and ambulate for the past two years. His disease showed little to no response to numerous topical agents including topical nitrogen mustard, imiquimod, clobetasol, vinegar soaks, PUVA soaks, amoxicillin, and doxycycline. Per the patient, consideration was made for amputation of the left foot below the ankle, which he refused. Subsequently, he was referred to radiation oncology.\nPhysical exam revealed tender, confluent, erythematous, and desquamated patches on the skin extending from the dorsal and ventral surfaces of his left foot to the ankle (Figures and ). His right foot had smaller, erythematous patches proximal to the 4th and 5th digits extending between the digits (). He was recommended surface HDR brachytherapy to his symptomatic lesions. The patient agreed to begin radiation therapy first to his most prominent and painful lesions on his left foot and undergo subsequent treatments for his other lesions if results warranted. A preliminary scan of the left foot showed diffuse involvement with some dorsal lesions > 5 mm in thickness.

She was also noted to have enhancing liver lesions (), suggestive of metastatic disease (cT4N1M1). Pulmonary embolus and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy were also noted. Biopsy of the mass revealed clear cell renal cell carcinoma, WHO ISUP nucleolar grade 3. She received Apixaban 10mg/day for management of pulmonary embolus.\nShe was started on Pazopanib 800 mg orally once daily which was later switched to Nivolumab after she developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to a duodenal ulcer.\nInterval imaging 6 months after targeted therapy revealed a decrease in the size of the primary renal mass, although the thrombus extension into the IVC still persisted with development of new hilar lymphadenopathy and segmental pulmonary embolism. Nivolumab was continued and 3-month PET/CT showed further reduction in the size of the renal mass with thrombus extension now to the level of liver. There were new enhancing masses in the liver suspicious for metastases with subcarinal, precarinal, and bilateral hilar mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nShe was initiated on Cabozantinib in addition to the Nivolumab in view of new lymphadenopathy. She tolerated the new regimen very well and was completely symptom-free with this therapeutic combination (). New imaging with PET/CT showed no FDG avid lesions anywhere in the body including the IVC thrombus with significant reduction in the size of the renal mass. MRI Angiogram of the abdomen showed the IVC thrombus invading the IVC lateral wall and situated below the hepatic veins ().\nBased on the imaging, it was decided to proceed with posttherapy right cytoreductive nephrectomy with IVC thrombectomy.

On physical examination, bilateral hearing impairment was found. The cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected signal changes consisted with multiple cerebral infarctions and bilateral demyelination in the centrum semiovale. And the cerebral MRA detected atherosclerotic cerebral arteries and bilateral stenosis of the middle cerebral arteries (Fig. a, b). For further diagnosis, the patient underwent DSA subsequently. The total amount of iopamidol (Bracco Imaging Italia S.r.L.) administered during the procedure was 110 ml. The DSA showed that the patient had bilateral embryonic posterior cerebral arteries, 40% stenosis of the left middle cerebral artery and tortuous vertebral arteries bilaterally. There was no obvious calcification of the aortic arch; angiography of the arch using 25 ml iopamidol was performed only once. Ten minutes after the aortic arch angiography, the patient experienced mild headache. The pain was bearable, and the patient could cooperate during the remainder of the procedure. The DSA was completed 20 min later. No haemorrhage or vasospasm was detected during the procedure. The headache was continuous, and the patient suffered nausea and vomiting. The immediate physical examination showed no obvious abnormal sign. The patient was treated with 8 mg ramosetron and 10 mg dexamethasone. After 20 min of observation, the symptoms were relieved. Her cerebral CT scan at the time was normal (Fig. a, b, c). Two hours later, the patient manifested dizziness with nausea and vomiting and was treated with 8 mg ondansetron and 20 mg diphenhydramine. Meanwhile, compound sodium chloride injection was used to facilitate the elimination of the contrast agent. The treatment alleviated her symptoms. Four hours after the procedure, the patient re-experienced dizziness; thus 5 mg dexamethasone was administered but resulted in no alleviation until after 11 h wherein dizziness was relived but her blood pressure was 183",

The PET-CT and CT scan results showed hypertrophy of multiple lymph nodes. In the subsequent bone marrow finding, a number of cells were in metaphase and, therefore, the metaphase quality was adequate. In the analysis of 20 cells in metaphase, no clone with chromosomal abnormality was observed and the karyotype was normal. Therefore, it was concluded that there was no evidence of bone marrow involvement of the lymphoma. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with atypical peripheral CD4 T cell lymphoma (follicular helper type, stage IIIA) and was recommended to receive chemotherapy at the hospital in accordance with the standard treatment guideline. However, first of all, his guardian and medical doctor suggested that the patient was unlikely to withstand chemotherapy, considering his age. Secondly, the patient was not within the normal range of standard body weight. Thirdly, the patient rejected chemotherapy due to unbearable pain and poor appetite and general weakness. Subsequently, the patient visited our hospital on December 23, 2015. At that time, there was no chief complaint caused by the diagnosis, and the patient complained of low energy and indigestion, among others. In the images he brought to our hospital, we found abnormal lymph node hypertrophy in the left intracarotid lesion, both cervical level II, left supraclavicular, both axillar, both mediastinal and interlobar, common hepatic artery, aortocaval, left iliac chain, right external iliac and inguinal lymph nodes. The blood pressure of the patient was 127/84 mm Hg, his temperature was 36.0\u00b0C, his pulse rate was 91, his respiration rate was 18, his weight was 47.95 kg",

She was a known diabetic but was on irregular treatment and poorly controlled according to the records available. Examination showed the patient to be febrile, along with tachycardia of 110/min. The patient was normotensive at admission. The patient was pale but had no other significant finding on general physical examination. Examination showed an ill-defined tender lump occupying the right lumbar and hypochondrium of approximately 10 \u00d7 8 cm size. Because of the tenderness and obesity of the patient the characteristics of the lump could not be elicited fully. Hematological investigations showed a hemoglobin of 5 g/dl and total count of 13,000/mm3. Biochemical investigations showed a blood sugar of 350 mg/dl with ketonuria, deranged blood urea (100 mg/dl) and serum creatinine (3 mg/dl). X-ray of the abdomen revealed air lucencies along the right psoas muscle, but no free air under diaphragm. Because of suspicion of emphysematous pyelonephritis, a CT scan was ordered and this revealed the right kidney enlarged with multiple air lucencies in the parenchyma with non-excretion of contrast, suggestive of emphysematous pyelonephritis [Figures and ]. The patient was explored in the emergency for right nephrectomy. A right nephrectomy with debridement of the surrounding necrotic tissue was done.

On examination, tenderness in the thoracic spine region was positive. Neurologic examination demonstrated bilateral lower limb spasticity with an asymmetric pyramidal pattern of weakness (right > left, Medical Research Council grade 4 and 3, respectively). No reflex deficits were identified, and there was no evidence of bladder or bowel dysfunction. No further neurological deficits were found. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine revealed a diffusely contrast-enhancing epidural mass extending from vertebral body T6 to T8 with compression of the spinal cord (Fig. A, B, G). The epidural mass extended through the right intervertebral foramen of T6\u20137, forming a paravertebral tumor of similar size. No hemorrhage or infiltration of bony structures was noted. The possibility of inflammatory spondylitis with epidural abscess was considered while tumor should be excluded. Laboratory investigations including tumor markers did not show any abnormal findings.\nTo achieve early decompression of the spinal cord and establish a definite pathological diagnosis by samples from the epidural mass, a T6\u20138 laminectomy was performed.

Complete resection was impossible because of significant adherence of the tumor to the dural sheath. After successful surgery procedure, the postoperative course was uneventful.\nPathological examination of the tumor samples revealed that the majority of the tumor cells were monocytoid small B-cells, which have small to medium sized nuclei and abundant pale cytoplasm, surrounding germinal centers.

    "original_text": "A 74 year-old man was transferred to our institution with biventricular heart failure and suspected myocarditis. One week earlier, he was admitted to a local hospital due to decreased exercise tolerance and a rapidly worsening shortness of breath. Three weeks before, he had flu-like syndrome. Due to coronary heart disease the patient had undergone a coronary artery bypass grafting 20 years prior to the current admission. A recently performed angiogram showed that all bypass-grafts were competent.\nOn admission, his physical examination was unremarkable except for tachycardia and dyspnea. ECG revealed a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of approximately 120 bpm without significant repolarisation disturbances. Transthoracic echocardiography showed an increased left ventricular (LV) and-diastolic dimension of 58 mm with global thickening and severely reduced systolic function (ejection fraction 15%). No new regional wall abnormalities were noted. Chest X-ray showed a cardiomegaly and pleural effusion on the left side. Blood chemistry showed a slightly increased troponin T and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB. NT-pro brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level was 18186 ng/L. Serologic tests for cardiotropic viruses were negative. The patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit, and standard heart failure therapy was started including beta-blocker, diuretics, and angiotensin converting enzyme. Four days later, the patient had a clinical deterioration with worsening of dyspnea and severe hypotension and was stabilized by inotropic support including levosimendan therapy.

In the past, he had identical complaints of dizziness one and half months back after falling off his bicycle. His parents had a nonconsanguineous marriage. There was a positive family history with his father suffering premature cardiovascular death at the age of 35 years.\nOn presentation to the clinic, he was in a hemodynamically stable state. Neurological evaluation was normal without any complaints of weakness, positive Babinski sign, or sensory involvement. He was admitted on the floor for thorough evaluation for his vertigo. Local causes of vertigo were ruled out on initial evaluation by an ear, nose, and throat consultation. Ophthalmology evaluation was done to rule out causes of raised intracranial tension, which showed no evidence of papilloedema on indirect ophthalmoscopy. The patient was reviewed anthropometrically which showed an increased arm length more than height.\nThe patient suddenly became drowsy along with complaints of right-sided weakness and continuous hiccups with high fever spikes, thus he was shifted to pediatric intensive care unit and his neurological assessment showed upper motor neuron facial nerve palsy as evident from right-sided hemiparesis.\nThe magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral cerebellar non-hemorrhagic infarcts.

Six months later, muscle weakness and numbness progressed to the right upper limbs and bilateral lower limbs. The symptoms progressively deteriorated, and he had difficulty walking and grasping at the age of 60. He had urinary urgency and incontinence, but without defecatory dysfunction. Additionally, he had a hypertension history of more than 10 years and a diabetes history of 6 years. He suffered from cerebral infarction at age 60 and 64, respectively. After the second cerebral infarction, he presented with obvious memory impairment, and cognitive assessments showed 27 points in MMSE and 17 points in MoCA.\nNeurological examination at 60 years old revealed muscle atrophy in bilateral hands, a bit more severe in the left hand. Muscle strength indices were grade 3 in the left proximal upper limbs, grade 4 in the left distal upper limbs, grade 4 in the right proximal upper limbs, grade 5- in the right distal upper limbs, and grade 4 + in the bilateral lower limbs. Hypotonia, absent tendon reflex in the four limbs, and negative Babinski sign were observed. Sensation examination showed hypoesthesia of pinprick sensation in the four extremities, more severe in the left. He had mild postural tremor in bilateral hands.\nAs for laboratory examination, the serum CK level was 182 IU/L. NCS showed decreased MCV in both upper and lower limbs, and decreased SCV in the upper limbs (). Brain MRI revealed leukoencephalopathy along the lateral ventricle but without U-fiber high in DWI ().

A metastasectomy for liver metastasis was done before the Hartmann's procedure in a separate operation. Neoadjuvant therapy included radiation therapy with a dose of 5 \u00d7 5 Gy and chemotherapy with 6 cycles of capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab. Since December 2009 JJ-stents were placed for ureteral stricture and functional obstruction with regularly bilateral replacement afterwards. In November 2010, extensive abscess drainage from the Douglas Cavity was needed after occluded ureteral stents with Candida glabrata infection. Furthermore she was diagnosed with Type 2 (noninsulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and angina pectoris.\nIn January 2011, she presented at the emergency room with intermittent macroscopic hematuria. An irrigation catheter was placed and manual irrigation was continued to remove all clots out of the bladder. Laboratory findings at admission included a hemoglobin level of 7,2 mmol/L and a creatinine level of 370 \u03bcmol/L. Ultrasound of the kidney showed bilateral hydronephrosis. One day after admission a cystoscopy and ureteral stent exchange was performed in the operation room because of persistent hematuria and suspected occlusion of the ureteral stents. Removal of the right double-J catheter revealed a pulsatile arterial bleeding from the right ureteral orifice. The ureteral stent was quickly changed and the bleeding subsided. An emergency peroperative hemoglobin was 3,4 mmol/L (norm >7,5 mmol/L). The patient was stabilized and 4 Packed Cells were given at the OR. Open surgery was primarily not considered an option because of the patients extensive abdominal surgical history.

Thus, the patient underwent computed tomography (CT) angiographic imaging, which demonstrated aneurysm sac shrinkage of about 5 \u00d7 5.5 cm, with a longitudinal extension of about 8 cm and showed also signs of mural thrombotic apposition of about 3 cm of maximum assial thickness.\nPhysical examination evidenced a tender and pulsatile abdominal mass, accompanied by the auscultatory finding of a systolic murmur in the paraumbilical region.

The rest of the workup was unremarkable and her abdominal pain resolved with conservative management alone.

Several <6mm partially solid nodules were noted as well. Spirometry, diffusion capacity, and plethysmography were all within normal limits. She did complain of mild dyspnea, but that this was intermittent and had a significant anxiety component.\nShe eventually underwent resection of the left kidney mass with a partial nephrectomy and a final pathologic diagnosis of an oncocytoma, which is a typical tumor type for Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 syndrome.

Upon follow-up, patient was counseled that his clinical history and radiographic imaging demonstrated several concerning findings including cyst size, main duct dilation diameter and recurrent episodes of pancreatitis. The constellation of findings were suggestive of a benign mixed type IPMN, however, the presence of several worrisome features posed increased risk for development of malignancy over time.

His serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) had risen since 2005 to 6.0 ng/L.\nNeurological investigation showed a global paresis grade 4 of the right upper leg with a distal paralysis of the right gastrocnemius and peroneus muscles. His right leg was kept preferably in flexed hip and knee position. Achilles tendon reflex was absent in the right leg with low knee tendon reflex; other reflexes were normal. Sensibility was disturbed in the right distal leg, showing decreased position sense of the right leg and decreased pain sensation at the medial lower leg. Lasegue test gave pain in the right upper leg and calf muscle at 30\u00b0. There were no other neurological abnormalities.

Anteroposterior traction view of both the hips with pelvis was taken, which revealed a bilateral fracture of the neck of the femur ().\nPreoperative physician\u2019s fitness was obtained, and the patient was posted for surgery.

For the operative intervention, both cemented as well as uncemented prosthesis, proximal and distal loading stems, and wire loop system were kept ready. The patient was positioned into a lateral decubitus position with the left side up. The left side was first operated with Moore\u2019s approach. A proximally deficient femur was noticed with a comminuted fracture of a greater tuberosity. THA was performed with uncemented distally loading long stem and uncemented acetabular cup replacement (Solution stem, Depuy J and J). Wire looping of the greater trochanter was added.
