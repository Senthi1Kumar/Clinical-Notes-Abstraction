A 4D CT scan showed a 2.6 \u00d7 1.3 cm ovoid mass at the sternomanubrial junction with contrast enhancement on both arterial and portal venous phases in the area where a sestamibi parathyroid study showed focal activity. A right inferior substernal parathyroid adenoma was excised. The excised parathyroid was markedly enlarged and had adenomatous characteristics including hypercellularity and gross enlargement. Pathology examination of the surgical specimens showed a hypercellular area of parathyroid tissue that was surrounded by a fibrous capsule, distinct and separate from adjacent normocellular parathyroid tissue, characteristic of parathyroid adenomas. The surgery was believed to be successful.\nThe patient returned three months later because of extreme fatigue. The parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was found to be elevated to 304. The diagnosis of persistent hyperparathyroid disease was made and reoperation was recommended because of probable parathyroid gland hyperplasia. A 4D CT scan of the neck showed two parathyroid glands (one right and one left) (Figure ). Three-dimensional reconstruction (Figures , , ) sharply demonstrated the two parathyroid glands in relation to the other major structures. This approximated well the anatomic features of the glands, trachea, great vessels etc., which are a precise representation of the human structures. For example, the left parathyroid gland was more posteroinferior than the right parathyroid gland and the left parathyroid gland lay just lateral to tracheoesophageal groove. The 3D post-processing was performed by 3D imaging laboratory staff on the 4D CT scan for parathyroid gland surgical planning (Vital Images VES version 6.5.5, Minnetonka, Minnesota). Anatomic segmentation was obtained by 3D software automation and hand contouring of specific anatomy to localize the parathyroid glands with respect to surrounding anatomic structures including arterial vessels, venous vessels, trachea, esophagus, and thyroid gland.

Over the next four decades he was treated with a number of antipsychotic agents including sulpride, aripiprazole, haloperidol and olanzapine; all were at up to maximal British National Formulary recommended doses and a minimum of 12 weeks\u2019 duration with compliance assured during inpatient episodes; he experienced a number of relapses over time. He did not achieve remission and was started on clozapine in 2002 (dose 400 mg daily). Following that, he was functional and relatively stable for 11 years, aside from some minor residual psychotic and anxiety symptoms.\nHis medical history at this time included ischaemic heart disease (IHD), cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 35%, congestive heart failure (NYHA II) and bilateral pedal oedema. In 2014, following a decline in his cardiac function, his maintenance clozapine dose was reduced from 350 mg to 300 mg daily. Unfortunately, this was followed by a severe psychotic relapse characterized by prominent thought disorder, paranoid delusions, self-neglect and increasingly aggressive and challenging behaviour. His clozapine dose was increased back to 350 mg but his mental state continued to deteriorate and due to violence and aggression he was transferred to a psychiatric intensive care unit in March 2015.\nIn August 2016 he was admitted to the National Psychosis Unit, having been an inpatient for over 2 years. His symptoms at this time included persistent persecutory delusional beliefs, obsessive-compulsive traits, anxiety, mood lability, prominent difficulties in concentration and memory and irritability with outbursts of aggression. Psychotropic medication on admission included lurasidone 111 mg (which he had been treated with for over 1 year), sertraline 100 mg and diazepam 6 mg daily. On admission, he scored 115 on the PANSS total score and 29/30 on the Mini Mental State",

In January 2019, he started with an intermittent headache, blurred vision, weakness, and anorexia. He was then admitted to a local hospital for further examination. His serum sodium level was 127 mmol/L with normal blood pressure. The biochemical indexes indicated that he suffered from hypopituitarism. The symptoms of diabetes insipidus were not observed. Pituitary MRI showed a suspicious low signal in the right-wing of the pituitary. Further, he had a history of partial thyroidectomy ten years ago due to a thyroid nodule, with unknown postoperative pathological results. Based on the above evidence, an initial diagnosis of autoimmune hypophysitis was made. The patient then started the replacement therapy using 30 mg hydrocortisone per day and Euthyrox at 50 \u00b5g qd, which alleviated headache and improved the right eye acuity.\nFive months later, the patient developed sudden right eyelid ptosis. A new MRI disclosed that the pituitary mass had invaded the right cavernous sinus. Glucocorticoid impact therapy with an initial dose of 500 mg qd was initiated, which improved his right eyelid ptosis on the second day of therapy. Nevertheless, a relapse of ptosis occurred three months later and another MRI revealed a 1.3 \u00d7 0.9 cm sellar mass with extension to the right cavernous sinus and internal carotid artery. Immunology tests, including ANA, ANCA, serum IgG4, and ACL were reported negative. Lumbar puncture and thoracoabdominal CT scan did not show any remarkable findings.

Right hemiparesis was present as a result of two cerebral infarctions that had occurred during the 2 months prior to his first admission. After consultation with a neurologist, we considered that it was necessary to wait several months before performing a major operation due to the risk of inducing another cerebral infarction. However, advanced cancer would be expected to grow during the waiting period. We therefore considered that it was necessary to administer systemic chemotherapy to suppress tumor growth. We initially administered five courses of preoperative chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6). No cerebral events or severe adverse events occurred during the chemotherapy. Stable disease, according to the RESIST criteria, was achieved with the preoperative chemotherapy. A laparoscopic Hartmann\u2019s operation with D3 lymph node dissection was performed at 4 weeks after the last course of chemotherapy. The patient\u2019s postoperative course was good without any complications. The final diagnosis of the rectal cancer was Dukes B with well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma and rectal tumor invasion to the subserosa (T3) without lymphatic or venous invasion (Fig. b). The resected specimen was free from cancer cells. The patient had complained of a perianal abscess for 5 years before his first admission. However, we gave priority to treating the rectal cancer. Although his anal symptoms did not worsen during chemotherapy, at 1 month after the Hartmann\u2019s operation for rectal cancer, his perianal abscess worsened and induration with two secondary open lesions was detected on physical examination (Fig. a). The pathological examination of the biopsied perianal tissue revealed adenocarcinoma. Because the perianal tumor was localized without invasion of the neighboring tissue on magnetic resonance imaging findings (Fig. b), and considering his physical states, we performed local excision under spinal anesthesia for curative resection.",

At first, she was referred to the provincial hospital for evaluation of spotting and mild abdominal pain at 6 weeks of gestation. Her serum \u00df-hCG level was 7000 IU/l, and transvaginal sonography showed an empty uterine cavity. She was diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy and underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy. At laparoscopy, 2 ovaries appeared normal and the infundibulum of left tube had light bleeding. A small amount of free fluid was seen in the pelvis. No trophoblastic tissue was found in the abdominal cavity. The patient was discharged from the provincial hospital on postoperative day 3. At a scheduled visit 1 week later, her serum \u00df-hCG level increased to 12000 IU/l. Soon after, she was transferred to our hospital.\nOn the day of admission, a physical examination revealed some vaginal discharge, but no vaginal bleeding. The abdominal examination was unremarkable. Her serum \u00df-hCG level rose to 16088 IU/l on postopereative day 12. Transvaginal Doppler ultrasound showed a 19 \u00d7 17 mm mass that contained a yolk sac and located in the right of rectum (Fig. ). A heterogeneous hypoechoic mass measuring 26 \u00d7 17 mm was close to this mass (Fig. ). No gestational sac was visualized in the uterine cavity. Abdominal Computed tomography (CT) angiography was then performed to determine the location of her adnexal mass.

No palpable pulses were identified. A code blue was called and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun according to Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support guidelines. The patient subsequently demonstrated ventricular fibrillation which responded to defibrillation shock and epinephrine. The patient had three cycles of chest compressions, one dose of epinephrine, and a shock of 200 J. He was successfully resuscitated and intubated for mechanical ventilation. A CT scan of the chest was obtained immediately after the resuscitation and it demonstrated development of a small anechoic area in the left cardiac ventricle consistent with air embolus (Figure ).\nThe vital signs recorded at the time were as follows: blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, pulse rate of 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and normal oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Bedside transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not reveal evidence of an air embolus.

Radiation therapy was initiated for 10 days. She received three cycles of bortezomib and dexamethasone followed by two cycles of bortezomib, dexamethasone, and lenalidomide. Her disease progressed, and a subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed hypercellular bone marrow with 70% atypical plasma cells. The patient subsequently received seven cycles of carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. She was not a candidate for bone marrow transplantation given the high plasma cell burden.\nOn her current presentation, the pain was sudden in onset, intermittent, worse with eating, and without radiation. The pain was associated with nausea and anorexia, but she was without any change in bowel habits. She denied any previous similar episodes. Upon physical exam, the patient was in distress but remained alert and oriented. Her vital signs were all stable. She exhibited right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding. Her initial labs are presented in Table . The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation of her abnormal labs and supportive treatment.\nThe patient was started on intravenous hydration and was made nil per os. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a distended GB with sludge (Figure ). The GB wall was thickened up to 9.5 mm, and the sonographic Murphy sign was positive.",

During the postoperative period, the child had progressive painful and difficult voiding with only few drops of urine after straining. During this period the child was prescribed painkillers for his discomfort and no additional evaluation was done. After about a week he was referred to a district hospital with fever (temperature=38.1C), agitation, vomiting, urinary retention, and significant abdominal distension. Abdominal examination showed decreased bowel sounds, dull percussion, and severe guarding. Urgent abdominopelvic ultrasound revealed large volume of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis, with small amount of urine in the bladder. The initial lab tests also showed leukocytosis with left shift and increased blood creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. Catheterization with a 6-Fr feeding tube failed because it did not pass beyond the subcoronal urethra. The patient underwent emergency midline laparotomy with the diagnosis of acute abdomen and the fluid was drained. A small intraperitoneal bladder rupture was noticed at the dome of bladder. The gastrointestinal tract was inspected precisely and was intact. The diagnosis of intraperitoneal bladder rupture with urinary ascites was made probably due to near-total urethral obstruction. The rupture site was repaired in two layers and a suprapubic cystostomy catheter was fixed.\nTwo months later, the patient was referred to our center for further evaluation and treatment. Antegrade voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was performed via the suprapubic catheter that showed terminal urethral obstruction ().

The proximal and distal displaced fractures were extra-articular (Robinson Type 1B1) and intra-articular (Robinson Type 3B2), respectively. The proximal end of the clavicle was displaced anteriorly and the distal end posteriorly (), with floating intermediate fracture fragments. This indicated fracture instability and a high risk of non-union. Therefore, we decided to treat with open reduction, and it was performed seven days after injury with the patient\u2019s consent.\nThe patient underwent surgery under general anaesthesia in the beach chair position. A skin incision was made over the distal fracture site. The distal end of the clavicle was displaced posteriorly. The floating bone fragment was found rotated opposite to the direction of the displacement. As the distal end of the clavicle was reduced, the proximal end was simultaneously reduced to a good anatomical position. A 3-hole locking plate [LCP\u2122 Superior Clavicle Plate, DePuy Synthes Trauma, West Chester, USA] was used to provide fixation between the distal end of the clavicle, as the intermediate floating fracture fragment was secured by more than two screws to prevent rotational displacement.

Associated, he had multiple episodes of vomiting for one day. On physical exam, he was found to have diffuse abdominal tenderness and distention.\nThe patient had undergone exploratory laparoscopy for tumor resection, and right radical nephrectomy for stage IV retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma one year before the presentation. The resected mass was 20 cm in size. The surgical and pathologic margins of the resected specimen were negative at that time. The microscopic findings revealed a spindle mass with fibrous stroma consistent with a Grade 3 dedifferentiated liposarcoma (Figure ). After six months of resection, lymph node recurrence was noted on surveillance imaging. A lymph node biopsy at that time showed spindle cell sarcoma with similar morphology to the original tumor (Figure ).\nOn admission, a CT scan of the abdomen revealed enlargement of the previously noted masses. The tumor was reported to be 17 cm in size (identified by yellow arrows), extending into the duodenal lumen, causing a duodenal obstruction (Figure ). The CT scan also revealed acute pancreatitis with significant stranding and free fluid surrounding the pancreas (Figure ). Serum lipase was 3817 U/L at the time of presentation.\nSubsequent esophagogastroduodenoscopy demonstrated a large polypoid mass in the second portion of the duodenum, completely obstructing the duodenal lumen (Figure ). A 22 mm x 12 cm metallic duodenal stent was placed under fluoroscopic guidance (Figures , ). After the duodenal stent placement, his symptoms were significantly improved.

Her dental history included injury to the tooth in question due to a fall from standing height during childhood, and the tooth began to be dislodged over the years. In a specialized dental care clinic, she received endodontic treatment that did not achieve the expected success.\nClinical examination showed grade II mobility of tooth 11. Radiographic examination revealed the presence of external root resorption that resulted in extensive resorption of the buccal wall in the area (Figures and ).\nAfter evaluating the case, extraction of tooth 11 was proposed to the patient, followed by immediate placement of a dental implant associated with guided bone regeneration, because her gingival biotype was classified as thick [], and the remaining bone tissue allowed immediate implant placement []. The management option of choice was a fully digital treatment, from surgical planning to fabrication of the final crown, for the current analysis of digital workflow in dentistry.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the complete maxilla was obtained in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format, and intraoral scanning was performed using the Trios 3\u00ae pod scanner (3shape) to obtain stereolithography (STL) files.\nOnce these 2 files had been obtained, the coDiagnostiX\u00ae software (Dental Wings) was used for virtual planning.

The first and second dose of paclitaxel (200 mg m2) combined with cisplatin was infused within 1 h with standard premedications. An 18F-FDG PET/CT scan performed 3 weeks after the second cycle of chemotherapy revealed multiple hypermetabolic skin lesions at several parts of the body including scalp, neck, chest, abdomen, and back, right inguinal region with maximum standardized uptake value of 4.31 [, arrows] mimicking probable skin metastases in addition to hypermetabolic mass in the right lower lobe and hypermetabolic mediastinal lymph nodes. On physical examination, severe painful and pruritic rashes on his scalp, neck, chest, abdomen, and back were inspected. It was retrospectively learned that he developed a widespread paclitaxel-induced drug eruption during the therapy within 2 days after the administration of the second cycle. Radiologic and clinical examination by a dermatologist indicated first the drug HSR as the underlying cause of these hypermetabolic skin lesions. Biologic tests revealed no autoimmunity. He reported not to have any skin lesions after the prior cycle of chemotherapy, and there were not any skin lesions at the first 18F-FDG PET/CT performed for staging, as well. Based on the clinical course and physical examination, skin biopsy did not need to be performed. Successful symptomatic management with oral (dexamethasone 4 mg/day) and topical treatment produced prominent regression of the lesions. The patient was re-exposed to taxanes through desensitization protocol, and these allowed him to complete the six courses of therapy that includes paclitaxel. Subsequently, 18F-FDG PET/CT performed after 3 weeks after completion of six cycles of chemotherapy showed resolution of the skin lesions in addition to the regression in primary malignancy [, arrows], which correlated with clinical resolution of the skin lesions without any scarring.",

    "original_text": "A 57-year-old man with cough and minimal whitish expectoration was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma after a biopsy was conducted on the upper lobe mass of his left lung on March 4, 2016. Mutational analysis revealed that he lacked EGFR mutations or ALK gene rearrangements. CT scans showed that this patient had developed multiple metastases, including mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, and also to the right intrapulmonary lymph nodes. He received 6 cycles of Pem-Cis chemotherapy, followed by thoracic radiation. Review of the CT scan at completion of sequential chemoradiotherapy treatment resulted in a significant shrinkage in the primary tumor in his left lung, while simultaneously resulting in a slight increase in metastatic lymph nodes (Fig. ). In February 6, 2017, CT scans showed that the tumor progressed rapidly. He was then scheduled to receive gemcitabine plus nedaplatin (Gem-Ndp) chemotherapy. However, the patient had to discontinue the planned 2nd cycle of this regimen as he developed moderate pneumonia. After systemic antibiotic treatment, the patient improved symptomatically and became increasingly energetic. However, CT scans on March 29 revealed that his tumors had progressed further. Owing to his poor physical condition after Gem-Ndp treatment, the chemotherapy regimen was changed to Pem-Cis. However, CT scans on May 11 failed to detect any shrinkage in his tumor. In addition, lymph node metastases increased post-treatment. The patient subsequently started standard of care pembrolizumab treatment at 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. During hospitalization, the general condition of the patient was good, with signs of fatigue only present at the first 2 days after each pembrolizumab infusion. The treatment failed to result in an anti-tumor response. The patient then received 2 cycles of initially used chemotherapy regimen Pem-Cis. Interestingly, we detected a significant shrinkage in the enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph node metastases, with the primary site in the left lung exhibiting no further progression.",

Other manifestations during childhood included epilepsy with frequent grand-mal seizures, deafness and significantly delayed psychomotor development. Aside from features associated with DOOR syndrome and obesity, the patient also had left sided cerebral palsy, recurrent chest infections, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux and hypertension. It was difficult to elucidate any history of obstructive sleep apnoea due to his learning difficulties. There was no cardiac defect or urogenital abnormities. His medication included carbamazepine, omeprazole, salbutamol and budesonide. He had no allergies. At anaesthetic preassessment the only findings noted were a thyromental distance of 7.5 cm and good neck mobility. The neck circumference was measured as 40 cm. Further airway assessment, such as the Mallampati score, was impossible. Basic observations were performed, including a blood pressure reading of 150/90 mmHg and a heart rate of 72 bpm. Oxygen saturation on room air was 95%. He was extremely uncooperative, rendering an awake dental examination unfeasible. A plan was therefore made to use short sedation for dental assessment including X-rays and then to administer general anaesthesia for definitive treatment. The patient was premedicated with 4 mg of buccal midazolam and sedated with titrated intravenous midazolam to a total dose of 5 mg and fentanyl 100 mcg.

On admission, physical examination showed no abnormal abdominal findings except mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Routine blood tests such as CBC, renal and liver panel proved unremarkable. Chest x-ray showed no signs of cardio-respiratory disease. Plain radiograph of the abdomen showed a calcified opacity at the level L2-L3 vertebrae on the right. The diagnosis, supported by ultrasound and computed tomography, was a calcified hydatid cyst of the liver with involvement and deformation of the gallbladder; the architecture and the size of biliary ducts were normal. The patient underwent right subcostal laparotomy. Intra-operatively, a calcified primary hydatid cyst of the fundus and body of the gallbladder was found with its pericyst attached to the liver (Figure ). The inflammatory response of the liver tissue against the cyst was extensive and formed the structural part of the posterior wall of the pericyst. Complete pericystectomy along with cholecystectomy was performed. No other cysts were found during careful exploration of the peritoneal cavity. On opening the gallbladder, a calcified hydatid cyst (dimensions 7 cm \u00d7 5 cm) was found, located in the body and fundus of the gallbladder (Figure ). Macroscopically, the hydatid cyst was part of the gallbladder. The cyst had reduced severely the lumen of the gallbladder and had grown entirely submucosally (Figure ).

She was a lifelong nonsmoker and notable preoperative medications included aspirin, furosemide, and propanolol. Preoperative imaging had no evidence of prior infarcts. After induction of anesthesia, a right internal jugular central venous catheter and radial arterial catheter were placed and maintenance of anesthesia was performed with a combination of 0.5 MAC sevoflurane, propofol 50 mcg/kg/min, and remifentanil 0.125 mcg/kg/min infusions. Mannitol 1 gram per kilogram for a total of 80 grams was administered.

    "original_text": "The patient is a 28-year-old male with prior history of a grade 3 astrocytoma, who presented to our emergency department (ED) after having a general tonic-clonic seizure (GTC). Initially, his disease was appreciated four years prior when he presented with a GTC and was found to have a grade 3 astrocytoma of the left occipital lobe (Figure ). He underwent maximal safe resection followed by adjuvant EBRT to 45 Gy in 25 fractions at an outside institution. Due to reasons outside the patient\u2019s control, he received only two cycles of adjuvant temozolomide following EBRT. He developed disease recurrence, presenting as a GTC six months prior to this ED presentation, where imaging demonstrated tumor progression with increased extension into the parietal lobe (Figure ). He subsequently underwent a second maximal safe resection later that month. Final pathology returned as GB. Follow-up imaging four months afterward demonstrated disease progression and he was started on bevacizumab as well as a tumor treatment field (TTF) device. He unfortunately only tolerated TTFs for one month, ending one month prior to the ED presentation.\nUpon admission to our hospital from the ED, MRI demonstrated progression of disease in the left occipital-parietal lobes with extension into the splenium and anterior-inferior extension into the left thalamus and basal ganglia (Figure ). His physical exam was notable for mild right-hand weakness, but he was otherwise neurologically intact.

While in the emergency department, he was hypotensive with an initial blood pressure of 96/53 mmHg and tachycardic. Patient's chronic Foley catheter appeared blocked and upon removal of the catheter purulent drainage was noted. Initial laboratory testing was significant for leukocytosis of 43,400 cells/mL, lactic acidosis with initial lactic acid of 2.3 mMol/L and an acute kidney injury with a creatinine of 2.92 mg/dL and an elevated INR of 2.3, which was secondary to apixaban therapy. The patient's blood pressure did not improve after 30 mL/kg of fluid resuscitation and patient was started on a vasopressor infusion. CT abdomen pelvis without contrast performed in the emergency department revealed gastric pneumatosis with adjacent left upper quadrant portal venous gas along with branching portal venous gas throughout the liver (). The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics with cefepime, vancomycin and meropenem and urine cultures, as well as blood cultures, were sent. The patient was transferred to the step-down unit for closer observation.\nThe general surgery and gastroenterology teams were consulted for further evaluation while the patient was in the step-down unit. Given the patient's therapeutic INR and lack of any small bowel findings on the initial CT scan, embolism causing mesenteric ischemia was thought to be unlikely. However given the acute renal failure, CT angiography was not performed. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed revealing proximal stomach ischemia from the midbody to the fundus with some necrosis with normal appearing distal stomach and duodenum ().

The alimentary continuity was reconstructed with a pedicled jejunal limb through the antethoracic route. When we separated the diaphragm from the esophagus and removed xiphoid surgically to prevent a pedicled jejunal limb injury, the pericardium was opened.

About 6 months after the esophagectomy, the patient was readmitted to our hospital because of abdominal discomfort and vomiting. His vital signs were stable and unremarkable. He was thin, with a body mass index of 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed that the pedicled jejunum through the antethoracic space was markedly dilated and the abdomen was soft and flat (Fig. ).

There was no history of trauma, cardiovascular disease, and bleeding disorders as well as no experience with drugs. The lower back pain worsened, and bilateral leg pain developed within 3 days. The subject received a medical examination and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the lumbar spine at a local hospital. MRI images revealed a large subdural hematoma, extending from L1 to S1 in the sagittal view and presenting as hyperintensities on T1 weighted sequences and hypointensities to isointensities on T2 weighted sequences (Fig. ). A conservative treatment plan was decided upon at a local hospital because there were no severe neurological deficits. However, the symptoms worsened progressively with lower extremity muscle weakness, gait disturbance, and numbness in the saddle area 15 days after onset. Therefore, the subject was transferred to our center for further examination and management.\nA neurological examination demonstrated paresthesia and pain below the L4 dermatome and motor weakness at grade 4 on the right lower limb and grade 3 on the left lower limb.

He had been operated on due to a tumour on the distal third of the left arm as a result of a closed trauma without fracture 20 years before. Several debridement surgeries were also performed on his lesion, but no detailed information is available. Physical examination revealed new lumps with seropurulent discharge 7 years after the first surgery. Subsequent blood analysis did not show alteration in acute phase reactants, and hematimetric indexes were within normal ranges. For the next 20 years, he continued to experience similar episodes of sporadic reactivation of the lumps.\nBefore 4 years, he was admitted to our hospital due to painless lumps fixed on the subcutaneous tissue of the left arm (). Radiographs of the left humerus revealed an alteration of the bone structure with distal diaphyseal involvement and thickening and cortical irregularity, which extended up to the metaphysis ().

He had a day case surgery for nasal polyp removal one week previously. He did not have any medical problems in the past and was not on any medications. He was a non-smoker. On examination all observations were normal and systematic examination was normal. All blood tests were normal. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray were normal. The Troponin-T test later came back raised at 0.14 micrograms per litre. A diagnosis of NSTEMI (non-ST elevated myocardial infarction) was made and he was started on appropriate treatment. The next day he had an in-patient coronary angiogram, which was normal (). The cardiologist concluded that a diagnosis of myocardial infarction was unlikely in his case, all treatment was stopped and the patient was allowed to go home with no further follow-up.\nFour weeks later the patient again presented, this time with a history of left-sided chest pain. He described a sharp stabbing pain initially in the left rib cage and then in both sides later. Pain was made worse on inspiration, not related to posture or exertion and was only partially relieved with analgesics. He felt short of breath on walking which was unusual for a man of his fitness. On examination his observations were all normal. Systemic examination was normal. ECG and chest X-ray were normal.

Reviewing the patient's chart, we found no evidence of acute episodes of heart failure associated with regional wall motion abnormalities, suggesting no previous episodes of TS. The patient developed progressive severe systemic right ventricular failure, a known complication after the Mustard palliation surgery. After successful cardiac transplant, the patient was followed up regularly by clinical evaluation, laboratory testing, and echocardiography every 3 months, while coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound was performed every 12\u201318 months, according to current guidelines, in order to establish progression of coronary disease (i.e. Stanford score). During follow-up, one hospitalization was reported in 2014 for bacterial pneumonia, while no acute heart failure events and/or cardiac rejection occurred. The last follow-up visit before the reported event was performed in November 2016. Clinical and echocardiographic examination showed optimal clinical conditions, New York Heart Association class I, normal biventricular function with absence of wall motion abnormalities, and no pericardial effusion. Angiography demonstrated mild-to-moderate coronary artery disease (Stanford II) with absence of significant coronary artery stenosis.\nIn mid-January 2017, the patient was admitted to the hospital owing to acute worsening of her clinical conditions characterized by reduced tolerance to activity and fatigue. The day before the onset of symptoms, she reported having an angry debate. Physical examination evidenced fair general clinical conditions, borderline tachycardia with a heart rate of 100 b.p.m., an oxygen saturation of 98%, and a cuff blood pressure of 130/87 mmHg. The electrocardiogram showed right bundle branch block (already present in her previous tracings) with new evidence of negative T waves in all precordial leads (Figure\n).
