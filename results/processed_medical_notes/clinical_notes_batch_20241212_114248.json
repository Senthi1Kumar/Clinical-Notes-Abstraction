He had experienced the sudden onset of dyspnea and had gone to another hospital. There, transthoracic echocardiography revealed the right atrial tumor. After his transfer to our hospital, transthoracic echocardiography was performed again. The right atrial tumor, which adhered to the interatrial septum, had a tail-like surface projection. The tumor projection was mobile and prolapsed into the right ventricle during diastole (Fig. ). In addition, the right cardiac cavities were dilated and the estimated right ventricle pressure was 63 mmHg, which suggested the presence of moderate pulmonary hypertension. Subsequently, computed tomography (CT) showed that the left pulmonary artery was occluded by a large embolus (Fig. ). Because the embolus formed acute angles with the vessel wall, acute pulmonary embolism was highly suspected. We performed an emergency surgery for the removal of both the right atrial tumor and the embolus in the left pulmonary artery.\nIn the supine position, a median sternotomy was made. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established by ascending aortic and bicaval cannulation without inducing hypothermic circulatory arrest. When the right atrium was opened, we observed a gelatinous and irregular shaped tumor with a multipapillary surface (Fig. ). Because the tumor was fragile and its attachment could not be confirmed as it was, the majority of the tumor was crushed and the remaining part, which adhered to the fossa ovalis, was resected with the interatrial septum. The defect of the interatrial septum was closed by an autologous pericardial patch. Finally, the main pulmonary artery was opened and the embolus, which was wedged into the left pulmonary artery, was removed (Fig. ).

    "original_text": "A 24-year-old female patient with a VP shunt who was admitted to our rehabilitation hospital was referred for distal catheter externalization. The patient was diagnosed with traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hemorrhage at another hospital. She underwent bilateral craniectomy, cranioplasty, and VPS. The patient was bed ridden (E4M4Vt on the Glasgow Coma Scale) and was admitted to our rehabilitation hospital for PEG (Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy) tube change. The patient had high fever, vomiting, and abdominal tenderness after the PEG tube change. Peritonitis was diagnosed, caused by extensive contamination of the peritoneum due to leakage through the PEG tube. Surgery for peritonitis was carried out and for this purpose, shunt externalization was performed at the clavicle level.\nPeritonitis was resolved after approximately eight weeks of antibiotic use, but the general surgeon expressed concerns about placing the distal catheter in the peritoneum due to adhesion of peritoneum and inflammation. After discussion, we decided to place the distal catheter into the pleural cavity. The patient underwent a ventriculopleural shunt operation in consultation with the thoracic surgeon and had no specific problems for 3 months. Eventually, pleural effusion was observed caused by the development of pneumonia. Pneumonia and pleural effusion were treated with antibiotics and PCD (Percutaneous Catheter Drainage), but effusion and pneumonia reoccurred after PCD removal.

Her past medical history was significant for sigmoid adenocarcinoma status after low anterior resection and four cycles of FOLFOX chemotherapy (leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) administered via a port-a-cath. Her course was complicated by development of a port-a-cath associated thrombus comprised of two parts spanning a total length of 8 cm, with extension from the left brachiocephalic vein along the SVC into the RA and RA appendage (). Secondary to the thrombus, the patient developed two episodes of SVC syndrome with facial and neck swelling as well as shortness of breath. The first episode at time of diagnosis was managed with discontinuation of her oral contraceptive pill and intravenous heparin with transition to subcutaneous enoxaparin (1.5 mg/kg once daily), a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), in the outpatient setting. Initially, the port-a-cath was scheduled to be removed, but given concerns from interventional radiology in regard to reinsertion of a CVC in the presence of an extensive SVC thrombus and decrease of thrombus burden with therapeutic anticoagulation, the port-a-cath was left in place. During the second episode, which occurred about three months after initial SVC thrombus diagnosis, the patient was admitted for evaluation of possible catheter-based extraction therapies. On further review of her imaging studies and consideration of the clot appearance and time from initial discovery, the interventional cardiology service felt that, due to clot chronicity, an extraction therapy would not be feasible. The recommendation was made to continue anticoagulation and proceed with surgery after inferior vena cava filter placement. Her surgery was scheduled six months after initial discovery of the port-a-cath associated clot. The patient's anticoagulation management was based on recent guidelines published in 2012",

The mass was oval-shaped and exhibited an enhanced pattern after contrast medium injection. In addition, no enlarged lymph nodes or distant metastasis in other organs around the stomach were observed (Figure ).In an endoscopic examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract, we observed that the greater curvature of the upper body was covered with relatively normal mucosa. Additionally, a subepithelial lesion approximately 2.5cm in length was observed bulging into the lumen (Figure ). Using endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), we observed a round mass of approximately 18mm\u00d712mm in size that originated from the submucosal layer. Within this mass, focal lesions with anechoic foci that appeared to comprise the cystic portion were observed, along with an inhomogeneous pattern (Figures A and B).

The patient's bilateral hand clumsiness and gait had gradually deteriorated in the month prior to her presentation at our hospital. She had also experienced severe nuchal pain for the past 3 months. A neurological exam revealed that deep tendon reflexes in both upper extremities were markedly increased. The patellar tendon reflexes were also markedly increased bilaterally.

She also reported severe nuchal pain. Based on the neurological findings, we concluded she had myelopathy below the upper cervical level.

She felt right coxalgia with no inducer in 2007, and was diagnosed with ION of the right femoral head at our department, but the pain was transient and remitted. Periodic follow-up was continued thereafter, but pain in her right hip joint over the gluteal region started upon sitting for a prolonged time in November 2011. Because the pain gradually aggravated and she became unable to walk, she revisited our department in August of 2012.\nAt her revisit to our department, she felt right coxalgia accompanied by dysbasia, and antalgic claudication was noted. Mild tenderness was noted in the Scarpa triangle, and internal rotation was slightly limited in the range of motion of her right hip joint. The anterior impingement sign was positive but the Patrick sign was negative. Based on the modified Harris hip score (HHS), the score of pain on her right side was 10, and the total score was 20. Plain radiography of her bilateral hip joints demonstrated no collapse of the femoral head. The cross-over sign was positive, and the center-edge (CE) and sharp angles were 29\u00b0 and 54\u00b0, respectively, showing mild acetabular dysplasia and pincer femoroacetabular impingement (FAI; Figure \n). Computed tomography of her hip joint showed that the \u03b1 angle was 50\u00b0, and an osseous change suggesting a cam lesion was not noted in the femoral neck. No irregular joint surface was noted (Figure \n). T1-weighted imaging of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the band sign, which is the characteristic MRI finding of ION of the femoral head. The MRI findings also demonstrated that the patient had type B of the femoral head according to the Nishii et al. classification and stage",

On cervicothoracic contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT), a mass with a maximum diameter of 24 mm was noted in the lateral wall of the right oropharynx, but no infiltration into the parapharyngeal space or epiglottis was seen. Swelling was also observed in the right upper and middle deep neck lymph nodes and the right node of Rouviere. In blood biochemistry, a squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen was elevated to 2.8 ng/mL. Biopsy of the right oropharynx lateral wall revealed p40-and p16-positive squamous cell carcinoma. The diagnosis was T2N2bM0 stage IVA oropharyngeal carcinoma of the right lateral wall. The treatment plan was to manage the disease through induction chemotherapy with TPF. As induction chemotherapy, CDDP and DOC were both administered at 60 mg/m2 on day 1 and 5-FU at 600 mg/m2 from day 1 to day 5. Daily urine volume was \u22653,000 mL. Although bodyweight decreased day by day from day 4, compared to before the start of chemotherapy, no deterioration in patient condition had been seen; so, we kept the patient under observation with particular attention to vital signs. On day 8, neutrophil count had dropped to 2250/\u03bcL and blood pressure fell to 70/50 mmHg. However, as no fever was evident, febrile neutropenia was ruled out.

Serum creatinine was 3.2 mg/dl (normal range 0.6\u20131.2 mg/dl), proteinuria was 2.5 g/d.

Regulation of membrane-bound vs. secreted forms of the immunoglobulin heavy chains depends on the competition of 2 mutual cleavage polyadenylation sites (pAs/pAm) (). In mice targeted deletion of the mu heavy chain cleavage polyadenylation site pAs leads to deficiency of secreted IgM with intact expression of surface IgM and normal secretion of other immunoglobulin isotypes (). Therefore, we sequenced mu heavy chain gene including the polyadenylation sites in both patients with sIgMD and found no alterations (data not shown). Both patients' B cells were able to express precursor, secreted and membrane IgM mRNA (Figure ). Furthermore protein expression of monomeric and native pentameric IgM (Figure ) and surface expression of IgM on the B cell membrane (data not shown) was comparable to healthy controls.\nTo elucidate the genetic basis of the patients' selective IgM deficiency we used a targeted resequencing approach to sequence potential candidate genes.

When captured, the animal weighed 110 kg and seemed to have a fracture of the left humerus. This bear was transferred to the same veterinary team and a non-reducible comminuted fracture of the left humerus was confirmed radiographically (Fig. a). Blood examinations revealed increased white blood cells, AST, and C-reactive protein. On the 17th of May (12 days after the accident), preoperative radiographs of both the injured and the contralateral humerus were obtained. From these radiographs, a plate of the appropriate length was selected in an attempt to span the entire length of the humerus. Immobilization and monitoring of vital signs were followed by the same procedures used for bear-01. Bear-02 was placed in a supine position and we approached laterally for the surgery. A longitudinal skin incision was made from the center of the deltoid insertion to the lateral epicondyle, and the lateral head of the triceps was exposed by the insertion of the brachial fascia. The humerus was exposed by elevation of the brachialis and triceps from the lateral intramuscular septum. We tried to remove a bone fragment that was lodged in the deep medial head of the triceps and repair the alignment of the humerus; however, it was impossible because of the exuberant granulations and muscular contraction.

He presented with severe visual loss to counting fingers with dense nuclear sclerosis and posterior subcapsular cataract bilaterally. The patient accepted the risks of postoperative infection as previously detailed by the infectious diseases team.

The patient did not receive intracameral antibiotics or oral antibiotics because of recent antibiotic nephrotoxicity. The eye patch was placed for 1 hour and removed to allow topical therapy. He was put on topical moxifloxacin and a combination of netilmicin sulfate 0.3% with dexamethasone phosphate 0.1% drops. The drops were administered hourly on the day of surgery with taper thereafter, as in the first case. Vision in the right eye recovered to 6/6.

At the end of September 2016, the patient performed farm work in contact with sheep when he had an ocular traumatism caused by a fly. Three hours after the ocular traumatism, the patient complained of a painful right eye discomfort, with sensation of moving foreign. Upon arrival at the department of ophthalmic emergency of the University Hospital Center of Dijon within hours of the onset of the first symptoms, the clinical examination showed a red and irritated conjunctiva in the right eye with the observation of mobile and translucent larvae in the conjunctival fornix. The rest of the ophthalmologic examination was normal. Eight larvae were extracted using Bonn hook forceps under local anesthesia. All larvae were sent to the Parasitology-Mycology Laboratory of the University Hospital Center of Dijon for identification.\nThe parasitological diagnosis allowed the identification of stage 1 Oestrus ovis larvae (L1). Indeed, the macroscopic examination revealed larvae of white color and about 1 mm length.

She was severely obese (body mass index 37 kg/m2) and had type 2 diabetes but was using insulin with good metabolic control. Her best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in both eyes was 1.0. Her IOP was 35 mmHg without the use of medication, though she achieved values of 18 mmHg in her right eye and 16 mmHg in her left eye with the use of tafluprost once daily. No changes were identified in an examination of her anterior segment. The papillary cup was 0.3 in her right eye with a temporal notch and her left eye had a normal appearance.\nOur patient\u2019s compliance to medical therapy continued to be poor, because she blamed her drops for coughing and dyspnea attacks. Without the use of drops, her IOP values remained consistently in the 30s. After continuous non-compliance with several other ocular medications, surgery was discussed as an alternative treatment option. The risks and potential complications of surgery were explained to our patient. No signs of cornea or ocular media opacity, retinal hemorrhage, macular or peripheral detachments, or other contraindications were observed in either eye. Our patient decided to opt for surgery. Her right eye was operated on first with an uneventful mitomycin C trabeculectomy (0.3 mg/ml, 3 minutes).\nOn the first postoperative day, our patient presented with a diffuse, functioning, and non-leaking filtration bleb, associated with a well-formed anterior chamber, and an IOP of 8 mmHg, with a normal appearance on fundoscopy.

    "original_text": "A 56-year-old woman received a diagnosis of cancer of the right breast 6 years prior. At that time, she underwent right mastectomy with placement of a tissue expander. This was followed by exchange to 650 cc silicone implant for right breast reconstruction and concurrent left breast reduction using inverted-T incision with inferior pole technique to achieve symmetry. Unfortunately, she developed ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion in her left breast 4 years later. After left-sided vertical mastectomy, her first tissue expander failed secondary to infection and was removed. After debridement and resolution of the symptoms, a second tissue expander was placed and later exchanged with a 650 cc implant. Within 2 weeks, there was again evidence of infection and the implant was removed. Now, 6 years after being diagnosed with breast cancer, she had a successful right breast reconstruction and a failed left breast reconstruction (a).\nAt this point, we had essentially exhausted implant-based reconstruction techniques and offered alternative autologous tissue options for further repair. She elected to pursue several rounds of fat grafting instead of a pedicled flap or free tissue transfer. Next, the left breast was fit with a Brava dome external tissue expander device (Brava, LLC, Miami, Fla). This was worn only in the preoperative period for 6 weeks, 8 hours per day, in an effort to best prepare the recipient site to receive and support large volume of fat grafts. Over a 2-year period, she received 5 rounds of AFT using the TLL system. Fat was harvested from various sites including abdomen, flanks, posterior hips, thighs, saddlebags, bra line, and lateral chest wall.

He had high blood pressure, and he started continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) because of hypertensive nephrosclerosis 8 years previously. A PD catheter was primarily inserted at the right abdomen, but it was removed and inserted at the left abdomen because of exit site and tunnel infection 5 years previously. He had no past medical history of diabetes mellitus and major abdominal surgery. In the peritoneal equilibration test, his result was high. Bloody ascites was not evident. One year previously, he had been hospitalized for PD-associated peritonitis caused by touch contamination that was treated with intraperitoneal cephazoline and cephtazidime. Bowel adhesion was not noted 5 years previously; however, local bowel adhesions and agglomeration of the intestine were detected by computed tomography (CT) after the identification of PD-associated peritonitis (Fig. , ). The major findings of EPS, such as peritoneal thickening and calcification, were not noted on CT.\nOn physical examination, his blood pressure was 134/74 mmHg, pulse rate was 76 beats/min, and temperature was 99.7 \u00b0 F. He complained of severe pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, and this area was tender on palpation. The exit site was clear. Laboratory tests revealed mild inflammation, with a white blood cell count of 10,100 /\u03bcL and C-reactive protein level of 0.9 mg/dL. The peritoneal fluid cell count was increased at 980 /mL. Based on these findings, PD-associated peritonitis was diagnosed. CT showed localized dilation of the intestine, which suggested adhesive small bowel obstruction (Fig. ). As we suspected that the peritonitis might be associated with bacterial translocation from the dilated intestine, he was advised to stop eating and was switched from CAPD to hemodialysis. Additionally, he was treated with intravenous vancomycin and cephtazidime. The PD catheter was flushed once a day",

Generalized tonic\u2013clonic type seizures at 6 months were his first clinical symptom, a detailed history revealed delays in developmental milestones after that. Electroencephalogram (EEG) findings showed abnormal awake and sleep recordings due to slow background activity, suggestive of diffuse cerebral dysfunction with symptomatic or cryptogenic seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging showed cerebral hypoplasia especially in the frontal and temporal lobes at approximately 4 years of age.
