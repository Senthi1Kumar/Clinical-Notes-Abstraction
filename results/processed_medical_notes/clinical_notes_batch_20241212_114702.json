On systemic examination, he had normal vesicular breath sounds bilaterally, heart beat was normal with no added sound, abdomen was soft to palpation and neurological examination was normal. On local examination, his both eyes were pseudophakic, and vision of the RE was hand movement and that of the left eye (LE) was 6/6. His RE had a subtotal rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD) with PVR-B (The updated Retina Society Classification) [] for which vitrectomy was planned. Routine laboratory investigations like CBC, serology, liver and renal functions were performed and were within normal limits.\nWith a diagnosis of subtotal RD, the eye was being operated using 23 gauge vitrectomy systems. After completing near total vitrectomy, perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) injection was started using a double bore cannula. During injection of PFCL liquid to flatten the retina, there was sudden change in visibility of the fundus due to increase in haze of the media.

She denied other systemic or gastrointestinal symptoms. Her medical history was notable for in vitro fertilization resulting in twin pregnancy 7 years prior. She was otherwise healthy with a body mass index of 27 and not taking any medications. Physical examination was remarkable for a non-tender, but firm and distended abdomen with palpable findings suspicious for a large mass. Lower extremity edema was not identified in either leg suggesting that the mass was not compressing the iliac veins and likely superior to the pelvis. All laboratory testing, including serum hCG, was within normal limits.\nComputed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a large heterogeneous, hypodense mass measuring 27 cm x 20 cm x 13 cm with irregular, central solid-enhancing components (Fig. a, b). Based on cross-sectional imaging, the mass appeared distinct from the uterus, without associated ascites or lymphadenopathy. An ultrasound-guided core biopsy demonstrated an admixture of mature adipocytes and spindle cells. Immunohistochemical staining showed diffusely positive for smooth muscle actin, desmin, and estrogen receptor, but was negative for HMB-45 (Fig. c\u2013g). Taken together with the imaging findings, the histopathological characteristics confirmed a diagnosis of lipoleiomyoma.\nGiven the symptomatic nature of the mass, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy to resect the tumor. Upon entering the peritoneum, the mass was immediately identified and encompassed most of the abdominal cavity. The tumor appeared to originate below the inferior border of the stomach with attachments to the mesentery and omentum and displaced the transverse colon into the pelvis.

A repeat chest radiograph showed worsening of the left lower lobe infiltrate and an enlarging effusion. A CT scan of the chest showed a large effusion on the left with some loculation inferomedially (fig. ). His laboratory analysis revealed a decrease in hemoglobin from 14.0 to 10.4 g/dl within the past 10 days as well as a leukocyte count of 10.6 \u00d7 109/l. Laboratory work-up also demonstrated normal platelets and a normal metabolic profile. With a high suspicion for hemorrhagic effusion, he underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery which revealed a large 12.5 \u00d7 8.0 cm gelatinous mediastinal mass with bleeding into the pleural cavity (fig. ). The mass was noted to be compressing the posterior aspect of the left atrium. The origin of the mass was unclear. The patient had a negative work-up for tumor markers including alpha-fetoprotein, CA-125, CA 15-3, CA 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen.

The patient stated that he was unable to self-administer basal insulin for two days after he ran out of insulin pen needles. His vital signs on presentation revealed blood pressure of 84/53 mmHg, heart rate of 103 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and temperature of 98.2 \u00b0F (36.7 \u00b0C). Physical examination at time of presentation showed that he was ill-looking, with dry oral mucosa and poor skin turgor. Initial diagnostic tests showed high anion gap, metabolic acidosis, ketonemia, and hyperglycemia, prompting the start of diabetic ketoacidosis management and subsequent intensive care unit (ICU) transfer (Table ). At this time, the patient only had a gauge-22 peripheral line placed at the dorsum of his left hand after multiple unsuccessful attempts at placing a larger peripheral line gauge.\nIn the ICU, efforts at internal jugular vein central line placement were unsuccessful as well due to the patient\u2019s low volume status, making the target vein extremely difficult to cannulate even by increasing Trendelenburg tilt and doing venipuncture at end inspiration. Right subclavian vein catheterization using the infraclavicular approach was instead performed. However, the postprocedure chest X-ray showed that the catheter was somehow in the aorta (Fig. ). Blood gas obtained from the subclavian central line revealed arterial placement, prompting removal of the catheter with no serious consequences to the patient (Table ; Fig. ).

His past medical history was unremarkable. Clinical examination revealed a bimanually palpable right flank mass.\nAn abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scan showed a 25 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 8 cm heterogeneous mass occupying the right kidney and extending into the renal vein lumen while compressing the IVC (). The rest of the abdominal cavity was unremarkable. A CT scan of the thorax showed nodular lesions that may correspond to a secondary location of his tumor.\nThe other laboratory findings were normal.\nThus, a right radical nephrectomy with the resection of the thrombus of the right renal vein was performed.\nIn the laboratory, the gross examination revealed a huge encapsulated mass weighing 2300 g and measuring 27 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 9 cm. The cut surface was gray-white showing a whorled appearance with foci of hemorrhagic and necrotic changes. The tumor was attached to the renal vein wall. A portion of the tumor occupied the renal vein lumen, but most of this huge tumor extended beyond the hilum area compressing the normal renal parenchyma ().\nMicroscopic examination showed an encapsulated tumor composed of interlacing fascicles of spindle-shaped cells with elongated blunt-ended nuclei, coarse chromatin, and moderately abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, intermingled with pleomorphic cells presenting marked nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, and prominent nucleoli.

She had not noticed her urinary symptoms specifically, until she was asked at the examination, but she stated that those symptoms had started several months before her first visit. She denied any history of trauma, infectious diseases, or surgeries related to her spine.

She also had a mesh repair surgery for ventral hernia 5 years ago. All abdominal procedures were performed under general anesthesia with epidural anesthesia in her thoracolumbar spine. Radiographs of her lumbar spine showed some degenerative changes including decreased disc height and mild scoliotic changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her lumbar spine demonstrated an intradural extramedullary spinal cord tumor at the T12\u2013L1 level (2.1 cm \u00d7 1.2 cm), and her spinal cord was markedly shifted anteriorly by the enlarged tumor (Fig. ).

No other clinical symptoms were mentioned. Clinical examination revealed a firm painless mass. Examination with rigid endoscopes was unremarkable. The patient underwent neck ultrasonography, which displayed a multinodular thyroid of 0.1-0.3 cm nodules and a well-defined mass of 4.5 x 2.5 x 2 cm situated in the lower pole of the right thyroid lobe. CT showed a vascular mass in the right supraclavicular region and in close proximity to the lower pole of the right lobe of the thyroid. Furthermore, three-dimensional CT angiography demonstrated a vascularized mass mainly supplied by the subclavian artery, the common carotid, and the innominate (Figures , ).\nThe results of two attempts of FNA on the mass were inconclusive while the third attempt suggested the presence of an ectopic thyroid tumor. FNA on the thyroid was also conducted, which revealed atypical follicular colloid cells of the Bethesda 3 category. Vanyllylmandelic acid was not examined.

A physical examination demonstrated a small melon sized mass on the anterior side of the distal thigh. The mass was not tender but rubbery hard and mobile.\nThe plain radiographs revealed a huge soft tissue mass with irregular calcification in the distal thigh. On MRI, the tumor was 17 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 9 cm in size located under the quadriceps muscle. The tumor matrix was partially calcified and relatively well defined with irregular low signal intensity in the T1 weighted image and heterogeneous low and high signal in the T2 weighted image. There was no abnormal signal of the underlying bony cortex and bone marrow ().\nGrossly, the excised tumor was a well circumscribed, lobulated round and firm mass. The cut surface was yellowish-white and fibrous to myxoid without any areas of hemorrhage or necrosis.\nThe optical microscopy examination demonstrated a mass with sharp demarcation, a nodular growth pattern and intervening hypocellular collagenous stroma (). The tumor showed a biphasic pattern with fibrous and myxoid areas. The cells were small, bland, regular, fibroblastic spindle cells with minimal nuclear pleomorphism, low to moderate cellularity, and swirling, whorled growth (). The background matrix ranged from fibromyxoid to densely fibrous ().\nImmunohistochemically, the tumor cells were diffusely and strongly positive for vimentin, but were negative for cytokeratin, smooth muscle actin, S-100 protein and neuron specific enolase.

Her blood sugar fluctuated from hypoglycaemia to hyperglycaemia and she was repeatedly admitted to medical wards for diabetic ketoacidosis.\nBetween 2009 and 2012 she presented with persistent positive psychotic symptoms: responding to auditory hallucinations, prominent thought disorder and inability to manage basic aspects of her personal care. This led to a psychiatric admission in June 2015 and clozapine was commenced in July 2015. There was no significant improvement in her mental state on clozapine, and over the next 6 months various augmentation strategies were attempted without success.

The patient reported that the nodular lesion was present for 8 years without pain and notable changes in size. Anamnesis disclosed presence of osteoporosis, hypercholesterolemia, arterial hypertension, and peripheral venous insufficiency.\nAt oral examination an enlargement of the mandible in buccal left premolar region extending from the canine to the first molar () was evident. The overlaying mucosa was of normal colour and texture. This nodule of 2 \u00d7 2 cm was firm and painless and had a nontender bony-hard consistency with no fluctuation on manual palpation. Both premolars were vital, and the second one had a partial crown fracture. Both were covered by the lesion. Root remnants of first and second molars were present. The patient had other radicular fragments, dental caries, and periapical periodontitis. No associated cervical lymphadenopathy was detected.\nPanoramic radiography showed a radiolucent lesion with a multilocular appearance between the mandibular left canine and second premolar (). The upper margin of the lesion was well-defined, contrary to the ill-defined lower margin. Root resorption was absent. CT scan revealed a multilocular lesion containing small calcified masses (). This lesion, sized 2.2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 2.1 cm, involved and displaced 34 and 35 teeth, with expansion and thinning of the buccal and lingual cortical plates partially eroded. The inferior margin of the lesion showed a proximity relation with mandibular canal and mental foramen.\nDifferential diagnosis included odontogenic myxoma, central giant cell granuloma, osseous dysplasia, desmoplastic fibroma, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumour, keratocystic odontogenic tumour, ameloblastic fibroma, and ameloblastoma.\nExtraction of 37, 36, 35, and 34 was performed and a bioptic specimen of the lesion was obtained under local anaesthesia (2% lidocaine with 1 : 100,000 epinephrine). Histopathological evaluation showed a lesion",

There was no history of pain, dysphagia, or hoarseness of voice. There was no history of cold or hot intolerance, tremor, palpitation, diarrhea, constipation, any menstrual irregularities, or any radiation exposure. On examination, a single, well-defined, painless, soft to firm swelling was seen in the midline of neck, measuring about 2 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm. The swelling moved with both swallowings as well as the movement of tongue. The overlying skin was normal, and there was no palpable cervical lymphnodes. The routine laboratory investigations including complete blood count, liver function test, and kidney function test was within normal range. The thyroid function test was within normal limit. The ultrasonography (USG) of neck revealed a midline complex cystic mass (2 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm) above the thyroid isthmus with multiple internal septations and a central large nodule with heterogeneous echogenicity and coarse calcification []. Both lobes of thyroid were normal in size and echo pattern with smooth margins. The isthmus was also normal, and there was no evidence of necrosis or hemorrhage. Thus, a diagnosis of infected TGDC was made. Following this diagnosis, Sistrunk operation was done which consist of resection of the cyst along with a central portion of the hyoid bone and dissection of the thyroglossal tract up to the base of the tongue. The resected specimen sent for histopathological examination. On gross examination, a globular soft tissue mass measuring 2 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm was received along with 1.5 cm elongated fibrous tissue attached to globular mass and a piece of bone. On cut section, a unilocular cyst (1 cm \u00d7 0.8 cm) filled with brownish material was seen. Microscopic examination showed a cyst lined by cuboidal",
