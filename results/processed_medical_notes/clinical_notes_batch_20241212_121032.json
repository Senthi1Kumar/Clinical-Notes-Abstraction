    "original_text": "A 48-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room because of a self-inflicted single gunshot wound to the mouth. The patient was awake and alert without dyspnea or broken teeth.\nThere was no evidence of neurological deficits or major vessel injury. A review of the patient's past medical history showed that he suffered from depressive disorder for 6 years and had received treatment for this condition. During the physical examination, the patient was alert and fully oriented. Aerodigestive involvement was not detected, and no neurologic abnormalities were found in the cranial nerves or cerebellar system. The bullet had passed along the right side of the mouth and exit wound was on the dorsal portion of the hard palate. A second entry wound was on the oropharynx at the C1 level. A single bullet lodged in the anterior arch of C1 was found on the simple lateral radiograph and computed tomographic (CT) scans (). Fortunately, the dural sac, trachea, esophagus, and vertebral artery were undamaged.\nEmergent surgery using a transoral approach was performed to remove the bullet. The patient was placed on the operating table with the head in extension while under general anesthesia and with orotracheal intubation. A self-retaining oral retractor was placed over the teeth and expanded to keep the mouth open. To obtain an operational view, the soft palate was divided with an incision along the midline extending from the junction with the hard palate to the base of the uvula.

Physical examination at that time revealed an abnormal left leg gait and a right lateral strabismus. Laboratory studies revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (AST 87, ALT 129, total bilirubin 0.9, and alkaline phosphatase 88). Imaging revealed multiple small liver masses and lesions in the lumbar spine. A liver biopsy was performed and was initially interpreted as nonspecific subacute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation. No granulomata, organisms, or evidence of malignancy were seen, and the patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics. Due to high suspicion of tumor in the lumbar region, an exploration of the L3-L4 region was also performed. Operatively, the nerve roots were found to be inflamed in the area, and a proteinaceous cyst was also seen. The patient was subsequently discharged after extensive workup and cultures proved negative.\nThe patient was readmitted three months after initial discharge due to worsening of low back pain, pain on ambulation, and bilateral lower extremity weakness and numbness, as well as an increase in size of the hepatic and spinal lesions on imaging. Physical exam now showed decreased pinprick, dysesthesias, and weakness with dorsiflexion in the lower extremities bilaterally. Right third cranial nerve palsy was also noted.

    "original_text": "A 65-year-old woman with untreated diabetes visited our emergency department for a one-day history of lower abdominal pain. Abdominal findings showed diffuse peritonitis. Computed tomography showed edema of the small intestine and bladder wall. Perforation of the appendix, alimental tract, or urinary tract was suspected; thus, emergency surgery was performed. Although there were purulent ascites, remarkable redness, and edema of both the small intestine and bladder wall throughout the lower abdominal cavity, there was no perforation of the gastrointestinal or urinary tract (). Intraoperative Gram staining of purulent ascites in the abdominal cavity showed the presence of Gram-positive cocci. Based on these findings, idiopathic peritonitis was initially suspected; thus, only irrigation and drainage were performed to complete the surgery. Although a part of the patient's left lower leg appeared slightly red in the operating room, we mistakenly assumed that the presence of mild phlegmonous changes was not associated with the abdominal cavity findings. Postoperative monitoring of vital signs indicated that the patient was going into shock with respiratory failure and acidemia progression due to anuria despite administration of an inotropic agent and high-volume infusion of colloidal fluid. The maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was 10 points; thus, mechanical ventilation and carbapenem administration were initiated. Continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) was also necessary for renal support along with cytokine regulation due to prolonged anuria and acidemia. Infection and necrosis of the leg were gradually becoming more evident and severe (Figures and ). Therefore, a diagnosis of NF was made.\nGroup A streptococcus (GAS) was detected in the ascites, blood culture, and purulent effusion from the left leg. Based on the above findings, the patient was diagnosed with STSS. The antibiotic regimen was changed to high-dose penicillin G and clindamycin to target the bacterial infection.

She developed the deformity as a small swelling at the tip of the nose of about 0.5 cm which increased progressively to the size of about 1 cm in 1 year. There was no history of trauma, fever, sudden increase in size or pain associated with the swelling. There was no association of similar swelling in any family member. Child was immunised and had achieved milestones appropriate for her age. Parents of the child wanted removal of the swelling as it was a cause of social embarrassment for the child and she had difficulty in breathing from right nostril. The child had an identical twin who was operated for intususseption at 6 months of age.\nOn examination, there was evidence of a diffuse 1.2x1x1.5 cm swelling at the tip of nose in maximum horizontal, vertical and anteroposterior dimensions. The skin over the swelling was found to be normal and free from the swelling. It was soft in consistency. Swelling extended to the nasal columella. Right ala was found to be slightly flared. It was non tender. The septum appeared normal. There was midline cleft of the upper lip (Fig. ). X ray chest showed levocardia. 2D echo was normal. Contrast enhanced Computed Tomography of para nasal sinuses and head showed a non enhancing fat density lesion of approximate size of 0.8x1.2x2.3 cm in the tip of nose and inferior nasal septum causing compromise of right nasal cavity (Fig. ).

The eyes continued to protrude until 3 months of age; the condition remains static ever since. He also developed tonic-clonic seizures after 3 months of age which still continued but decreased in frequency, and the last episode was 2 days before the presentation. He also reported having increased head circumference at birth that has not progressed since then. At the time of presentation, the child has abnormally protruded eyes with coloboma of middle 1/3 of right upper lid, and medial 1/2 of left upper lid; an abnormal skin fold present below the malformed left lid. A skin tag was present at the outer canthus of right eye [ and ]. The conjunctiva on the right side appears slightly cystic, both the conjunctiva and cornea were keratinized because of exposure. No other ocular abnormality in the form of orbital cyst or microphthalmia was present. He had frontal bossing with depressed nasal bridge [] and also slight protrusion of tongue.

During the course of follow-up for the respiratory condition an abdominal ultrasound was ordered to investigate a new onset minor abdominal discomfort. An abdominal cyst was found which, otherwise, was not clinically palpable during abdominal examination. Subsequent computed tomography (CT) scanning of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast revealed a retroperitoneal thick-walled fluid filled mass, measuring approximately 11.5 \u00d7 13 cm in close relation to the main pancreatic duct with inflammation of the adjacent pancreatic tissue. Provisional reports indicated a pseudo-pancreatic cyst with further extension into the posterior mediastinum through one of the diaphragmatic hiatus (\n).

Shortly after bonding the mandibular appliance in 2017, the patient became aware of an apical displacement of the gingival margin at the lingual surface of central incisor (Figure ). At the time of referral, the patient was diagnosed with a lingual recession measuring 4 mm vertically and 1.5 mm horizontally at the level of the CEJ. The phenotype was regarded as thin. The axial direction of the central incisor was characterized as neutral, without labial or lingual root torque. A definite labial frenal pull and a narrow zone of keratinized attached gingiva coronal to the fibrous attachment were diagnosed (Figure ). The lingual defect was classified according to Smith's classification (the only system that classifies both lingual and palatal recessions). Radiographs of mandibular central incisors showed short roots without loss of interdental bone, but with widened periodontal membrane apically.

His end-stage renal disease was attributed to chronic glomerulonephritis. After an induction treatment by thymoglobulin and methylprednisolone pulses, the immunosuppression regimen consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. There was no immediate complication after transplantation and the nadir of serum creatinin was 2.24 mg/dL. Rapidly, after two months, tacrolimus was withdrawn due to nephrotoxicity (histologically proven) and replaced with everolimus which was also stopped due to development of lymphocele and proteinuria. In February 2014, belatacept was started at a dose of 5 mg/kg intravenously every month in association with mycophenolate mofetil in order to decrease corticosteroids to the level of 10 mg/d.\nFrom the start of mycophenolate mofetil treatment, the patient had anorexia and diarrhea, with liquid stools without blood. He underwent in March 2014 an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and a colonoscopy which showed no mucosal abnormalities. Duodenal biopsies demonstrated normal mucosal histology. In October 2015, because of worsening of the diarrhea, a stool culture was performed which was positive for Campylobacter jejuni. Antibiotics course was prescribed with some efficacy but the diarrhea persisted.\nIn February 2016, the patient was hospitalized for bloody stools with anemia and abdominal pain for which blood transfusion was necessary. A colonoscopy was rapidly performed showing large round shaped deep ulcers with normal surrounding mucosa. These ulcers were located in the caecum, transverse colon, left colon and sigmoid colon and were compatible with the diagnosis of CD (Figure ). The terminal ileum and rectum were normal. Histologic examination of the colonic biopsies showed acute colitis with ulcerations, crypt abscesses, lymphocytes and neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration. Neither crypt dystrophy nor granuloma was found (Figure ). A small bowel wireless capsule endoscopy was also performed without mucosal abnormalities.\nDue to suspicion of mycophenolate mofetil involvement in the acute colitis, this treatment was withdrawn in March",

The aortic valve area measured 0.52 cm2. Mean pressure gradient was 49 mmHg. A peak aortic jet velocity was 4.4 m/s.

There was no history of previous dental treatment. Her family and medical history were noncontributory. The patient provided a history that there was no spacing between the maxillary central incisors two years back. A gradual increase in spacing was noticed between the maxillary central incisors over the last nine months. On intraoral examination, other than a poor oral hygiene status, a 9 mm deep periodontal pocket was noticed between the maxillary central incisors. Both the teeth were showing Miller's Grade I mobility. There was high labial frenum attachment and a 2 mm diastema was present between the two central incisors []. Functional occlusal evaluation was done, which revealed an increased overbite that could be traumatic to the opposing maxillary teeth.

However, his symptoms persisted.\nHe had also visited our hospital six months ago when he was diagnosed as Brucellosis (based on Brucella abortus antibody titre > 1:320) with splenic abscess. He was then treated with doxycycline and rifampicin for three weeks. It should be noted that aminoglycoside was not preferred due to deranged renal function test. Eventually, fever subsided and patient remained asymptomatic for three months. Unexpectedly, the patient re-developed high fever and visited our center again. This time he complained of accompanying pain in the right elbow that was consecutive for five days. A thorough examination revealed that he was anemic but his respiratory and gastrointestinal findings were normal. The lateral aspect of right elbow was tender; however, no swelling or redness was noticeable. In addition, blood examination revealed normocytic normochromic anemia, raised inflammatory markers like ESR and C-reactive protein, deranged renal function test, raised random blood sugar (32 mmol/L) and raised Brucella Ab titre (both IgG and IgM). His chest radiography showed infiltration in left upper and middle zone of lung whereas the ultrasonography of abdomen showed splenomegaly. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone and flucloxacillin and his blood sugar level was maintained to normal by intravenous insulin.

    "original_text": "A 72-year-old woman with abdominal complaints for several months was found to have a large right upper quadrant cystic mass (16 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 18 cm), consistent with a multivesicular liver hydatid cyst that replaced the right lobe of the liver, with compensatory hypertrophy of the left lateral segment (LLS) (). After discussing the high risk of postoperative complications, the patient agreed to undergo surgery. We performed a total open cyst pericystectomy; after detaching the right lobe ligaments, we opened the cyst, extracted the fluid, and instilled hypertonic saline. The right lobe elements were ligated, and the entire cyst with a margin of pericystic inflammation was resected. The LLS was sutured to the diaphragm.\nPostoperatively, the patient developed progressive jaundice. She was afebrile and had otherwise normal liver function. Ultrasound and CT were notable for intrahepatic biliary dilation. ERCP showed an obstruction at the level of the biliary confluence and a contrast leak (). The patient was taken back to surgery for exploration where we found a fibrotic and ischemic main bile duct, likely due to torsion along its longitudinal axis. We dissected the bile duct until the liver parenchyma, but there was not viable tissue.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 47-year-old male presenting to our hospital with the chief complaint of sudden epigastric pain with vital signs indicating shock. One month earlier, he was hospitalized in our department and underwent omental patch repair for gastric ulcer perforation. Emergent contrast-enhanced CT revealed a retroperitoneal hematoma in the pancreatic head (Figure A), aneurysm formation in the PDA (Figure B), and extraluminal compression to the celiac trunk (Figure C,D). Extravasation was also detected around the aneurysm in the PDA (Figure A), but no liquid was retained in the peritoneal cavity. Emergent IVR for hemostasis was performed for retroperitoneal hemorrhage from the ruptured PDA aneurysm. Arteriography of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was performed through a sheath introduced in the right femoral artery. Imaging of the SMA revealed the development of several collaterals in the pancreatic head (Figure A), and the common and proper hepatic arteries were imaged via these collaterals. The aneurysm in the PDA accompanied by leakage of the contrast-enhanced agent had a diameter of 9.3 mm. IVR hemostasis was completed by PDA coil embolization. Subsequent SMA arteriography showed several collaterals other than embolized PDA perfusing the proper hepatic artery (Figure B). After IVR therapy, blood chemical analysis was monitored for several weeks, revealing that transaminase level was not elevated and hepatic infarction was considered negative.

She was admitted to the emergency department with dyspnoea and orthopnoea for the previous month. She denied having fever, oedema or other signs and symptoms, particularly of the gastrointestinal tract. On examination the patient was oriented, afebrile and had normal vital signs. She had a distended jugular vein and audible crackles in the right lung base. A swollen lymph node approximately 1 cm in diameter was found in the internal portion of the left supraclavicular fossa, adherent to deeper tissues and painless on palpation. A second similar swollen lymph node also approximately 1 cm in diameter was found in the middle third of the right cervical ganglion chain. The rest of the examination was unremarkable, and the patient was admitted to the ward for further investigation.\nInitial laboratory findings showed no changes in red or white blood cells, renal function was normal, and NT-proBNP was 254 pg/ml. An x-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusion, larger on the right side. A diagnostic pleural tap showed an exudate without neoplastic cells, and microbiological investigation, including mycobacteria, was negative.\nA CT of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis showed large bilateral adenopathies in the supraclavicular fossa, large mediastinal adenopathies () and a large pericardial effusion as well as a bilateral pleural effusion () without any other masses or suspicious nodes, and without involvement of the lung, liver or other solid organs.\nHistology of a biopsy specimen of the cervical adenopathy showed an adenocarcinoma of the colon with immunochemistry positive for CK20 and negative for CK7 and TTF-1.

Physical examination showed swelling of the left ankle joint, extensive tenderness, normal skin temperature, and limited range of motion for ankle plantar flexion and dorsi flexion. Venous blood test showed no abnormalities in ESR, CRP, and blood routine. Radiograph and MRI suggested hyperplasia of synovial tissue in the articular cavity and epiphyseal injury of the distal tibia. Ankle arthrocentesis was conducted, and a small amount of turbid liquid was drained. No diagnosis of ankle TB was suggested. Preoperative diagnoses were (1) traumatic ankle synovitis and (2) epiphyseal injury of the left distal tibia. We initially planned to perform articular cavity debridement; however, when we conducted the surgery, we saw obvious hyperplasia of synovial tissue and the cartilage was obviously damaged; TB was highly suspected. Considering that the patient was still a child, ankle arthrodesis was not suitable in this case. Therefore, we only performed articular cavity debridement after obtaining the tissue sample for biopsy. Pathological examination confirmed ankle TB, and the result was also positive for TB-PCR.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 65-year-old male who presented with a swelling of the posterior surface of the proximal third of his left leg. His prior history included a prolonged stay in hospital for treatment of bacterial endocarditis, when two mitral valve replacement operations were performed. He had also previously undergone two abdominal operations to treat an intestinal tumor and one varicose veins surgery.\nPhysical examination revealed a pulsating mass in the posterior region of the proximal third of the left leg. Femoral, popliteal, and dorsal pedal pulses were palpable and normal in both lower limbs. The posterior tibial artery pulse was absent, whereas the posterior tibial artery pulse was palpable in the right lower limb.\nMagnetic resonance angiography showed a saccular dilatation in the tibioperoneal trunk with a 4.4 cm diameter, at the level of the origin of the posterior tibial artery. The posterior tibial artery was also occluded ( ). Investigation was supplemented with laboratory tests (inflammatory activity tests, coagulation tests, and complete blood cell count), which all returned normal results, in addition to blood cultures, which were negative.\nHaving ruled out other probable etiologies and active infections, in view of the history of bacterial endocarditis, it was decided to perform a less invasive treatment, considering the inflammatory/infectious pathophysiology and the size and site of the pseudoaneurysm. A covered, self-expanding stent (Gore VIABAHN 6.0 \u00d7 50 mm) was therefore placed in the tibioperoneal trunk, preserving fibular artery patency and excluding the aneurysm.

Physical examination revealed a rigid, distended, clearly tender abdomen on palpation, and rebound tenderness was positive at all quadrants. Laboratory investigation revealed white blood cell count 19000/mm3, hemoglobin 16 mg/dl, glucose 102 mg/dl, urea 65 mg/dl, and creatinine 1.55 mg/dl. An upright abdominal X-ray demonstrated free air under the diaphragms bilaterally and intraabdominal hyperintense free fluid was clearly seen in abdominal ultrasonography.\nAt the age of 22, he was diagnosed with BD because of his oral and genital ulcers as well as left ankle arthritis, and a medical treatment regimen with oral ointments and colchicine was started. After 3 weeks, he was symptom free and stopped taking his drugs. Within the first 10 years of initial diagnosis of BD, he had a drug-free period except for the irregular occasions that he mentioned taking colchicine. Interestingly, in this period, he had episodes of oral and genital ulcers, which disappeared spontaneously without any treatment. He had never been followed up by any healthcare facility on a regular basis. He was positive for HLA B5 and pathergy test was negative. With two major and two minor criteria, he was diagnosed with incomplete BD according to the diagnostic criteria of the International Study Group for BD.[] Both his brother and sister were diagnosed with BD as well.\nAfter the initial evaluation in the emergency room, he was diagnosed for acute abdomen and we immediately took him to the operating room. Laparotomy revealed massive intraabdominal purulent fluid, multiple perforations, and extensive inflammation in all the segments of the colon.

She reported having a history of chronic left leg sciatic pain that contributed to a fall two days prior to the onset of these symptoms. Her past medical history was significant for colon cancer requiring a low anterior resection, which is eight years ago. The patient was noted to be confused and tachycardic. She was afebrile but had leukocytosis of 14,000. On physical examination, she was noted to have a significant crepitus to the left thigh and knee. Radiographs of the left leg confirmed subcutaneous emphysema consistent with necrotizing fasciitis (). Prior to surgical consultation, the patient also received a pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan to evaluate for hip fractures. This further confirmed the necrotizing fasciitis (Figures and ) but also identified a collection in the presacral space () that communicated to the left leg through the left sciatic notch, which is consistent with an AL. The patient was immediately taken to the operating room for debridement of the thigh and diverting colostomy.\nAn exploratory laparotomy with diverting colostomy was created to control ongoing contamination of the leg. Intra-abdominally, there were no abnormal findings, which is consistent with the extraperitoneal nature of the disease process. The decision, at this point, was to access the extraperitoneal collection through interventional radiology so as to minimize intra-abdominal contamination. After the colostomy was completed, the left thigh and hip were incised revealing a significant amount of feculent and purulent drainage.

Then, she was brought immediately to PGC Cikini Hospital and diagnosed as Moderate Head Injury. She was resuscitated using fluid therapy, and they put her into sleep using a sedative. After initial resuscitation, her family asked to refer her to RSCM. When she arrived at the ED, we immediately put her a cervical neck collar and do a few examinations such as head and neck X-ray, FAST, and Head CT-scan. No bleeding or vomiting was observed.\nThe patient was presented with a mainly stable haemodynamic with altered mental status. Local examination of the neck shows no deformity, swelling, bruise, and all normal skin color (). On palpation, all pulsation on the radial artery was regular, yet despite unable check on tenderness, we felt a step off the sign. We avoid moving the head until we obtained the cervical radiograph. We immobilized the patient's neck to protect it by using a hard rigid cervical collar. The sensory and motor function on this patient cannot be assessed because of the previously used sedatives.\nWhen the patient regained her consciousness, she felt numbness and tingling at her four extremities. She also felt weakness using both arms and legs, and she felt that her right half of the body is weaker than the other half. Her urination and defecation control were all normal.

She had never smoked. She had a dog in her childhood and she also lived in the rural area. Her physical examination was normal. No abnormal signs were observed on her chest radiograph. Pulmonary function tests and laboratory test results were within normal limits except for eosinophilia and minimally elevated D-dimer in the blood test. D-dimer level of the patient was 600 ng/mL, while normal limits are 0-500. A negative D-dimer result may exclude pulmonary embolism, but there are many reasons that cause D-dimer elevation such as infection, trauma, deep venous thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In this case, the reason of elevated D-dimer was parasitic infection. The patient was treated with 250-mg fluticasone dry powder twice daily in an inhaler and montelukast once daily under a suspicious diagnosis of allergic asthma; she asked for a control examination 2 weeks later. At the control examination, she still complained of coughing. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) was performed to investigate the etiology of cough and her minimally elevated D-dimer level. Filling defects were observed inside the left main pulmonary artery, upper segmental branch of the lingular artery, and segmental and subsegmental branches of the lower lobe artery on her thoracic CT angiogram (-). This finding at the main and superior branch of the lingular artery showed continuity with an 18 \u00d7 16 mm nodular opacity considered likely to be a cystic embolism. The right pulmonary artery and its branches were clear. Subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulant therapy was administered on the basis of the suspicious diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism.

He works as a mechanic, is married, and was a former smoker. His family history is significant for prostate cancer and high blood pressure. He was recently diagnosed with CML during an admission for weight loss, easy bruising, and fatigue. A bone marrow biopsy showed hyperplastic granulocytes with a maturation pattern consistent with CML. Further genetic analysis showed cells with a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, the genetic hallmark of CML. The cells were also positive for the genetic product of the translocation, a defective or deregulated tyrosine kinase, also known as the BCR-ABL protein, which is essential to the pathogenesis of the disorder. During that admission, he developed hematuria and bloody stools. A computed tomography scan of his abdomen and pelvis showed mild left hydronephrosis without obvious mass or stone, and his hematuria resolved. His gastrointestinal bleeding work-up included an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. Several polypectomies resulted in prolonged bleeding, which ultimately resolved.\nBefore definitive treatment for his CML could be started, he again developed hematuria with mild left flank pain. Upper tract imaging was negative for an overt renal mass, and a cystoscopy found gross blood from the left ureteral orifice (). Ureteroscopy was performed, but no obvious cause of bleeding was found. Cytology showed left renal pelvis urine abundant in acute and chronic inflammatory cells with no evidence of malignancy.\nBecause of persistent bleeding without a treatable source, the patient was sent to interventional radiology for an angiography examination. A pseudoaneurysm was noted in the left renal artery at a small branch in the lower pole, and it was subsequently embolized (). The patient's bleeding stopped and his hematocrit remained stable until 2 days later when he became hypotensive because of sudden blood volume loss. He required vasopressors",

On a subsequent visit he reported right wrist pain which began while lifting a heavy box. On examination, redness and swelling was noted on the dorsal aspect of his right wrist. Range of motion was full with pain at end range of flexion and extension. His health history included two hip replacements, two previous episodes of gout in both first metatarsophalangeal joints (2 and 5 years prior), and hypertension. Medications for hypertension included perindopril (4 mg), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg), and Norvasc (10 mg). In addition, he was prescribed 80 mg of aspirin/day and took a daily multivitamin. One week prior, the patient's general practitioner had increased his Norvasc dosage and also prescribed Tylenol 3 to be taken as needed for his back pain.\nTwo days later the swelling had increased in the dorsal aspect of his right wrist and hand. Wrist flexion was limited by 80% with severe pain. Pain was present on palpation of the scaphoid bone. Due to the suspicion of fracture, the patient was referred to his general practitioner for radiographs. The radiologist who read the films described tiny cysts at the distal radius and concluded that these were most likely due to old trauma. Mild osteoarthritic changes were noted at the carpal-metacarpal joint at the base of the thumb. The report stated that the radiographs were otherwise normal.\nThe patient's symptoms worsened with increased pain and swelling over the next few days.
