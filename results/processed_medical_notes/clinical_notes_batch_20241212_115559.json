He has a medical history of ventricular septal defect associated with pulmonary stenosis diagnosed at 15 years old, with surgical treatment refused by his parents and with interrupted follow-up since then. Currently, a physical examination was notable for a grade 3/6 systolic murmur over the second left intercostal space without signs of heart failure or cyanosis. His electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with incomplete right bundle branch block. His chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and dilatation of his left pulmonary artery. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal left ventricular systolic function without wall motion abnormalities. The right ventricle was hypertrophied, dilated but with normal contractility. Severe pulmonary valvular stenosis was also visualized. An exploration of the ventricular septum showed a closed ventricular septal defect without evidence of shunt, related to a spontaneous closure of the defect. Cardiac catheterization confirmed a tight valvular pulmonary stenosis with systolic right ventricular and pulmonary arterial pressures at 103 and 14mmHg respectively, resulting in a 95mmHg systolic gradient between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery. Selective pulmonary angiography showed a severe valvular pulmonary stenosis and a left pulmonary artery stenosis with a poststenotic aneurysm. Left ventricle angiography showed a 12mm ventricular septal defect completely closed and an aneurismal left coronary artery. Selective coronary angiography revealed a dilated left coronary artery and 3mm coronary fistula arising from the mid segment of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) to the right ventricle (RV) with occlusion of the distal LAD (Figure ). Percutaneous treatment of both lesions was decided starting with the CAF to prevent acute myocardial ischemia that may appear after acute coronary steal consequent to the decrease of the RV pressure after relief of the pulmonary obstruction. A successful transcatheter closure of the fistula using a 4/6 Amplatzer\u2122 duct occluder II (ADO II) was achieved, with partial reopening of the fistula",

Abdominal computed tomography showed thickening intestine wall at the recto-sigmoid junction, which leaded to an obvious dilatation of proximal intestine. And the density of intestinal mesentery increased as well as omentum (Fig. ). Through colonoscopy, we found an annular ulcer with irregular bottom and dirty surface near the recto-sigmoid junction, with pathological diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Without other obvious anomalies in the preoperative examinations, we performed an exploratory laparotomy on January 25. Massive serous ascites, a recto-sigmoid obstructive lump, and extensive nodules of implantation metastasis in abdomen, especially on the surfaces of intestinal tract and liver, were found during the operation. Considering the advanced stage of the tumor, we decided to perform a palliative Hartmann operation to relieve obstruction and adjuvant chemotherapy was chosen for following treatment. After operation, upper GI obstruction was well-relieved. But on February 10, 16 days after operation, the patient complained of discontinuous abdominal distention and pain again. Digital radiography of upper digestive tract showed a complete obstruction at the horizontal segment of duodenum, while the cavity was so narrow that the contrast agent could not pass through. We presumed that the obstruction was induced by the wide abdominal metastasis of the tumor. Conventional treatments for obstruction were performed, such as fasting, GI decompression, proton pump inhibitor, and parenteral nutrition. However, the intestinal obstruction was not relieved in the following days. Based on his situation, we assessed that the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of the patient had already reached to 3 which was not suitable for high intensity of chemotherapy. So, targeted therapy was chosen as the further treatment instead of routine chemotherapy. By genetic testing, the wild type of KRAS gene had been found, for which cetuximab was very suitable. On February 27, an initial loading dose of cetuximab was given at 400 mg/",

    "original_text": "A 38-year-old man sustained injuries in both lower extremities in a motor vehicle accident. Bilateral closed femoral shaft fractures were present, along with bilateral tibio-fibular fractures and severe soft tissue injury. The right leg was amputated at the above-knee level on an emergent basis, due to extensive comminution and loss of circulation caused by the crush injury. The bilateral femoral shaft fractures were fixed with plates. Reduction and external fixation of the left tibia was performed along with titanium plating. Initially, the size of the soft tissue defect was 20 \u00d7 15 cm, and the fractured tibial segments were exposed. The patient was treated in the emergency intensive care unit for 2 weeks due to multiple rib fractures and hemothorax. A bacterial culture from the tibial defect site revealed the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Wound care was performed with betadine, saline solution irrigation, and betadine-soaked dressings. The patient was shifted to the general ward 2 weeks after the trauma, at which time debridement and ostectomy of the necrotic tibia were performed. The tibial defect measured 17 cm. A vascularized bone graft was required to reconstruct the tibia; however, the contralateral fibula was lost due to the trauma and the ipsilateral fibula had multiple segmental fractures.

The grandmother of the patient had died of leukemia at the age of 50 years and the father had also developed leukemia at the age of 35 years and later died of it. A 17-year-old cousin of the patient also died of leukemia. On clinical examination, the patient had a unilateral, right bluish cyst, measuring 4 cm \u00d7 3 cm \u00d7 1 cm, covering the right eye completely []. Slit lamp examination of the left eye showed a normal anterior and posterior segment, an intraocular pressure of 14 mm of Hg, and normal angles on gonioscopy. The thumbs were absent in both the hands. Blood tests of the patient showed no evidence of any metabolic disorder or coagulopathy and were within normal limits.

The problem evolved rapidly with appearance of abnormal posture of the left hand during repetitive movement performed at work, sometimes associated with pain. This condition severely limited her business. Previous examinations, including brain and cervical magnetic resonance scanning, had excluded a peripheral or central nervous disease as the cause of her symptoms. The patient's medical history excluded the presence of any psychiatric disorder. She has no story of psychogenic disturbances and she had never taken any antidepressants or neuroleptics. EMG of her forearm muscles showed the presence of dystonic activation patterns, indicating a diagnosis of focal dystonia. Pharmacological treatment with clonazepam and gabapentin was prescribed; however, as this failed to ameliorate the symptoms and caused side effects (such as drowsiness and gastrointestinal disorders), the patient suspended pharmacological treatment and came to our attention.\nWhen she came to our attention, the clinical examination showed an abnormal posture of the left hand with hyperextension of the IV and V finger and flexion of the interphalangeal joints of II and III finger. This particular posture was more evident during the execution of movements similar to those performed during her job. We performed surface EMG that confirmed the diagnosis of focal dystonia: her muscles showed typical signs of hyperactivity (). We administered 100 U incobotulinumtoxinA diluted in 1 mL saline solution into the following muscles of her left hand: extensor digitorum communis (35 U), flexor carpi radialis (35 U), and flexor digitorum superficialis (30 U). Electrical muscle stimulation was used to guide the injections.\nOne month later a marked reduction in muscle hyperactivity was observed.

The patient's family history was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed conjunctival pallor. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 7-cm left renal mass, and renal biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), although no apparent adrenal metastasis was detected during the CT. Nevertheless, the patient underwent unilateral nephrectomy with ipsilateral adrenalectomy based on the current guidelines for RCC. The guidelines recommend ipsilateral adrenalectomy with radical nephrectomy for tumors that are >6 cm, based on their high risk of adrenal metastasis, even in the absence of radiographic evidence of metastasis.[\nThe surgery was uneventful, although the patient lost consciousness when he stood up for the first time on postoperative day (POD) 1. The patient's blood pressure could not be measured, and electrocardiography revealed ventricular fibrillation. The patient received 4 injections of epinephrine and 2 defibrillator shocks, which led to the return of spontaneous circulation at approximately 20 minutes after the ventricular fibrillation was detected. Pulmonary embolism was initially suspected, although CT failed to detect any emboli. The workup included coronary angiography, which revealed 90% luminal narrowing of the #6 branch of the lateral ascending artery, and the narrowing was attributed to vasospastic angina. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention, which successfully stabilized his cardiopulmonary condition. Laboratory testing revealed marked increases in potassium levels and eosinophil counts from POD 1 to POD 2 (Table ), when the patient experienced the cardiopulmonary disturbance.\nTwo weeks after the percutaneous coronary intervention, the patient developed a retroperitoneal cystic infection, which induced fever and hypotension, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified as the causative agent.

He experienced anywhere between 10\u201360 seizures a day. Starting at the age of 7 years, after multiple failed attempts to control the seizures using various pharmacologic regimens, the patient underwent the first of 7 surgical resections. The first two surgeries were performed outside the United States and consisted of resections of the left hippocampus and neocortex and the left anterior temporal lobe and hippocampus. Nonspecific diagnoses of gliosis were reportedly made in examining the resected tissue from the first two surgeries. A third surgical resection for continued seizures at the age of 10 years included resections of the left frontal lobe and portion of the left temporal lobe; the pathologic diagnosis was focal cortical dysplasia, Palmini type IA []. The patient was seizure-free for 14 months postoperatively but eventually developed seizure recurrence. Three subsequent surgeries within a 3-week period ensued and included resections of the left temporal lobe, orbitofrontal region, and insula. The pathology in all three cases was interpreted as representing Palmini type IA focal cortical dysplasia. Seizures recurred within 2 weeks of the sixth surgery and persisted for the next 5 months. A seventh surgery included a left frontoparietal resection.\nHistopathologic examination of tissue from the final surgical resection showed focal evidence of contusional damage, related to previous surgery. Areas of cortical architectural disorganization marked by an abnormal layering pattern with focal absence of cortical layer two and occasional enlarged and dysmorphic neurons characterized by an atypical distribution of Nissl substance in the cytoplasm were observed (). The findings were interpreted as being consistent with a Palmini type IIA pattern of focal cortical dysplasia. Balloon cells were not identified.

The patient also showed facial paralysis on left side (House-Brackmann grade III). He didn't have any underlying disease and showed a social history of smoking with 60 packs years and no history of alcohol intake. According to the physical examination, there was found no dermatological lesion such as rash, vesicle or crust near the ear drum, external auditory canal and near the external ear. The patient showed a sensorineural hearing loss of high frequency in both ears on pure tone audiometry. The hearing ability showed no worsening pattern as the symptoms were developed. The pain that was shown in this patient was of great severity compared to that generally shown in Bell's palsy, and he complained of a stronger, deep pain in the external auditory canal rather than in the areas near the auricles. Accordingly, beside to Bell's palsy, we considered an atypical type of Ramsay-Hunt syndrome that doesn't show dermatological lesions, as our possible differential diagnosis. We started with high doses of steroid (prednisolone, 60 mg/day) and antiviral drug (Acylovir 1800 mg/day) after the patient was hospitalized. Even though it's rare to present severe otalgia from primary or metastatic tumors of the skull base, we performed a CT scan of the temporal bone to rule out these possibilities. The findings from the CT scan showed a bony destruction of the temporal bone of the left, anterior attic and sphenoid bone ().

She was medically managed with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and \u03b2-blockers for hypertension and was a nonsmoker who expressed strong wishes to become pregnant. Her obstetrician was concerned that her condition would not support her pregnancy owing to lack of blood flow to the pelvis during pregnancy. The patient had two prior spontaneous miscarriages. Physical examination was remarkable for hypertension, with systolic blood pressure ranging from 160 to 180 mm Hg. Strong palpable pulses were noted in her upper extremities, with weaker palpable pulses in her lower extremities.\nPreoperative work-up included a magnetic resonance (MR) angiogram which revealed a normal appearing thoracic aorta that tapers from 2.0 cm down to 8 mm in size. There was no evidence of stenosis at the origin of the renal arteries or in the mesenteric vessels (\n). A dynamic cardiac MR revealed a maximal gradient of 37 mm Hg at the level of the diaphragm.\nThe patient underwent a tunneled descending thoracic aorto-left common iliac artery bypass, avoiding the need for a traditional large thoracoabdominal incision. The thoracic aorta was accessed via a 10-cm left thoracotomy incision and the left common iliac via an 8-cm left paramedian incision.

The patient had already been diagnosed with congenital pulmonary agenesis on the right side based on pre-natal ultrasonography and a postnatal computed tomography (CT) scan. After admission, a follow-up CT scan and bronchoscopy were performed to evaluate the condition of the lung and trachea and their relationship with surrounding structures.

The patient went to see a dentist at a private clinic to receive dental treatment for his anterior teeth erosion. The dentist performed history taking and found no obvious intrinsic or extrinsic causes of the erosive lesion. Thus, the patient was referred to the Prosthodontic Clinic at the Faculty of Dentistry, Prince of Songkla University, Thailand for consultation and joint management. Medical and dental history taking were performed to verify whether the patient was exposed to any cause of dental erosion or not. The patient mentioned that he rarely consumed acidic foods or beverages and had no sign of acid regurgitation presented. Apparently, it was found that the patient had been routinely swimming for 3 months. Since then, he noticed that his anterior teeth had been eroded. He stopped swimming 2 weeks ago because of the extreme sensitivity of the anterior teeth. The patient was asked to collect a sample of pool water from the swimming pool that he routinely went to swim in. The sample of pool water was evaluated for a pH value using a pH meter (Precisa, pH900, Precisa Gravimetrics AG, Dietikon, Switzerland). The pH value for the pool water was 4.5, which was lower than the critical value for enamel dissolution. Moreover, the patient reported that he spent more than an hour swimming each time, which meant that he had been exposed to low pH pool water for more than an hour every day over 3 months.\nIntra-oral examination revealed loss of enamel on the labial and incisal surface of the maxillary anterior teeth.

The onset of the right facial pain was June 10, 2010. The patient stated that the pain was not serious (verbal pain scale, VPS 2) and that she never needed any analgesics to relieve it. As the pain did not change, she paid no attention to it, and no imaging studies were performed until one month previously. New symptoms of right facial and cervical pain, as well as right cervical itch, developed on July 5, 2013. The pain (VPS 9) and itch were severe, and drugs (tramadol, carbamazepine, and antihistamines) did not relieve the symptoms. Physical examination showed only paresthesia of the right cervical area, with no abnormal observations of the limbs, the central nervous system, or the right cervical skin. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed one day after admission. Unfortunately, the head MRI showed that the right trigeminal nerve was compressed by the right posterior cerebellar artery (). A trigeminal nerve microvascular decompression was planned; however, the right cervical pain and itch were not explained by the trigeminal nerve compression. After a group discussion involving the whole department, a cervical MRI was performed. The cervical MRI demonstrated a round intramedullary lesion located at the C2 level, exhibiting a core of increased signal intensity and surrounded by a low signal intensity rim on the T2-weighted images ().\nA debate was held on which surgery should be performed first: microvascular decompression or intramedullary lesion resection. Considering that the right cervical pain and the itch were recent developments, we opted for the removal of the C2 intramedullary lesion first. After the preoperative examinations were completed, the patient was sent to the operating room. Microsurgical extirpation by posterior middle incision under general anesthesia was performed. After the skin and muscle were dissected, a laminectomy at the C2 level",

Multiple aspects of her personalities were reported, including the following: a personality of a seven-year-old child, a personality that would behave as a teenager, and another that acted like a male person in addition to her normal 55-year-old personality. She reported that she had been constantly dominated by her alternate personalities and became aware of their existence when people around her informed her, usually after a situation ended. She reported that stressful situations and substance abuse could aggravate the fragmentation of her personality. This was found to be mostly an involuntary phenomenon with seldom memory of the event.\nWhile transitioning between these personalities, she was found to be violent even to people who were close to her. This could range from being suicidal to homicidal for which she was arrested twice in the past. She had to be isolated and restrained by being locked in a room and calling the police.

The patient's medical history included coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia. Further history revealed he had received (2) stents in the past and undergone multiple heart catheterizations (up to seven) approximately seven years prior at an outside facility. During his last catheterization and stent procedure, which took over 4 hours (approx. 33 mSv), he developed a radiation-induced injury to his right back around the T10 dermatome (). During the following years, the burn was closely followed at an outside facility, and the area developed a chronic nonhealing ulcer which continued to evolve over time eventually growing outward from his back and developing a foul odor on his presentation to our facility in 2017. He reported increasing pain at the periphery of the tumor margin. Up to a year prior to presentation, the area was flat and biopsies revealed no evidence of malignancy. Upon presentation to us, however, the physical exam demonstrated a fungating mass approximately 5 \u00d7 9 cm with central purulent necrosis and induration surrounding the periphery (Figures \u2013). No additional nodularity or adenopathy was found on physical exam initially. At this time, punch biopsies demonstrated undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma along with frankly necrotic debris.\nInitial staging showed only localized disease by MRI with no evidence of metastasis by CT scan (Figures and ). Approximately one month following diagnosis, the patient underwent a radical excision with a 20 \u00d7 9 cm elliptical excision of the site. In this case, the patient chose human dermal matrix reconstruction, as primary closure was not possible due to the size of the site.

This was complicated by heavily restored upper first permanent molars, restored lower first permanent molars, reduced overbite, moderate upper arch and severe lower arch crowding, and a lower centreline discrepancy to the right side (). The maxillary central incisors showed white opacities. His dental history revealed repeated and major restorative work associated with his MIH-affected FPMs. The patient also presented with signs and symptoms associated with the heavily restored upper FPMs. His Orthopantomograph (OPT) showed signs of molar stacking of the upper right and left second molars, and distally tipped lower right and left second molars (). His paediatric dentist referred him to explore the potential for fixed appliance therapy and, if indicated, whether or not extractions of FPMs will be planned as part of orthodontic treatment.\nWith a view to help the patient avoid a course of root canal treatment to his upper FPMs, treatment involved the extraction of the upper and lower first permanent molars, together with upper and lower fixed appliances ().\nAlthough the timing of FPMs\u2019 extraction is most favourable around a chronological age of 8\u201310 years old, this older case illustrates the advantages of FPMs\u2019 extraction at a later stage.

She had no medication history or surgical history, and no relevant family history. She had felt increasing pain and numbness in her left finger for about 1 month, and she was referred to our hospital after the pain increased further.\nHer forearm were broadly distended () and the circumference of the left wrist was 1.2 cm longer than that of the right wrist. Grip strength was reduced by 11.4 kg on the left. Pain in the dorsiflexion of the wrist joint was noted, and the patient complained of numbness in the fingers. Electromyography showed a decreased amplitude of motor nerve conduction of the median nerve compared to the healthy side, but there was no delay in latency. Sensory nerve conduction velocity was undetectable on the affected side in the median nerve. The visual analogue scale for pain was 30/100.\nImaging findings showed no abnormalities on plain X-rays. MRI revealed hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging and suggested that the vein had expanded from the proximal forearm to the palm (). The size of the lesion was 16 \u00d7 2.2 \u00d7 3.3 cm. The median nerve was compressed by the vascular malformation invading the carpal tunnel.\nPregabalin was given for pain, but there was no improvement. Resection of the vascular malformation was considered to be invasive and to have a risk of incomplete resection. Therefore, carpal tunnel release was performed as an alternative treatment. A skin incision was made from the distal forearm to the palm, and the flexor retinaculum was opened.

He was admitted in another hospital the day prior, where he underwent closed reduction and received an above-elbow slab. He was referred to our hospital due to the inability of the former to achieve a good reduction. Examination at our ED revealed intact vascularity and nerve function. No signs of compartment syndrome were evident in the form of excessive pain or tense swelling. Radiography showed malreduction (). Re-reduction and casting were successfully performed (). Assessment of the ulnar nerve post-reduction was not possible as the boy was uncooperative due to pain. The patient was discharged and scheduled for a follow-up visit in the outpatient clinic 2 days later. The visit was rescheduled, and he was seen 7 days after discharge.\nAt the follow-up visit in the clinic, the patient still complained of sharp pain. Physical examination showed no swelling suggestive of compartment syndrome, pulses and capillary filling were normal, and median and radial nerves were intact; however, signs of ulnar nerve palsy in the form of decreased sensation in the little finger and weak abduction and adduction of the fingers were present. Radiography showed loss of reduction. Redisplacement could be explained by the fact that the patient was 10 years old, and as described by the study by Bowman et al stating that reduction of both bone forearm fractures in children 10 years and older are more likely to fail. The patient was admitted and closed reduction with percutaneous ESIN under general anesthesia was performed. Two 2.5-mm elastic nails were used, retrogradely for the radius and anterogradely for the ulna.

EGFR expression was negative by immunohistochemistry and mutation analysis was wild type. One year after surgery, he was diagnosed with multiple liver metastases confirmed by biopsy and received six cycles of CHOP chemotherapy at another medical center with partial response.

He had moderate right upper quadrant pain and fullness, but surprisingly no constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia or weight loss. Due to limited tissue availability, only two genes were sequenced to determine potential clinical trial eligibility, and both BRAF and PI3KCA were wild type as has been reported in FDCS.

    "original_text": "A male patient in his fifties presented to his local hospital having awoken with numbness and weakness of the right leg which left him unable to mobilise. The patient was a known historic intravenous drug user who had maintained a period of abstinence over the preceding 12 months before relapsing and injecting heroin the previous morning. This was followed by a period of immobility, as he lay in a comatose state on the floor. On rousing he experienced pain in the gluteal region and an inability to walk, prompting him to seek medical attention. On arrival at the A&E department his condition was diagnosed as acute limb ischaemia secondary to intravenous drug-induced thromboembolism. The patient was commenced on treatment dose low-molecular weight heparin and transferred to a tertiary centre for an urgent Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA, ). The angiogram showed patent vessels below the common iliac artery and was reported as normal. Detailed neurological examination revealed weakness in hip flexion and extension (1/5 on the Medical Research Council [MRC] scale) with complete paralysis in knee flexion and extension (0/5 on the MRC scale) and ankle plantar and dorsiflexion (0/5 on the MRC scale). Sensation to pinprick, vibration, and light touch was globally reduced and there was a loss of proprioception in the limb. Lower limb reflexes could not be elicited and the patient was in severe pain requiring regular high-dose oral morphine for analgesia. Blood tests revealed acute kidney injury with raised creatinine kinase, prompting treatment for rhabdomyolysis.

She had been told to hold her warfarin during her office visit. The patient was directed to go immediately to the emergency department (ED) but did not present until the next day. She had a history of very labile INRs in the past, with and without compliance. Multiple prior ED visits with extremely high levels in the past had been treated successfully with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) without complications.\nOn presentation to the ED the patient complained of a headache. She had no epistaxis or evidence of nasal bleeding. Her skin exam was normal. A neurologic exam was normal. A rectal exam was heme negative and the stool was normal color. The patient had right lower abdominal pain and tenderness. The emergency physician (EP) attending who was board certified in emergency medicine (EM) (seven years experience) supervised an intern (who had just begun residency training) in rendering patient care. A computed tomography (CT) of the brain was done with normal results. An INR lab test returned with a result of greater than 10. Due to abdominal tenderness, the possibility of appendicitis was entertained. A CT of the abdomen was ordered and the surgical service consulted.\nThe attending EP then discussed the case with the intern and a decision was made to give Profilnine (factor IX).

    "original_text": "A 54-year-old Japanese female visited an oral surgery clinic with a complaint of swelling in the inner region of the left cheek for the past one month. On clinical examination, a mobile swelling (size, 1 cm x 0.75 cm) with a clear boundary was observed on the left buccal mucosa. No associated pain was reported and the overlying mucosa was normal in appearance. The swelling was clinically diagnosed as benign buccal mucosa tumor. The tumor was excised under local anesthesia and was diagnosed as acinic cell carcinoma (AcCC) after histopathological examination. The margins were still positive for the tumor and further resection was advised. The patient reported to the Health Sciences University of Hokkaido Hospital for resection of the residual tumor two months after the initial surgery. Clinically, the patient was asymptomatic. The level 1B lymph nodes on both sides were palpable, bean sized, mobile, elastic, and soft. Intraorally, a surgical scar of about 7 mm was present on left buccal mucosa. There was no pain on pressure in the region of the scar (). The patient had a history of noninvasive ductal carcinoma (ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]; Tis N0M0) in the right breast, which was treated by excision and 57 Gy of radiotherapy five months ago. On investigation for oral lesion, no obvious abnormalities were detected on the computed tomography- (CT-) scan, contrast MRI, and ultrasonogram. Positron emission tomography- (PET-) CT did not suggest transition to and from any of the distant organs. The margin was resected under general anesthesia and sent for histopathological examination (). No relation to the parotid gland was found at the time of surgery.\nHistopathologically, the excised margin appeared as a fragmented tissue with no encapsulation. The tumor tissue was composed of cells with dominant microcystic structure with eosinophilic cytoplasm and eosinophilic secretory material. Papillary and tubular pattern of cell arrangement were also found but were limited to small area. A few vacuolar cells and some areas with hem",

He reported being tackled and falling back, leading to a direct impact onto his flexed right elbow. Examination demonstrated his right arm to be neurovascularly intact despite having a closed gross deformity at the elbow joint. X-ray evaluation revealed an anteromedial elbow dislocation with fracture of the radial head (). Two attempts were made at closed reduction in the emergency room under ketamine sedation with no appreciable reduction or improvement in alignment. Given the lack of success with closed reduction, the decision was made to take the patient to the operating room urgently for closed versus open reduction and possible fixation. Once under general anesthesia and with muscle relaxation employed, another closed reduction maneuver was attempted again with no success (). A direct posterior approach to the elbow was then performed with exposure carried around to the subcutaneous border of the ulna. It was noted that the olecranon apophysis remained in its anatomic position despite the ulna being anteriorly dislocated. Interestingly, the proximal ulna was found to be buttonholed through the anterior joint capsule, thus preventing reduction of the joint. The radial head was also noted to have an angulated Salter-Harris II fracture which was realigned with direct pressure application. No epicondylar fracture was noted with direct inspection. Once the entrapped proximal ulna was freed from the anterior capsule, it was easily reduced into its anatomic position (). Braided suture was used to reattach the olecranon apophysis to the proximal ulna through two drill holes in a figure of eight fashion.
