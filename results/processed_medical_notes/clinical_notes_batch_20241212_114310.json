Digital rectal examination revealed non-specific findings for the prostate, except that it was apparently enlarged. The serum level of prostate-specific antigen was normal (0.85 ng/mL). Transrectal ultrasonography revealed that a huge prostatic mass measuring 97\u00d788\u00d784 mm was well capsulated with internal hemorrhage and that the mass was isolated from the surrounding structures (). The radiologist recommended abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for an evaluation of the prostatic mass. CT scan showed direct invasion to adjacent organs with no metastasis. MR imaging of the prostate showed an enlarged prostatic mass with hemorrhagic necrosis. The prostatic mass was large (110\u00d785\u00d786 mm) with heterogeneous enhancement, displacing the bladder anteriorly and rectum posteriorly (). This implied that the tumor was mainly localized within the prostate and there was no definite evidence of a direct invasion of adjacent organs. The patient then underwent five-core prostate biopsy guided with transrectal ultrasound. Histologically, the tumor was composed of spindle cells with vesicular nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. These cells were arranged in a whirling or fascicular pattern. There was no significant nuclear pleomorphism (). Mitotic counts were more than five per 50 high-power fields. The tentative diagnosis was prostatic stromal sarcoma. Tumor cells from the biopsy specimen showed strong and diffuse immunohistochemical reactivity to KIT (CD117) and CD34, while negative immunohistochemical staining results were obtained for desmin, smooth muscle actin, cytokeratin, and S-100 (). These outcomes are concordant with the diagnosis of GIST.",

An above the knee and near-total amputation was sustained at the supracondylar level, with a complete degloving of the thigh up to the inguinal area (Fig. ). There were no other injuries.\nReplantation started at 9 h after injury. The supracondylar fracture was fixed with Kirschner wires, followed by intramedullary nailing of the tibial fracture using a Steinmann pin. The popliteal artery was anastomosed using a 5-cm vein graft from the contralateral saphenous vein after which two popliteal vein anastomoses were performed. The peroneal and tibial nerves were then repaired followed by repair of the quadriceps femoris, hamstrings and triceps surae. The degloved skin was defatted and was re-applied as a full-thickness skin graft to the thigh.\nThe patient was stable postoperatively. A few days after surgery, skin and muscle necrosis of the gastroc-soleus complex developed, requiring repeated debridement before a split-thickness skin graft could be applied (Fig. ). Two months after the index surgery, the patient had begun rehabilitation exercises for the lower extremity. After removal of the Steinman pin, an anteromedial external fixator was applied for two and a half months on the tibia in order to facilitate range of motion and weight-bearing exercises. The patient was discharged 1 month later.\nAt 4 years after the injury, the patient was ambulatory without assistance and no leg length discrepancy was noted at the time; knee flexion was noted at more than 90\u00b0 and ankle dorsiflexion was to 10\u00b0. Six years after injury, the patient was able to stand on the affected limb without support, but soft tissue contractures had developed in the ankle and knee",

She had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy and open appendectomy previously. She did not have any medical, family, or psychosocial history. She had missed her menstrual period without any other symptom and visited a private obstetrical clinic to confirm the pregnancy. However, she was diagnosed as having an abnormal pregnancy such as cervical or CSP by USG.\nAt our institution, she reported that her last menstrual period was just 5 to 6 weeks prior. However, USG revealed a gestational sac in the anterior lower uterine segment with a fetus measuring 4.83 cm crown-rump length (CRL) with positive cardiac activity, corresponding to 11 weeks and 6 days of gestation. Color/power Doppler images depicted a hyperechoic rim of a choriodecidual reaction with excessive vascularity (Fig. ). Although we could observe a definitive abnormally located gestational sac, our patient did not have any pain during the physical examination. She admitted that her last menstrual period was different from her usual menstrual periods. Because CSP or cervical pregnancy was suspected, we performed computed tomography (CT) for a definitive diagnosis. The CT scan showed an intrauterine gestational sac in the lower uterine segment bulging through the anterior uterine wall at the site of the cesarean scar. No invasion of the urinary bladder was observed (Fig. ). On presentation, her \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) level was 66,536.8 IU/L (Day 1).

Simultaneously, 2 ml of amniotic fluid was aspirated for termination of the pregnancy. However, fetal cardiac activity was still observed 2 days later (Day 3), without significant changes",

Therefore, tracheostomy was performed and night-time breathing using a ventilator was maintained subsequently. At the time of admission, repetitive hand flipping without purpose and lip smacking was observed during examination, although epileptiform discharges were not observed during EEG, we decided to proceed with additional evaluation other than that previously considered at this point.

The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken at the previous hospital showed an epidural mass at L1-2. Besides, there was a spinal stenosis at L4-5 and a spondylolytic spondylolisthesis at L5 (). The patient had suffered from neurogenic claudication for the last 10 years and had received epidural steroid injections from time to time. Eleven days before his transfer he was troubled due to multiple tryouts of an epidural injection. Severe back pain and both legs radiating pain were developed after that night. MRI was done the next day and SEH compressing the cauda equina was found at L1-2. The conservative treatment failed to ameliorate the symptoms. Thus, he was transferred to our hospital. On neurological examination, there was a diffuse sensory decrease in the left lower extremity, the motor power was intact. On laboratory findings, platelet count, bleeding time, clotting time, and prothrombin time were within normal limits. Activated partial thromboplastin time was slightly extended with 36.4 seconds (). As the patient had neither a past history of abnormal bleeding nor any medication of anti-platelet agents and there was nothing specific in his laboratory findings, we couldn't consider any bleeding disorder. His SEH was suspected to be related to the unsuccessful epidural injections. Carelessly, we did not give attention to the fact that the location of the hematoma was different from the site of epidural injections. We performed the hematoma evacuation and the surgery for L4-5-S1 simultaneously. All surgical procedures were uneventful. The symptoms had improved after the operation.

Initial surgical excision yielded a mass measuring 2.5 \u00d7 2.2 \u00d7 1 cm. Histological examination revealed tumor islands infiltrating the dermis and connecting to the epidermis with a lobulated morphology (Figure ). Since the deep resection margin was positive for malignant cells, a re-excision was performed and negative margins were verified microscopically. Eight months later, our patient presented with a 2 cm firm mass overlying the left parotid gland with minimal mobility on physical examination (Figure ). Whole body imaging in the form of a positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed increased uptake in the left parotid gland, which was consistent with metastasis. Our patient underwent left parotidectomy with facial nerve preservation and cervical lymphadenectomy. Surgical pathology specimens revealed a moderately differentiated carcinoma with growth pattern and morphological features consistent with porocarcinoma. Microscopically, nests of polygonal malignant cells were seen infiltrating the papillary and reticular dermis (Figure ). A surrounding dense fibrous stroma could be visualized (Figure ). The cervical lymph nodes (14 in total) were negative.\nGiven the aggressive behavior of EPC described in the literature and evidence for the effective use of radiation therapy [], our patient was offered intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). After initial consultation at the Head and Neck Radiation Oncology Clinic of the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Hollings Cancer Center, a consent form was obtained. Treatment planning consisted of a contrasted head and computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck with our patient lying supine, using a head and neck thermoplast mask with bite block immobilization.

Biochemical and radiological assessment showed features of acute pancreatitis in terms of elevated pancreatic enzyme level, and CT abdomen finding showed edematous pancreas with normal ductal system. It was attributed to hormonal replacement therapy after thorough investigation. Although the patient had stopped the implicated medications, she still had recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis.\nSince there was no obvious cause found for her recurrent episodes of pancreatitis, autoimmune pancreatitis was suspected.\nThen, she underwent endoscopic ultrasound in 2015 which revealed mass swelling at the duodenal ampulla, and biopsy was taken. The biopsy showed ampullary adenoma with high-grade dysplasia (Figures and ).\nThen, the patient decided to go abroad for further assessment where she underwent Whipple's procedure and histopathology confirmed the presence of ampullary adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.\nUnfortunately, she continued to have recurrent episodes of pancreatitis despite the removal of the ampullary adenoma.\nIn 2016, while she was admitted under care of a surgical team for another episode of pancreatitis, she was reviewed by the rheumatology team to rule out autoimmune condition. Therefore, IgG4 level was tested (1.49 g/L (149 mg/dl)). The biopsy was reassessed and found to have increased IgG4-positive plasma cells around 30\u201340 per high-power field with the background of adenoma with high-grade dysplasia. Accordingly, she was diagnosed to have both IgG4-related disease and ampullary adenoma.\nShe was started on oral prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg and rituximab therapy with significant improvement over 1 year of follow-up as the pancreatitis attacks have reduced from around once in every month to around once in every 3 to 4 months after 3 months of rituximab therapy, and currently she remained attack free for around one year.",

The pathological diagnosis was right renal cell carcinoma (RCC), clear cell carcinoma, pT1bN0M0, v1 (Fig. ). One and half years later, lymph node swelling was detected at hepatic portal region and he underwent lymphadenectomy. The pathological diagnosis was a metastasis from RCC. Two years after diagnosis, he was suspected of lung metastases and started treatment with interferon \u03b1. Three years later, the multiple lung metastases grew larger and were determined as progression despite interferon \u03b1 therapy. At this point, he was referred to our hospital in October 2016. There were no abnormalities on physical examination and his vital signs were normal.

Four weeks after cessation of sunitinib 50 mg/day, he was started on a dose of sunitinib 25 mg/day on a schedule of 2 weeks on and 1 week off. Computed tomography (CT) findings in January 2017 revealed that his lung metastases had shrunk; however, he continued to experience the same adverse events. Therefore, the dose of sunitinib was further reduced to 12.5 mg/day on a schedule of 2 weeks on and 1 week off. CT findings in May 2017 revealed new metastases in the pleura, diaphragm, and the right paracolic gutter (Fig. a, b).

Furthermore, the mass showed persistently peripheral enhancement on the gadolinium-enhanced MR images (). Two weeks after the CT scan, a PET/CT was performed to evaluate other occult metastases, including this lesion. The results of the PET/CT scan revealed the presence of a solitary liver mass with markedly increased accumulation of FDG (SUVmax, 9.6) ().

At the age of 32, bilateral cataracts were diagnosed and at 44 he was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, currently on oral hypoglycemic agents. Additionally, he has hypothyroidism and hypertriglyceridemia in management and calcification of the Achilles tendon. Patient endorses lack of an early adolescent growth spurt; however, final stature is similar to his other 3 siblings (164 cm). Patient reports he had no child by choice.\nPatient is product of the union of consanguineous parents (second cousins) and has a 49-year-old brother with similar clinical characteristics, including voice changes since the age of 28, bilateral cataracts at age 29 (subsequently presents complications from corneal ulceration and is currently legally blind), and premature graying since age 33, moreover, scleroderma-like skin changes since his 30s and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus at age 35. His brother also endorses no child by choice.

As the boy, his mother, and younger brother were waiting outside the building for friends to \u201cbuzz them in\u201d (), an individual exited the building and held the door open. The mother and younger brother entered without touching the door. As our patient entered the building, he grasped the metal door knob with his left hand while at the same time keeping his right hand on a metal stair railing that was adjacent to the entrance. This action occurred just as the door entry mechanism was activated from upstairs. As a result, the patient sustained an electrical shock inducing upper extremity tetany, prohibiting him from releasing his grip. The shock lasted approximately 5 seconds and was witnessed by the patient's mother. The patient retained consciousness throughout the event and did not fall afterwards.\nInitial evaluation in the Emergency Department centered on the potential cardiac, myopathic, and renal aspects of the injury. The patient was admitted for telemetry monitoring in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. No arrhythmias were noted. The following morning, the patient complained of bilateral wrist pain. He had mild swelling and erythema, therefore an orthopaedic surgery consult was requested for evaluation.\nThe child was able to use both hands, favoring the right over the more painful left. There were no burn marks or abrasions, but mild, bilateral, distal radius volar angulation deformities were present. Anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique radiographs of both wrists revealed bilateral, buckle-type, apex-dorsal angulated fractures of the distal radial metaphyses (Figures and ).

His fasting glucose level and postprandial (2 hr-after-meal) glucose level were 196 mg/dL and 300 mg/dL, respectively.\nHis visual acuity was 20/100 in both eyes.

Based on the brain MRI finding, the bilateral ptosis and superior rectus palsy of the left eye were regarded to be caused by 3rd nuclear palsy. The results of CSF analysis showed that white blood cell count and protein were elevated and intravenous antibiotics were given for a central nervous system infection.\nOn November 3, 2005, the visual acuity of both eyes decreased to perception of hand motion and bilateral complete ophthlamoplegia developed (). Anterior segment examination revealed no specific change compared with the previous finding. Fundoscopic examination revealed that the optic disc was pale and the posterior pole was generally edematous in both eyes. A cherry-red spot was found in the left eye ().

After the detailed physical examination and reviewing of X-ray images, it was decided that UKR would be the most suitable option for the patient with anteromedial knee osteoarthritis. After spinal anesthesia application and sedation, the UKR surgery was performed with a standard minimal invasive midline vertical incision and a medial parapatellar approach; the patella was removed laterally but not dislocated or everted. The patient received a medial partial knee implant with a mobile-bearing insert (medium size with 4 mm thickness; Oxford\u00ae, Zimmer Biomet Inc., Warsaw, IN, USA). Following the UKR surgery (), weight bearing was allowed as tolerated by the patient and a standard postoperative physiotherapy was started on the first postoperative day. The patient was discharged at postop 2nd day when she met the following criteria: independent ability to get dressed, to get in and out of the bed, and to sit and rise from a chair/toilet; independence in personal care; and mobilization with crutches. After discharge, a home-based exercise program was given to the patient. At postoperative follow-up, our patient acquired a full knee RoM in the postop 1st month and returned to independent daily activities without any external support in the postop 3rd month.\nAt postoperative 1st year after first UKR application, the patient fell down while getting on a public bus; this caused that the right knee of the patient was exposed to the valgus force vector.

Remarkably, he reported that his SRPE only occurred after having sexual intercourse, including ejaculation, the evening before. He did not have SRPE when intercourse and ejaculation had taken place during other times of the day. The duration of the intercourse did not make any difference; if he ejaculated during intercourse before he went to sleep, SRPE would occur in any case.

Four days into the course of antibiotics, he woke up from sleep with pain on the left side of his neck. Despite taking ibuprofen and acetaminophen, he presented to the Emergency Department 3 weeks later due to persisting torticollis. Pain was worse with movement.

The patient was euthyroid with normal serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and free thyroxine (FT4) during replacement therapy with L-T4. At physical examination, a palpable nodule of ~2 cm in size was detected in the isthmus of the thyroid. There were no palpable cervical lymph-nodes. An US evaluation confirmed an isolated lesion located in the isthmus, showing an isoechoic solid nodule with smooth margins; its size was 18 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 6 mm with intra and perilesional vascularity (Figure ). Therefore, a FNA was performed and cytological results revealed a TIR3A lesion. The cytological specimen showed an increased cellularity with some microfollicular structures in the background of scant colloid (Figure ). Thus, we assessed the risk factors associated with the isolated TIR 3A nodule of our patient. According to the ATA guidelines we repeated the FNA which confirmed the same result (TIR3A). The second US (after 6 months) showed that there were no clear signs suggesting malignancy such as microcalcifications or taller than wide-shaped nodules. However, we found a small hypoechoic cranial component in the nodule with blurred margins and elastography revealed an increased stiffness in this cranial component. No nodules were detected in the contralateral lobes by US; cervical lymph nodes were normal. Among the possible risk factors, our patient referred a familial history of thyroid cancer. Her mother was submitted to total thyroidectomy for a follicular variant of PTC twenty years ago; our subsequent evaluation showed that she was disease free at the moment.\nOn this basis, we decided that a surgical treatment was indicated for our patient and assessed the risk/benefit of",

Perianal ultrasound suggested an inflammatory mass, with no significant relationship between the mass and the rectum (). The clinical diagnosis was a perianal mass for further examination. The decision was made to perform excision and biopsy. Under general anesthesia, the perianal area was prepped and draped in a sterile manner and the anal mass was identified. Local anesthesia with 25% macaine was injected into the skin around the mass, and an elliptical incision was made around the mass, about 0.5 cm from the edge of the mass. The subcutaneous tissue was taken down by electrocautery. During surgery, the tumor was found to be spreading subcutaneously, with unclear boundaries. It had a hard texture, no capsule, and no fluctuation (indicating a solid mass) and was sent for pathology. The skin was closed using interrupted subcuticular stitches and Monocryl.\nGross examination showed a gray-yellow mass measuring 4 cm \u00d7 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm ().

Within 24 hours an open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture was performed.\nUnder general anesthesia, using a direct subcutaneous approach to the ulna, the ulna was reduced and fixed with a seven-hole titanium dynamic compression plate (DCP; Figure ); 1 mm compression was applied.\nThe radius was exposed using Henry's approach. The distal radius fracture was fixed using a five-hole titanium DCP while applying 1 mm compression. The proximal three radius fragments were fixed with a nine-hole DCP (Figure ). Careful handling of the soft tissues was paramount and extra care was taken to avoid devascularising any of the bone fracture segments. We also applied 1 mm compression to the proximal fracture. The middle fracture was bridged because of inherent comminution.\nAfter wound closure, an above-elbow back slab was applied with the elbow held in 90 degrees of flexion. The forearm was held elevated in a sling and our patient was monitored for signs of compartment syndrome. Our patient was discharged from hospital after 48 hours of observation in a broad arm sling; there were no immediate post-operative complications.\nAfter two weeks, the back slab and the skin staples were removed. There was no neurovascular deficit; only a minor but improving subjective altered sensation over the dorsal first web space. The range of active supination was slightly reduced, but otherwise a good range of movement was demonstrated. Our patient was left free",

On day 26 of hospitalization, the parenchymal hemorrhages were managed with neurosurgical debridement of the hemorrhagic brain with partial temporal lobectomy and duraplasty with titanium mesh placement since the patient failed to improve with medical management alone. A repeat head CT scan obtained on day 28 of hospitalization identified an 18 mm subgaleal fluid collection overlying the duraplasty noted in . Given the persistent fevers, the subgaleal fluid collection was aspirated on day 30 of hospitalization which subsequently grew 2+ Enterobacter cloacae complex susceptible to TMP-SMX, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and ertapenem. Resistance patterns of the patient-specific E. cloacae isolated are described in . Cell count of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) identified 17,300 nucleated cells/\u03bcL with 98% granulocytes, 35,000 red cells/\u03bcL, 980 mg/dL of protein, and an undetectable glucose level.\nGiven the susceptibilities, the patient was transitioned from vancomycin and ceftazidime to SMX-TMP (5 mg/kg of TMP) every 8 hours IV and metronidazole 500 mg IV every 12 hours. Since the patient continued to have persistent fevers, a repeat head CT scan was performed which identified an enlarging subgaleal fluid collection measuring 104 \u00d7 23 mm as noted in . The neurosurgical team believed the risk of removal of the titanium mesh was much greater than the benefit given her poor surgical candidacy attributed to comorbidities. Furthermore, a future procedure would be needed following removal. Repeat subgaleal collection aspirations performed on day 35 of hospitalization remained persistently",

Acute bilateral DVTs involving the common femoral and popliteal veins were diagnosed. Over 48 h, despite receiving unfractionated heparin, he developed anuric renal failure and shock.

The heparin infusion was discontinued and the patient was transferred to our hospital.\nOn arrival, his mean arterial pressure was 71 (104/53) mmHg while on norepinephrine, vasopressin, and phenylephrine. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.06, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 28 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 312 mmHg, and a lactate of 16 mmol/L. The platelet count was 31 K/\u03bcL. Examination was notable for tense bilateral lower extremity oedema. Dorsalis pedis pulses were detectable with Doppler ultrasound. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed dilation of the distal IVC suggesting thrombosis (Fig. A). Transthoracic echocardiography showed a 25% ejection fraction with no right ventricular dilation or strain. The IVC was collapsible proximal to the hepatic veins. Lower extremity ultrasound confirmed acute bilateral DVTs involving the external iliac and femoral veins. Laboratory evaluations excluded thrombophilia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Infusion of 5 L of isotonic fluid and continuous renal replacement therapy led to a reduction in the vasopressor requirement, a reduction in lactate to 2.",
