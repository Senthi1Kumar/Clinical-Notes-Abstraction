    "original_text": "A 74-year-old woman who suffered from pancreatic adenocarcinoma of the corpus, including peritoneal and bone metastases, had received palliative chemotherapy with gemcitabine for eight months; however, she switched to concomitant chemoradiation due to painful symptomatic primary tumor progression. Treatment consisted of percutaneous modulated arc radiotherapy with single doses of 3.0 Gy five times a week up to a total dose of 36.0 Gy. The planning target volume was 102 ccm. Radiation was combined with fluorouracil (225 mg/m2/d) as continuous infusion.\nFour weeks after the completion of chemoradiation, the patient presented in the emergency room with vomiting and rapidly increasing pain in the upper left abdomen, and gastrointestinal obstruction due to progressive disease was suspected. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed an intrasplenic cyst () with a size of 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 16 cm. Fine needle aspiration revealed mesothelial cells and elevated levels of lipase but no tumor cells. Therefore, the diagnosis of an intrasplenic pancreatic pseudocyst was made. There were no signs of a splenic rupture or peritonitis. Because of the massive painful enlargement and the risk of intraperitoneal rupture, we performed a gastrocystic drainage from the cardia into the upper part of the intrasplenic cyst. The technique was undertaken with a short needle path, with less splenic tissue between the gastric wall and the cyst, using endosonography to place a 4 cm double pigtail. The pigtail drainage produced brown cloudy liquid without the presence of any tumor cells.\nWithin the following days, the patient experienced relief from pain and had bowel movements. A CT scan and ultrasound showed shrinkage of the cyst and air in the parenchyma of the spleen as the organ returned to its typical shape (). Free intra-abdominal air was not detected. The patient recovered without further pain in the upper left abdomen; however, she died six weeks later because of the progressive systemic disease.",

In 1999, he had an urgent splenectomy for a spontaneous splenic rupture. A few months afterward while on holiday in Egypt in 2000, he was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and secondary diabetes mellitus requiring urgent treatment with subcutaneous insulin. In 2008, he was seen by the neurologist for a 2-year history of symptoms of painful neuropathy and poor balance. Nerve conduction studies confirmed diabetic sensory-motor neuropathy secondary to poor diabetes control. Prior to being seen in the endocrine clinic, the patient had been advised to reduce the intake of potassium-containing foods and to avoid the use of NSAIDs as it was thought that these may be contributing to his continued hyperkalemia. Despite these interventions, the hyperkalemia and recurrent attendances to the emergency department persisted. His medication list at the time of presenting to the endocrine clinic included Humalog\u00ae insulin at meal times, human insulatard insulin at bed time, and calcium resonium powder to remove excess potassium.\nOn examination, he had no abnormal clinical findings apart from peripheral sensory loss affecting his feet. His serum creatinine and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio were normal, and an ultrasound scan revealed normal kidneys. Therefore, renal impairment and diabetic nephropathy were ruled out as a cause for his hyperkalemia. He also had a normal short Synacthen (adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation) test, which ruled out adrenal insufficiency.

    "original_text": "A 49-year-old Caucasian male was referred from an outside facility for further evaluation of refractory iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic intermittent melenic gastrointestinal bleeding. Despite multiple blood transfusions and iron supplementation, his anemia continued to worsen. Upper endoscopy performed at an outside facility described features of chronic gastritis hence proton pump inhibitor therapy was instituted. Despite this the frequency of melenic stools increased. Repeat upper endoscopy reported multiple friable antral polyps with histopathologic analysis reporting changes consistent with adenomatous tissue.\nOur patient\u2019s past medical history was notable for chronic active hepatitis C infection, coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease. The patient was post pancreatic and renal transplantation. A liver biopsy in 2001 demonstrated mild fibrosis (grade 2, stage 1) consistent with chronic viral hepatitis C. Medications on referral to our institution included Nexium 40 mg daily, Iron sulfate 325 mg twice daily, ASA 81 mg, Carafate 1 g four times daily and cyclosporine 100 mg daily.\nOn referral to our facility, EGD evaluation revealed multiple erythematous friable antral polyps and nodules ranging in size from 2 to 6 mm ().

The pain had been present for the past four-to-five days and was progressive in nature. The patient admitted to being fairly active and normally able to ambulate without the assistance of a cane or walker up until symptoms began. He described his pain as 10 out of 10 constant pain in the anterior bilateral hip joints with mild radiation into his lumbar back and groin, with no radiation into his legs. His pain increased with ambulation but improved with rest. He attempted to take three doses of aspirin at home without any relief in his symptoms and began using a walker to help him ambulate.\nThe patient had an extensive medical history. This history included sigmoid diverticulitis with sigmoid colectomy in 2012, deep vein thrombosis, duodenal ulcer, benign prostatic hypertrophy and hypertension. He also suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic thrombocytopenia, peripheral vascular disease, atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

He has completely recovered when arriving at the emergency department and the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 0 point. No abnormalities such as bleeding or tumor were found in the examination of brain computed tomography (CT) scan. We treated him with clopidogrel 300 mg and aspirin tablets 300 mg immediately. Another 3 similar attacks occurred for 5 hours after administration of loading dose of the dual antiplatelet therapy, and the attack duration extended longer time (Fig. ). Fourteen hours after the first episode of TIAs, he developed more severe right hemiparesis and dysarthria, and the NIHSS score was 12 points (Fig. ). The computed tomography angiography (CTA) results showed that M1 segment of the left MCA was highly stenosis, but the distal end of the M2 segment was well clear (Fig. ). Repeat CT scan showed small acute infarcts in the right putamen and no bleeding. The loading dose of dual antiplatelet treatments seemed to be ineffective in the acute phase, and the patient declined to proceed for digital subtraction angiography. We administered r-tPA (46.8 mg, 0.6 mg/kg) at 76 minutes after final unrecovered attack of right hemiparesis and dysarthria.

She had sinus rhythm on ECG and mild LV hypertrophy with a normal LV ejection fraction in echocardiography with no evidence of organic heart disease.

No ventricular tachyarrhythmias on PVS were inducible. A mild mixed-type vagotonic reaction associated with atypical chest pain was observed on TTT. In light of these findings, a treatment with verapamil targeting at the suppression of AVNRT episodes was initiated.

BUN (blood urea nitrogen) was elevated at 19 mg/dL. A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast showed stranding around the head of the pancreas in addition to splenic granulomata and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes (Fig. ).

The patient was being maintained on tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone for immunosuppression (). Due to loss of previous graft from rejection, she was maintained on a high-dose triple drug immunosuppressive regimen to prevent recurrence of rejection. One month prior to diagnosis, she presented with acute left leg pain and swelling felt to be secondary to chronic pain from hardware repair of extremity several years ago.

The patient was admitted from a skilled nursing facility for ventilator-dependent patients with a tracheostomy tube in situ. His history was significant for cerebral vascular accident (CVA) 3 times, atrial fibrillation (AF), abdominal aortic aneurism (AAA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), neurogenic dysphagia (for which he had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement (PEG)), stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer with osteomyelitis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, chronic renal failure, peripheral vascular disease, previous gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, dementia (minimally responsive at baseline), a seizure disorder, and ventilator-dependent respiratory failure for which he had a tracheostomy created. The patient had a prolonged hospital stay, and on hospital day 33, he was noted to have bright red blood draining profusely from his tracheostomy tube. The patient underwent immediate evaluation by the cardiothoracic surgery team. The patient was noted to be losing blood and bradycardic.

The local police were called and they brought the patient and his wife to the psychiatric hospital for evaluation. Based on the patient's own report and that of his wife, starting in 1988 (when he was 25 years old) he became convinced he was an internationally renowned secret agent who had: a) changed global military thinking when he was 8 years old; b) communicated with Taiwanese spies when he was 17; c) used his mental powers to direct American military forces; and d) (more recently) single-handedly coordinated the liberation of Kuwait. The Intelligence Agency in Taiwan and the US Central Intelligence Agency had been secretly protecting him and had made monthly payments into his account at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which now totaled over 100 million US dollars. The Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China had contacted him on many occasions with the goal of acquiring his advanced military intelligence, but he refused to provide this information so they persecuted him and his family in a variety of ways: his application to build a house in 2007 was denied by local authorities; the government had made it difficult for him, his wife and his son to find good jobs; and his co-workers hampered his activities at work and even poisoned his food.

He admitted using nasally insufflated recreational drugs resulting in loss of consciousness for about eight to ten hours on a staircase. He was aware of the symptoms upon regaining consciousness. His past medical history included chronic intravenous drug use and hepatitis C.\nOn examination, the lateral aspect of the left thigh was markedly swollen along with the left buttock. They were no signs of redness or skin injury. Left ankle dorsiflexion was weak, with a muscle power grade (MRC) of 3/5, whereas vascular supply was intact. Sensory and motor assessment revealed a left lateral leg deficit indicating left peroneal nerve palsy.\nPatient\u2019s biochemistry on admission showed high levels of creatine phosphorkinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Both suggested muscle death and tissue breakdown (Table ). Imaging with an ultrasound (US) showed non-uniformly swollen left buttock muscle compartments. A CT angiogram was performed to rule out hemorrhage or infection and it revealed signs of muscle and subcutaneous tissues oedema. Moreover the intramuscular fat planes were obliterated. No active arterial or venous bleeding or any abscess was detected. (Figures and .)\nSubsequently, the patient became anuric with high levels of urea and creatinine, suggesting acute kidney injury (AKI), which was managed with temporary hemodialysis.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen revealed bilateral lower lobe pneumonia and two retained Jackson-Pratt drains in the right upper quadrant with a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema and stranding adjacent to one of the drain tips (Figure ). In addition to the presence of pneumoperitoneum, one drain was resting over the dome of the liver and traversing the transverse colon, while the other drain was near the right flank and distally traversing the second portion of the duodenum. Neither drain could be appreciated by palpation or inspection along the external body surface.\nHis history was significant for an exploratory laparotomy, right nephrectomy, and diaphragm repair for a gunshot wound sustained to the right lower back and abdomen eight years previously. The entrance wound was via the diaphragm into the abdomen, with the bullet traversing segments eight and five of the liver and then into the retroperitoneum. There was no significant bleeding from the right lobe liver wound, but there was a large zone 2 retroperitoneal hematoma on the right. The mid-portion of the parenchyma of the right kidney had been essentially obliterated, and the pelvis of the right kidney was involved; the right kidney was therefore resected. The diaphragm injury was repaired with a running #0 Prolene suture and then two separate 3/16 inch round silastic drains were placed, one over the dome of the liver, the second into the subhepatic pararenal space. Our patient was discharged home with the drains left in place for large output drainage.

He was a nonalcoholic and nonsmoker and had no significant past medical or surgical history. On examination, the patient was found to have normal oxygen saturation with normal physical examination findings. Thus, the patient was discharged home with paracetamol and was advised to maintain adequate hydration. During the first week of illness, the clinical progression was fairly controlled, but through the second and third weeks of illness, the patient developed malaise, loss of appetite, distaste, and loss of smell sensation. At that time, the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation was still within normal range with normal hydration status, and the patient was thus continued with the original management plan and was asked to visit hospital if there was any aggravation of symptoms. Through the fourth week of illness, there was aggravation of clinical features with frequent drops in oxygen saturation noted overnight and generalized weakness, and cramps especially in the lower limbs. By the end of the first month of illness, the patient was afebrile with resolution of most of the symptoms including improvement of appetite and return of sense of smell and taste, but the body aches and muscle weakness further aggravated. This was when serological tests were performed for SARS-CoV-2 that showed strong IgG positivity with negative reaction for IgM, presented in Table .

Six months prior, she had consulted a dermatologist for a painful area on her right heel that had been present for approximately three to six months. The area was raised, tender, firm, and was increasing in size. Physical exam at that time revealed a 2 cm raised, firm, noncompressible nodule on the posterior right heel, which was tender to palpation without any redness or streaking. X-rays were nonspecific and revealed that the soft tissue shadow was \u201cnot connecting to bone.\u201d A punch biopsy taken at a follow-up visit with the dermatologist revealed a leiomyoma of the heel. She continued to experience pain (8/10 in severity) and was seen in our clinic for evaluation six months later. She had no other areas of bleeding, itching, or pigment changes of the skin. Physical exam revealed a palpable 2 cm x 1 cm nodule on the posterior aspect of the right heel which was freely mobile and tender to palpation (Figure ). Pulses and sensation were normal throughout in both lower extremities and no other gross abnormalities were noted.\nThe patient did not have a history of frequent running, gout, diabetes, constitutional symptoms, or weight loss. Due to the unusual location of this leiomyoma, Reed\u2019s syndrome was considered in the differential diagnosis, and the patient was referred for a gynecological oncology appointment. However, because she had no personal or family history of other similar soft tissue masses, uterine fibroids, renal cell carcinoma, or skin cancer, there was a low index of suspicion.

    "cleaned_text": "a 41-year-old female presented to our clinic as a new patient for excision of a previously diagnosed right heel leiomyoma. six months prior, she had consulted a dermatologist for a painful area on her right heel that had been present for approximately three to six months. the area was raised, tender, firm, and was increasing in size. physical exam at that time revealed a 2 cm raised, firm, noncompressible nodule on the posterior right heel, which was tender to palpation without any redness or streaking. x-rays were nonspecific and revealed that the soft tissue shadow was \"not connecting to bone.\" a punch biopsy taken at a follow-up visit with the dermatologist revealed a leiomyoma of the heel. she continued to experience pain (8/10 in severity) and was seen in our clinic for evaluation six months later. she had no other areas of bleeding, itching, or pigment changes of the skin. physical exam revealed a palpable 2 cm x 1 cm nodule on the posterior aspect of the right heel which was freely mobile and tender to palpation (figure ). pulses and sensation were normal throughout in both lower extremities and no other gross abnormalities were noted.\nthe patient did not have a history of frequent running, gout, diabetes, constitutional symptoms, or weight loss. due to the unusual location of this leiomyoma, reed's syndrome was considered in the differential diagnosis, and the patient was referred for a gynecological oncology appointment. however, because she had no personal or family history of other similar soft tissue masses, uterine fibroids, renal cell carcinoma, or skin cancer, there was a low index of suspicion. her past medical history was nonspecific for any condition predisposing to cancer.\nshe was scheduled for surgery two weeks later. the tumor was excised (figures -) and sent for pathology confirming cutaneous leiomyoma (figure ). follow-up visit at two weeks status post-excision showed a well-healing",

He reported that he underwent excision of a small pigmented lesion in the same location in 1999, and pathology had suggested a nevus. The lesion reappeared in 2005, and had grown rapidly in the previous 2 months. Ophthalmic examination revealed visual acuity of 20/20, an intraocular pressure of 14 mmHg in both eyes, and normal funduscopy. Biomicroscopy showed the presence of a pigmented tumor at the caruncle, extending to the lower conjunctival fornix and establishing a mass in this region. A computed tomography scan of the orbit showed localization of the tumor in the medial corner without orbital extension.\nThe patient underwent incisional biopsy of the lesion located in the inferior fornix. Histopathologic examination showed an atypical neoplastic melanocytic lesion in the conjunctiva compatible with ulcerated and invasive melanoma, with thickness of 4.5 mm. There was no evidence of tumor spread. In May 2010, the patient was brought to the nuclear medicine service where Tc-99 was injected in the pericicatricial conjunctiva. After 2 hours, lymphoscintigraphy identified two SLN in the pre-auricular region. Tumor excision was performed with wide margins, achieving an oncologic R0 result. The corner of the eye, the medial third of the upper and lower eyelids, and the lacrimal sac were also excised in monoblock. Reconstruction was done with skin graft. At the beginning of the procedure, isosulfan blue dye was injected into the scar in order to stain the SLN and help in identification of the surgical field. The oncology surgeons localized and resected the two previously identified nodes using a gamma probe intraoperatively. The lymph nodes were processed using the \u201cbread loaf\u201d technique in 2 mm thick slices. Hematoxylin-eosin-stained (HE) sections from all blocks of the primary lesion were analyzed initially, confirming the diagnosis of melanoma. At SLN",
