He was discharged 24 hours after delivery. He was brought back to our ER with left eye purulent discharge, which was noticed since birth, and swelling of his left upper eyelid of 2 days duration.\nThere was no associated fever or history of decreased level of activity or feeding. There was no history of rashes or seizures.\nThe pregnancy course was remarkable only for gestational diabetes and the fact that the mother had a history of vaginal discharges, which was treated as vaginal candidiasis during the last trimester. Group B streprococcus screening on the 37th week of gestation was negative. Similarly, HIV and hepatitis B serology were negative one day prior to delivery. There was no maternal history of genital lesions, vesicles, or ulcers.\nExamination was normal apart from the purulent eye discharge & swelling of the left eye upper eyelid. The eye secretions were yellowish sticky, copious, and profound.

Symptoms were typically worse at night and on laying flat. On exam, she had a faint stridor and was slightly tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. CT of the neck was performed, revealing soft tissue prominence within her cervical trachea.\nThoracic surgery explored the neck due to the presence of stridor but that did not reveal any extratracheal abnormal tissue and no apparent lymph nodes in the area. She improved with steroid treatment only to relapse with the same symptoms a few days after discharge when the steroids were tapered down. After multiple examinations, and several treatments for COPD exacerbation, the patient was referred to the pulmonology clinic.\nBronchoscopy showed that the trachea was heavily studded and infiltrated with abnormal tissue on all walls: from the vocal cords and subglottic area, down to the carina and into the proximal mainstem bronchi (Figures -). Biopsy of the multiple areas showed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with supportive histochemistry. Her Program Death Ligand molecule 1 expression (PD-1) was low at 20%. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed next and showed normal esophageal mucosa throughout and no evidence of any fistulas. The staging process was initiated, with a PET/CT scan only showing increased uptake at the site of the locally advanced disease confined to the airways. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was negative for metastasis. Her case was discussed in the multidisciplinary tumor board. The tumor was considered unresectable due to the apparent involvement of the entire tracheal length.

Based on the physical examination, we observed no abnormalities except for an icteric appearance. Additionally, an irregular lump was observed in the right lobe of the liver with unclear boundaries on abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Multiple tubular and patchy images appeared around the lesion, while the dilated bile duct was inspected at the distal end of the lesion. We identified that the solid components of the lesion were slightly enhanced with an average computed tomography value of about 66 HU (Fig. ). We also viewed filling defects in the inferior vena cava with no clear enhancement (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed that the right hepatic intrahepatic bile ducts were dilated to varying degrees, some of which were cystic. In the dilated bile ducts, there was an irregular and slightly longer T2 signal lump shadow, some of which were \u201ccauliflower-like,\u201d whereas the partial liver margin was slightly sunken (Fig. ). Using an echocardiogram, we discovered an irregular mass-like echo filling in the right atrium, with divided lobes visible (Fig. ). In particular, the larger lobe was approximately 47 mm \u00d7 18 mm in size, starting from the entrance of the inferior vena cava. We also uncovered small filling defects in the posterior pulmonary artery in the left and right upper lobes using computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA). As the patient had space-occupying lesions in the inferior vena cava and atrium along with pulmonary embolism, the Caprini grade was high-risk. Without bleeding tendency, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was used for thromboembolic prophylaxis twice a day (100 IU/Kg).

Initially, a bronchofibroscope examination failed to reveal any abnormalities. In order to obtain a definitive diagnosis, the tissue specimens were taken by diagnostic right thoracoscopic lung biopsy.\nThe histological diagnosis of PEH was based on the pathological examination.

The tumor cells were round with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, intracytoplasmic vacuolization and a signet ring-like appearance (). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the tumor cells were positive for the endothelial markers, factor-VIII-related antigen and CD34 ().\nPEH disease progressed rapidly in this patient one month after pulmonary surgery. The T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) section examination revealed a nodular lesion in the brain, which was strongly suggestive of brain metastasis (). The CT revealed a spreading of the nodules throughout both lungs three months after surgery (). At this point, the patient began treatment with one cycle of chemotherapy with cisplatin, paclitaxel and endostar (15 mg/day for 14 consecutive days). The patient demonstrated improvements in dyspnea and a dramatic improvement in their clinical status.

Previous surgeons had attempted this by stapedectomy and implantation of various stapes prostheses in the patient's right ear, and she reported immediate hearing improvement after the most recent surgery. However, several hours after that surgery she vomited and the hearing improvement ceased. Previous surgical records could not be obtained. At the time of the initial visit, she used behind-the-ear hearing aids bilaterally with poor benefit.\nA previously obtained audiogram revealed a profound mixed hearing loss bilaterally (with a masking dilemma due to large bilateral conductive components), with air-conduction pure-tone averages (500, 1000, and 2000 Hz) of 108 dB HL in the right ear and 95 dB HL in the left ear (). Word recognition scores were 20% at 115 dB HL in the right ear and 80% at 105 dB HL in the left ear.\nThe patient had never undergone otologic imaging. Because of the patient's unusual story and multiple previous surgeries, a noncontrast temporal bone computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained. Results revealed multiple bilateral middle ear and cochlear malformations. The ossicles demonstrated abnormal morphology and appeared to be fused bilaterally. There were only 1.5 turns to both cochleae instead of the expected 2.5 turns. The vestibules were enlarged bilaterally. Incomplete separation of the basal turns of both cochleae from the internal auditory canals (IACs) was seen (). A metallic stapes prosthesis was seen in the right ear, with abnormal orientation, abutting the facial nerve; the bilateral facial nerves followed an abnormal course of the second genu anterior to the promontory ().",

    "original_text": "A 61-year-old man who was a heavy cigarette smokerpresented to our department with a mass in the nasopharynx found by bronchoscopy. He had been diagnosed with SCC of the left lower lung by bronchoscopic biopsy 2 years earlier. He was staged with T4N0M0 disease after systemic evaluation at that time. Thereafter he received a presumed curative left pneumonectomy, which revealed moderately differentiated SCC with no lymph node metastases and a clear bronchial resection margin. He was given four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with regular doses of gemcitabine and cisplatin. His disease had remained stable for 1 year until 6 months before his presentation to our hospital.We founda recurrent mass in the end of his trachea by chest computed tomography and bronchoscopy (Figure ), and, on the basis of a bronchoscopic biopsy, we confirmed the mass to be a well- to moderately differentiated SCC. To alleviate the patient\u2019s symptoms of respiratory obstruction, tumor removal was carried out through bronchoscopy intervention therapies, including argon knife, electric snare, cryotherapy and hot biopsy forceps. His symptoms were relieved after these procedures. However, his symptoms recurred 1.5 months later. A similar mass was found again in the end of the trachea, with the same pathological result confirmed by biopsy. The second-course tumor removal through bronchoscopy intervention therapy was carried out, followed by one course of conformal external beam radiation to the tumor bed at a dose of 6,600 cGy in 33 fractions. Three months after the completion of radiotherapy, a cauliflower-like mass in the torus tubarius of the nasopharynx was found during a routine follow-up bronchoscopic evaluation. Biopsy of the nasopharyngeal mass confirmed it to be SCC. The patient was referred to our department for further evaluation. Serum tests of antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were negative.

    "original_text": "A 74-year-old male sustained complete subcutaneous rupture of the right Achilles tendon while ballroom dancing. Initial repair via flexor hallucis longus tendon transfer was performed at an outside institution. The postoperative course was complicated by progressive, recurrent infection, and the patient subsequently presented to our clinic after 2 months with a necrotic, infected tendocutaneous defect of the Achilles. Extensive debridement was performed, on 3 separate occasions, resulting in a 9-cm tendon gap with an overlying soft tissue defect measuring 90-cm2 (). Given the extent of the defect, composite tissue transfer utilizing a combined ALT flap with vascularized fascia lata was proposed.\nDoppler examination in the operating theater revealed a weak, yet audible signal along the surface of the proposed ALT donor site. Intraoperatively, however, only a single, small-caliber perforator supplying this region from the lateral circumflex femoral system could be identified. To avoid the additional morbidity of selecting a surrogate donor site, a portion of the thinner, more attenuated rectus femoris muscle was harvested in conjunction with the posterior rectus fascia to reconstruct the soft tissue and tendoachilles defects, respectively (). End-to-side microvascular anastomosis was performed between the posterior tibial artery and the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery.

Before her retirement, she had worked in the chemical industry for over 10 years. Her past medical history included papillary urothelium carcinoma of the bladder (pTaN0M0, grade 2), which was diagnosed at age 62, with a clinical presentation of painless gross hematuria. The patient's bladder cancer was treated by transurethral resection of a bladder tumor (TURBT), and she was administered routine pirarubicin intravesical chemotherapy for 3 years. The bladder lesion recurred twice during the first 2 years and had remained undetectable until the time the renal lesion was identified. Her relevant family history included pancreatic cancer in her father.\nAn abdominal CT scan showed a 5 \u00d7 4.5 \u00d7 3-cm inhomogeneous and partially exophytic lesion in the right lower kidney with hypodense, necrotic lesions in the middle surrounded by relatively hyperdense lesions (Figure ). No metastatic lesions, lymph node enlargement or renal vein involvement was noted. After a radical laparoscopic nephrectomy, the pathological examination showed a 5 \u00d7 4.5 \u00d7 3-cm mass in the right lower kidney. Further immunohistochemical staining was performed (Table ). The patient's thyroid gland was examined carefully after the surgery, and there were no significant pathologic findings.

He was admitted to the pediatric department of a peripheral hospital because of repeated episodes of vomiting. After a few days, vomiting turned into projectile vomiting.\nA sonography was performed and showed a pylorus with a channel length of 17 mm and a mural thickening to 4 mm, confirming the diagnosis of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, and he was transferred to the pediatric surgical department.\nAn extramucosal pyloromyotomy (Bianchi's approach) was performed the day after, at 20 days of life. In the postoperative course, vomiting persisted, and a control sonography suspected the persistence of a stenosis since it showed no passage through the pylorus during the 8 minutes of the exam. This led the surgeons to a redo pyloromyotomy 5 days later by extending the incision a few millimeters more distally.\nAgain, the vomiting didn't stop after the second surgery. The baby was on parenteral nutrition and his clinical condition was good. A radiography and an upper gastrointestinal (GI) study were performed at 5 weeks of age, and showed a stagnation of contrast in the dilated stomach and minimal passage to the duodenum (\nand\n).\nThe newborn was transferred to our third level reference children's hospital, for a second advice and to provide further care.

General anesthesia was administered and femoral venous catheterization using the Seldinger method was performed. The anesthesiologist staff checked the inguinal ligament and palpated the femoral artery at about 2 cm inferior to the inguinal ligament. The operator punctured the medial skin to the palpated femoral artery. At a depth of 2 cm from the skin, the femoral vein was punctured and venous catheterization was successfully done with a 7 Fr. two-lumen catheter (ARROWgard Blue\u00ae, Arrow International, Reading, PA, USA) on the first attempt. The first surgery, lasting 5 hours and 25 minutes, was uneventful and there were no signs of swelling or petechia around the catheter insertion site postoperation. However, a routine postoperative brain CT revealed an epidural hematoma and emergent removal of the hematoma was accomplished. The total anesthesia time of the second surgery was 3 hours and 15 minutes. During both operations, hemodynamic variables were well maintained, and fluids including 4 units of packed red blood cells were administrated via a femoral venous catheter.\nOn postoperative (post-op) day 1, the femoral catheter was removed and physical compression and compressive dressing on the puncture site were performed. Two hours after removal of the catheter, the patient complained of severe scrotal pain and swelling. Urologic ultrasound and CT () scans in the inguinal area and scrotum showed a large hematoma in the right inguinal area, which extended into the scrotum (2 \u00d7 3 cm within scrotum) via a spermatic cord from the inguinal canal, as well as extravasating contrast within the hematoma suspected of originating from the right common femoral artery.

On palpation, the mass was firmly fixed with the deeper structures. Palpation did not reveal whether the mass was derived from maxillary bones, although a hard structure could be felt inside of the mass. Under sedation with intravenous xylazine hydrochloride (0.01 mg/kg), the calf was examined by computed tomography (CT) scanning using a helical CT device (Pronto SE, Hitachi Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) for preoperative observation of the positional relationship of the mass with deeper structures (the nose and maxillary bones). The mass was demonstrated to be a homogenous and slightly bright gray structure than the neighboring soft tissues within the root of the mass, and included no radiopaque structure (i.e., bone or dent) (Fig. ). Neither osteolysis nor ossification was evident in the maxillary bone near the mass. Three-dimensional (3D) CT revealed that the mass arose cranial than the rostal edge of the maxillary bone and possessed anatomical continuity with the nasal structures (Fig. ). The mass was removed from the basal region by cutting along the gingival mucosa with an electric scalpel soon after the CT examination. The mass had a dual structure comprised of white cartilaginous tissues and soft tissues surrounding a cartilaginous core. The root of the mass extended into the deeper site of the maxillary gingiva toward the nasal cavity, and was removed as deeply as possible.

She had undergone a series of treatment for breast cancer with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy 14 years earlier. Additionally, she had been regularly examined and treated for COP. Concerning her ocular history, she had been diagnosed as having an epiretinal macular membrane on her right eye and received a vitrectomy and phacoemulsification 3 years prior. One year later, her right eye had developed uveitis and secondary glaucoma. The intraocular inflammation was resistant to topical betamethasone administration but decreased spontaneously in 1 year. Despite the uveitis being mostly controlled, the intraocular pressure in both eyes had gradually increased and she was referred to our hospital.\nThe initial ophthalmic examination disclosed a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/50 in the right eye and 20/80 in the left eye. The intraocular pressure was 25 mm Hg in the right and 40 mm Hg in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination demonstrated no sign of uveitis or retinal disease besides pseudophakia in the right eye and a cataract in the left eye. Both eyes showed substantial anterior chamber depth without goniosynechia. The results of the laboratory investigations of serum including angiotensin-converting enzyme, antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were unremarkable despite for the presence of elevated C-reactive protein. Serological analyses indicated that there was no active infection of syphilis, human T-cell lymphoma virus 1, herpes simplex virus or varicella zoster virus. The results of human leukocyte antigen type B testing were positive for B-60 and B-61.

She had no psychosocial history. She did not take any medications. She was a housewife. She lived with her husband and three children in a flat in the city center of Istanbul. She never smoked tobacco and did not consume alcohol. Her vital signs were stable with blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, pulse rate 82/minute, and temperature 36.5 \u00b0C. On neurological examination, there was a limitation of temporal movement in her right eye. There were no signs of paresthesia or hypoesthesia. A general examination showed no other abnormality. Brain MRI showed 34 mm \u00d7 10 mm and 20 mm \u00d7 19 mm masses in her clivus. She was operated on and a pathology examination showed chordoma. Postoperative stereotactic radiotherapy to clivus at a total dose of 24 Gray in one fraction with gamma-knife was performed. In March 2014, she had a recurrence in her clivus and then she underwent another operation. A pathology examination revealed chordoma. She presented with diplopia for 1 month in January 2015. Brain MRI detected a recurrent mass in her clivus and invasion to the pons. She was treated with external cranial radiotherapy for palliative intent. She received a total of 30 Gray to recurrent mass in ten fractions during 10 days. In March 2015, a residual mass in her clivus was seen in MRI. She was started on daily 400 mg of imatinib in April 2015. The best response to imatinib was stable disease.

Severe pain discouraged the patient from using his left hand in daily activities. He had no other complaints and was in good general condition. On physical examination of the hand, the left ring finger was edematous at the proximal interphalangeal joint (fig. ). The finger movement was restricted. His left ring finger measured 80 mm in circumference, while the contralateral healthy finger had a circumference of 55 mm.\nWe performed an X-ray of the rib cage, which showed a lytic lesion of the eighth rib. An X-ray of the left hand showed a lytic bone lesion with the destruction of the bone cortex in the proximal phalanx and a swelling of the surrounding soft tissue (fig. ). A CT scan of the chest showed several suspicious opacities, one in the left lung hilum, a stellar image at the apex of the right lung, and a lytic lesion of the anterior arc of the eighth rib (fig. ). The pneumologist performed a bronchoscopy, but the first biopsies were negative. Then a biopsy of the rib mass identified an infiltration of the parietal pleura and striated muscle tissue by a pulmonary adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated TTF1+, KRAS mutant, BRAF wild type, EGFR wild type, and with no ALK rearrangement. The bone scintigraphy showed multiple bone metastases on the rib cage, the spine, and the left scapula. The patient's left ring finger was very painful. He was given a nonsteroidal analgesic. The pain was morphine resistant. The patient received radiotherapy for his left ring finger in March 2014 (dose of total 30 Gy/10 fractions, 5 fractions/week, 6-MV X-rays with 5-mm bolus). Over the next month, the left ring finger became much less painful. Analgesics were no longer",

She was educated to post-graduate level. She was musical and had learnt to play the piano between the ages of 7 and 11 years, but did not continue playing into adulthood.\nThe patient experienced hearing symptoms coincident with a right hemisphere stroke manifest as sudden-onset weakness and loss of sensation in the left arm and leg associated with nausea, vomiting and collapse. This was felt to be due to a paradoxical embolus associated with a deep vein thrombosis that passed from the right to the left heart through an atrial defect. She reported becoming aware of hearing difficulties on the day of her event.\nShe reported difficulty hearing music through her headphones: the volume was adjusted to the highest setting, but she could only hear part of the music. However, this difficulty was only transitory. Shortly afterwards, she attended a family gathering and quickly realised she was struggling to identify who was speaking. She also reported difficulties processing speech in group situations when there was background noise\u2014which became worse in environments with prominent echo. She also reported finding it difficult to identify emotion in other people's voices and to identify when someone was asking a question based on inflexion.\nShe reported no difficulty recognising musical tunes, but commented that music sounded different after her stroke. Familiar music sounded slow and was frustrating to follow. The last part of a song or lyric appeared to merge into the next. She found it easier to listen to music that was played with a single instrument or only vocals.

His COVID-19 test was positive on the same day. He was managed symptomatically; however, he left against medical advice from the hospital 48 hours later and was instructed to follow the isolation precautions. He continued hemodialysis as an outpatient with COVID-19 isolation and precautions as per the dialysis unit protocol. The patient was supposed to be tested for COVID-19 as per the dialysis unit protocol but did not get the test done. Finally, he got the test done on May 15, 2020, which was inconclusive. He was retested on May 21, 2020, when it came back positive. He was tested again on June 2, 2020, and was negative. The patient continued to have intermittent back pain, nausea, vomiting, cough, and shortness of breath, which were mostly related to non-adherence with dialysis and shortening the dialysis treatment time.\nThe patient was again admitted on August 17, 2020, for headaches and altered mental status. His mother provided pertinent history due to his altered mental status. He had weeklong severe headaches and left-hand weakness. As per the documentation by the emergency department, the patient had altered mental status but gradually became somnolent. Based on the examination by different providers during the emergency department encounter, his motor and sensation abilities were initially grossly intact. The patient eventually became unresponsive and was intubated for airway protection.

He had an otherwise uneventful recovery; however, a GTC was found during routine follow-up 4.5 years after the original subtotal esophagectomy. Endoscopic examination showed a type 0-II c tumor with ulceration, located proximal to the pyloric ring (Figure ). Biopsies were taken, and the histological examination ultimately led to a diagnosis of signet-ring cell carcinoma. Barium swallow was unable to detect the primary tumor, although the shape of the GT exhibited narrowing at the border of the thorax and abdomen (Figure ). Computed tomography was also unable to detect the primary tumor and found no obvious nodal metastasis. The preoperative stage of the GTC was therefore diagnosed as cT1N0M0, Stage I. On the basis of guidelines for treating gastric cancer, ESD was not indicated for the GTC because the lesion was undifferentiated and estimated to be submucosal in depth. All other laboratory values, including tumor markers, were within normal limits.

She underwent a radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo oophorectomy in 1996 due to stage Ib of cervical cancer. She has also had a medical history of anticoagulation due to the pulmonary thromboembolism with deep vein thrombosis in both legs since 2001. However, she had quit her medication for 1 month without doctor's permission prior to this admission. There was a 11 cm diameter of thoracic aortic aneurysm containing mural thrombus with contrast leakage at the descending aorta on pre-procedural CT (). A chronic eccentric embolism on the left pulmonary artery was also found in the CT angiography (). An echocardiography indicated normal systolic function of the left ventricle without any intra-cardiac thrombi. On laboratory study, her anti-phospholipid IgG antibody and the tumor markers of CEA and CA19-9 were within the normal value. A protein C antigen level of the patient was also normal, but the protein S antigen was lower at 44.2% (normal range; 60-150%). Since the size of the patient's aneurysm was very large despite the absence of any symptoms, there might have been a risk of aortic rupture. Therefore, we planned TEVAR for her aneurysm.\nA 300 mg of aspirin and the 600 mg of clopidogrel were administrated orally on the day of the procedure. A Rt. common femoral artery (CFA) was prepared for the 22 Fr large sheath insertion by preclose technique, and the 7 Fr sheath was inserted after puncture via Lt. CFA.

The patient had no other medical conditions.\nOn physical exam, the patient had a 10 cm \u00d7 15 cm warty and friable scrotal mass. He had two fixed voluminous inguinal lymph nodes bilaterally.\nAn abdominal and pelvic computed tomographic (CT) scan, a pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a positron emission tomography (PET) scan were performed. The PET scan revealed increased uptake of the inguino-scrotal mass. Metastatic inguinal and pelvic lymph nodes were identified, the biggest measuring 7 cm on the left inguinal side. There were no other primary lesions noted. There was no distant metastasis.\nMany biopsies were taken from the cutaneous inguinal mass and revealed a dense proliferation of atypical epithelial cells in the dermis extending and ulcerating the epidermis. Numerous mitotic figures and apoptotic cells were observed as well as focal squamous and glandular differentiation. Immunohistochemistry was performed and the tumour was diffusely positive for CK5/6 and CK AE1/AE3. It was also positive for p63 except in the cells bordering the lumen of the glands. GATA3 was positive in a proportion of the tumour cells.\nInitially, our differential diagnosis included a malignant adnexal carcinoma and an adenosquamous carcinoma. Moreover, because of GATA3 positivity, a urothelial origin could not be excluded. Although an adnexal malignant carcinoma cannot be entirely excluded since the whole tumour was not examined pathologically for a residual benign component, the clinical history is negative for transformation of a long-standing tumour.

Ophthalmic examination confirmed reduced visual acuity with only perception of light in the left eye. Neurological examination showed no other neurologic deficit. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a solid mass lesion involving the hypothalamus and the optic chiasm. The lesion was hypointense on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-WI, and showed marked homogenous enhancement after the administration of contrast material []. The patient was operated by the right pterional craniotomy and transsylvian approach. Bulging of the optic chiasm and the site of lamina terminalis were seen. Incision with knife was done on the right side of optic chiasm through the exophytic part of the tumor and tumor evacuation done from inside the chiasm []. Furthermore, resection of the suprachiasmatic part of the tumor was performed and lamina terminalis was opened. Tumor entry sites were planned to minimize the risk of neural injury. Entry to the optic chiasm was performed from the lateral part of the right optic chiasm where tumor was bulging and exophytic with minimal covering neural tissue.

    "original_text": "A sixty-year-old male patient was taken to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) with a diagnostic of poorly differentiated squamous tongue carcinoma, with a four-month evolution period, which had lateralized intraoral pain on the left mandibular edge. The patient has personal smoking records of 100 packets per year and he is a heavy alcohol drinker.\nA clinical examination observed an endophytic growth on the tongue reaching the left jaw and the base of the tongue (). Mouth opening was normal. The lesion was classified as T4 N2 M0 and imaging studies were carried out. The neck computerized tomography (CT) confirmed the existence of a lesion of the neoplastic aspect on the floor of the mouth without microscopic evidence of marrow infiltration. The chest CT did not have pathological findings. In maxillofacial CT, as observed in , a heterogeneous mass can be seen that spreads to the back of the tongue with extension to the floor of the mouth without reaching the sublingual space.\nAn oncological resection with jaw resection, bilateral modified radial lymphatic cervical dissection, and mandibular reconstruction with a fibula free flap was carried out.

Both appeared a few days previous, along with dysphagia. The patient had no other symptoms. The patient was in good health, height and weight were in the normal percentile range, and she presented no medical history, nor allergies. The patient had never been hospitalized, never had a severe or recurrent infection, nor received a blood transfusion. The clinical examination showed a soft painless blue swelling of the left side floor of the mouth. Except for the left submandibular mass, no cervical lymphadenopathy was palpated. Medical imaging, including an ultrasound and magnetic resonance (), was performed confirming the presence of a cystic lesion of 31 \u00d7 31 \u00d7 17 mm. The patient's father was HIV positive, and the mother was HIV negative in 2012. The patient has four brothers, all HIV negative. A preoperative HIV serology was performed, due to the familial context and clinical presentation, and led to the diagnosis of an HIV infection. The patient had 477 CD4 cells/mm and a viral load of 8310 copies/mL at the time of diagnosis. No HIV treatment was prescribed at that time. A marsupialization of the lesion was performed. Unfortunately, relapse of the lesion occurred three months later. The patient benefited from a resection of the cystic lesion and the sublingual gland. The anatomopathological examination of the 4.5 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 1 cm fragment revealed a seromucous salivary gland characterized by canals dilatation, containing mucin and a discreet chronic inflammatory infiltrate without lymphoid formation that could fit in a mucocoele context.

These events induced the man, married and father of an adolescent, to close the express courier business company he owned with a friend, remaining unemployed for a month. After starting to work again as an employee for another haul company, his forgetfulness and difficulties in driving the van persisted, to the extent of forcing him to take a sick leave in January 2019.\nNo family history of neurodegenerative or psychiatric diseases was reported, while other non-neurological conditions of the patient included episodes of asthma during the first years of life and alopecia for the past 16 years. He also reported poor performance at school, making frequent spelling mistakes in writing compositions and showing little interest in school subjects. No sleep disturbances were reported.
