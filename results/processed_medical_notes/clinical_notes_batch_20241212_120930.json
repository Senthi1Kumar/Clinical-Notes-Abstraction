Following the initial diagnosis, the patient was treated with 4 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide (VP-16); unfortunately, dosing information is not available for either drug. This regimen was completed by September 2008 and, at that time, the patient had not received any radiation or systemic therapy other than the initial treatment of carboplatin plus etoposide. The patient's response to this regimen was excellent, with complete regression of the disease. Following completion of the initial treatment, a review of the pathology findings established that the tumor was consistent with infiltrating ductal carcinoma, and that it was triple negative.\nRoutine follow-up appointments took place, and, in November 2009, the patient was diagnosed with a recurrent infiltrating carcinoma of the left breast at the same clinic that had initially diagnosed and treated her. Pathology tests performed at this time revealed a grade III, 2.5-cm carcinoma, although neither of the 2 sentinel lymph nodes showed involvement. In addition, the patient's BRCA1 status was tested, and she was identified as a mutation carrier.

These episodes were confirmed to be hypoglycemia at a local hospital with positive Whipple's triad while awaiting surgery for the aforementioned malignancy. There was some improvement of these symptoms after resection of the tumor; hence, no further evaluation was performed. However, hypoglycemia symptoms recurred in September 2019 and gradually progressed thereafter with increasing frequency and severity, up until 2 weeks, when he started to develop episodes of disorientation and confusion, which prompted him to seek medical attention. There were no episodes of coma or seizures to report, and he denied symptoms of overt liver or renal failure apart from the loss of appetite. He neither had features of clinical depression nor history to suggest abuse of oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin, recreational drugs, or alcohol. He was off from any medication over 3 months before the admission.\nHis past medical history revealed poorly controlled hypertension since mid-2017 which was not properly controlled as he went for employment abroad. According to his medical records, he admitted to a hospital abroad in January 2018, with subacute onset moderate to severe retrosternal chest pain with difficulty in breathing.

Approximately 1 year before presentation at our facility, he underwent a peritoneal biopsy which did not reveal anything abnormal. Over several days, the patient developed acute periumbilical pain and was admitted for work-up of this acute presentation of abdomen pain. The patient had not had this acute periumbilical pain before but had experienced chronic abdominal shooting pain for up to 2 years previously. He reported no cramps, no nausea, no vomiting, and no migration of the pain. The periumbilical pain was a new onset, abrupt continuous sharp feeling of pain that was different from his chronic abdominal discomfort. On physical examination, he was afebrile and had a soft and minimally tender abdomen. Although he had periumbilical pain, it was not exacerbated by palpation, and there was no rebound and no guarding on examination. His bowel sounds were normal. His laboratory tests revealed a normal white cell count, liver function, and chemistry panels.\nThe work-up for this abrupt onset of acute abdominal pain was evaluated by upper gastro-intestinal (GI) endoscopy, radiographic upper GI series, and finally a surgical exploratory laparotomy which revealed no apparent bowel pathology and during which an appendectomy of a grossly normal appearing appendix was performed. All of these procedures revealed normal anatomy of the peritoneum and abdominal organs. During the week of admission for work-up of this abrupt onset of acute abdominal pain, the patient developed sudden, severe lower extremity weakness and an abrupt lower extremity decrease in sensation.\nWithin 48 hours of onset, the patient's physical examination demonstrated a flaccid paraplegia of the lower extremities.

Six months ago, there were no abnormal findings in chest X-ray at that time presented with mild chest pain. At the time of cough with chest pain presentation, chest X-ray showed a about 5 cm sized round mass in left hilar area and computed tomography (CT) scan of chest showed a about 5\u00d74 cm lobulated mass arising superior segmental bronchus in lower lobe with interlobar pulmonary artery invasion (). Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT was revealed only increasing uptake of hilar mass without anywhere active lesion. Brain magnetic resonance (MR) showed no evidence of metastasis. Bronchoscopic finding was a complete obstruction of superior segmental bronchus. Bronchoscopic and CT-guided needle biopsy of the lesion results a histological diagnosis of suggestive sarcoma. The hilar lesion could be considered as the primary malignant tumor, based on clinical findings including CT scan of chest, PET-CT, and brain MR. The patient underwent a left pneumonectomy with a dissection of the regional lymph nodes.\nThe resected tumor was encapsulated, firm, and areas of focal hemorrhage and necrosis with pulmonary arterial invasion by tumor.\nMicroscopically, the tumor was consisted of a pleomorphic and spindle cell proliferation in a storiform pattern with high grade differentiation (). By an immunohistochemical staining, the tumor was positive for CD68, but negative for S-100 protein and desmin. The histological final diagnosis was typical of malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) by the features of microscopic finding and special staining. There was no evidence of regional lymph node metastasis and bronchial and arterial resection margin were negative.\nPostoperative recurrence was developed on pleura in pneumonectomy space during first regular follow-up three months after the operation.

He initially presented with weakness and numbness of the lower extremities. He had been using intravenous heroin and was lying supine on a floor for approximately 24 hours.\nUpon presentation to our emergency department, the patient had pain in his bilateral lower extremities and no appreciable motor function below the level of the knee. He was in mild distress with a temperature of 37\u00b0C, pulse of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 146/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Examination of the lower extremities revealed erythema and tension in the bilateral posterior thigh compartments. In contrast, the medial thigh compartments bilaterally along with all four leg compartments were soft. Gluteal and buttock compartments were soft and compressible bilaterally. Motor strength testing revealed 1/5 strength bilaterally with manual testing of ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, and knee flexion and extension. The patient was found to have bilateral sciatic nerve palsies, with no sensation bilaterally in the tibial nerve, deep and superficial peroneal nerve distributions. Both legs were warm and pink with brisk capillary refill along with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. Provocative testing demonstrated pain with passive range of motion of the knees bilaterally and no pain with passive ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Lab work was significant for a creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) of 231,360 U/L.\nGiven the high suspicion for compartment syndrome, the patient underwent compartment pressure testing via Stryker pressure monitor system. Diastolic blood pressure recording measured 75 mmHg. The right posterior thigh compartment measured 75 mmHg and left posterior thigh compartment measured 30 mmHg. Based on the history and physical examination findings, the patient was diagnosed with bilateral thigh compartment syndrome likely secondary to his recent IVDA",

Earlier that day, she had presented to a local immediate care facility due to a cough that had worsened over the prior two days. She was admitted to the hospital at the immediate care facility due to wheezing and shortness of breath that continued to worsen despite nebulized albuterol, nebulized racemic epinephrine, and subcutaneous epinephrine. Intravenous (IV) ampicillin/sulbactam was also given. The decision was made to transfer the child to a quaternary care facility for further workup and treatment. While in route, an anterior-posterior (AP) radiograph and a lateral chest radiograph (CXR), which had been taken prior to transportation, was reviewed and it revealed a circular foreign body extending from C3 to C6 (Figures and ). This was the patient's first documented radiograph. Upon arrival, the patient had her first evaluation by a pediatric otolaryngologist.\nThe patient's parents reported that the patient had a barking cough and hoarseness that had varied in severity over the last 9 months. She had been diagnosed with recurrent croup. Upon further questioning, the family revealed that the child had a choking event while playing with a rubber band 9 months earlier. She was evaluated in a local emergency department shortly after the choking event and had had 4 to 5 emergency room and/or primary care physician visits over the last 9 months due to the barking cough and hoarse voice.

He was told that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during a thorough examination by his previous physician in July 2011 revealed a mass in his left iliopsoas muscle, and he was examined in our department for the first time in August 2011. The physical findings during the initial examination revealed that both flexion and extension were limited. MRI showed a tumor mass measuring approximately 11 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 cm that extended from the medial aspect of the wing of the left ilium along the iliopsoas muscle to its site of insertion on the femur. The same site was isointense on T1-weighted images (fig. ) and heterogeneous hyperintense on T2-weighted images (fig. ), and it was gadolinium enhanced (fig. ). The tumor was in contact with the ilium, but there was no clear bone invasion. Although left inguinal lymph node enlargement was observed, it was considered to be a reactive lesion. Bone scintigraphy and chest computed tomography (CT) showed no evidence of metastasis, and although a positron emission tomography examination showed fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation in the left inguinal tumor, there was no distant metastasis. Based on the above findings, a malignant soft tissue tumor was suspected. An incisional biopsy was performed for the purpose of making a definitive diagnosis. Histopathologic findings of the biopsy showed round/polygonal tumor cells in a solid or diffuse pattern with moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm and rhabdoid characteristics (fig. ). Immunohistochemical stains were positive for pan-keratin (fig. ) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) (fig. ). As a result, the histopathological diagnosis was proximal-type epithelioid sarcoma.

Liver CT suggested a right-lobe mass of approximately 11 \u00d7 8 cm in size. Enhanced CT showed a cystic mass at the edge of the liver parenchyma, with uneven enhancement during the arterial phase; the density of the lesion was lower than that of the surrounding normal liver parenchyma during the portal and delayed phases, indicating possible hepatic cystadenoma (Fig. A and B). MRCP showed a mass of approximately 10 \u00d7 13 cm in size with high T1 and T2 signals and with multiple nodules on the wall of the right anterior lobe (Fig. C and D). Laboratory tests were largely normal, and liver function was rated Child grade A; thus, the lesion was operable. During the operation, a cystic lesion of approximately 12 \u00d7 12 cm in size was observed in liver segments 5 and 8, directly adjacent to the gallbladder. Thus, resection of liver segments 5 and 8 and the gallbladder was planned. During the operation, the hilum was blocked for 25 minutes. Blood loss was approximately 500 mL, 1500 mL of fluid was infused, and no blood transfusion was given. The cystic fluid was brown and turbid.

He was unable to walk due to the pain and weakness. There was no bowel or bladder incontinence but he had loss of appetite and significant weight loss.\nHe had history of fall and sustained a stable burst fracture of T12.

During follow-up, he developed a kyphotic deformity of which we performed pedicle subtraction osteotomy of T12 a year after the primary injury. He defaulted the follow-up after surgery.\nExamination revealed a posterior midline surgical scar measuring 12cm. There was a mild kyphotic deformity. His hip and knee flexion were weak with a medical research council (MRC) muscle power grading of 3. The ankle and toes had MRC muscle power grading of zero. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was suggestive of an aggressive spinal tumour over T12 with extension to T11 and L1 (). Computed tomography of the lungs revealed no lung metastasis.\nHe underwent posterior extension of fusion from T8-L4 with total vertebrectomy of T11, T12 and L1. Excision of the posterior elements of T11 and L1 then removal of the pedicles of T11 and L1 was done. En bloc tumour removal was attempted but scarring and adhesions to the diaphragm prevented an en bloc removal, so piecemeal vertebrectomy of T11, T12 and L1 and excision of tumour was performed. Three segmental arteries were ligated on the right side to facilitate cage insertion and the bone gap reconstructed with a titanium mesh cage filled with bone cement (). The reconstructed mesh was shorter than the total height of the removed vertebral bodies, as we shortened the spinal column, but not exceeding one vertebral body and two discs height to prevent cord buckling.

At that time, a small \u201cpolyp-like\u201d nodule was found in the left anterior nasal cavity, but neither radiological examination nor biopsy was performed.

As a result, the patient was referred to our hospital for examination and treatment. Physical examination showed that the left anterior nasal cavity was obstructed by a large reddish mass with amount of purulent exudation. The mass filled the left nasal cavity and compressed the nasal septum to the opposite side. There was no defect in visual field test and vision acuity in her eyes. The laboratory results, including blood count, differential, liver and renal function, were within the normal range. There was no weight loss and no palpable lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. Computerized tomographic (CT) scans revealed an irregular, homogeneous mass in the left nasal cavity measuring 1.5 cm\u00d71.0 cm.

Although the cause of his lesions is unclear, given the location of the lesions, their appearance and the patient\u2019s history of HIV, we surmise that they are the possible result of HIV-related vasculopathy associated with CNS toxoplasmosis. His career was in construction, and the onset of his neurological symptoms was associated with a fall through a roof in 2010. His immediate neurological status post-fall remains unknown; however, he reported the onset of multiple subsequent neurological deficits over the following three to four months, including tremor, seizures, gait impairments, left spastic hemiparesis and dysarthria. Subsequent MRI indicated the presence of bilateral thalamic lesions with the left lesion being substantially larger than the right. He first noted tremors of the left ring-finger, which spread throughout his left arm, then gradually involved his right arm. His right arm tremor represented the most active component of is Holmes tremor and displayed components of resting, postural and kinetic tremors. In addition to arm tremor he demonstrated low frequency tremors of the neck and chin. Consistent with the asymmetry of his thalamic lesions, his tremor was more severe on the right-body compared to his left, whereas rigidity symptoms displayed similar severity in bilateral upper and lower extremities. His tremors were refractory to medications including levodopa, propranolol, gabapentin, topiramate and primidone.

One week prior, she presented to another hospital with dyspnea on mild exertion and was advised to return for a chest X-ray if her shortness of breath did not improve. The patient had a past history of dysmenorrhea for several years, along with a history of abdominal pain and fibroids. Her last menstrual period was one week prior to presenting to us.\nOn examination, decreased breath sounds were noted over the base of her right lung, and harsh breath sounds were noted bilaterally. After evaluating the patient in the emergency department, the patient was advised admission. However, the patient declined to be admitted and preferred to be managed as an outpatient the following day. When the patient returned the next day, she was diagnosed with a right-sided pleural effusion and ascites. Consequent to the detection of the pleural effusion, the patient was again advised admission, to which she agreed.\nInvestigations\nPrior to admission, an abdominal ultrasound showed an enlarged uterus, with fibroids and a moderate amount of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis. A gross amount of fluid with diffuse internal echoes in the right pleural cavity was seen as well.\nFollowing the ultrasound findings, chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging of the chest and abdomen were performed, which showed a large, right-sided pleural effusion (Figures -; Video ) with atelectasis (Figure ) and consolidation in the adjacent lung parenchyma (Figure ). The pleural effusion caused a mass effect, resulting in a mild mediastinal shift to the contralateral side.

He was in a hemodynamically stable condition.\nThe chest radiograph revealed a leftward deviation of the cardiac silhouette (). The findings of the electrocardiogram were normal, except for a sinus tachycardia. Given the hemodynamic stability and the availability of an early CT scan, FAST was not performed. A total body CT scan revealed a moderate left anterior pneumothorax, a negligible right pneumothorax, fracture of the middle arch of the 5th, 6th, seventh and eighth left ribs and a fracture of the sternal manubrium. However, the heart silhouette shifted on the left pleural space, demonstrating rupture of the pericardium complicated with left cardiac luxation (). There were no cardiac cavity or great vessel strangulation signs. Moreover in the abdomen, there were contusions of segments 4 and 7 of the liver of 10 and 18 mm respectively, as well as a lower polar splenic contusion and an intraperitoneal effusion of medium abundance. These hepatic and splenic contusions were managed conservatively.\nThe diagnosis of left cardiac luxation was made, and surgery was then performed on an emergency basis.\nEchocardiography was performed in the operating room just before the surgery and was normal, notably there was no valvular injuries.\nSurgical exploration via a midline sternotomy revealed the heart herniated into the left pleural cavity through a large tear (15 cm) of the left pericardium bound by the left phrenic nerve and the left pulmonary veins ().\nUndertaking the repair was challenging.

    "original_text": "A 78-year-old man presented with bilious sputum after several rounds of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). He was diagnosed with HCC 13 years ago, underwent central lobectomy of the liver, and received 3 rounds of TACE and 5 rounds of RFA, which extended until 8 years ago. Four years ago, the patient was hospitalized for a liver abscess, which was treated with percutaneous abscess drainage. Upon presentation, his symptoms included greenish sputum, as well as an irritating cough, which he had experienced for the past 3 months and which decreased immediately after insertion of a percutaneous transhepatic bile drainage (PTBD) catheter. Bronchobiliary fistula was diagnosed upon visualization of a fistula tract between the biliary tract and the right lower lobe bronchus by cholangiography through the PTBD catheter (), and fiberoptic bronchoscopy also showed biliary secretion from the RB8 bronchus in response to a saline injection through the PTBD catheter (). Although biliptysis decreased after PTBD catheter insertion, the symptom recurred after 2 months, when we attempted to remove the catheter after clamping. Considering the surgical risk and the poor overall condition of the patient, non-surgical treatment was initially proposed; however, drainage via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography failed, and embolization through the PTBD catheter was not possible.\nTherefore, a surgical approach to treat the bronchobiliary fistula was necessary, but fistulectomy through an abdominal approach was impossible due to severe adhesions near the fistula tract and the area of the liver dome. We therefore planned fistula closure by repair of the diaphragm via a thoracic approach and reinforcement with omentopexy. First, a laparotomy incision was made and sufficient omental tissue was mobilized, after which the omentum was pulled up through the substernal tunnel.

She also complained of pain of left side of the lower jaw during the lateral excursion. Her symptoms started 10 days back for which she underwent extraction of mandibular second molar on the left side. This failed to improve her symptoms and then she reported to our institution for further investigation. She was not on any medication and there was no history of any recent trauma to the jaws. Her medical history revealed that the patient had undergone a radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection 4 years back along with radiotherapy for invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast. The patient had no complaints thereafter for the past 4 years. No relevant intraoral findings were detected. Regional lymph nodes were not palpable.\nThe radiographic examination with panoramic radiograph revealed radiolucency with ill-defined borders measuring 15 mm \u00d7 10 mm apical and distal to 37 area []. An incisional biopsy was taken under local anesthesia. Sections from the biopsied material, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, revealed a delicate to moderately collagenous stromal tissue showing the presence of cords of tumor cells with pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei and moderate amount of cytoplasm []. Cells were also arranged in irregular nests and glandular islands []. These histological results supported evidence of metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma.\nSubsequently, a bone scintigraphic image of the whole body was obtained.

    "original_text": "The patient is a 65-year-old man referred to the senior author's clinic with persistent right shoulder pain and severely restricted range of motion approximately 10 months after a primary anatomic TSA. The indication for the primary procedure was longstanding severe osteoarthritis with an intact cuff. The Exactech Equinoxe (Exactech Inc., Gainesville, FL) shoulder system was used for the index procedure, with a pegged, caged glenoid (model number 314-02-04). Utilizing a standard deltopectoral approach, a 15 mm press fit humeral stem with a 47 \u00d7 18 humeral head, offset with a 4.5 mm replicator plate and a large beta curvature, pegged glenoid with cage was implanted. No complications had been noted at the time of the primary procedure. The patient had an uneventful, atraumatic postoperative course, but he failed to progress. His range of motion was severely restricted to about 15 degrees in all planes 8 months after surgery. A CT arthrogram was ordered to evaluate if there was a rotator cuff tear but instead found that the glenoid component had dissociated and was sitting posterior to the humeral head (). The polyethylene glenoid component had disengaged from its metallic cage and one of the three metallic peg caps, which remained seated in the glenoid. Close inspection of the postoperative films, as early as those immediately following surgery in the postanesthesia care unit, confirmed that the glenoid had in fact failed acutely ().\nThe patient was subsequently referred to the senior author and underwent revision TSA. The glenoid component was retrieved from the posterior capsule. The component failure occurred at the interface between one of the pegs and its metallic cap as well as at the cage component, which had disengaged from the polyethylene ().

The patient had a history of hypertension and left renal urolithiasis. CT showed a heterogeneous left upper pole renal tumor (5.3 cm in diameter). A laparoscopic radical nephrectomy was performed in May 2008. Left adrenalectomy and lymph node dissection were not performed because the CT scan showed no adrenal gland invasion or lymphadenopathy. The histological evaluation of the tissue revealed a clear cell renal cell carcinoma and negative surgical margins (pathological stage, T2N0M0). Three years after nephrectomy, following a cerebrovascular accident, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score changed from 0 to 2. No tumor recurrence (CT scan was performed every 6 months) was found until 51 months later. A CT scan detected two nodules in the renal fossa (1.8 and 0.9 cm, respectively). Retroperitoneal exploration confirmed recurrent clear cell carcinoma with microscopically positive surgical margins. Lymph node dissection was not performed because of severe adhesion around the aorta. Lymph nodes that could be detected by palpation were not identified during the surgery. Four months after excision, an abdominal CT showed a nodule (1.6 cm) over the right adrenal gland. At that time, tumor target therapy was not covered by the national health insurance in Taiwan. Therefore, because of economic reasons, the patient could not afford the treatment until 2013. A repeat CT evaluation confirmed the disease progression of the adrenal metastasis (2.1 cm). The patient was treated with sunitinib (37.5 mg/d) for 4 weeks, but the treatment was discontinued because of gastrointestinal side effects and fatigue.

    "original_text": "A 54-year-old gravida 2 para 2 Japanese woman visited her local hospital, complaining of fever and left vulvar pain over a 2-month period. She had a past medical history of appendicitis at 13 years of age, erythema nodosum at 20 years of age, and hypertension diagnosed at 50 years of age. Her menopause occurred at 53 years of age. The initial examination revealed a 10 \u00d7 6 mm, firm, ulcerative mass on the inner side of the left labium minorum (Fig. ). A vulvar abscess was suspected at the initial visit, but treatment with antibiotics was not effective. SCC was strongly suspected by a subsequent needle biopsy, and she was referred to our hospital for further treatment. Upon admission, her physical examination revealed an ulcerative mass on the left side of the vulva that had increased in size to 31 \u00d7 24 mm. Our patient underwent a diagnostic workup that included magnetic resonance imaging, revealing that the primary lesion did not involve the urethra or anus (Fig. ). Neither inguinal lymphadenopathy nor distant metastases were seen on computed tomography (CT). With a preoperative diagnosis of vulvar SCC, our patient underwent radical local excision and bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy. Histopathological examination found eccrine porocarcinoma with a depth of invasion of more than 20 mm; marked vascular invasion was present. The inguinal lymph nodes were negative for metastatic disease, and the surgical margins of the resected lesion were also negative. Our patient was diagnosed with stage IB disease (T1bN0M0; International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 2008). To prevent local recurrence, she underwent adjuvant radiation therapy for the pelvis, bilateral inguinal area, and vulva (50.4 Gy/28 Fr) with concurrent administration of weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m2) for five cycles.

He did not give any history of trauma nor there was any history of tuberculosis. Initially he did not have urinary retention nor there was any sensory symptoms. He did not complain of shortness of breathing.\nOn examination he was found to have asymmetric flaccid paralysis of bilateral lower limbs with power grade one to two. Reflexes were diminished bilaterally and Babinski sign was equivocal. Examination of optic fundi and cranial nerves were normal. There was no demonstrable sensory level and joint position sense was initially preserved. Upper limbs were neurologically normal. Respiratory movements and sphincter function were preserved. Depending on initial findings a clinical diagnosis of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome was suspected and he was closely observed for the development of respiratory paralysis with monitoring of forced vital capacity and oxygen saturation.\nOn the fifth day of onset of symptoms his weakness worsened with additional flaccid paralysis of upper limbs and neck muscles. He was catheterized for acute retention of urine. Patient was urgently transferred to a high dependency unit but he did not develop respiratory paralysis necessitating ventilator support. Later he developed bilateral spastic paraparesis and positive Babinski sign with mild paraesthesia of lower limbs.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 65-year-old male who presented with a swelling of the posterior surface of the proximal third of his left leg. His prior history included a prolonged stay in hospital for treatment of bacterial endocarditis, when two mitral valve replacement operations were performed. He had also previously undergone two abdominal operations to treat an intestinal tumor and one varicose veins surgery.\nPhysical examination revealed a pulsating mass in the posterior region of the proximal third of the left leg. Femoral, popliteal, and dorsal pedal pulses were palpable and normal in both lower limbs. The posterior tibial artery pulse was absent, whereas the posterior tibial artery pulse was palpable in the right lower limb.\nMagnetic resonance angiography showed a saccular dilatation in the tibioperoneal trunk with a 4.4 cm diameter, at the level of the origin of the posterior tibial artery. The posterior tibial artery was also occluded ( ). Investigation was supplemented with laboratory tests (inflammatory activity tests, coagulation tests, and complete blood cell count), which all returned normal results, in addition to blood cultures, which were negative.\nHaving ruled out other probable etiologies and active infections, in view of the history of bacterial endocarditis, it was decided to perform a less invasive treatment, considering the inflammatory/infectious pathophysiology and the size and site of the pseudoaneurysm.

Emergency medical services were called at the nursing home and the patient was reportedly hypoxic with oxygen saturation in the 70s on room air with subsequent development of agitation and lethargy after the seizure. The patient was transferred to an outside hospital's emergency department (ED), where additional tonic-clonic activity was noted. She subsequently developed hypotension with a blood pressure of 52/36 mmHg that was refractory to crystalloid intravenous fluid resuscitation. Central venous catheter (CVC) was placed and norepinephrine was started for persistent hypotension.

The patient was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care facility cardiac intensive care unit for evaluation of cardiogenic shock.\nUpon arrival, the patient was alert and following commands, but disoriented.

The implant used was a NexGen PS knee prosthesis (Zimmer, Warsaw, Indiana, USA) with a tibial component size of 4, a femoral component size of D, and a polyethylene insert 10 mm in thickness. No problem was reported during the follow-up examination, and the patient was able to perform normal life activities for the next nine years.\nIn March 2008, while rising from a chair, she felt a sudden pain and instability in her left knee. After this acute event she was unable to bear weight on her left knee, and was thus forced to use crutches. On physical examination she presented a mild effusion of the knee, a flexion of 90\u00b0, and knee hyperextension. The joint presented signs of both anteroposterior and varus to valgus instability. X-ray examinations showing the anteroposterior view of the knee did not indicate any remarkable alteration in polyethylene wear, while the lateral view showed a hyperextension of the tibia with a posterior subluxation of the femur (Figure ). The hypothesis of post breakage was thus made.\nOur patient underwent diagnostic knee arthroscopy and was scheduled to have her polyethylene insert changed.

The patient complained about pain, of score 9 (on a scale of 1\u201310; 1 being normal 10 being most severe), around the right medial thigh and the pain intensified when he stands or walks for a long time and complains about abnormal walking posture. This situation was accompanied by lateral hip joint pain: the hip joint was unable to adduct and sometimes the pain can be felt at the knee joint if severe enough. It was also accompanied by pain during micturition which however, was relieved after rest. The CT scan showed bilateral hip joint degenerative changes, oedema at the region of the right inguinal hernioplasty and encapsulated effusion at the right pelvic cavity (Fig. ). He was diagnosed with neuralgia after right inguinal hernioplasty. When he was admitted to our hospital, local anaesthetics were used at two points: one just above the right pubic tubercle and the other 2 fingers above the right inguinal ligament and medial to the right anterior superior iliac spine. The pain was alleviated temporarily for just 2 hours. Conservative regimen which included pain killer Tramadol failed. He underwent partial neurectomy under general anaesthesia based on his right to autonomy. During the surgery, the spermatic cord was freed, and the mesh was visible. Modified Kugel mesh procedure was carried out in the previous surgery during which 4 sutures over the transversalis fascia were stitched. The mesh had adhesion with the surrounding tissues, with unclear boundaries. The mesh was exposed and right iliohypogastric nerve was observed on the superficial surface of the mesh.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) was diagnosed on core needle biopsy; thus, mastectomy was considered necessary. As the patient desired to undergo immediate breast reconstruction, she was referred to our department.

The cancer was pathologically diagnosed as DCIS. Postoperative hormone therapy was continued at a nearby medical facility. At an outpatient visit three years and eight months after surgery, a tumor measuring 5 mm was detected by palpation at the lower right region of the right breast and a tumor shadow was identified on ultrasound. Fine-needle aspiration cytology indicated the possibility of C4 local recurrence. Thus, we performed enucleation of the lesion, and a subsequent pathological examination confirmed that the tumor was invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) with the ductal spread. In addition to the enucleated tumor, a contrast-enhanced lesion extended from the upper exterior area to just below the nipple on MRI. The patient was diagnosed with multiple cancer recurrences in the reconstructed breast. As the patient desired to undergo autologous breast reconstruction again, extensive extirpation of the nipple-areola, breast skin including the buried DIEP flap and initial breast reconstruction with an anatomical tissue expander (TE) were performed at another hospital ().
