In an effort to control his hypothermic episodes he was treated with chlorpromazine.\nThe electrocardiogram (ECG) made by the paramedics on arrival demonstrated VF, which was successfully terminated with three external defibrillator shocks. At return of spontaneous circulation the ECG revealed a sinus bradycardia of 40/min with a normal heart axis, a first-degree AV block and Osborn waves with normal QT interval lengths (Figure ). Physical examination demonstrated a body temperature of 28.7\u00b0C. The echocardiography at admission revealed no abnormalities. The cardiac arrest was attributed to VF caused by the hypothermia since other possible causes, such as ischaemia, structural heart diseases, and electrolyte disorders, were excluded.

Initial diagnostic bronchoscopy revealed no endobronchial lesion. She was treated under the respiratory and infectious diseases' teams with decortication and antibiotics which resulted in marked clinical improvement.

    "original_text": "History of the presenting complaint\nThe patient was a 34-year-old male immigrant to the US from Asia who was admitted to the medical floor of a community hospital for the management of his medical problems. He had experienced a recurrent history of anxiety and mild somatic symptoms for the past five years. He reported sleeping difficulties, panic attacks, ruminative worries, muscle tension, body weakness, and chest discomfort. The patient had a prior psychiatric history and hospitalization for anxiety and depression. He had been admitted for anxiety and depression in a free-standing health facility five years ago and had been treated with medications. He had been prescribed sertraline and quetiapine but had self-discontinued because of tolerability issues. He had continued to be anxious with mild somatic symptoms. The patient denied any manic or psychotic symptoms or any neurological symptoms. The patient also denied any suicidal or homicidal ideations. He had no history of substance use or alcohol intake. He had a family history of anxiety disorder, described as an obsessive-compulsive disorder in his mother. In 2019, he had consulted a physician who had performed an extensive medical workup. All test results were unremarkable; he was reassured and his symptoms improved. During the two to three weeks prior to the current presentation, his anxiety and somatic symptoms had recurred and had subsequently worsened. He was then admitted for further investigation.\nExamination\nThe mental status examination revealed a young man who was neat and well-groomed. He was cooperative, calm, and made appropriate eye contact. His speech was normal. He described his mood as anxious and his affect was constricted. His thought process was normal and linear.

    "original_text": "A 34-year-old- male patient, is a known case of advanced keratoconus in the left eye, for which he underwent deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (LK) 2 years ago. The patient had quiet post-operative course and all sutures were removed 8 months after the surgery with BCVA of 2030 but eventually his vision started to decrease to a BCVA of 20400 at presentation. Upon examination, he was found to have quiet conjunctiva. Examination of the cornea showed suture-less corneal graft with sub-epithelial non-vascularized elevated corneal opacity that was more prominent in the temporal aspect of the graft measuring about 2.5 \u00d7 3 mm with faint smooth borders. The nasal aspect of the opacity was less dense compared to the temporal one with sparing of the visual axis. Otherwise, the graft was relatively clear with no evidence of underlying edema (a).\nTopographically, there was an irregular corneal surface on the sagittal curvature map due to massive flattening effect caused by the corneal opacity temporally with total anterior astigmatism of 16 diopters, also there is evident anterior elevation corresponding to the area of opacity. on pachymetry map there was marked thickening at the area of the opacity temporally (b).\nThe patient was counseled regarding the surgical option for visual rehabilitation of his condition and he was offered simple peeling in the minor operating room under topical anesthesia, which was done in a similar fashion as in case 1 with no complications.

Through intraoral clinical examination, a fistula of the buccal mucosa in correspondence of apex of right maxillary lateral incisor was found (1.2) []. The response to the electric pulp sensibility test of the right upper canine and the lateral and the central incisor was positive. The 1.2 appeared morphologically normal except for a deep pit on the lingual surface []. Through periapical radiography, the dilated and amorphous central area was observed in the crown of 1.2, due to inner presence of a wide radiopaque development. The latter occupied the coronal space and got over the enamel cement junction, enclosing a radiolucent space that communicates with the periodontal space of the middle third of the root []. The fistulography, performed through the insertion of a gutta-percha cone into the oral fistula and sinus tract, revealed the impact of gutta-percha's tip against the half of the lateral incisor root surface neighboring a radiolucent area. The radiographic diagnosis showed a DI of 1.2 [Figure and ]. The aim of the therapy was to try the endodontic treatment. The patient was informed about the diagnosis and the treatment plan; then, the agreement was signed by an informed consent form. After the administration of local anesthesia, under \u00d720, the pulp chamber of 1.2 was opened and the invagination orifice of malformation was localized []. Subsequently, the design of the cavity was finished to surround the profile of the malformation. The DI appeared as a rounded shape malformation into the dental chamber, surrounded by vital and bloody pulp [].

She had a past history of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and was treated with prednisolone (40 mg/day) 3 months before presenting at our hospital. Her bone mineral density in the hip had a T-score of \u22124.7, and bisphosphonate and vitamin D were initiated to treat osteoporosis. She underwent computed tomography (CT) and was diagnosed as having a left vertical sacral fracture and treated conservatively. Three weeks after her initial diagnosis of sacral fracture, her low back pain worsened and she started to have radiating left posterior thigh pain with symptoms of stress urinary incontinence, constipation, and loss of anal sensation.\nOn examination, she had weakness of dorsiflexion of her left ankle and flexion of both great toes, in which the muscular power was grade 3/5 and 4/5, respectively, as measured with manual muscle testing (MMT). Sensation to pinprick on her S2 receptive field was impaired. Lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging using a short inversion time inversion recovery (STIR) sequence revealed an H-shaped fracture in the sacrum, but there were no abnormal findings such as spinal stenosis in her lumbar spine potentially explaining for her neurological symptoms (). Repeated CT demonstrated slightly aggravated displacement of the sacral fracture compared with previous CT ().\nWe consulted a urologist, and the patient was diagnosed as having stress incontinence because of poor function of pelvic floor muscles or the sphincter. However, we speculate that both the weakness of dorsiflexion of the ankle and great toes and loss of anal sensation could be attributed to SIF and recommended that she undergo surgery.

    "original_text": "In February 2020, a healthy 48-year-old woman employed in housework began to complain of low back pain that worsened in June and July. She was not taking any medications and had no history of conditions such as autoimmune diseases, diabetes, pulmonary disease, tumors, trauma, or acupuncture. Initially, her low back pain occurred after carrying heavy objects and was paroxysmal. At that time, a local doctor performed lumbar computed tomography (CT). The results were normal and the patient was diagnosed with lumbar muscle strain and treated with analgesics. Her pain persisted. When her low back pain worsened with no improvement in a supine position, magnetic resonance imaging was performed and showed multiple nodular abnormal signals in the thoracolumbar spine and accessories, lumbar 3-sacral 1 disc degeneration, and swelling (). Positron emission CT revealed bone lesions with increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the sternum, left clavicle, multiple ribs, and multiple vertebral bodies of the spine and pelvis along with increased density and some bone destruction. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) was approximately 7.0 (). Multiple hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes showed increased FDG uptake. The maximum SUV was approximately 7.3 ().\nClinicians initially considered these lesions to represent multiple bone metastases from a distant cancer. However, bone marrow biopsy showed extremely reduced bone marrow hyperplasia, with no immature cells, megakaryocytes, or tumor cells. In August, the patient was transferred to another hospital. Bone radionuclide scanning showed abnormal radioactivity concentration in the sternum, right 5-7 anterior ribs, multiple thoracic vertebrae, and multiple lumbar vertebrae (). Clinicians still considered bone metastases as the most probable diagnosis. The patient visited our hospital for further examination.\nUpon admission, her vital signs were normal.

The mass was mildly painful and enlarged over one year. This patient had a family tree consisting of 2 generations above and 1 generation below compiled during her visit with the Clinical Genetics team. The family cancer history was notable for a paternal grandfather with prostate cancer at age 80, a maternal uncle with prostate cancer at age 72, and a maternal grandmother with melanoma at age 60. There were no cancers at an early age, sarcomas, leukemias, lymphomas, nor malignancies pathognomonic for inherited predisposition syndromes.). Approximately one month prior to diagnosis, she was hospitalized for management of pneumonia; imaging studies were not performed and she was treated with antibiotics and a weeklong pulse of glucocorticosteroids. Following ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration showing a spindle cell neoplasm, a MRI demonstrated an enhancing intra-muscular mass measuring 4.9 cm in maximal diameter. She underwent en bloc resection of the mass with pathology consistent with high-grade spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma with high mitotic rate, negative margins, and negative local lymph nodes. During staging imaging, she was found to have a hypermetabolic 1.4 cm left anterior mediastinal perivascular thoracic lymph node on baseline PET scan (SUV = 6.6). As the presence of a distant metastasis would increase her stage from Stage 2 to Stage 4, with a resultant significant change in both her therapy and prognosis, she underwent excision of this mediastinal mass which revealed a distinct primary tumor, DLBCL. Given the simultaneous occurrence of two rare and pathophysiologically distinct malignancies, each tumor was sequenced using MSK-IMPACT, a hybridization capture-based next-generation DNA sequencing assay of exons of 410 genes recurrently mutated in solid tumors [] (Fig. ). Her rhabdomyosarcoma was negative for FOXO1 gene rearrangement and found to have a somatic alteration in NF1. Her DLBCL had multiple somatic mutations",

His past medical history was significant for severe dementia requiring hospitalizations, bradycardia requiring a pacemaker, carotid artery disease, and hypertension. He was a non-smoker who drank alcohol occasionally. Imaging that included a CT scan identified an enlarging left cervical lymph node with central necrosis, measuring 3 cm. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the lymph node was positive for squamous cell carcinoma (HPV testing not performed). Flexible nasopharyngoscopy could not identify the primary site of disease. A follow-up PET scan again identified a 33 mm \u00d7 30 mm left level II lymph node, standardized uptake value (SUV) 12.5, and a 25 mm \u00d7 13 mm right level II lymph node, SUV 4.3. There were no other areas of FDG avidity. He was staged cT0N2cM0 (stage IVA) and was referred to radiation oncology to discuss treatment options. At the time of presentation, he was in an acute rehabilitation facility for progressive dementia and antibiotics for a recent bacteremia.\nGiven his severe dementia, it was concluded he would not tolerate standard head and neck treatment. Further workup, including directed biopsies and tonsillectomy, was also declined given his high perioperative risks. Therefore, he was treated with SBRT to 2500 cGy in five treatments given daily (500 cGy per treatment), with no concurrent systemic sensitizer. The treatment field included the enlarging left cervical lymph node encompassing levels II/III, which was limiting his head movements. During treatment, he had some response in the left neck with resolution of the palpable lymph node. He did not develop any notable toxicity from treatment, including dermatitis, mucositis, or esophagitis. The plan was to return and treat the right cervical lymph node as well, however, his dementia rapidly progressed following treatment and he soon entered hospice care",

Initial diagnostic bronchoscopy revealed no endobronchial lesion. She was treated under the respiratory and infectious diseases' teams with decortication and antibiotics which resulted in marked clinical improvement. Follow-up imaging showed a persistent right hilar mass, necessitating a repeat diagnostic bronchoscopy and biopsy. This revealed a non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) adenocarcinoma which was EGFR and ALK negative.\nBaseline staging imaging revealed that she had metastatic disease with a right lung primary lesion, mediastinal nodes, and adrenal, frontal skull bone, and left pelvic bone metastases (T4N2M1c). She underwent an FDG-PET scan as part of her staging investigations in June 2017, revealing an area of intense heterogenous FDG-PET avidity in the sigmoid colon. This was suspicious for a metastatic deposit or a complication secondary to diverticular disease (). However, a colonoscopy done 6 months prior had been normal. A CT scan was performed which demonstrated a focal area of thickening of the sigmoid colon (); however, given the recent colonoscopy findings, the possibility of malignancy was deemed less likely in this situation.\nThe patient had minimal comorbidities and palliative systemic treatment, including radiation, was organised. She proceeded to carboplatin plus gemcitabine chemotherapy and completed 4 cycles in September 2017. She received palliative radiation to the right frontal bone and left pelvis metastatic deposits. She was then commenced on maintenance pemetrexed chemotherapy in October 2017.\nIn March 2018, she had a repeat colonoscopy, which revealed two polyps and evidence of diverticulosis in the sigmoid and descending colon.

The patient gave informed consent for the publication of her case. She was transferred to our urological clinic because of an incidentally identified heterogenous tumor in the right retroperitoneal cavity, which was 4.5 \u00d7 3.9 cm in size, and causing right hydronephrosis (Fig. ). A subsequent CT scan (Fig. A and B) revealed heterogeneous enhancement over the right retroperitoneum. The differential diagnoses included gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), carcinoid tumor, neurogenic tumor, metastasis, lymphadenopathy, or another rare tumor. No remarkable symptoms were noted by the patient prior to surgery. Laboratory studies, including tests for serum creatinine, amylase, lipase, bilirubin, alanine, aspartate aminotransferases, and urine analysis were all within normal ranges. We suggested a further MRI scan, but the patient asked for surgical intervention as soon as possible.\nWe created a subcostal incision, and the retroperitoneal tumor was found medial to the right upper third ureter, lateral to the duodenum, and above the inferior vena cava. One draining vein into the right renal vein, and another 2 feeding arteries arising from the renal artery were noted. It was not possible to clearly identify the gonadal vessel within the operative field. In addition, a slight adhesion was noted between the tumor, hydroureter, and second portion of the duodenum area.\nGross examination of the resection specimen (Fig. ) revealed a tan and elastic tumor consisting of a tissue fragment with focal hemorrhaging and an elastic consistency. Microscopically, the sections revealed a vascular tumor, composed of lobulation of proliferating capillaries within a delicate or loose fibrous stroma.

    "original_text": "A 55-year-old male with past medical history of congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 30%, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, and alcohol abuse, presented with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain. Admission vitals were stable with the significant except oxygen saturation of 70% on room air. Labs on admission were significant for lactic acid of 5.3 mmol/L (), Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), and subtherapeutic INR of 1.5 on Coumadin. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine use. CT scan of the abdomen was initially unremarkable. The patient was subsequently admitted to the ICU for severe acute hypoxic respiratory failure with potential for decompensation and clinical suspicion of mesenteric ischemia given his subtherapeutic INR in the setting of atrial fibrillation along with sudden onset of abdominal pain and elevated lactic acid without a clear cause. Cocaine abuse may have also been a contributing factor to sudden ischemia.

    "original_text": "A 42-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with the complaints of weakness, pain and numbness in all extremities that had lasted for 4 months, and a 10-year history of persistent neck pain. Her pain was mainly in the suboccipital area and radiated to the right retroauricular region. Her symptoms increased gradually with time. Her medical history revealed that she had fallen from a wall onto a concrete ground 10 years earlier and hit her head. Since then, she had neck pain exaggerated by motion. Various medical treatments were attempted without a clear diagnosis. Previous radiological examinations were unavailable. Upon admission, the neurological examination revealed spastic quadriparesis (in 3/5 muscle strength) and hypoesthesia below the C2 level. The deep tendon reflexes were hyperactive in all extremities. Clonus was elicited at both ankles and knees with bilateral extensor plantar responses. An evaluation of the severity of myelopathy using the Japan Orthopedic Association (JOA) scale gave a score of 10 out of 18. A lateral cervical radiogram revealed a hypertrophic lesion in the posterior arch of the first vertebra (). Computed tomography (CT) revealed bony outgrowth from the right anterior aspect of the posterior arch of C1 (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of a homogenous irregular contoured bony mass, compressing the spinal cord with increased intensity, indicating myelopathy (). The adjacent structures appeared to be normal. A skeletal survey for osteogenic tumors revealed no other lesions.\nPosterior decompression with a laminectomy of C1 was undertaken. The right aspect of the posterior arch of C1 was removed slowly, allowing the intended dura to expand ( and ).

The endoscopic examination revealed a circumferential tumor with ulceration in the cervical esophagus. Biopsies obtained during the endoscopy indicated squamous cell carcinoma. Contrast-enhanced CT showed extensive tumor growth with suspected tracheal invasion and enlarged lymph nodes extending from the cervical region to the upper mediastinum. FDG-PET/CT revealed abnormal FDG accumulation in the primary lesion (SUV max: 23.1) and lymph nodes (SUV max: 5.45) from the cervical to upper mediastinal region (Fig. ). However, it was difficult to determine whether the multiple lymphadenopathy was benign or metastatic because of her past medical history of sarcoidosis. Therefore, and also for the purpose of preserving the larynx, we initiated definitive chemoradiotherapy. The patient was administered 2 cycles of 45 mg cisplatin and 700 mg 5-fluorouracil with 60 Gy/30 fr radiation therapy over 2 months. In each cycle, 8 mg dexamethasone was administered to prevent side effects of chemotherapy. After completing the chemoradiotherapy, we observed complete disappearance of FDG uptake in the primary cancer in the esophagus, and only a slight reduction in FDG uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes (SUV max: 3.26; Fig. ), which indicated that the lymph nodes were affected by sarcoidosis. The primary lesion of the esophagus relapsed 3 months later. Then, the patient underwent thoracoscopic and laparoscopic total laryngopharyngoesophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction via the posterior mediastinal route. The pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the cervical esophagus. The resected lymph nodes demonstrated no tumor metastasis. However, some lymph nodes showed granulomatous reactions and contained several small epithelioid cell granulomas (Fig. ), suggesting the presence of sarcoidosis. The final stage was determined as pT2N0M0, pStage IB (UICC 7th). The patient was discharged 27 days after surgery. Contrast-enhanced CT performed 6 months after surgery showed no tumor recurrence.

Initially, risperidone up to 2 mg/dL and a continuous perfusion of clonazepam was administrated, with no response. Further treatment with tetrabenazine 25 mg twice a day was necessary for improvement of the movements in the next few days.\nMR imaging of the brain was performed 2 days after the second admission showing right basal ganglia hyperintensity on T1-weighted sequences and fairly normal signal intensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences ().
