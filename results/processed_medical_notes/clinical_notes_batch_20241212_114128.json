Additionally, he developed left facial weakness 5 days prior to hospital presentation consistent with peripheral VII nerve palsy evaluated by his primary care physician. The patient's history was significant for a high fever, headache and generalized body malaise 4 weeks prior to admission. Based on the history of constitutional symptoms, peripheral facial nerve palsy and endemic occurrence of Lyme disease, B. burgdorferi antibody testing was conducted. Serologic testing for antibodies to B. burgdorferi was conducted following the two-tier strategy. Both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot assay were positive. The patient denied other extra-neurological manifestations of Lyme disease, such as arthralgia or erythema migrans, and had no known history of a tick bite. Treatment with minocycline 100 mg twice a day for positive Lyme antibody was initiated. On hospital admission, his neurological examination was significant for left peripheral facial nerve palsy and subtle sensory level to below T7 dermatome to temperature. Strength was normal along with other sensory modalities. Due to the severity, persistence and abrupt worsening of the patient's back pain despite conservative measures and analgesics, a lumbar and thoracic MRI study without contrast was obtained.

    "original_text": "A 9-year-old female patient reported to the Department of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry, Yenepoya Dental College, Mangalore, after sustaining an uncomplicated crown fracture to her maxillary left central incisor while playing about 24 hours ago.\nThe fractured tooth fragment was recovered by the patient at the site of the injury and she had kept it in an empty box. Clinical examination revealed that the teeth had fracture of the incisal angle involving the enamel and dentin []. The fractured part of the tooth was intact, with some crack and craze lines \n[]. No abnormal mobility of the injured tooth was recorded and the surrounding tissues were healthy.\nA periapical radiograph showed that the root formation was complete and there were no other injuries.

On day 9, his clinical course was complicated by a pulmonary hemorrhage, requiring re-intubation.

The chest radiograph showed extensive bilateral pulmonary interstitial emphysema, with the left side more extensively involved in comparison to the right. A hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus was treated by intravenous paracetamol. The baby's condition did not improve, and he was selectively intubated into his right main bronchus. The position of the endotracheal tube was radiologically confirmed, allowing the right lung to be oscillated while the left lung was rested. The baby was nursed on his left side for a period of 36 hours, after which the endotracheal tube was retracted into the trachea and secured in that position. The baby's ventilatory status subsequently improved, allowing for extubation on day 7 after the relapse. On day 28 of life, he presented with severe stridor, requiring re-intubation.

Examination of the patient confirmed a single, live intrauterine pregnancy of 33 gestational weeks. A widespread erythematous rash was also evident, with tense fluid-filled blisters accompanied by severe itching. The patient indicated these symptoms had begun two weeks previously. The patient was referred to the dermatology polyclinic, where examination showed erythematous maculae scattered over the arms, legs, trunk, and neck (Figures , , , , and ), some with burst and crusted tense blisters on them. The patient's personal history was unremarkable. Routine hemogram and biochemical tests produced normal results, and vitamin B12, folic acid, thyroid hormones, and antibody levels were all within normal ranges. Anti-BP 180-NC16 could not be obtained because this test could not be carried out in the biochemical laboratory of our hospital. Subepidermal disintegration was detected by means of punch biopsy (). Direct immunofluorescence showed linear C3 deposition () and weak IgG deposition () at the basement-membrane zone. A diagnosis of PG was made from these findings. Systemic corticosteroid treatment was initiated at a dose of 40 mg/day prednisolone. Since a regression was observed in the lesions of the patient after two weeks, the prednisolone dose was reduced gradually. No new blister formation was observed during hospitalization. Prednisolone treatment was started at a dose of 10 mg/day on the 15th day of hospitalization and the patient was then discharged.

Physical examination revealed a hard, tender, and 25-mm mass in the upper outer quadrant of her right breast and a palpable lymph node in her right axilla. Mammography indicated an indistinct mass on the mediolateral oblique view and the craniocaudal view. Ultrasound (US) showed an 18 \u00d7 16-mm, irregular-shaped, and hypoechoic mass with a suspicion of a spread to the nipple inside the duct (Fig. a) and several swollen lymph nodes in levels I to II (Fig. b). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected enhancement of a 17 \u00d7 17-mm indistinct mass surrounded with a non-mass enhanced segmental lesion toward the nipple side spreading a maximum of 74-mm range, which had no interaction with the chest bone, muscles, and breast skin, in the right breast tissue (Fig. ). Invasive carcinoma with multiple axillary lymph node metastases was strongly suspected on clinical examination and imaging.

Initial vital signs reveal tachycardia and hypotension (lowest recorded 85/64). Initial testing revealed new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, negative troponin, chest X-ray revealing cardiomegaly, and negative computer tomography of the brain. Subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a single ostium shared by all three coronary arteries (right coronary artery, LCX, and LAD) all originating from the right coronary cusp with the left anterior descending artery originating posteriorly and coursing between the aorta and left atrium (Figs. , and ). In addition to an occluded mid RCA, distal disease of the LAD and severe disease of the superior branch of the obtuse marginal artery of the LCX were noted. The occluded RCA appeared to have left-to-right collaterals from the septal branches of the LAD to the posterior descending artery (PDA) (Fig. ). Next, a CCTA was performed to evaluate the artery for a \u2018malignant course\u201d defined as an anomalous origin of the coronary artery with subsequent course between the aorta and pulmonary trunk. It is considered malignant as the affected coronary artery can get compressed between the aorta and pulmonary trunk, specifically during exercise, and can produce angina or in worst cases, sudden cardiac death. Our patient was found to have a non-malignant course (Fig. ).

Additionally on physical exam, a localized band of tissue with tethering could be palpated within the superior portion of the remaining SCM with rotation to the left, a taut right SCM can be seen along the entire remnant of the muscle (Figure ). MRI prior to the second operative intervention showed marked atrophy of the right SCM and a persistent fibrotic band just deep to the skin (Figure ).

A gradual increase in size and no history of previous treatment were also reported during the anamnesis. The patient signed the informed consent, which represents the ethical approval of the faculty committee. Her medical and socio-economic histories were not contributory. The extra-oral evaluation did not reveal changes. The intraoral examination revealed a sessile nodule with a color similar to that of the mucosa and a focal erythematous area with a fibro-elastic consistency measuring 1.5 cm in the largest diameter extending from the inferior right lateral incisor to the inferior right first premolar. The lesion involved the vestibular and lingual gingiva, causing displacement of the inferior right canine (Fig. ).\nPanoramic reconstruction and parasagittal slices of the Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) showed a slightly superficial hypodense area between the inferior right lateral incisor and inferior right canine with reabsorption of the alveolar crest (Fig. ). Based on the clinical and immunological aspects, the main diagnosis hypotheses included peripheral ossifying fibroma, peripheral giant cell lesion, and ancient pyogenic granuloma. The peripheral odontogenic tumors were also included as a differential diagnosis. An excisional biopsy was performed and a clear separation was noted between the lesion and mandible bone during the trans-surgical approach. The histopathological analysis revealed a well-circumscribed proliferation comprising numerous islands and strands of epithelial polyhedral cells with well-defined borders and marked round nucleus in the connective tissue under the mucosal epithelium. Numerous nests, cords, and small islands of polyhedral cells with clear and vacuolated abundant cytoplasm were observed interspersed with the amorphous eosinophilic deposits (Fig. ).

Mutational analysis revealed that he lacked EGFR mutations or ALK gene rearrangements. CT scans showed that this patient had developed multiple metastases, including mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, and also to the right intrapulmonary lymph nodes. He received 6 cycles of Pem-Cis chemotherapy, followed by thoracic radiation. Review of the CT scan at completion of sequential chemoradiotherapy treatment resulted in a significant shrinkage in the primary tumor in his left lung, while simultaneously resulting in a slight increase in metastatic lymph nodes (Fig. ). In February 6, 2017, CT scans showed that the tumor progressed rapidly. He was then scheduled to receive gemcitabine plus nedaplatin (Gem-Ndp) chemotherapy. However, the patient had to discontinue the planned 2nd cycle of this regimen as he developed moderate pneumonia. After systemic antibiotic treatment, the patient improved symptomatically and became increasingly energetic. However, CT scans on March 29 revealed that his tumors had progressed further. Owing to his poor physical condition after Gem-Ndp treatment, the chemotherapy regimen was changed to Pem-Cis. However, CT scans on May 11 failed to detect any shrinkage in his tumor. In addition, lymph node metastases increased post-treatment. The patient subsequently started standard of care pembrolizumab treatment at 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. During hospitalization, the general condition of the patient was good, with signs of fatigue only present at the first 2 days after each pembrolizumab infusion. The treatment failed to result in an anti-tumor response. The patient then received 2 cycles of initially used chemotherapy regimen Pem-Cis. Interestingly, we detected a significant shrinkage in the enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph node metastases, with the primary site in the left lung exhibiting no further progression.",

Within 3 hours, she noticed multiple pruritic, oval, swollen, erythematous, bright red or dusky red patches measuring 3 to 4 cm with erythematous halos over her face, neck, both upper arms, and trunk (). On further inquiry, she recalled a history of a similar episode about 6 months ago, when she had taken fluconazole for treatment of onychomycosis. The patient had no previous history of any medical conditions, such as allergy or atopic dermatitis. She was not taking any regular medications. In the laboratory study, except for white blood cell count (11,020 cells/mm3, normal 3,600~10,200 cells/mm3), results of blood sugar, liver function test, and urine analysis, Ig E PRIST were all within normal limits. A clinical diagnosis of FDE caused by fluconazole was made. A skin biopsy was performed on an erythematous to brownish patch on her left upper arm. Histopathological findings revealed an appearance of a fixed drug eruption; an interface dermatitis with dyskeratotic keratinocytes in epidermis, lichenoid lymphocytic infiltration and pigmentary incontinence in upper dermis (). She was treated with oral prednisolone 10 mg daily for 3 days and 7.5 mg daily for 3 days. Oral antihistamine and topical corticosteroid ointment were also prescribed. The skin lesion regressed after 10 days; therefore, we performed a patch test and an oral challenge test to confirm the relationship between suspected drug intake and drug interaction 4 weeks later.

At that time, her menstrual cycle was regular and 30 days long, with dysmenorrhea, manifesting as lower abdominal and lumbar pain, persisting for 5\u20137 days. There was no family or medical history of note. She had visited a local clinic with the chief complaint of lumbar pain, where a right ovarian tumor 8 cm in size that included solid internal components, was identified, and she was referred to the University of Tsukuba Hospital. Transvaginal ultrasound had revealed a right adnexal mass with solid components, 68 mm \u00d7 53 mm in size, and an intramural uterine fibroid 23 mm \u00d7 27 mm, with no hypertrophy of the endometrium, which measured 2.1 mm. Blood counts and blood biochemistry test results revealed no abnormalities. Her serum CA19-9 level was 45.9 U/ml, CA125 was 22 U/ml, and CEA level was 1.3 ng/ml. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an 80-mm unilocular cystic mass in the right ovary with a papillary protrusion of longest diameter 45 mm. The left ovary was not enlarged, and there was no obvious peritoneal dissemination or enlarged lymph nodes. Surgery, comprising right adnexectomy, left ovarian biopsy, partial omentectomy and uterine fibroid removal, was performed. The right ovary was enlarged to 8 cm in size, and it was removed without intraoperative rupture and with its capsule intact. The left ovary was not enlarged, but was seen to have a small endometrial cyst, which was resected. The absence of peritoneal dissemination and enlarged lymph nodes was confirmed during surgery.

It was learned that, four years ago the patient had been diagnosed with Behcet's disease and received irregular colchicine treatment. During interviews, we learned that, he had recurrent oral and genital ulcers. On examination, there was no pathological finding except for high temperature (38.5\u00b0C). Her chest radiogram showed bilateral, hilar enlargement and peripheral but localized patchy infiltration (). Initial diagnosis of pulmonary artery aneurysm and pulmonary emboli were especially associated with the hilar enlargement and previous diagnosis of Behcet's disease. Accordingly, dynamic contrasted CT was obtained. On dynamic thorax computed tomograms of both pulmonary arteries, aneurysmal dilatation and chronic thrombus involving all interior lmen of both pulmonary arteries were detected. Consolidated substances were determined on posterobasal segment of the left pulmonary lower lobe with a dimension of 3 \u00d7 2 cm related to, newly formed emboli (Figures and ).\nOn concurrent transthoracic echocardiograms (TTE) a bulk with a dimension of 4.5 \u00d7 1.6 cm was determined in the right ventricle explaining symptoms of thrombus (). On cardiac MRI, a mass lesion was detected in the right ventricle with the dimensions of 4.5 \u00d7 1.5 cm concordant with the thrombus. Thrombus was determined in the bilateral femoral veins by venous Doppler ultrasonography of the lower extremities. Hematologic parameters of the patient were within the normal limits. Thrombophilia panel was reported as normal. The patient was referred to an ophthalmologist who found evidence of active uveitis.\nPulsed immunosuppressive therapy was administered to the patient.

    "original_text": "A 68-year-old Japanese man with a history of distal partial gastrectomy for gastric cancer 10 years earlier was admitted for surgical treatment of intrathoracic esophageal cancer (T3, N2, M0, stage III). He underwent subtotal esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection and removal of the remnant stomach with the abdominal lymph nodes. The alimentary continuity was reconstructed with a pedicled jejunal limb through the antethoracic route. When we separated the diaphragm from the esophagus and removed xiphoid surgically to prevent a pedicled jejunal limb injury, the pericardium was opened. Anastomosis of the esophagus and jejunum was carried out instrumentally with a circular stapler. A postoperative enteral contrast examination showed smooth passage and no deformity of the reconstructed jejunum. The patient was discharged about 4 weeks postoperatively. About 6 months after the esophagectomy, the patient was readmitted to our hospital because of abdominal discomfort and vomiting. His vital signs were stable and unremarkable. He was thin, with a body mass index of 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed that the pedicled jejunum through the antethoracic space was markedly dilated and the abdomen was soft and flat (Fig. ). Laboratory data showed only leukocytosis with no other remarkable findings. A chest roentgenogram revealed an increased cardiothoracic ratio of 70%, and an enteral contrast study showed a bird\u2019s beak deformity. The swallowed barium remained static in the reconstructed jejunum. Computed tomography of the thoracoabdominal region showed the reconstructed jejunum within the pericardium anterior to the heart (Fig. ). We diagnosed the patient with IPDH after esophagectomy and performed an emergency laparotomy.

After 2 years, she returned to the hospital with abnormal vaginal bleeding. After the first month of hormonal therapy, which the patient tolerated well, another endometrial biopsy was performed. The presence of simple endometrial hyperplasia without nuclear atypia was detected once again, and she was subsequently treated with lynestrenolum. Abnormal vaginal bleeding returned after 1 year, and the presence of a simple hyperplasia with fibrous endometrial polyp was detected. For 1 year, the bleeding repeated. Anatomopathological examination revealed simple endometrial hyperplasia with partially polypoid endometrium. Administration of progesterone (100 mg twice per day) for 6 months was prescribed but, unfortunately, recurrent vaginal bleeding repeated when therapy was finished.\nDuring follow-up, transvaginal ultrasonography was repeatedly performed, which confirmed the presence of a linear endometrium of 5 to 7 mm thickness and homogenous myometrium. Although recent transvaginal ultrasonography scans showed that both ovaries were normal-sized with no liquid in the recto-uterine pouch, a small ovarian tumor (2 cm in diameter) was surprisingly found on her right ovary.

    "original_text": "A 14-year-old Thai girl was born via cesarean section due to premature rupture of the membrane with a birth weight of 2500 g. She is the first child of a consanguineous (second-degree relatives) couple. Both parents are healthy and have never had fractures. During her first year of life, she had delayed motor development and growth failure. At one year of age, she could not sit by herself and weighed 7.5 kg (< 3rd centile). She presented to our hospital at 14 months of age with fractures of both femora without a history of significant trauma. She was found to have ptosis of both eyes with normal teeth but no blue sclerae. She was small for her age. Her weight was 7.8 kg (3rd centile) and her length was 68 cm (< 3rd centile). Skeletal survey showed diffuse osteopenia, multiple healed fractures of the right humoral shaft, both tibiae and fibulae. Spine radiograph showed flattening and indentation of vertebral bodies (Fig. ). A diagnosis of OI was made and intravenous bisphosphonate therapy (pamidronate 1 mg/kg/dose for 3 days) was initiated and given every 3 months. However, she sustained 1\u20132 long bone fractures per year from minor trauma. She required multiple corrective osteotomies to correct her deformities. At the last follow-up, she was 14 years old, weighing 20 kg. She could not walk due to her long bone deformity (Fig. ).

He became aware of hoarseness with bloody sputum and then facial edema with redness a half year before. At the first physical examination, he had bilateral eyelid edema with erythema, finger edema with keratinizing erythema and limb extensor erythema (). Serous creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was 850 IU/mL (normal range: 40-200 IU/mL). Later, he was referred to the rheumatology department and diagnosed as having dermatomyositis. Fiberscopic examination revealed a laryngeal tumor with left laryngeal palsy (). We immediately performed tracheotomy to maintain airway patency and obtained a biopsy. The histopathological examination revealed squamous cell carcinoma. Computed tomography scan showed that laryngeal cancer had invaded the thyroid cartilage and metastasized to the bilateral superior deep neck lymph nodes. The stage of this case was classified as T3N2CM0. Gallais reported that the most important prognostic factor for dermatomyositis was malignancy. It has been suggested that treatment of the original malignant disease should be the first priority when a malignancy coexists with dermatomyositis. Dermatomyositis can cause dysphagia 4 leading to death from aspiration pneumonia. Therefore, we performed total laryngectomy with bilateral neck dissection. Postoperatively, the serous CPK was 67 IU/mL. The eyelid edema with erythema and finger edema with keratinizing erythema decreased or disappeared after this operation (). Moreover, the aspiration pneumonia, oral intake and performance grade improved from 3 to 1 by the total laryngectomy. A few researchers have reported processes of relationship between dermatomyositis and malignant tumors. Mooney have described explanations about prostate cancer and the occurrences of dermatomyositis were described as follows.

She had no history of infection with mycobacteria or contact with an elephant. Results of physical examination were unremarkable. The patient's tuberculin test was negative. Routine laboratory testing on admission revealed an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 34 mg/L, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 45 mm/hr. The chest X-ray examination showed a diffuse shadow in the right apex suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis. The initial microbiological examination of bronchial lavage by the hospital laboratory revealed the presence of small coccobacillary acid-fast organisms. The bronchial lavage specimen was cultured on L\u00f6wenstein-Jensen medium for mycobacterial isolation. Since the growth of the isolate on L\u00f6wenstein-Jensen medium was slower than that for the majority of rapidly growing mycobacteria, and due to apical pulmonary lesions the patient was misdiagnosed as having tuberculosis and entered into the TB Register. After one month of antituberculosis therapy, the patient discontinued treatment due to extreme weakness and severe abdominal pain. Meanwhile the isolate was referred to our laboratory for definitive identification. Further investigation on repeated specimens revealed that the infecting micro-organism was a rapidly growing mycobacteria.

No chills, fever or other particular discomfort were noted and the patient had no history of surgery, trauma or radiotherapy. A physical examination revealed pain, a flat abdominal area and mild lower abdominal tenderness, but no rebound tenderness. A 6\u00d75-cm tender mass was palpated in the left ovarian area. An ultrasound examination revealed a 6.9\u00d74.6-cm mixed echo mass in the left side of the pelvic cavity; irregular dark areas and free dark areas were observed in the surrounding area of the mass and in the Pouch of Douglas, with cloudy areas of light (). The laboratory examination revealed no abnormalities in the blood, urine, stool, blood coagulation ability, biochemistry or tumor marker levels. Laparoscopic surgery was performed under intravenous anesthesia with endotracheal intubation on December 4, 2008. A 6\u00d75-cm mass was identified on the greater omentum, located posterior to the annex and next to the left side of the uterus. The tumor was completely resected.

His medical history was remarkable for chronic heart failure, moderate mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. He was undergoing treatment with apixaban and pilsicainide for atrial fibrillation. He was severely hypoxic (SpO2: 80 under O2 15 L/min by oxygen mask) and hypotensive (systolic blood pressure: 80 mmHg) on admission. In the emergency department, we performed intubation into the right main bronchus through guided bronchoscopy; this was followed immediately by right side one-lung ventilation as portable chest radiography showed consolidation in the left upper lung. Bronchoscopy showed that the trachea was almost obstructed by haemorrhage and haematoma. He experienced cardiopulmonary arrest immediately after the airway was maintained. However, spontaneous circulation was restored by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Contrast computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an aortic aneurysm at the aortic arch, which penetrated the upper lobe of the left lung (Fig. A,B). We suspected that it would be difficult to perform emergent surgery because of the patient\u2019s poor general condition. Furthermore, we believed that there was no indication for endovascular stenting due to the following reasons: (1) the root of the left brachiocephalic artery was close to the penetrating portion of the aneurysm, at a distance of 12 mm. Thus, there might have been a high risk of obstructing blood flow to the brachiocephalic artery; (2) a risk of aortic injury might have been induced by stenting because the aortic arch was highly calcified. He was admitted to the intensive care unit, and we controlled blood pressure using nicardipine and discontinued anticoagulation therapy and performed platelet and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion for haemostasis. Bleeding from the APF decreased gradually due to astriction by haematoma. On the 17th hospital day, we performed bronchoscopy for the suction of haematoma, except in the bronchi of the left upper lobe, and adjusted the intubation",

A physical examination conducted at presentation revealed gait disturbance with spasticity. He was able to stand by himself, but needed a crutch for walking. A neurological examination showed motor weakness of left lower extremity (Grade IV). In addition, sensory disturbances of vibration and positional sensation were present on the left side below the T4 dermatome.

    "original_text": "We present the case of a 65-year-old male with no previous smoking or supplemental oxygen history who presented to the emergency department after a routine clinic visit that showed desaturation into the 70s. Past medical history was insignificant except for recent hospital admission the week prior that entailed a recent bilateral embolic stroke followed by a left carotid endarterectomy with 80% stenosis bilaterally, as well as a viral infection with influenza type B treated with Tamiflu. Initial evaluation upon admission revealed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure without hypercapnia. CT chest showed significant bilateral consolidation in the mid to lower lobes correlating with a bilateral pneumonia secondary to recent viral illness (). Meropenem and Levaquin were started, followed by vancomycin as the patient continued to require more oxygen and non-invasive ventilation over the following three days. This included high-flow-nasal cannula (HFNC) initially, with advancement to Vapotherm to maintain the patient\u2019s oxygenation status. Initial laboratory work revealed a white blood cell (WBC) of 13.3 (high of 23 during admission), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 88, and c-reactive protein (CRP) of 8.8. The respiratory viral panel was negative, and tests for other possible causes, including fungal and autoimmune causes, were negative.\nThe patient underwent an endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscopy where the obtained samples were negative for source of infection from cytology, Gram stain, and sputum findings. The findings from EBUS bronchoscopy also included respiratory macrophages and inflammatory cells. Following this procedure, there was increasing concern for noninfectious organizing pneumonia as other diagnoses had been excluded.

    "original_text": "A 37-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of aplastic anemia (AA), presented to a rural hospital after a ground level fall. AA was diagnosed 10 months earlier after he was investigated for pancytopenia. A bone marrow biopsy showed cellularity of only 10% and the presence of a small paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clone (less than 0.2%). He received standard combination treatment for AA with cyclosporine 225 mg orally twice daily, horse anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) 40 mg/kg daily for 4 consecutive days, and prednisone 1 mg/kg daily. His other medications included daily Pantoloc 40 mg orally, daily Valtrex 500 mg orally, and daily Dapsone 50 mg orally for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis due to a reported allergy to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. He had recently quit smoking and denied alcohol use but actively used other recreational drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, and methamphetamine. He was unemployed. He had no known other medical co-morbidities and was taking no other medications prior to developing AA. The etiology of AA was felt to be idiopathic because he had no improvement after an initial trial of sobriety.

Now, \u201csteady brightness\u201d was blocking her view in her right eye and she experienced color desaturation. The left eye did not appear to have any visual changes. The patient had a normal BMI and reported no history of being overweight, headaches, tinnitus, or previous visual disturbances. She had a 4-month history of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) for which she was being treated with a progestin and estrogen birth control.\nUpon examination, papilledema was noted in both eyes as well as a 2+ right relative afferent pupillary defect. No cranial nerve deficits were noted. The patient had a 20/20 visual acuity, and a visual field test was performed. A severe peripheral visual field deficit was noted in the right eye with a mean deviation on the Humphrey scale of \u221226.10 dB using a Central 24-2 Threshold Test (). The normal mean deviation should be between \u22121 and \u22122 db. The left eye was at baseline. The patient was admitted to the hospital for expedited vision workup. An MRI with and without contrast showed slight dilation of the optic nerve sheath, as well as an incidental small right frontal developmental venous sinus anomaly, but otherwise unremarkable ().

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed small mediastinal lymph nodes. The patient was discharged on a tapering dose of oral steroids and albuterol inhalation with a follow-up outpatient appointment with a pulmonologist. An endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy of the mediastinal lymph nodes was performed 1 week later. The patient had worsening dyspnea and was again admitted to the hospital. She denied any orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. On admission, the physical examination, including chest auscultation, was unremarkable. Initial basic blood work, including complete cell count and metabolic profile, revealed no abnormalities. Her serum cardiac brain natriuretic peptide level was elevated at 1,500 U/L, along with mild elevation of cardiac troponin. The chest radiograph was unremarkable. A CT scan of the chest revealed new small nodular opacities with a tree in bud appearance in the peripheral centrilobular area (). Subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram revealed extremely elevated right ventricular systolic pressures with flattening of the interventricular septum and severely high pulmonary artery pressures, suggestive of acute cor pulmonale from severe pulmonary hypertension. Within a day of admission, the patient's dyspnea worsened and she required high-flow oxygen. Meanwhile, mediastinal lymph node biopsy revealed signet ring cell poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (), and mucicarmine staining confirmed mucin secreting signet ring cells ().
