Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine levels were normal by biochemical analysis. Thyroid ultrasound revealed multiple nodules in both lobes. Bigger nodules were a 50 x 36 x 40 mm hypoechoic solid nodule in the right lobe and a 33 x 25 x 37 mm isoechoic solid nodule in the left lobe.

Informed consent was obtained from the patient.\nThe right thyroid lobe was partially mobilized after ligation of the middle thyroid vein. The carotid sheath was incised, and the right vagus nerve (VN) was located behind the carotid artery and the jugular vein. Direct stimulation of the VN with the stimulator probe at a standard distal point did not create a sound signal. The absence of a distal V1 (d-V1) signal revealed the early proximal separation of the inferior laryngeal nerve and eventual presence of the non-RLN. The carotid sheath incision was extended toward the cephalic direction. The right VN was proximally followed under the guidance of IONM with serial electrophysiological stimulation to identify the separation point of the inferior laryngeal nerve. A positive signal from a proximal point of stimulation (p-V1 = 648 \u00b5V) helped us to locate the separation point of the right inferior laryngeal nerve. Stimulation of the inferior nerve when first identified at the separation point posterior to the carotid artery created a positive sound signal and wave amplitude (R1 = 661 \u00b5V).

She carried a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and underwent radioiodine ablation 10 years ago. The patient had a complex ocular history, which included a 30-year history of glaucoma initially treated with topical glaucoma medications and argon laser trabeculoplasty and, later, trabeculectomy in both eyes 7.5 years prior to presentation. She has also had cataract surgery in the right and left eyes, 6 and 5 years prior to presentation, respectively.\nBefore and after cataract surgery in the left eye, the patient was noted on examination to have bilateral \u2018papillitis\u2019 with congestion and hemorrhages of both optic nerves.

A first-trimester screen, including \u03b1-fetoprotein test and chorionic villus sampling for chromosome analysis to determine the karyotype, was offered but this was declined by the mother even with the understanding of the risks involved. She had taken folic acid as advised during the first trimester. Prenatal ultrasonographic scan performed at 18 weeks showed an anencephalic fetus with polyhydramnios. No other structural fetal defects were identified. The expectant mother was counseled by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) consisting of an obstetrician and a neonatologist. The mother decided to continue the pregnancy. A decision was reached with the mother not to perform cesarean section delivery. It was agreed with the parents that after birth inflation breaths could only be applied if signs of life were present and sustainable unsupported, feeding through orogastric tube could be started after birth if in infant\u2019s best interest initially with water or dextrose before using milk. Any resuscitation or invasive supportive attempts beyond this were deemed inappropriate. A written informed consent was obtained from the patient.\nThe mother gave birth to a male stillborn infant at 39 weeks 3 days gestation in a specialized obstetric unit. Detailed neonatal physical examination of the baby was undertaken by an experienced pediatrician.

She was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes with poor treatment adherence. She was referred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and was submitted to endotracheal intubation for 5 days. After 3 days of extubation, the patient showed respiratory distress due to stenosis of the trachea at the fourth tracheal ring, which was diagnosed by a nasofibroscopy. The cervical computed tomography (CT) study showed a segmental parietal concentric thickening of the trachea with 2 cm of craniocaudal extension associated with a marked luminal reduction at the T1 level directly below the thyroid gland (1B).\nThe suspension videolaringoscopy evidenced ulcers in the lateral and posterior walls of the trachea, and necrosis of the mucosa at the fifth tracheal ring (A). A complete resection of the necrotic tissue that measured 2 cm was undertaken. At the end of the procedure, the trachea resumed an almost normal caliber (B). The histopathological examination of the surgical specimen was represented by tracheal necrosis ().\nThe patient was discharged 3 days after the endoscopic necrosis resection. However, she returned to the ECU after 9 days, presenting severe respiratory distress due to upper airway obstruction, which required urgent fiberoptic bronchoscope-guided orotracheal intubation. A new rigid and eccentric stenosis was diagnosed (A). In attempting the tracheal dilation with the bronchoscope, and with the intubation tube insertion, a rupture and laceration of the posterior pars membranacea of the trachea in its proximal stenotic portion occurred, with consequent pneumomediastinum, which was drained with a pigtail coupled to a Heimlich valve.

Her past history includes type two diabetes controlled with lifestyle modification and breast cancer in 2002 treated with surgical resection (2002) and chemoradiation (2003). She first presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Her physical exam was notable for a palpable hard protuberance on her right frontal calvarium. An EEG showed intermittent low-amplitude polymorphic delta slowing over the right anterior head region, without clear epileptiform discharges, and she was treated with levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis. Her neurological exam remained normal, and she did not have any subsequent seizures.\nImaging studies of her head were performed. The computed tomography (CT) of her head demonstrated a 3.7 cm \u00d7 3.4 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm lytic lesion of the right frontal calvarial bone with the erosion of the inner table []. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain suggested herniation of the right frontal lobe parenchyma into the bony defect [].\nDue to the history of seizure activity and the expansile nature of the bony mass, the patient underwent surgical resection. A right frontotemporal craniotomy for resection of the right frontal calvarial lesion was performed. Upon inspection of the skull prior to the craniotomy, the lesion was evident by marked cystic thinning of the frontal bone. As the bone flap was elevated, brain tissue was noted to have herniated into the calvarial lesion []. Bipolar electrocautery was used to coagulate and divide the herniated portion of the brain from the right frontal lobe, and the specimen was sent for frozen and permanent pathology.

The patient underwent hysterectomy along with surgical removal of the fallopian tube and ovaries due to cancer of the right ovary. Histologic examination was consistent with well-differentiated serous papillary cystadenocarcinoma of the right ovary with scattered moderate differentiation, and metastatic invasion of the left ovary. Eighteen years later, the patient presented with a mass at the left supraclavicular space, corresponding to an enlarged lymph node. The fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the enlarged supraclavicular lymph node revealed recurrence of the previously treated serous adenocarcinoma. Epithelial cells of cylindrical shape in papillary clusters, psammoma bodies and foamy histiocytes were observed. The patient underwent CT of the neck, thorax, upper and lower abdomen for evaluation of disease extent. Lymph nodes were detected at the neck, including the left supraclavicular area, the mediastinum, the left axilla, the right paraaortic region, the right common iliac and external iliac vessels, as well as the right retrocrural space. The lymph nodes were enlarged and displayed large amount of calcifications, while some of them were completely replaced by calcium depositions ().

She had sought previous consultation with at least five hip surgeons, who established the diagnosis and indicated surgery, but none of them was able to go on with treatment reporting that they did not feel comfortable with the surgical procedure.\nThere were no comorbidities, allergies, or medication use, except for analgesics.\nOn physical examination, there was a mild limp on the right side, no deformities, and some tenderness over the trochanter. Of note, there was an increased range of motion in the internal rotation of the hip and severe pain in the provocative anterior impingement test (in flexion, adduction, and internal rotation).\nRadiographs depicted signs of right DDH, with a T\u00f6nnis angle of 20\u00b0, a center edge angle of 8\u00b0, an anterior center edge angle of 0\u00b0, a broken Shenton line, and the presence of a spherical femoral head ().\nComputed tomography (CT) scan provided three-dimensional details of the deformity, including the presence of the femoral head-neck junction offset loss, leading to the concomitant cam deformity diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contributed to the diagnosis of a typical hyperplasic torn labrum ().\nUpon confirmation of the diagnosis and clear surgical indication, we suggested to proceed with the treatment.

Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen with a palpable mass about 3 cm below the xiphoid process, about 20 cm in diameter, which was hard and had limited mobility. The values of laboratory tests, including tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, alpha-fetoprotein, cancer antigen 125, and cancer antigen 15-3) on admission were within the normal ranges.

During his childhood, a clinically evident bilateral dislocation of patella was observed and described without the assistance of imaging. Nevertheless, the pathology was asymptomatic, and he never reported difficulty in walking. Therefore, the malformation had never been treated and the patient conducted a normal life including time served in the army.\nPhysical examination revealed that the patient could walk normally, with a very mild stumble on the right knee, which was referred as absent before the trauma. There was conspicuous muscle wasting of each thigh (particularly on the medial side, with a clear depression on the vastus medialis) and 15\u00b0 of genu valgum. The patellae were lying laterally to the lateral femoral condyle with the knee in the position of full extension () and they displaced more laterally during the flexion (). The proximal tibiae were rotated outward. The knees could be extended actively against maximum resistance, with full range of motion. Both the femoral quadriceps worked as knee extensors, and their strength was 5/5. The knees showed no signs of instability or ligamentous deficiency. The right knee was painful on the lateral side, and the clinical signs were positive for pathology of the lateral meniscus.\nRoentgenograms of bilateral knees revealed small, laterally displaced patellae with slight degenerative changes in the tibiofemoral joints with subluxated tibia (). The medial joint spaces were widened. Lateral roentgenograms showed marked lateral rotation deformities of the tibiae ().

He underwent an anterior decompression and reconstruction of the L3 vertebral body with fibular strut allograft.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the lung revealed obstruction of the left main bronchus accompanied by a large endobronchial mass (). The next day, a bronchoscopy identified showed total obstruction of the left main bronchus, with evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscopic findings suggested bronchogenic carcinoma (), and positronemission tomography (PET)-CT identified a hypermetabolic endobronchial mass involving carina obstructing left main bronchus, highly suggestive of lung cancer.

Hypoxemia and dyspnea worsened and hemoptysis aggravated; oxygen saturation was barely maintained between 88% and 90% by using an oxygen mask with a 15-L flow rate. Thus, emergency radiotherapy was administered based on the probable diagnosis of lung cancer as suggested by the chest CT, PET-CT, and bronchoscopic findings, even though the biopsy did not confirm malignancy. As a result of the radiotherapy, hypoxemia resolved, hemoptysis decreased, and the mass obstructing the bronchus diminished in size. Two days later, a second bronchoscopy detected no evidence of bleeding and resolution of all bronchial obstruction (). Two weeks after cessation of radiotherapy, a follow-up chest CT scan revealed that the size fo the endobronchial mass had markedly decreased and obstructive collapse had improved ().

After a primary survey, a computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed clavicle fracture, serial rib fractures associated with pulmonary contusion and hemopneumothorax on the left side, and non-displaced serial rib fractures on the right side.\nHe underwent surgery with surgical stabilization with plates of the clavicle and the ribs on the left side and was discharged home on the 19th postoperative day (POD).\nThree months later, he presented with a painful swelling on his right chest wall without a history of new trauma or surgery on that side. Physical examination showed a large solitary swelling over the seventh/eighth rib, 3 \u00d7 5 cm in dimension. The lesion was soft, tender, fluctuating with defined margins, and not attached to underlying structures.\nIn order to determine the cause of the swelling, we performed an ultrasonography and a CT Scan that showed a capsulated fluid collection (). A diagnostic thoracoscopy showed no abnormal intrathoracic findings (), and therefore, an open incision of the collection was performed. Intraoperatively, we confirmed the presence of an encapsulated abscess with purulent secretion coming out from a hole in the 7th rib ().\nAfter partial resection of the affected rib and tissue sampling for histological and microbiological examination, a negative pressure dressing was applied (Wound V.A.C. Therapy; KCI, San Antonio, Texas).\nHistopathologic examination revealed extensive granulocyte infiltrates. The presence of Candida albicans was detected in the resected tissue but not in blood cultures (in absence of specific treatment). Dressing changes were scheduled every 3 days until a clean granulating wound without any residual sign of infection was obtained.

    "original_text": "A 30-year-old female office administrator was admitted with a 6-month history of increasing left knee pain. In 1990 and 1995, she underwent surgery for removal of a haemangioma located near the medial border of the patella. Examination of the knee showed no abnormalities, and angulation was possible without any significant limitation in the range of motion. On physical examination, she had spontaneous pain in the anterior region of the knee, with a maximum point of tenderness just near the surgical scar, at the superomedial corner of the patella. In addition, pressure on the patella itself was painful. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for further evaluation (3T Skyra, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The protocol consisted of T1- and T2-weighted images as well as fluid-sensitive short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences and contrast enhanced T1-weighted images. MRI revealed two different angiomatous masses that were the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s pain. The bigger one with a maximum extension of almost 7 cm and a fusiform shape with partial intraosseous extension were located on the medial edge of femoral diaphysis and arising from the upper part of the medial aspect of the intercondyloid fossa.

Previous medical history was nonrevealing except from a trauma to the right neck about 9 years ago. At that point, the patient had noticed the swelling for the first time. However, he did not seek further medical attention since the mass did not cause any symptoms. Thorough physical examination was unremarkable besides the substantial mass of the right lateral neck (Fig. ). Subsequent imaging with ultrasound revealed a septate, cystic formation comprising the entire right cervical region. The septa were partly calcified and showed moderate blood perfusion. Based on these ultrasound findings, a diagnosis of lymphangioma was considered. However, an additional magnet resonance imaging (MRI) was recommended for appropriate assessment of the masses\u2019 size and potential invasion of the surrounding tissue.\nMRI revealed a massive, polycystic formation located right beneath the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The mass had a craniocaudal diameter of 13 cm with a maximum width and depth of 10 cm and 5 cm, respectively. The caudal part surrounded the brachiocephalic trunk and extended down to the upper mediastinum as well as the thyroid isthmus. However, direct communication with the thyroid gland was not reported. Distinct septa displayed slight contrast enhancement, abnormal lymph nodes were not found. These MRI findings were also considered consistent with a lymphangioma.\nConsequently, surgical resection of the presumed lymphangioma was pursued.

She had exophthalmos of left eye 20 years ago and she was diagnosed as Graves\u2019 disease which resolved without any treatment or intervention. She was without complaint for 20 years until presenting to her ophthalmologist who felt that her exophthalmos was due to Graves\u2019 disease but she was found to be borderline hypothyroid. Six months later, she developed redness, dryness, and pain in the right eye with worsening exophthalmos. She also complained of double vision and headaches. She was started on thyroid replacement for borderline hypothyroidism but had no relief in proptosis. Antibiotics were prescribed for suspected bacterial infection of the right eye without resolution of her symptoms. She was then started on prednisone 80 mg daily for possible autoimmune/inflammatory etiology and her symptoms improved significantly. At this time, her visual acuity was noted to be 20/25 in the affected eye. Fundoscopic exam was normal. Hertel exophthalmometry, ocular tension, and biomicroscopy were not documented. An MRI of brain and orbit revealed an enhancing soft tissue mass behind the right globe (). The biopsy of the soft tissue mass revealed transmural inflammation with fibrinoid necrosis consistent with necrotizing vasculitis as well as also evidence of lymphocytic infiltration in the fatty tissue consistent with Graves\u2019 disease (). ANA, ANCA, ACE, anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies were negative though the patient was found to have an equivocal MPO-ANCA of 6. A diagnosis of limited WG was made.

    "original_text": "A 46-year-old male patient was referred to our institution in November 2015 with three months history of headache. At the time of admission, a plain head CT scan showed an enlarged pineal gland with smooth margins and several peripheral calcifications. The pineal parenchyma appeared hyperdense to cerebral cortex because of a possible haemorrhagic component. The brain magnetic resonance (MR) showed a well-defined lesion in the pineal region (14 \u00d7 10 mm in the axial plane), responsible for a slight impression on the tectal plate underneath and minimal internal cerebral veins dislocation along the top. The lesion was iso-hyperintense on T1 (Figure ) with diffuse contrast enhancement after gadolinium injection. Moreover, the signal was strongly hypointense on T2 (Figure ), confirming the hypothesis of an hemorrhagic lesion with no sign of hemosiderosis outside the pineal gland.\nMR scan of the spine and CSF cytology resulted negative for pathological seeding. The patient underwent also hormonal and tumour markers blood tests and radiological workup with chest and abdominal CT scan, which were all reported as normal. Repeated MRI scan after short interval showed a significant overall enlargement of the pineal lesion (18 mm x 12 mm) with no evidence of further bleeding.

The ulcer had been present for around 4 months. Initial assessment revealed the wound measuring 5.5 cm long \u00d7 2 cm wide, necrotic with extensive fibrin deposits, heavily exuding, malodorous, and tender. There was erythema, eczema, and trophic changes of the surrounding skin []. Previous treatment was with removal of exposed reconstruction plate and primary closure [].\nAfter extensive assessment, exudate was sent for culture and sensitivity test. The wound was cleansed with saline solution and a sterile hydrocellular dressing applied. The culture report was positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with selective sensitivity to linezolid. The patient was hospitalized and IV linezolid 300 mg b.i.d for 7 days administered along with local wound debridement and periodic dressing. Healing was satisfactory and the patient was discharged a week later. Hydrating gel and cream were applied to the surrounding skin. Two-month later, the patient reported back with an ulcer on the same site [] which was bigger in size than the first reported. Culture sensitivity gave the same report of MRSA positive and sensitivity to linezolid. The treatment was same as before, but the second time, the ulcer did not show any progress in healing, rather the ulcer deteriorated further. The failure of conventional methods of repeated wound dressings prompted the use of Calgigraf Ag foam [Figure and ]. Drastic reduction in the ulceration followed by improved healing was evident and the patient was recalled weekly to change the Calgigraf Ag foam dressing.
