An MRI of the brain identified a left-sided frontal sinus tumor that was benign in appearance and of bone origin (). Radiologic impression was a fibro-osseous lesion either representing a fibrous dysplasia or an atypical osteoma. On examination, the patient had no facial asymmetry with no facial nerve dysfunction and she reported some paresthesias on the left side on sensory exam in the V1 distribution. Flexible nasal endoscopy was normal on the right and showed a slightly irregular edematous mucosa in the left superoanterior surface of the bulla ethmoidalis.

However, by the time of presentation now, she had six months of progressively worsening left-sided headache despite both topical and systemic treatments for sinus disease and medical management for her headaches.\nThe patient was ordered a CT scan of the paranasal sinuses that showed significant interval growth of the osseous mass since the scan prior to her endoscopic procedure. The mass now crossed the midline into the right frontoethmoidal recess. Given the inability to attain symptom control with medical treatment for this patient, surgical options were considered.

    "original_text": "In June 2015, a 43-year-old woman presented at another hospital with a swelling on the lateral side of the right knee, which clinically resembled a cyst of the lateral meniscus. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a cystic mass lying over the lateral meniscus, the femoral epiphysis and the tibial condyle. These findings seemed to be consistent with the clinical diagnosis of a cyst. For this reason, an arthroscopy was planned. A first attempt to decompress the cyst arthroscopically through a medial incision failed. The doctors then accessed the mass through a lateral incision and found that the formation had a solid consistency rather than fluid. Considering the macroscopic aspect of a malignant lesion, the tumor was enucleated and a drain was placed several centimeters below the lateral scar. The histopathologic examination demonstrated that the lesion was a high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma. In September 2015, the woman approached our tertiary referral center for musculoskeletal oncology, which boasts the presence of a multidisciplinary team. We planned the oncological re-excision on new computerized tomography (CT) scans to achieve wide healthy resection margins. The oncology\u2013orthopedic surgeon performed the surgical re-excision, while the plastic surgeon harvested an adipo-cutaneous propeller flap based on a peroneal artery perforator at the middle third of the same leg. In addition, we used a random local flap harvested from the popliteal region to cover part of the donor site (\u2013).\nThe histopathologic examination demonstrated the complete resection of the tumor with more than 3 cm cuff of healthy tissue. The patient spent 1 year and 9 months without significant complications after adjuvant radio- and chemotherapy.

    "cleaned_text": "in june 2015, a 43-year-old woman presented at another hospital with a swelling on the lateral side of the right knee, which clinically resembled a cyst of the lateral meniscus. a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan revealed a cystic mass lying over the lateral meniscus, the femoral epiphysis and the tibial condyle. these findings seemed to be consistent with the clinical diagnosis of a cyst. for this reason, an arthroscopy was planned. a first attempt to decompress the cyst arthroscopically through a medial incision failed. the doctors then accessed the mass through a lateral incision and found that the formation had a solid consistency rather than fluid. considering the macroscopic aspect of a malignant lesion, the tumor was enucleated and a drain was placed several centimeters below the lateral scar. the histopathologic examination demonstrated that the lesion was a high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma. in september 2015, the woman approached our tertiary referral center for musculoskeletal oncology, which boasts the presence of a multidisciplinary team. we planned the oncological re-excision on new computerized tomography (ct) scans to achieve wide healthy resection margins. the oncology\u2013orthopedic surgeon performed the surgical re-excision, while the plastic surgeon harvested an adipo-cutaneous propeller flap based on a peroneal artery perforator at the middle third of the same leg. in addition, we used a random local flap harvested from the popliteal region to cover part of the donor site (\u2013).\nthe histopathologic examination demonstrated the complete resection of the tumor with more than 3 cm cuff of healthy tissue. the patient spent 1 year and 9 months without significant complications after adjuvant radio- and chemotherapy. the woman underwent a trimestral follow-up until she suffered from a tibial plateau fracture in june 2017. the injury was treated by open reduction and internal fixation (orif) through the incision of the medial margin of the propeller flap. we assisted to a delayed wound healing probably due to the previous radiotherapy. after 4 months, the patient noticed a painless swelling that gradually increased in",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an obstructive hydrocephalus caused by midbrain tumors [Figure and ]. He had past history of a malignant lymphoma of the stomach, which had occurred 10 years earlier. ETV and an endoscopic biopsy were performed to treat the hydrocephalus and to confirm the histology of the tumor.\nThe operating sheath was inserted into the right lateral ventricle through a right-sided coronal burr hole. The endoscope was advanced into the third ventricle through the sheath and the foramen of Monro. The floor of the third ventricle was thin and translucent. Under continuous visual control, the biopsy forceps and a 4-French Fogarty balloon catheter were used to perforate and widen the stoma. The basilar tip and bilateral posterior cerebral artery were visible below the stoma, but there was no injury to these arteries. A biopsy was not performed because the tumor did not appear on the surface of the ventricle, but cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology revealed malignant lymphoma cells. After some minutes of irrigation, no bleeding was confirmed, and external ventricular drainage was then inserted into the right lateral ventricle.\nThe patient was in our intensive care unit with continuous monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure. His systolic blood pressure was stable in the range of 130\u2013110 mmHg. He was drowsy, but did not exhibit confusion or other signs of significant pain. After the procedure, the initial level of ventricular drainage was 10 cm H2O. About 220 ml of CSF was drained in the first day after surgery. The patient remained drowsy, but a computed tomography (CT) scan the day after the operation showed no abnormal findings except dilated lateral ventricles. The CSF continued to drain.

The fluid had been discharged from abdominal drains that had been placed intraoperatively. Eleven days postoperatively, the patient developed sentinel bleeding from a drainage tube placed in the foramen of Winslow. He remained hemodynamically stable and was managed by transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells and intravenous fluids. Emergency angiography was also performed. Common hepatic arteriography showed protrusion and dilatation at the stump of the gastroduodenal artery. Although this later proved to be incorrect, we considered the stump of the gastroduodenal artery as the cause of hemorrhage. This patient showed an anatomical variant of the hepatic artery, with the left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric artery. We therefore embolized the common hepatic artery using microcoils. After embolization, arterial flow to the liver was preserved through collateral flow from the left hepatic artery.\nAt the same time, to exchange the drainage tube located in the foramen of Winslow, traction was placed on the drain and contrast medium was injected via the drainage tube. This contrast study showed not only the peritoneal cavity due to pancreatic leakage, but also the main portal vein, indicating portal vein injury (). The point of damage to the portal vein was just above the confluence of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins. Recurrent hemorrhage from the drain then occurred.

However, transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound examination revealed a 6.0 \u00d7 5.5 \u00d7 5.9 cm vascular mass within the right pelvis with a clear arterial feeder and turbulent swirling intraluminal flow, leading to the diagnosis of a pseudoaneurysm (Fig. ). The diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig. ). The patient was discussed in our multidisciplinary team meeting with interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons, and anaesthetists. The risk of imminent rupture was assessed as high due to the severity of her symptoms and a 5\u201310 mm overall increase in the size of the pseudoaneurysm documented by sequential MRI 14 days apart. Surgery was considered high risk and so selective embolization of the pseudoaneurysm was performed. This was performed under local anaesthetic in the Interventional Radiology suite with full preparation for emergency delivery by the obstetric and anaesthetic team in case of fetal distress. The right uterine artery was identified angiographically from a contralateral femoral arterial puncture and selectively catheterised using a microcatheter. The artery was small but extravasation into the presumed pseudoaneurysm was identified near its proximal portion. The artery was embolised with a series of microcoils across the neck of the pseudoaneurysm to block flow. The procedure was uneventful and the fetus showed a continuous reactive heart rate pattern. Follow up ultrasound showed a completely thrombosed pseudoaneurysm with no flow. She had regular follow ups in the antenatal clinic with no sign of recurrence.

Ten days prior to presentation, the patient sustained a 1 cm laceration at the level of the distal wrist crease after falling on a piece of broken glass. On examination, he had weakness of abduction and adduction of the fingers. Movement of the thumb was unaffected.\nThe injury was managed at the emergency department by thorough wound irrigation. There was a partial irregular cut of about 30% of the radial aspect of the FCU with intact ulnar nerve and ulnar artery. The skin was sutured. After the primary management the patient was sent to our orthopaedic clinic for further follow up. The initial examination one week after the injury revealed a clean wound, no hematoma or swelling, normal sensation of the fifth and ulnar side of the fourth finger, and normal abduction and adduction of the digits. However a gradual numbness and weakness of intrinsic hand muscles was noted after 10 days that gradually worsened. On subsequent follow up a total ulnar nerve deficit was noted distal to the injury, at the wrist level involving motor and sensory branches.\nThree weeks after the initial injury he developed marked weakness of all ulnar supplied intrinsic muscles with total sensory loss at the fifth and the ulnar side of the fourth fingers. Due to the progressive nature of his symptoms, exploration and decompression of the Guyon's canal was done under general anaesthesia. Exploration revealed normal healing of skin and subcutaneous tissue with excessive scar tissue at the radial edge of the FCU which spanned the ulnar nerve, narrowing the entrance of Guyon's canal and causing severe compression and cicriatrical constriction of the nerve.\nThe ulnar nerve was completely intact (Fig. ). No organized hematoma or lesion of ulnar artery was observed. Adhesions were released, excised and Guyon's canal was completely released.

In the physical exam, however, there were no other signs and symptoms recognized except for weight loss. Upper GI endoscopy was done and there was a huge necrotic mass in the first duodenal section which had obliterated the lumen. A biopsy was taken and the result was a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with vascular invasion. A CT scan revealed that there was a mass measuring 10.12 cm and multiple liver metastasis yet lab tests showed that renal and liver functions were normal: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)=0.34 and hemoglobin=8.5. Because of the liver metastasis, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was done with capecitabine and oxaliplatin and we decided to refer her to surgery if the response to chemotherapy was good. After 4 courses of chemotherapy, we evaluated her with a CT scan with the results showing that the size of the duodenal mass and liver metastasis had increased (12.12) yet chest CT scans and lab tests were normal (CEA=1.46). Due to pain, mass effect, and no response to chemotherapy, we started radiation therapy (RT) with a local field with a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions and there was quickly a dramatic response to radiation therapy. We have CT before and after RT (). Once the pain subsided, we started chemotherapy again with capecitabine and irinotecan and over a 4 course, the mass size was 4.4 cm and the liver metastasis had become smaller (). We referred her for radiofrequency ablation for the liver metastasis and then to the surgery department. Radiofrequency was done but yet the patient was inoperable so we continued chemotherapy with capecitabine and irinotecan for another 2 courses. After seven months of radiation therapy, ascites and peritoneal seeding were happening so we did palliative care for her. Because lab tests were normal and the patient could tolerate further treatment, she received chemotherapy with Gemcitabine along with D1 and D8",

Subsequent transthoracic echocardiography confirmed a pericardial effusion of 3 cm with an end-diastolic compression of the right atrium and ventricle besides normal performance and size of the left ventricle.\nBecause of rapidly worsening clinical condition due to tamponade physiology, an emergency pericardiocentesis was done but the patient developed hemodynamic instability.

The defect of the right atrium was restored with a nonvascularized pericardial autograft.\nThe patient's postoperative course was without any complications and a control echocardiography showed minimal pericardial effusion, a normal left ventricular systolic function as well as normal ejection fraction. Since histology revealed cardiac angiosarcoma (tumor cells stained positive for CD34), the patient was transferred to our oncology department for further examination and treatment.\nBesides progressive multiple pulmonary nodules, a postoperative CT scan of the chest and abdomen showed no further distant metastases and no evidence of recurrence of the angiosarcoma in the right atrium.

Also three urinary tract infections occurred in the previous year after the laparoscopic tubal ligation and treated with antibiotherapy. Pulse rate of 90/min, a respiratory rate of 34 cycles/min, and a blood pressure of 110/90 mmHg were detected.

The patient developed congestive heart failure in July of 2013 and underwent an endomyocardial biopsy that demonstrated amyloid. Proteomic typing demonstrated that this patient had TTR cardiac amyloid, and genetic studies demonstrated the TTR gene to be wild-type, so-called senile cardiac amyloidosis.

He had AL amyloidosis successfully treated and had not relapsed after 9.5 years but subsequently developed age-related cardiac amyloidosis that could have easily been misdiagnosed as relapsing AL if cardiac biopsy and proteomic analysis had not been done.\nOver 15 years ago, it was common to identify amyloid in a patient with a monoclonal gammopathy and assume that this was AL type.

Finally, even when AL is diagnosed with proteomic analysis, this does not indicate whether the amyloidosis is localized or systemic. Attention must be given, particularly to those patients who present with amyloid in a skin biopsy, bladder biopsy, laryngeal biopsy, or at the edge of a colonic ulcer or polyp, that the amyloid may be a localized AL amyloidosis that requires no intervention.\nMany specialists, when encountering a patient with biopsy of an organ containing amyloid, refer to a cancer care provider uncertain of the type of amyloidosis.

She has made her booking visit at ninth week of gestation and all the booking investigations were normal except for the platelet count which was 112,000 per liter. During her pregnancy, the lowest platelet count was 80,000 per liter at 27 weeks of gestation and no specific intervention has been done except for regular monitoring of the platelet count. She had been diagnosed with gestational hypertension at 22 weeks of gestation and prescribed labetalol and methyldopa. Other than that, she has had few erythematous, itchy macular lesions over the palm of her right hand from early in the first trimester onwards and had persisted throughout the pregnancy. She has had mild pain in her right small finger from first trimester onwards. But she had not worried about these symptoms so they had gone unnoticed.

The third time he underwent an exploratory laparotomy when all conservative measures failed.\nThe patient's previous medical history included only hyperlipidemia, treated with an oral agent. One month before the first episode of intestinal obstruction he underwent emergency surgery in another institution for acute appendicitis and appendectomy was performed. The surgeon noticed an abnormal membrane covering part of the ileus, and a sample of the tissue was sent for histological examination. The findings were non-specific, indicating a membrane formed of connective tissue.\nThe diagnostic workup during his second admission included an upper GI endoscopy and a barium-contrast examination. A CT scan with oral and intravenous contrast was scheduled in the last admission. The endoscopy revealed gastritis, caused by helicobacter pylori, while the barium study showed no abnormalities. The CT scan revealed a distended stomach and upper jejunum, especially near the ligament of Treitz (Figures , ). It also revealed an area of the jejunum with thickened wall and narrowed lumen.\nThe patient experienced incapacity of feeding properly and was malnourished. During hospitalization he was supported with parenteral nutrition and a decision of laparotomy was made, as no amelioration of his condition was observed with conservative measures.\nHe underwent laparotomy through a midline incision. By entering the abdominal cavity, a dense membrane was found encapsulating the stomach, the small intestine and part of the large intestine (transverse colon and the front of the ascending and descending colon) (Figures , ). The whole membrane was excised and extended adhesiolysis was performed, releasing the small bowel loops (Figure ). The entire small intestine was viable, without serosal tears.

He had restricted neck flexion up to 30 degrees and extended to neutral. He had minimal lateral bending motion and refused to turn head from side to side because of pain. His neurological examination was normal. Anteroposterior (AP), lateral and open mouth odontoid films were obtained followed by computed tomography (CT) scan. CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of Type II odontoid fracture with a gap of 2.5 mm and anterior displacement of the dens by 4 mm. The fracture angulation was 27 degrees with an associated anterior and posterior arch of atlas fracture leading to unstable left lateral mass of C1 (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed intact transverse ligament. Possible treatment options were nonsurgical management in a halo vest as well as surgical management. Both were discussed with the patient. The patient denied a conservative treatment with halo vest because of the long duration of treatment and high incidence of associated complications.\nSince the fracture had angulation of 27 degrees, the surgeon felt that it would be difficult to get appropriate trajectory for screw fixation and in turn adequate reduction. Hence, anterior odontoid screw fixation was not considered. Considering the patient's young age and the limitations of C1-C2 fusion including significant loss of cervical rotation, temporary internal fixation with a lateral mass fixation of C1 and pedicle fixation of C2 without fusion was planned.

The major concern of both the patient and the referring general dentist was the persistence of several deciduous teeth. Possible systemic, endocrine, metabolic or genetic-syndromal disorders as possible etiologic factors could not be detected by a physician and endocrinologist, to which the patient was referred prior to orthodontic examination. In addition, there was no family history of eruption failure of permanent and persistence of deciduous teeth. The first deciduous upper molar on the right side (tooth 54) was extracted 1 year earlier by the referring general dentist, but no spontaneous eruption of the permanent first premolar could be achieved within this timeframe (Table ). Thus and due to no previous referral by the general dentist or presentation of the patient for orthodontic planning, treatment was started quite late.\nThe clinical examination and study model analysis (Figs. and ) in conjunction with the panoramic radiograph (Fig. ), taken by the referring general dentist, showed initially nine persisting deciduous teeth \u2013 all deciduous canines and molars of the upper jaw and those on the right side of the mandible, minus the already extracted upper right deciduous molar. All upper permanent canines and premolars were impacted and malpositioned. The lower right canine, which was severely rotated, was also impacted to a higher and the lower right first and second premolars to a lesser degree, whereas the corresponding teeth on the lower left side were in good occlusion and showed no signs of impaction. No adequate root resorption of the deciduous teeth could be detected radiologically with exception of the lower deciduous molars on the right side.

The pain was diagnosed as neuroma-related pain and he underwent excision of the stump neuromas of the radial, ulnar, and median nerve three times. Despite repeated surgeries, the pain was only relieved partially and temporarily and became more intense after the surgeries. After the last surgery, the pain was treated by nerve blocks but the effect transient.\nAt first assessment in our unit, he presented with increased and intolerable phantom pain and stump pain. He described the pain as stabbing with an intensity of 9/10 on the visual analogue scale. The pain lasted for a few minutes and reoccurred at 30\u201360 minute intervals. It was accentuated when pressure was applied to the medial side of the limb stump () and the Tinel's sign was confirmed by pressing on the point.

The option of treatment at that time was an arthrodesis of the left hip. Having presented with the history of trauma, we did not take into consideration a proximal femoral malignancy. However, Ungureanu et al. stated in their study that tumoral growths can be kept hidden under adipose tissue or local swelling located at the thigh level and they could appear concurrently with trauma . Therefore, the differential diagnosis was made using the patient history and the CT description given by the radiology specialist. A standard emergency anteroposterior radiograph revealed an intertrochanteric fracture, severe deformity of the left hip joint, and the migrated implants used for the arthrodesis (Fig. ). Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the left hip joint showed a displaced intertrochanteric fracture distal to the ankylosed hip joint, some artifacts due to the osteosynthesis material, and marked atrophy of the gluteus muscles (Fig. ). Due to the rarity of the pathology, several discussions with fellow surgeons were needed to establish what the best therapeutic option was. We decided to perform a surgery to remove the osteosynthesis material used for arthrodesis of the left hip and then perform the internal fixation using a locking plate and locked screws (Fig. ). The patient was positioned in dorsal decubitus; we used a lateral approach (a skin incision reaching approximately 5 cm proximal and 15 cm distal from what used to be the tip of the greater trochanter). Intraoperative passive mobilization of the limb was realized to outline some intraoperative anatomical landmarks. After initial hardware removal, normal femoral rotation was re-established and checked intraoperatively using the C-arm.

The patient had undergone endoscopic sinus surgery 12 years previously and had no other history of surgery or trauma. At the ophthalmology outpatient clinic, she received no definitive diagnosis and did not undergo treatment. After 2 years, the mass became larger and was accompanied by pain. For these symptoms, she visited the ophthalmology outpatient clinic again and the ophthalmologist referred her to the outpatient clinic of the department of plastic and reconstructive surgery. About 4 days prior to presentation, she had experienced swelling in her right eye area, frequent secretion of tears, and severe headaches. On physical examination, a palpable mass was observed in the right upper medial eyelid area. The mass was soft but fixed, and the patient complained of sensory disturbances in the right supraorbital nerve region. On an ophthalmic examination, the degree of exophthalmos was 21 mm on the right side and 17 mm on the left side, and eye protrusion and lateral displacement of the right eyeball were observed (). Computed tomography (CT) was performed, and an expanding cyst measuring 3.8\u00d7 2.8 cm was observed over the frontal and right ethmoid sinuses (). In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, and cystic fluid filling the frontal and right ethmoid sinuses was found to have invaded the right orbit.

An abdominal ultrasound demonstrated the presence of cholelithiasis and biliary sludge. The patient was diagnosed with symptomatic cholelithiasis and laparoscopic cholecystectomy was recommended to the patient on an elective basis. At the beginning of the procedure the peritoneal cavity was inspected with no masses, scar tissue or other abnormal pathology noted. During dissection of the gallbladder there were chronic omental adhesions noted but the gallbladder was not acutely inflamed. The cholecystectomy was able to be performed without complication and the gallbladder was sent for histopathological assessment. The pathology report was consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma with signet ring features consistent with metastatic lobular carcinoma as well as chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis (see , ). Breast biomarker studies performed on the gallbladder were significant for PASD positive staining, antibodies that were positive included CK88, CK7, BRST2, and GATA3 (see ). Estrogen and progesterone receptors were both strongly positive, HER2 was negative.\nAt her follow-up appointment in the office a focused breast history and physical exam was performed. The patient denied family history of breast cancer. Full risk stratification and oncologic workup was pursued. Her BMI was 32.4, age of menarche was 13, her first pregnancy was at age 35, menopause began at 37 years old at which time she briefly was placed on estrogen therapy. She denied family history of cancer. She had a right breast lumpectomy in 2012 with benign pathology. Her last mammogram was in 2018 with no concerning findings at that time. A Gail score was calculated revealing a 12.5 % lifetime risk of breast cancer.\nBreast MRI revealed several spiculated masses in her right and left breasts as well as suspicious bilateral axillary lymph nodes. Potential areas of osseous metastasis were noted in her sternum and several ribs (see ). The study was deemed as BI-RADS 5",

During her pregnancy, the lowest platelet count was 80,000 per liter at 27 weeks of gestation and no specific intervention has been done except for regular monitoring of the platelet count. She had been diagnosed with gestational hypertension at 22 weeks of gestation and prescribed labetalol and methyldopa. Other than that, she has had few erythematous, itchy macular lesions over the palm of her right hand from early in the first trimester onwards and had persisted throughout the pregnancy. She has had mild pain in her right small finger from first trimester onwards. But she had not worried about these symptoms so they had gone unnoticed. She had been apparently well until late 28 weeks of gestation and then she has developed a severe headache and worsening of bilateral lower limb oedema with frothy urine leading to hospitalization. She was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia (blood pressure of 185/115 mmHg) at 29 weeks of gestation. An emergency caesarean delivery was arranged soon after this presentation. Her baby was admitted to the premature baby unit with a birth weight of 1000 grams. She was in intensive care unit in first 24 hours after delivery and received intravenous magnesium sulphate as a prophylactic anticonvulsant.\nHer pain in the right finger worsened after delivery and erythematous macular lesions have been increased in number and spreading over the dorsal aspect of the right forearm.

Biopsies of the damaged tissue showed an invasive, grade III ductal carcinoma, with areas of papillary shaping, areas of necrosis, and invasion of the skin. The breast tumour was classified as triple negative, since there was a lack of estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and absence of HER2 oncoprotein after immunohistochemical staining. Staging revealed multiple lung metastases and enlargement of right axillary lymph nodes. Consequently, she was diagnosed with a stage IV infiltrating ductal cancer in her right breast which was triple negative and grade III.\nThe patient was started on first line chemotherapy with the regimen carboplatin 2AUC and paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly plus bevacizumab 10 mg/Kgr on days 1 and 15. Initially she had a partial response to this treatment. However, her disease relapsed and she started on second line chemotherapy with the regimen docetaxel 75 mg/m2, adriamycin 60 mg/m2, and cytoxan 600 mg/m2 every 21 days. She received only two cycles of this chemotherapy because she was admitted to hospital due to multiple brain metastases. She was administered whole brain radiotherapy with minimal improvement of her clinical symptoms. Taking into account the triple negative, along with the BRCA1 mutation status, the patient was considered as a candidate for entering a clinical trial with PARP inhibitors. Unfortunately, due to a rapid systemic disease progression the patient finally passed away a month later and therefore did not receive any further treatment.\nThe proband had limited family history of breast or ovarian cancer. It is noteworthy that the family was rather small (). Her grandmother from her father's side was diagnosed with breast cancer and died at her early fifties.

Her breast symptoms arose 5 years ago and had been worsening. She could not visit a hospital because she expected for naturally healing and feared noticing cancer and death. She had a history of atrial fibrillation and cerebral infarction 2 months earlier, then her breast lesion was found out. The area of erythema was 15 \u00d7 15 cm2. Her nipple and alveolar complex were destroyed and had an uncertain shape. Her skin erythema was soft, and no tumor was palpable (Fig. ). Her quality of life had got worse by hemorrhage and exudate from the tumor, and she felt strong anxiety about getting more worse and death from the cancer.\nA punch biopsy indicated mammary Paget\u2019s disease. Computed tomography showed that the tumor was only on the surface of the breast, with no metastasis including of the axillar lymph nodes. There was no underlying tumor in the breast (Fig. ).\nEven though our patient was a very elderly woman with comorbidities and her prognosis was relatively good, her symptoms were intolerable. By the request of her and her family, we decided to perform surgery to eliminate the area of erythema after receiving sufficient informed consent. The surgical treatment was performed by two teams that included surgeons and dermatologists. We drew a resection line 1 cm from the skin erythema. Dermatologists were on standby in case a skin graft was needed. We performed muscle-sparing mastectomy with sampling of an axillar lymph node. We added two stress-relaxation sutures to avoid diastasis because the excision area was very large and the tension of the skin flap was strong (Fig. a, b).

He had a history of two previous lateral patellar dislocations on same knee. The first event was 15 years prior, when his knee twisted in flexed position while pushing a car.

The second event was four years prior, when he sustained an injury while pushing a van, this time with the right knee fully extended. On this occasion, his patella spontaneously reduced and he did not seek any medical intervention. Our patient had no other significant past medical or surgical history and explained his right knee was completely asymptomatic prior to this current event.\nOn examination, there was an obvious deformity suggesting lateral displacement of the patella with a sulcus in the skin evident over the femoral groove. Furthermore, the knee was held fixed in 15 degrees of flexion. Due to patient positioning difficulties we were unable to obtain true AP and lateral views on X-ray. The radiographs demonstrated a laterally displaced and a mal-rotated patella in the vertical plane (see Figs. and ). A manipulation under sedation was attempted unsuccessfully. A further attempt of reduction under a femoral nerve block had again been unsuccessful.\nOur patient was subsequently taken to theatre where one final attempt of closed reduction was carried out under general anaesthetic and muscle relaxation.

Based on the clinical examination and the evaluation of radiographs (panoramic radiograph () and computed tomography of the maxilla with DentalScan reconstructions), it was decided to treat the atrophic upper jaw with a combined sinus lift procedure and local ridge augmentation using bone grafts in the areas from 1.4 to 1.6, performed under general anesthesia. In addition, it was decided to conserve not compromised teeth until the bone grafts were integrated in order to proceed, in a second phase, with implant placement and immediate loading.\nThe patient was adequately informed about the use of FFB grafts and the subsequent implant-prosthetic treatment plan. The preoperative phase included blood tests, an interview with the anesthesiologist for the general anesthesia, the signature of the informed consent form for the surgery, the test to determine the patient's blood group, and the signature of a specific informed consent form for the bone graft from the Tissue Bank. Once the preliminary phase was completed, the tissue specimen was then booked at the reference Tissue Bank, and in particular, a specimen harvested from the iliac crest was required.\nInitially, the avulsion of the element 16 was performed and after 40 days, the reconstructive surgery was programmed.

The patient was first diagnosed with hepatitis C in 1990, and subsequently diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1991 by liver biopsy. At that time he was briefly treated with interferon, but sustained a severe allergic reaction following his fourth dose prompting discontinuation. In February of 2007, he developed worsening fatigue and sought care from his primary care physician. A computed tomographic (CT) scan was performed which demonstrated a small, irregular-appearing liver consistent with cirrhosis, but no liver masses were appreciated and the portal venous system was patent (Fig. ). An alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was noted to be elevated at 7,100 ng/ml in September of 2007. A CT scan was repeated in October of 2007 and demonstrated thrombus within the left portal vein (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging of the liver was performed and demonstrated cirrhosis with left portal vein occlusion. A heterogeneous nodular mass had replaced the entire left lobe of the liver and the caudate lobe of the liver with evidence of increased enhancement. There was another heterogeneous lesion with abnormally increased signal intensity in the medial segment of the left lobe measuring 2 cm in diameter. Both of these lesions were highly suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A metastatic evaluation was negative and a repeat AFP level was 24,100 ng/ml. The patient was referred to an outside institution for transplant evaluation, and was deemed unsuitable due to evidence of an infiltrating form of HCC with evidence of portal vein thrombosis. By December of 2007, the patient's AFP level had increased to 194,000 ng/ml. A CT scan at that time demonstrated extensive thrombus within the main portal vein near the bifurcation that extended into the right and left portal veins. Sorafenib was started at a dose of 400 mg twice daily in January of 2008. The AFP level decreased to 84,800 ng/ml and continued to exhibit a remarkable decline to 7,300",

According to her parent, the swelling started as a small roundish and hard mass around the area below the right eye. It gradually, but consistently increased in size resulting in severe facial deformity. There was no significant medical history apart from the notable bending of spine which was noted as the child was growing and episodes of per vaginal bleeding which were noted when the patient was 5 years old.\nGeneral examination revealed an otherwise healthy young girl, who was well oriented to her surroundings, with her spine bent to the right (scoliosis), irregular skin pigmentation on the right side of the chest and back, slightly enlarged breasts, vaginal bleeding and some sparsely distributed pubic hair. Her body stature, however, was normal for her age. On local examination of the craniofacial region, the patient had bilateral frontal bossing. She also had facial asymmetry due to a massive oval shaped exophytic mass on the right side of face that measured approximately 24 by 17 cm. The mass slightly crossed the midline, the overlying skin was hyperemic and shiny with visible dilated blood vessels. The right eye was displaced superiorly without any visual disturbance. The nose was displaced towards the left side, with occlusion of the right nostril. The overstretched overlying skin had normal temperature and could not be folded.

However, transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound examination revealed a 6.0 \u00d7 5.5 \u00d7 5.9 cm vascular mass within the right pelvis with a clear arterial feeder and turbulent swirling intraluminal flow, leading to the diagnosis of a pseudoaneurysm (Fig. ). The diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig. ). The patient was discussed in our multidisciplinary team meeting with interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons, and anaesthetists. The risk of imminent rupture was assessed as high due to the severity of her symptoms and a 5\u201310 mm overall increase in the size of the pseudoaneurysm documented by sequential MRI 14 days apart. Surgery was considered high risk and so selective embolization of the pseudoaneurysm was performed. This was performed under local anaesthetic in the Interventional Radiology suite with full preparation for emergency delivery by the obstetric and anaesthetic team in case of fetal distress. The right uterine artery was identified angiographically from a contralateral femoral arterial puncture and selectively catheterised using a microcatheter. The artery was small but extravasation into the presumed pseudoaneurysm was identified near its proximal portion. The artery was embolised with a series of microcoils across the neck of the pseudoaneurysm to block flow. The procedure was uneventful and the fetus showed a continuous reactive heart rate pattern. Follow up ultrasound showed a completely thrombosed pseudoaneurysm with no flow. She had regular follow ups in the antenatal clinic with no sign of recurrence.

He was known to have peripheral vascular occlusive disease with documented stenosis in both common iliac arteries (CIA), the left external iliac artery (EIA) and common femoral artery and occlusion of the right EIA.\nHis other relevant medical history includes a renal transplant, for which he takes regular prednisolone and azathioprine. He also had ischaemic heart disease with recent cardiac drug eluting stent insertion necessitating dual antiplatelet agent therapy and a coronary artery bypass graft in 1996.\nClinically he was aypyrexic with compromised circulation to his leg, which was pale but warm, and were absent of pulses on the affected side. There was a 1 cm wide ulcer located in the gaiter area, and a 3 cm wide ulcer located in the middle third of his lower leg posteriorly. Both lesions had a punched out appearance, with evident necrosis and no discharge or foul smell. He had a normal white cell count, a CRP count of 240 mg/L, potassium levels of 5.8 mmol/L and a creatinine level of 232 \u03bcmol/L.\nHis ankle brachial pressure index values were 0.23 on the right and 0.40 on the left. An arterial Doppler study showed no change in his occlusive disease, with patent, highly calcified vessels distally with poor flow. Doppler ultrasound studies of his transplanted kidney was normal.\nTo preserve renal function, a lower leg angiogram was performed using carbon dioxide. This showed an occluded right EIA and stenosed left CIA, with otherwise patent superficial femoral arteries bilaterally.\nWhile undergoing medical assessment for a right EIA endarterectomy and left EIA stenting, the ulcers progressed in size necessitating a surgical debridement. Tissue samples from the initial debridement were sent for histopathology and microbiology.\nDespite debridement to healthy tissue and skin, there was significant deterioration of the margins as well as new areas of necrosis",

    "original_text": "A 17-year-old female patient visited the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology with a complaint of swelling in the lower jaw that had begun 5-6 months earlier. The lesion had progressively increased in size and been painful beginning two months earlier. There was no anesthesia or paresthesia of the lower lip, chin, or jaw, and there was no history of trauma.\nOn extraoral examination, the swelling in the mandibular anterior region measured about 8 cm\u00d75 cm extending about 4 cm from the midline bilaterally (). Superoinferiorly, it extended from the lower lip to the lower border of the mandible. The skin over the swelling and the surrounding area appeared normal and the margins were diffuse. On palpation, there was no local rise in temperature, but the swelling was tender, especially in the anterior region. Intraoral examination revealed swelling 7 cm\u00d75 cm obliterating the buccal and lingual vestibule extending bilaterally to the buccal sulcus of the first permanent left mandibular molar and first permanent right mandibular molar and measuring about 3.5 cm from the midline bilaterally (). The expansion of the lingual cortex in the midline region was remarkable. The swelling was bony hard in consistency. The crowns of the mandibular anterior teeth were tipped mesially. The left lateral incisor, right central incisor, and right lateral incisor were grade 2 mobile. Grade 1 mobility was present in the permanent first molar in the left mandibular region and the permanent central incisor in the left mandibular region was clinically missing. The teeth were nontender on percussion. The teeth associated with the swelling - the incisors, canines, premolars and first molars of the left and right side of the mandible - gave a negative response to a vitality test. Since the expansile lesion with clinically aggressive behavior was associated with a missing tooth, a working diagnosis of ameloblastoma was considered. Other odontogenic cysts and tumors including dentigerous cyst and odontogenic keratocyst were considered in the differential diagnosis.\nThe patient was subjected to radiographic examination",
