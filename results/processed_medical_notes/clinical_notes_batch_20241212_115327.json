She had been seen initially for antenatal care at a gestational age of 16 weeks, and had a total of two antenatal visits. Her pregnancy was thought to be uncomplicated during these visits. On admission to the labour ward, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, pulse 110 beats/minutes and respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute. Her abdomen was distended with a fundal height corresponding to 32 weeks with hypogastric tenderness. Fetal heart rate could not be established by fetoscope. Her laboratory results showed hemoglobin of 6 g/dl and urinalysis with 20 leukocytes per high power field. An ultrasound examination revealed a live intrauterine pregnancy at 31 weeks of gestation but the lie of the fetus and location of the placenta were not established. The impression of the admitting doctor was of an intrauterine pregnancy complicated by anemia and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient received iron supplements, oral nitrofurantoin 500 mg every 8 hours for 5 days and paracetamol; her pain subsided, and she was admitted to the ward for follow-up and further investigation. Two days later, the case was reviewed by senior doctors on the ward, at that time, the patient continued to have generalized abdominal pain, and on examination she was found to have generalized abdominal tenderness with rebound tenderness and easily palpable fetal parts. A provisional diagnosis of abdominal pregnancy was made and an urgent repeat abdomino-pelvic ultrasound examination was performed. The ultrasound revealed an empty bulky uterus, a viable fetus in the abdominal cavity at 31 weeks, and a placenta attached anterior to the uterus. The decision was made to do an emergency laparotomy based on clinical features of peritonitis. Under general anesthesia and through sub-umbilical midline incision, the uterus was found to be empty",

The pain was weak when in the supine position, but it was aggravated when rising up or moving, so that the patient could not carry out the movements and activities of daily living. A pertinent part of the patient's history was that she had received conservative treatments in another hospital for right LBP and right radicular leg pain, six months before the visit.

According to the physical examination, right radicular leg pain was developing along the dermatomes of the 4, 5th lumbar nerve roots. In the straight leg raising test, the degree was limited to 45 for the right leg and the pain was aggravated by extension and flexion of lumbar spine part.

She-like her father- has sickle cell trait. Throughout her life so far, she has not had any acute episode of sickle cell-related symptoms like severe, acute chest pain. However, she states about a year prior, she had the same hip pain. She went to her primary care provider, who gave her hip cortisone injections. These helped for a few weeks. She then went on vacation a month later. Her feet became swollen during this time, prompting her to visit her primary doctor again. At this time, she was referred to the orthopedic clinic. She had severe groin pain with internal and external rotation of her hip. X-rays were done of her hip, which showed an area of necrosis suggestive of stage 1 or 2 AVN in the head of the right femur. An MRI was done and showed stage 2 or 3 AVN. This can be seen in Fig. .\nShe was then prescribed bisphosphonates, told to walk with no weight bearing on the right leg, and scheduled for a decompression procedure several weeks later. The plan after surgery was to be minimal weight bearing for 6 weeks as well as continuing therapy with Alendronate, a bisphosphonate. After decompression, the patient\u2019s pain subsided. Two weeks after surgery, the patient presented for follow-up and suture removal. She was in high spirits as her pain and overall anxiety had subsided. She had not felt pain free in quite some time.

At the time of admission to the oncology department on March 2016, the patient's general condition was good with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1, and he did not have any specific disease history. He complained of a palpable left inguinal mass (), and histology of the resected inguinal mass revealed invasive breast cancer of ectopic breast origin. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed it to be hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative. The tumor was 28 mm in size, and the resection margin was clear. Subcutis and muscle involvement were noted, but there was no lymphovascular or perineural invasion. The tumor cells had an estrogen receptor (ER) score of 8, a progesterone receptor (PR) score of 8, and a Ki-67 labeling index of 10%. The histologic grade was 3 (). The patient had no family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and no pathogenic germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) 1/2 mutations were identified in the peripheral blood. However, an unclassified genetic variation of BRCA2 was detected (). Although 4 cycles of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC) regimen followed by twelve cycles of weekly paclitaxel were planned as adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient completed only 8 cycles of weekly paclitaxel after 4 cycles of AC because he developed grade 2 neuropathy. Thereafter, tamoxifen was started without evidence of disease relapse at that time.\nIn October 2016, enlargement of the left inguinal mass was noted, and further analysis revealed adenocarcinoma with abundant mucin pools. The recurrent tumor cells showed an ER score of 8, a PR score of 8, HER2-negative, and a Ki-67 labeling index of 10%.

Intubation was performed for airway protection and respiratory distress. The only visible injury was a fracture deformity to his left hand. An initial chest radiograph (CXR) demonstrated a widened mediastinum (Fig. ). An abdominal ultrasound was positive for free fluid and the patient was taken immediately to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy.\nDuring the abdominal exploration, multiple mesenteric injuries were identified and repaired. An abbreviated damage control laparotomy with packing was performed. A left-sided chest tube was inserted and drained ~800 ml of blood without continued hemorrhage.\nHe was taken directly for a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest and body for evaluation of the mediastinum. The CTA confirmed a 5.9 cm \u00d7 3.9 cm \u00d7 6.9 cm contained rupture of the descending thoracic aorta (Fig. ). The vascular and interventional radiology team took the patient immediately for an angiogram with aortic endograft stenting.\nBilateral femoral arteries were accessed and an aortic endovascular stent was deployed to cover the area of injury. During the procedure, the patient developed significant hemorrhage from the left chest and became hypotensive. An emergent left thoracotomy was performed and the mediastinum was packed temporarily while the vascular team deployed an additional two stents over the area of injury, including the origin of the left subclavian artery. This resulted in exclusion of the aortic injury with no signs of radiographic leak.\nThe patient required massive transfusion resuscitation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed for the exsanguinating hemorrhage. The patient had multiple episodes of cardiac arrest and required internal defibrillation as well.

    "original_text": "A 45-year-old woman presented to our hospital with multiple lung nodules. She had a history of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma, diagnosed 7 months prior to admission, at an outside hospital. The patient was healthy otherwise and reported no radiation exposure or any family history of thyroid cancer. The initial work-up at the time of discovery of the right thyroid nodule included fine needle aspiration and core biopsy, with findings consistent with poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The patient then underwent a total thyroidectomy and central neck lymph node dissection. The pathologic diagnosis from the outside hospital reported a 2.8 \u00d7 2.4 \u00d7 1.1 cm tumor in the right thyroid without extrathyroidal extension or lymph node metastasis. However, both capsular invasion and extensive vascular space invasion were noted. Based on the tumor size, tumor extension and lymph node status, the tumor was designated as Stage II (pT2 pN0 pMx). IHC staining showed that the tumor cells were positive for thyroglobulin and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1). An immunostain for p53 was also performed at the outside hospital and showed a small focus (< 1 cm) with p53 positivity, suggesting a diagnosis of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.\nAt our institution, the diagnosis was revised, based on review of both the primary thyroid tumor and the current lung metastases. Both tumors were remarkable for biphasic malignant components: the carcinoma and the sarcoma. The carcinoma component showed a poorly differentiated microfollicular type thyroid carcinoma, composed of sheets and islands of tightly packed thyroid follicles with dense colloid. The tumor nuclei were small and round with vesicular chromatin, resembling those of typical poorly differentiated follicular thyroid carcinoma. Admixed with the epithelial component were malignant spindle cells with small round blue cell type morphology. Focally, rhabdomyosarcoma-like cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm were appreciated. No heterologous cartilage or bone components were identified. The IHC staining performed at the outside hospital showed that the thyroid carcinoma (epithelial) component was positive for thyroglobulin, PAX8 and TTF1 (Fig. ). The sarcoma",

Radiological interpretation suggested that this focus most likely represented either severe dental disease or a metastatic focus. Few months later, the patient developed severe pain in her mandible, for which dental evaluation led to a tooth extraction.

CT scan of the mandible () demonstrated a mandibular body bony lesion on the left with adjacent soft tissue stranding, again interpreted to be concerning for a metastatic bone lesion. Bone scintigram () demonstrated expansion of the mandibular lesion and slight progression of the multiple other skeletal metastases.\nA referral was made to radiation oncology due to worsening jaw pain unresponsive to narcotic medications and imaging findings suggestive of a metastasis. Without exposed bone on physical exam, it was felt that she would benefit from palliative radiotherapy (RT) for her presumed mandibular metastasis. She underwent RT to her jaw lesion to a total dose of 2000 cGy in 5 fractions of 400 cGy each using a 3D-conformal technique. However, after the RT, the patient's jaw pain continued to worsen.

    "original_text": "A 66-year-old Japanese man undergoing hemodialysis for chronic renal failure was referred to our hospital with suspected duodenal cancer. On physical examination, his abdomen was soft and flat without symptoms. Tumor markers were within normal limits, and laboratory findings were normal except for renal dysfunction due to chronic renal failure. Upper gastric endoscopy revealed a giant polypoid-type tumor extending from the duodenum bulb to the pyloric ring; its main location was thought to be the duodenum bulb (). The surface of the tumor was rough, but its outline was clear. A biopsy of the tumor showed atypical papillous epithelium containing goblet cells, and nuclei in the epithelium were p53-positive. An endoscopic ultrasound test suggested that the tumor might invade the muscular tunic (). A computed tomography scan revealed a slightly enhanced lobular tumor (54 mm \u00d7 34 mm) protruding into the duodenum bulb, although serosal invasion was not detected (). Positron emission tomography showed an accumulation of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (60 mm \u00d7 34 mm, maximum standardized uptake value = 5.6) in the area extending from the antrum of the stomach to the duodenum bulb (). Because indications of endoscopic mucosal resection were not favored, the giant polypoid-type early gastric cancer that was expressed on the pyloric ring and confined within the mucosal layer was curatively removed via abdominal surgery. We performed a submucosal resection via an incision in the gastric anterior wall. The resected tumor was localized in the anterior wall of pyrolic ring. Intraoperative histopathological diagnosis with a frozen section suggested that the tumor contained adenocarcinoma components; therefore, we performed distal gastrectomy followed by Billroth II reconstruction. The extent of resection was from the lesser curvature of stomach, which was 5 cm from the pyrolic ring, to the duodenum, which was 4 cm from the pyrolic ring.

The child had ingested a small metallic toy \u2013 a decorative item attached to the upper pocket of his shirt \u2013 about an hour ago. We found that the vital parameters (pulse, blood pressure, and respiratory rate) were normal and stable. However, the child had continuous drooling of saliva, potentially indicating an inability to swallow. Based on these findings, our primary goal was to determine the position of the FB by a radiological examination and manage the child appropriately.\nWe found that the metallic body in the shape of a cycle was lodged in the upper esophagus []. We decided to remove FB endoscopically using an esophagoscope under general anesthesia. The child was placed in a supine position with an extended neck. Two anesthetists monitored the child for vital parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate) and management of endotracheal tube ventilation. The FB was dislodged from the esophageal wall, and the procedure was atraumatic. Due to the shape of the metal, we faced difficulties during removal. Thus, we used meticulous and gentle manipulation around the edge of the metallic FB and performed the procedure over a sufficient amount of time so as to dislodge the body from the impacted esophageal mucosa without causing any trauma or bleeding from the adjacent site. On removal, we found that the FB was about 1.5 inches in size []. The object was made of aluminum with a probable mixture of other unknown metals. We finished the removal of the FB in 20 min. The entire procedure from intubation to extubation lasted for 45 min.

In the past two weeks, the baby was suffering from a gradually severe soft tissues swelling on his left face. Two days before admission to our hospital, the pain and tenderness of left face became worse. As a result, the patient was referred to our hospital for examination and treatment. There was no history of any trauma to head and neck. Physical examination showed the patient had a mild soft tissues edema on his left upper face and severe pain was elicited upon pressure. There was no fever, weight loss and no palpable lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. The laboratory results, including blood count, differential, liver and renal function, were within the normal range. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head revealed multifocal osteolytic lesions in the facial bones, including left zygomatic bone (measuring 1.5 \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 cm in size), left orbital bone (measuring 0.5 cm in diameter) and right maxillary bone (measuring 1.0 cm in diameter). The most of left zygoma was observed to be destroyed and associated soft tissue mass was also noted (Figure ). The lesions showed moderate enhancement after meglumine diatrizoate injection. There was no enlarged lymph node found in head and neck. A CT scan of neck and abdomen showed no pathologic findings, particularly no lymphadenopathy could be observed. A CT guided needle biopsy was performed on left zygomatic bone initially, but histopathological examination showed pieces of fibrosis with infiltration of inflammatory cells. From the clinical and radiographic evaluations, the lesion was preoperatively diagnosed as Langerhans cell histiocytosis (eosinophilic granuloma) of bone.

His physical examination was positive for tenderness upon palpation of his left flank. The initial laboratory evaluation showed normal. The computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis showed left moderate hydronephrosis and an upper ureteral stone was measured at 1.3 cm. Our patient was diagnosed with left upper ureteral stone with moderate hydronephrosis. The procedure of PCNL was carried out. A ureteral catheter was inserted retrogradely into the left pelvic under ureteroscopy. The puncture target calix was the middle posterior calix. The puncture site of the target calyceal fornix was localized under C-arm radiological monitoring using contrast agent injected through ureteral catheter, producing a retrograde pyelography (RP). An 18 gauge, 2 piece entry needle was used. Clear urine was seen when the needle stylet was removed. When we injected the contrast agent into his left collecting system through the puncture needle, we were able to see his left renal vein (Fig. ). Moreover, we could identify that the location of the puncture needle tip was not optimal, the reason was that the puncture needle tip was located outside the collecting system near the calyceal infundibulum. At the moment, the patient had a hemodynamic stability and the puncture needle was maintained in its original place. Additional lower pole calix puncture was performed under radiological monitoring. Clear urine was also seen when the needle stylet was removed.

The peak headache lasted for approximately 24 hours and thereafter she was left with a persistent lower grade headache which never waned. She denied having any further thunderclap headaches. With the original thunderclap headache she did not seek emergency attention. She saw her PCP the following day and had a brain MRI with and without gadolinium within 7 days which was reportedly normal with no evidence of subarachnoid blood. No lumbar puncture was ever completed. Her persistent daily headache was typically of moderate severity (4-5/10 VAS) and was localized to the right occipito-nuchal region. There was never any pain free time and she experienced intermittent associated symptoms including nausea and photophobia. She never experienced any cranial autonomic associated symptoms. The patient denied any headache triggering or alleviating maneuvers. She could not identify any precipitating event just prior to the onset of her daily persistent headache including no viral infection, stressful life event and she had not had any surgical procedures. She was on citalopram at the time of headache onset although she denied the use of marijuana, ecstasy or pseudoephedrine. In addition to head pain the patient also complained of having issues with numbers including doing simple addition and subtraction, recognizing the order of numbers and even recognizing certain numbers.

Two years later, she developed a second vaginal cuff recurrence as well as distant metastatic disease and was referred for palliative brachytherapy to a 2.4 \u00d7 2.7 cm necrotic vaginal cuff mass causing progressive vaginal bleeding. Due to her prior treatment, the vaginal canal was very stenotic, and our narrowest commercial applicator could not be comfortably inserted. We therefore decided to print a vaginal cylinder applicator of 2 cm diameter, with a central catheter channel as well as six evenly spaced longitudinal surface grooves for interstitial brachytherapy to the vaginal cuff mass (). Distance between surface grooves was 1 cm. We used the same printing process and equipment as described for patient 1.\nAt the time of treatment, two marker seeds were placed at the vaginal cuff. The patient underwent free-hand trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided interstitial brachytherapy. During this procedure, trans-rectal ultrasound was used to guide free-hand placement of flexible 30 cm interstitial catheters into the para-vaginal and vaginal cuff tissue. Additional catheters were placed along the surface and central channels of the vaginal cylinder to allow further dose modulation. The cylinder was secured to the vagina using sutures, and the catheters were secured to the cylinder using dental putty. For this patient, the final implant consisted of nine interstitial catheters, with six surface catheters around the cylinder, one central catheter, and two paravaginal catheters ().

She was diagnosed with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation vs. possible long QT syndrome. Five days after presentation, a dual chamber single coil ICD (Medtronic Inc., St. Paul, MN) was placed for secondary prevention, and she was discharged following a 1 week hospitalization. Three months later, she experienced her first ICD shock. She was sitting down, and began to feel lightheaded, then lost consciousness. She was shocked a total of three times, though she does not remember this. Upon waking, she noticed a pain in the anterior chest radiating to her arm. Interrogation of her ICD revealed she had also received an appropriate shock for an episode of ventricular fibrillation while asleep several days earlier, though she had no memory of this. Device interrogation revealed that the patient had exhibited antitachycardia pacing during defibrillator charging, which had disorganized the ventricular tachycardia into polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. She was hospitalized for defibrillator threshold testing, in order to ascertain the likelihood that her ICD could successfully terminate a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Unfortunately, due to a high defibrillation threshold, 6 attempts to elicit ventricular tachycardia termination were unsuccessful. To decrease the risk of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias requiring ICD shocks, the patient was referred for consideration of BCSD.\nNotable for recurrent syncopal episodes with loss of consciousness dating back to high school.

The patient reported early satiety, a 30 lb. weight loss over 3 weeks and was unable to tolerate anything by mouth. Additionally, the patient had developed a left lateral neck mass which progressively increased in size over the past 9 months. Patient denied tenderness to palpation of the mass and dysphagia. His past medical history was significant for papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, GERD, chronic hepatitis C, polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). His past surgical history was remarkable for thyroid malignancy treatment with radioactive iodine and total thyroidectomy in addition to a gunshot wound. Family and social history were not significant. On physical exam, a left supraclavicular soft tissue mass 6 cm in diameter was appreciated, it was non-tender with no submandibular lymphadenopathy. A soft tissue mass was also palpable on the anterior abdominal wall in the epigastric region.\nGiven the patient's malignant history, significant weight loss in the past 3 weeks with increasing left mass size, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, the patient was admitted for further evaluation. Initial studies included ultrasound of the abdomen for workup of acute pancreatitis with findings unremarkable for the body of the pancreas and the head and tail not being visualized. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed pulmonary nodules in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe of the lung and bronchiectasis of the left lower lobe, PKD and bilateral hepatic cysts. Oncology was consulted, and a CT of the chest and neck were ordered in addition to a chest X-ray that was remarkable for two pulmonary nodules with an enlarged paratracheal node. Pulmonology was consulted, and the patient was recommended to follow-up in 6 months for surveillance of the pulmonary nodules. ENT and Surgery were consulted, and an excisional lymph node biopsy was pursued due to suspicion of possible recurrence of previous thyroid",

He was athletic, self-reliant and had no cognitive impairment. During the last 28 years, he had experienced 8-10 heterogeneous episodes of acute neurological symptoms, such as central facial palsy, hemiparesis, and non-fluent aphasia, lasting from seconds to 3-4 hours. Precerebral duplex and electrocardiography (ECG) were performed several times with normal results, and EEG registration and 24-hour Holter monitoring had been normal. Previous MRI scans showed no abnormal restricted diffusion, as seen in acute cerebral infarcts, but infarct sequelae in the left temporal lobe and both thalami. Several years later, three additional infarct sequelae were detected in the cerebellum. The patient was treated with platelet inhibitors, and medications and dosages were adjusted after new episodes. There was no suspicion of lack of compliance. Except from age, migraine, and previous smoking, with cessation 35 years ago, he had no known risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. On the current admission, he presented with reduced motor speed in his left arm and leg. Electrocardiography and Holter monitoring showed no signs of atrial fibrillation. CT and MRI revealed multiple, cortical infarct sequelae in the anterior and posterior circulation territories of both hemispheres, and MRI also detected two acute embolic infarcts in the right occipital lobe and one in the left parietal lobe (Figure ). CT and MRI angiograms and duplex sonography did not show significant plaques or stenoses, and pre- and intracerebral flow were normal with asymmetrical vertebral arteries, which were considered a normal anatomical variant. Cortical infarcts in several vascular territories strongly suggest cardioembolic etiology, but transthoracic echocardiogram showed no cardiac sources of emboli, and there was no sign of left atrial enlargement, which may be seen in the presence of atrial fibrillation. The patient concurred to further diagnostic tests aiming to determine the cause of recurrent cerebral emboli, although he was informed that the results would not necessarily alter treatment recommendations.",

More specifically, its anatomical contribution was extending to the anterior limb and the genu of the right internal capsule, and in the nearby territory of the globus pallidus.

The patient underwent a detailed cardiologic work up, which included a transesophageal echocardiographic examination. It revealed the presence of a patent foramen ovale (capillary subtype) and a patent ductus arteriosus (, ).\nBased on these findings, the patient was immediately treated with anticoagulation therapy. Despite that, he developed a second episode of arterial ischemic stroke 9 months later. The neurological evaluation after the second ictus revealed complete left-sided hemiparesis with involvement of the musculature of the ipsilateral half of the face.\nHe underwent a radiological evaluation with a new CT scan, which revealed an extensive area of hypointensity, extending to the mesencephalon-pontine region the dimensions of the basal ganglia infarction were significantly reduced. An additional new infarction territory was recognized, in the area of the right cerebellar hemisphere, lateral to the vermis. The anatomic substrate of the new stroke could be attributed to a second stroke that developed in the region that is nourished from the perforators of the basal artery, near its terminal bifurcation.

The chest X-ray showed a tumor shadow in the upper-middle field of the right lung with pleural effusion and a tumor shadow in the upper field of the left lung (). Computed tomography (CT) of the neck and chest revealed that the tumor shadows had been caused by a substernal goiter connected to the thyroid gland in the neck.

He had mixed aphasia, eye gaze to the right, shallow left nasal and labial groove, mouth angle slanted to the right, left limb muscle strength grade 1, positive left side pathological signs, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 16 points. Emergency brain computed tomography (CT) showed a large cerebral infarction in the right frontal temporal parietal lobe. Chest CT revealed pulmonary edema and double lung inflammation.\nThere was a need to recanalize because of cerebrovascular occlusion, and the family members of the patient agreed to undergo endovascular interventional therapy. After successful right femoral artery puncture, the angiography guidewire could not pass through the aortic arch (Fig. A). 5F pigtail angiography showed that there was no development of the aortic arch or vessels above the arch. Considering the vascular variation, we performed a right radial artery puncture. Cerebral angiography was performed again and aortic arch interruption was clearly diagnosed (Fig. B). The right internal carotid artery was occluded (Fig. C), and the posterior communicating artery was opened. Considering the possibility of cardiogenic embolism, a middle catheter was used for thrombus aspiration of the right internal carotid artery, and a dark red thrombus was removed.

He was diagnosed with sarcoidosis by biopsy of a tumor in front of the right tibia 14 years before presentation. Since the tumor and abdominal lymphadenopathy were the only manifestation of sarcoidosis and no other signs of organ involvement were present, he received no immunosuppressive treatment. The abdominal lymphadenopathy had been stable over time. Nine years before presentation, he was referred to our nephrology clinic to determine the cause of chronic kidney disease. His serum creatinine level was 1.2 mg/dL and he had proteinuria of 0.4 g per day. Hematuria was not present. Renal biopsy revealed six globally sclerotic glomeruli among all 34 glomeruli (18%) and some residual glomeruli with segmental sclerosing lesions, but no involvement of sarcoidosis. He was diagnosed with primary FSGS. Since the proteinuria was mild, he did not receive immunosuppressive treatment.\nOne year after that, the patient experienced palpitations and was diagnosed with complete atrioventricular block. Coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis of the coronary arteries, and he underwent pacemaker implantation. Whether sarcoidosis contributed to the complete atrioventricular block was unclear. The abdominal lymphadenopathy and the dyskinesia of the ventricular septum were stable and did not progress over time.\nThe patient was stable for eight years, until when he started to suffer from sporadic gait and right face numbness that occurred and resolved within a day every few weeks. Three months later, the symptoms recurred along with sudden dysarthria and left limbs weakness. Physical findings were notable for pronator drift on the left side.

However, both capsular invasion and extensive vascular space invasion were noted. Based on the tumor size, tumor extension and lymph node status, the tumor was designated as Stage II (pT2 pN0 pMx). IHC staining showed that the tumor cells were positive for thyroglobulin and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1).

He had suffered an acute episode of myocarditis four years previously requiring hospital admission. He had no other relevant medical history and no family history of cardiac disease. He is a nonsmoker and consumed alcohol occasionally. Clinical examination was unremarkable and did not show any evidence of heart failure or systemic disease. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm without any ischemic changes, and chest X-ray showed no evidence of infection or heart failure. Routine blood tests including antinuclear antibody, creatinine kinase (CK), rheumatoid factor, and C-reactive protein were all within normal limits apart from an elevated cardiac troponin T with a peak value of 2700 ng/l (<14 ng/l). Further extensive inflammatory, viral, and autoimmune screening was carried out and found to be negative. Subsequent coronary angiogram showed normal coronary arteries, and transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >55% with trace mitral regurgitation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated extensive subepicardial and midwall late enhancement typical of myocarditis in the anterior, lateral, and inferior walls along with extensive fibrosis with normal LVEF ().\nA short course of steroids and anti-inflammatory medication as an inpatient resulted in the resolution of his myocarditis symptoms. The troponin T level normalized and the patient was discharged with a plan to repeat cardiac MRI in six months. On follow-up as an outpatient, it was decided to refer the patient to rheumatology for an opinion regarding ongoing immunomodulatory therapy. At this juncture, the patient stated that he also had symptoms of stiffness and aching in his calf muscles for quite some time but he did not consider it to be relevant.
