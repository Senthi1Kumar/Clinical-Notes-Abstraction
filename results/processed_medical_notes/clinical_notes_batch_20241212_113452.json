    "original_text": "A 57-year-old African-American male presented to the emergency department via emergency medicine service (EMS) with witnessed cardiac arrest. Patient reportedly was at work talking to a coworker when he collapsed and received immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on scene. Patient was found in ventricular tachycardia arrest by EMS and received advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol treatment with ROSC en route to the emergency department. Upon department arrival, the patient arrived with supraglottic device in place and remained unresponsive. No obvious signs of trauma were noted; however, the patient was noted to have leftward gaze with bilateral pupils responsive to light. The patient then went into ventricular tachycardia arrest upon being placed on department bed. CPR and ACLS protocol were initiated and continued for approximately three rounds when ROSC was achieved. Epinephrine drip was started and definitive airway was established. Soon after, the patient was noted to have spontaneous movements with opening eyes and was placed on Diprivan drip for sedation. While preparing for central line placement to the right internal jugular, it was noted that the patient\u2019s left eye became significantly proptotic and chemotic appearing without pupil reactivity to light. IOPs were then immediately measured with tonometer device demonstrating pressure of 35 mmHg to the left eye and approximate pressure of 8 mmHg on the right. Decision to perform cantholysis was made given these findings. There was concern of retrobulbar hematoma likely in setting eye trauma upon patient collapsing prior to cardiac arrest. Using materials from laceration kit commonly found in the emergency department, hemostat pressure was applied to lateral canthus using Kelly clamp and then careful dissection of lateral canthus was made using tissue scissor. Upper and lower eyelids were retracted for better visibility of the superior and inferior crux, which were both cut given the extent of proptosis and chemosis (Figure ).

The evaluation included an elective colonoscopy in light of a family history of colorectal cancer in his mother who died at age 61 from the disease. The patient had his first screening colonoscopy at age 45 and was diagnosed with benign polyps, which were removed, and left-sided diverticulosis. The procedure was uncomplicated and he was advised to repeat a colonoscopy in five years.\nThe patient was without GI symptoms at the time of his colonoscopy. He denied tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. His medications included amiodarone, aspirin, famotidine, levothyroxine, lisinopril, metoprolol, sildenafil, and intravenous heparin as well as torsemide, acetaminophen, docusate sodium, and melatonin as needed. On examination, he had a left ventricular assist device port entering at the upper abdomen, but otherwise the abdomen was soft and nontender to palpation with normal bowel sounds and no appreciable masses or ascites.\nThe patient underwent a standard bowel preparation which included a clear liquid diet the day prior to the procedure and 20mg of Dulcolax with 4 liters of polyethylene glycol the night prior to the procedure. Monitored anesthesia care sedation was administered with propofol. The colonoscopy was performed at night without difficulty with good bowel preparation. Abdominal pressure was briefly required to maneuver around the splenic flexure. The colonoscope was advanced to the cecum with identification of the appendiceal orifice and ileocecal valve.

Since the patient also suffered from mild hypertension, vascular encephalopathy was thought to be the cause of the progressive cognitive decline. Extensive neurocognitive testing was carried out in a rehabilitation centre in May 2012 and disclosed a severe decline of attention, memory and executive functions corresponding to subcortical dementia (Fig. ).

    "original_text": "A 61-year-old woman fell over a barrier curb while walking and bruised her right shoulder. A local clinic examined the patient and diagnosed her with anterior dislocation of the shoulder with a glenoid rim fracture (). The right shoulder had been immobilized with a sling for a month after immediate reduction (). However, the active range of motion for the shoulder remained limited. An MRI scan two months after injury revealed rupturing of the supraspinatus tendon. The patient was referred to our hospital for further management. Clinical examination found stiffness in the right shoulder with muscular weakness. Respective ranges for active and passive right shoulder flexion were 30 degrees and 120 degrees. There was sensory disturbance over the lateral aspect of the shoulder. Radiographs and CT scanning revealed a large anteroinferior glenoid rim fracture, a type IA fracture under the Ideberg classification [, ]. The articular surface was displaced by 2.5 mm, and the width of the bony fragment was 30% of the glenoid length. Upon initial presentation at our hospital, the fracture had already achieved partial union (); therefore, we treated the glenoid rim fracture conservatively. An MRI scan showed a large tear approximately 3 cm long in the supraspinatus tendon, with atrophy and fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus muscle (). Electromyography and nerve conduction studies showed an incomplete lesion of the axillary nerve; therefore, we diagnosed axillary nerve palsy in addition to glenoid rim fracture and rotator cuff tear. The axillary nerve palsy was incomplete and recovering.

Her antiepileptic therapy was discontinued at the age of 7 years because she had no symptoms, but she had an epileptic seizure at the age of 17 years, and treatment with the antiepileptic drugs was resumed. She married at the age of 25 years; however, she did not receive preconceptional consultation. Because she had slight mental retardation, she did not report her wish for a pregnancy to her physician. At the age of 27 years, she was referred to our hospital from a primary obstetrical clinic at 13 weeks of gestation. She was obese, with a body mass index of 30 kg/m2. The antiepileptic drugs she was taking included 1400 mg/day of VPA, 140 mg/day of phenobarbital (PB), and 1200 mg/day of carbamazepine (CBZ). The blood concentrations of the drugs were 80 \u03bcg/ml VPA (effective blood range is from 40 to 100 \u03bcg/ml), 26.1 \u03bcg/ml PB (10\u201330 \u03bcg/ml), and 10.5 \u03bcg/ml CBZ (4\u201312 \u03bcg/ml). Despite the mother\u2019s use of three antiepileptic drugs, she had convulsions about three times per week. Therefore, reduction or alteration of the drugs was difficult. She was informed of her epileptic status and the teratogenic effects of VPA, but her wish to have a baby was so strong that she continued her pregnancy with oral folic acid of 5 mg/day.\nAlthough second-trimester transabdominal ultrasonography was performed at 20 weeks of gestation, fetal malformation was not detected because of a poor ultrasound image due to maternal obesity. At 25 weeks of gestation, contracture of the fetal right wrist joint suggestive of a radial ray defect was detected by ultrasonography (Fig. , ). The fetus demonstrated growth retardation starting from 32 weeks of gestation. After that, fetal ultrasonography was performed weekly",

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, which was interpreted as right-sided pneumonia with right parapneumonic effusion. He was sent to his local emergency department, where he was admitted for antibiotics and thoracentesis, the latter which demonstrated the presence of atypical mesothelial cells with inflammatory cells. He was readmitted two weeks later for progressive thoracic pain, was found to have a recurrent right-sided pleural effusion, and was managed with partial right pleurectomy with pleural biopsy, and talc pleurodesis. Right pleural pathology demonstrated atypical mesothelial proliferation at the pleural surface, without true invasion or definitive pathologic evidence of malignancy. Following surgery, he felt substantially better, such that he could sleep in the bed again, and he was able to return to his baseline activity levels. He underwent repeat chest CT five months later, which showed right pleural thickening and a small loculated pleural effusion, favored to represent a combination of calcification, pleurodesis, and atelectasis. He remained clinically well for another five months until he presented with cough and sinus congestion unrelieved by guaifenesin, dextromethorphan, and antibiotics. He underwent repeat chest CT that showed extensive mass-like pleural thickening completely encasing the right lung, with prominent involvement of the mediastinal pleura, and probable mediastinal extension into the right paratracheal and precarinal space, with pericardial effusion and probable pericardial metastases.

Written informed consent was obtained for surgery including neck dissection. Upon examination, the mass presented as a swelling of approximately 4\u00d75 cm in size, located in the left posterolateral side of the lower neck. It was non-tender, hard, and attached to deep neck structures. A contrast enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a large soft tissue mass in the left posterior neck that involved both the anterior and medius scalene muscles (, ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an iso-intense mass on the T1 weighted image and a low-intensity mass on the T2 weighted image (). On the anterior side, the mass extended up to the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM), with splaying of the left internal jugular vein. No pathological finding was detected in the upper aerodigestive tract by endoscopic examination. After an inconclusive fine needle aspiration, surgical extirpation of the tumor was performed. We did not perform preoperative incisional biopsy because incisional biopsy of neck masses before radical treatment is associated with poor prognosis. The negative influence of preoperative incisional biopsy on prognosis is possibly because of tumor cell dissemination or changes in lymph flow. We were ready to perform a neck dissection procedure if the tumor was malignant. A preoperative incisional biopsy was performed at the beginning of the surgery. The pathological diagnosis of the biopsy was fibromatosis. In response to the clinical findings, a wide excision of the tumor was performed. We encountered difficulty because of local infiltration of the surrounding tissues. Parts of the scalenus medius and SCM were also resected because of tumor invasion.

He smoked about one pack of cigarettes per day for 40 years but stopped at the age of 55 years and denied alcohol abuse. At the initial oncologic evaluation, his physical examination did not reveal any abnormality except varicose veins on the left leg more than right. Neurological examination was also normal. He was able to ambulate without any assistance and was able to do all activities of daily living (ADLs).\nThe patient started chemoradiation therapy consisting of capecitabine (1600 mg/m2 in two divided doses = 3200 mg/m2 per day Monday to Friday with weekends off), with concurrent radiation (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions over 5.5 weeks). He tolerated the combination therapy extremely well for the first three weeks without any major toxicity except grade one nausea, grade one vomiting, grade one diarrhea and grade one hand-foot syndrome. On day three of the 4th week, he presented to the oncology clinic with new onset of gait abnormality noticed by his son that morning. The son noticed that the patient was dragging the front of his right foot on the ground when he walked. The patient further confirmed that he developed a new difficulty lifting the front part of his foot that morning when he wanted to walk to the restroom.

She was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery at 40 weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 3392 g. The maternal vaginal culture was positive for group B Streptococcus (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae) in the third trimester, and her mother had received a prophylactic antibiotic at delivery. There were no perinatal complications, including birth trauma or antecedent infections. She did not receive any invasive medical interventions, such as catheterization or parenteral nutrition. Her umbilical cord fell off on day 15 after birth. She had no significant family history of recurrent or intractable infections. On day 21 after birth, her parents noticed that she cried during diaper change. On day 23 after birth, her left leg was swollen and she was referred to our hospital. On admission, she had mild fever with left leg swelling and erythema. She had no history of trauma. Laboratory data showed an elevation of inflammatory markers, including blood leukocyte count 22 140/\u00b5L, absolute neutrophil count 15 276/\u00b5L, C-reactive protein 4.5 mg/dL, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 31 mm/h. A lower leg plain radiograph revealed osteolytic cortex and hyperlucency at the left proximal tibia. Osteomyelitis in the left proximal tibia was diagnosed, and intravenous cefotaxime was initiated. On hospital day 4, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated an intramedullary ring-enhanced lesion in her left tibia. On day 5, surgical debridement of necrotic bone and pus drainage were performed. The pus culture was positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, whereas three sets of blood cultures on admission were all negative. Cefotaxime was switched to cefazolin based on the culture result. Her clinical symptoms and inflammation markers improved gradually.

    "original_text": "A 39-year old Caucasian female with known NF1 presented herself in the emergency department of an outside hospital with acute symptoms of thoracic pain and dyspnea. Her history was otherwise significant for an extensive thoracic myelomeningocele and status post-surgical correction of a thoracic scoliosis using a tibia bone graft 27 years earlier.\nOn physical examination at the outside hospital, she was awake, afebrile, blood pressure of 80/40 mmHg and a heart rate of 100 beats per minute. The initial haemoglobin was 12.5 g/dl, quickly deteriorating to 8.4 g/dl in the following hour. Chest x-ray (Figure ) was performed 40 mins after admission and revealed an extensive mediastinal shift. Subsequent computer tomography (Figure ) was performed 1h later at the outside hospital and revealed a massive hemothorax on the left side. The patient was intubated orotracheally because of hemorrhagic shock and imminent cardiopulmonary arrest and received seven packed red blood cell concentrates. A thoracic drainage was inserted prior to transfer. 4 h 10 min after admission to the outside hospital the patient was transferred to our institution and arrived there 1h later.\nOn admission, she was highly catecholamine-dependent.

Physical examination revealed respiratory distress, an irregularly irregular tachycardia at 140 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 126/72 mmHg. The cardiac exam was remarkable for a displaced and diffuse apical beat, and a 2/6 mitral regurgitation murmur heard at the apex. His ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rapid ventricular response. There was no electrocardiographic evidence of right ventricular overload. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated a markedly dilated left atrium in the four-chamber view (51 mm) divided into 2 chambers by a membrane (). Continuous wave Doppler showed flow across the membrane with a peak diastolic gradient of 6 mmHg, peak systolic gradient of 2 mmHg, and a mean of 4 mmHg (). The left ventricle (LV) was dilated in the parasternal long-axis view (65 mm) with an ejection fraction of 20\u201330%. There was moderate-to-severe functional mitral regurgitation. The right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was 70 mmHg. Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a membrane within the left atrium (LA) with a 7 mm gap in its midportion and measured a peak gradient of 15 mmHg. The interatrial septum was intact. Of note, the patient had a previous TTE 5 years ago when first immigrating to Canada, which identified a dilated left atrium and the cor triatriatum defect which had a peak gradient of 9 mmHg, which was not that much different than the more current study.

He had his elbow massaged every week for 5 months but there was no improvement. His elbow became fixed in extended position. A month later, he went to an orthopaedic surgeon and underwent x-ray examination which revealed a fracture and dislocation on his left elbow.

There was no neurological deficit (). From radiological examination, there was a malunion of medial epicondyle with subluxation of left proximal ulna (). From 3D CT reconstruction, there was a deformity and malunion fracture in humeral capitellum with radial and ulnar postero-superior dislocation (). The patient was diagnosed with extension contracture of the left elbow due to malunion of left capitellum, neglected dislocation of the radiohumeral joint, and neglected dislocation of the ulnohumeral joint.

On examination, the patient was awake with her eyes open, but she was not responding to verbal stimuli. She reacted verbally and withdrew her extremities in response to pain, and her extremities were held in flexion. She scored an 11 on the NIH Stroke Scale. An ECG in the emergency department demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and a right bundle branch block.

Pathological findings showed carcinoma consistent with FIGO stage IA1 with lymphovascular invasion. She was referred to Keio University Hospital. The patient and her husband were informed of the treatment options, including AmRT and pelvic lymphadenectomy. The patient was told that the outcome of this procedure could not be guaranteed because an insufficient number of these procedures have been performed worldwide to yield reliable conclusions. The patient wished to preserve fertility, and she and her husband signed a written consent form agreeing to this treatment. Pathological findings after AmRT and pelvic lymphadenectomy showed no residual tumor and no lymph node metastasis. There was no finding of an ovarian tumor before surgery. A left ovarian cyst of 4 cm was identified during postoperative follow-up.\nAt 3 years and 6 months after surgery, the patient underwent IUI and then had fever and pain in her left lower abdomen 10 days later. At her first visit, her temperature was mildly elevated to 37.5\u00b0C. The patient's pregnancy was denied because a qualitative urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test was negative. A tumor with tenderness was palpated in the left adnexal area. A cystic tumor of 64x 41 mm was found by transvaginal ultrasonography ().

Clinical examination showed a cutaneous lesion measuring 3 \u00d7 2 cm, and the clinical differential diagnosis was infected epidermoid cyst and subcutaneous neoplasm.\nThe patient's previous medical and surgical history included a cholecystectomy, and an upper gastrointestinal bleeding developed on a gastric ulcer.

On examination thickening and tenderness of the tendons were noted and there was no evidence of joint deformity []. However, he gave a history of recurrent crops of the tender nodular lesion during and after MDT.

She had gone to her primary care physician, who performed a chest X-ray and urged her to come to the hospital. Upon presentation at the emergency department, her oxygen saturation was above 95% on room air, and she was not in any respiratory distress, but her exam was significant for decreased breath sound on the right. A chest X-ray confirmed a large right-sided pneumothorax with small pleural effusion. A chest tube was inserted on the right side for the resolution of the pneumothorax, and subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed bilateral diffuse bullous disease of the lung with multiple cysts (Figure -). The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for right thoracoscopic wedge resection of a lung bleb and talc pleurodesis. Gross examination of the specimen revealed several dilated air-like spaces ranging from 0.2 cm to 0.4 cm in size. The hospital course was complicated by postsurgical pneumonia, but she recovered fully and was discharged to home with only minimal symptoms of dyspnea on exertion. Upon further investigations, she was found to have multiple small lesions of angiomyolipoma on the right kidney with diffuse retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. One of the lymph nodes was biopsied, and pathology revealed predominantly spindle cells positive for HHF35 and smooth muscle actin, consistent with the diagnosis of leiomyoma. At the eight-month follow-up at the pulmonology clinic, her pulmonary function test (PFT) showed normal vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), but moderately reduced diffusion capacity, which may also be related to LAM. At her 12-month and 24-month follow-up visits, her PFT results showed improvements in peak flow and diffusion capacity, and the patient continues to report no symptoms other than minimal dyspnea on exertion.",

On the day of her initial presentation she awoke disoriented and with memory loss (as is typical for transient global amnesia). She enjoyed full memory recovery within several hours but complained of a marked but tolerable headache. She was examined by a local neurologist and was discharged home. Two days later she was admitted to a tertiary-care hospital because of symptom progression. On admission, the patient was suffering from cephalea, nausea, and had meningeal signs. MRI of the brain and cervical spine showed SAH in the prepontine and premedullary cisterns and on the convexity. No vascular abnormalities in the craniocervical junction or the cervical area could be identified on the MRI (A\u2013D). Digital subtraction angiography of the cranial vessels did not reveal any aneurysms.\nAs the symptoms diminished, she was discharged home with the presumptive diagnosis of pretruncal non-aneurysmal SAH. After a period of 2.5 months and in her 32nd week of pregnancy, she underwent an MRI examination for moderate back pain. This identified a spinal vascular lesion with a large ectatic venous aneurysm at the level of L1. Dilated perimedullary veins could be seen in the T10 to L5 range. Cesarean section was recommended, leading to the delivery of a healthy child in the 33rd week of pregnancy. Two days later, as she was recovering in the obstetric ward, the patient developed progressive lumbar pain and lower limb weakness along with partial urinary incontinence.

He was an employee with average income who did not smoke tobacco or drink alcohol. He had no weight loss or urinary symptoms, and no substantial family history. He denied any significant medical or surgical history. His abdomen was soft, non-tender, and non-distended, with normoactive bowel sounds. In examination, a mass could be touched by finger tips. The mass was large and bleeding. In subsequent examinations, blood was detected in a stool sample. His vital signs were: blood pressure, 130.77 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/minute; heart rate, 83 beats/minute; and temperature within normal limits. Oxygen saturation was 98% on room air on admission. In colonoscopy, a large lobular tumor was diagnosed at 4 cm above the dentate line, which was suspicious for malignancy. Various samples were taken from the tumor. The rest of his large intestine did not show a clear pathologic lesion in the colonoscopy.\nHigh-grade adenocarcinoma was reported in pathological examinations. In subsequent diagnostic procedures, his carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was normal. Computed tomography (CT) scans revealed that metastatic lesions were not detected in his liver, abdominal viscera, and chest. In CT scans with or without contrast, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, an ectopic kidney was detected incidentally on his right pelvis without any prior urinary symptoms. The left kidney was in its original location, and both kidneys were functional. Renal function tests provided normal results.\nIn subsequent investigations done by MRI scanning for staging the tumor, a pelvic rectum tumor was reported to be interfering with the T3 N1 mesorectal lymph nodes (Figs. , ). The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary cancer team; afterward, our patient was regarded as a candidate for neoadjuvant radiotherapy.

The patient reported that the pain is a new manifestation of a previously dull aching pain that had waxed and waned over the last decade. His description alluded to a pain that was sharp and intermittent with localization in the right upper quadrant. He could not attribute the intermittent nature of his predicament to any aggravating or relieving influences. The pain was associated with fluctuating low-grade fevers (99\u00b0F-100\u00b0F), anorexia, and an associated 13-pound weight loss, which culminated in a visit to our clinical setup.\nFurther interrogation disclosed that the patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 2003. The ensuing year was relatively pain-free but was followed by recurrent bouts of right upper quadrant pain, albeit less upsetting than his current presentation. He was subsequently diagnosed in 2005 with gallstone spillage. The patient chose conservative treatment for his abdominal pain, rather than invasive interventions, which included the administration of acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This treatment modality was sufficient for the duration of a decade. He presented to another medical facility with similar complaints of fever and abdominal pain in 2016.

Her mother left home to take a burn ointment from the neighbor and rubbed it over the burnt area. An hour later, the mother brought the girl to the local city hospital with an impaired level of consciousness and difficulty breathing. The family provided no more history than the burn. A general practitioner and afterward, a pediatrician visited the patient. She was unconscious without responding to any painful stimuli, had pinpoint pupils and apneustic respirations (respiratory rate: 6 per minute).

On examination, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 in both eyes. Intraocular pressure was 21 mmHg in both eyes. Dilated funduscopic examination in the right eye revealed retinal emboli inferior to the optic disc obstructing a small arteriole associated with retinal ischemia (Figures and ). The left eye was unremarkable. There was no prior past ocular history. The patient had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and had an extensive smoking history.\nFluorescein angiography revealed delayed retinal perfusion along the inferior arcade in the right eye (Figures and ). Optical coherence tomography showed normal foveal contour with inner retinal ischemia and thickening, consistent with an acute inferotemporal branch retinal artery occlusion ().

There were no significant findings on examination and the patient was asymptomatic.\nA contrast enhanced CT noted small SRCs bilaterally, the largest being 1.2 cm in width. A 10.5 cm upper pole simple cyst was also noted in the left kidney. It contained a small soft tissue focus in the lateral wall, however, no calcification, septations or convincing solid components were noted. The lesion fit the criteria for Bosniak stage IIF and the patient was placed on 12-month interval CT surveillance.\nIn 2013, significant increased global cyst size was noted in the left kidney, the largest being a 7.5 cm lesion in the left lower pole with a small focus of wall calcification. The left kidney upper pole cyst had increased in size to 10.7 cm with new focal soft tissue calcification noted. However, these findings were still consistent with Bosniak stage IIF. A decision was made to alter CT surveillance from 12- to 6-month intervals.\nIn 2014, the lower pole cyst in the left kidney had increased in size from 7.5 to 9.4 cm. A further 9.3 cm cyst had developed from the anterior midpole. The upper pole cyst had increased in size from 10.7 to 11.4 cm. The radiographic findings still indicated these cysts to be simple in nature. At this time the patient reported weight loss of 5 kg and fatigue over the last 6 months. eGFR had deteriorated to 29 ml/min. MRI corroborated CT results at this stage. MRI also demonstrated the left renal upper pole cyst to contain extensive thick walled septations. T1 gadolinium imaging demonstrated significant underlying haemorrhage. MRI findings upgraded the lesion from Bosniak IIF based on CT findings to Bosniak III. MRI and CT images illustrating these findings are outlined in Fig. .",

Physical examination revealed a pulsatile mass in the central abdomen and a distended upper abdomen. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed an infrarenal AAA with a diameter of 50 mm and a duodenal obstruction at the third portion between the AAA and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). CT also displayed distension of the stomach and the first and second portions of the duodenum, accompanied by duodenal wall edema (). He was diagnosed with aortoduodenal syndrome.\nConsidering the patient\u2019s acute symptoms, the possibility of AAA impending rupture could not be excluded completely; thus, emergency surgery was performed. Preoperative upper gastrointestinal examination with an oral contrast agent was not performed because of the emergent situation. Endovascular treatment was selected on the basis of the patient\u2019s age, frailty (Clinical Frailty Scale 6), and anatomical suitability as his proximal landing zone was straight and over 2 cm long. Before the operation, a nasogastric tube was inserted and the intragastric fluid was suctioned completely to prevent vomiting during the procedure. Abdominal pain did not diminish after the aspiration of the gastric fluid.\nThe procedure was performed under local anesthesia and conscious sedation with dexmedetomidine to prevent aspiration pneumonia caused by vomiting on tracheal intubation. The AAA was successfully treated by fitting an endoprosthesis (Gore Excluder; W. L. Gore and Associates Inc., Flagstaff, AZ, USA). After the exposure of the bilateral common femoral artery, the main body and contralateral leg of the endoprosthesis were deployed. A proximal aortic extender was added because the digital subtraction angiography revealed a type IA endoleak. On the final angiogram, there was no endoleak (). The operative time was 96 min, and surgery was completed without complications. The patient\u2019s abdominal pain was diminished after the operation, and a physical examination",

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed two small filling defects, and we extracted the stone via stent placement in the common bile duct (CBD). She underwent open cholecystectomy one month following ERCP. Intraoperatively, we noted the gall bladder (GB) was contracted and filled with multiple calculi, the CBD was dilated, and the hepatoduodenal ligament was frozen. Intraoperatively there was no suspicion of any bowel injury. An abdominal drain was placed in the right subhepatic region. She was discharged on postoperative day (POD) three with a drain in situ due to persistent serosanguinous discharge. The abdominal drain was removed on POD eight as output was decreased. A GB biopsy showed features of chronic cholecystitis.\nFollowing drain removal the next day on POD nine, she had concerns of abdominal pain and bilious vomiting. She was admitted and started on conservative management with nasogastric (NG) tube placement. USG of the abdomen revealed an 8 cm x 3 cm fluid collection in the GB fossa with multiple localized thick collections on the right side of the abdominal cavity.
