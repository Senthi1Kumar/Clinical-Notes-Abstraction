On physical examination, facial paralysis was identified as Grade V using the House-Brackmann grading system. Endoscopic exam revealed total perforation of the tympanic membrane, edema of the middle ear mucosa, and profound discharge from her left ear (). Initial ear culture studies did not identified pathogens. On electronystagmography, spontaneous nystagmus toward the right side was identified and left-sided caloric weakness of 71% was found (). She denied a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or pulmonary tuberculosis. Pure-tone audiometry showed deafness of the left ear. A temporal bone CT scan revealed that a soft tissue density filling the middle ear cavity and mastoid, and dehiscence of the tympanic segment of the facial nerve was suspected (). She was initially treated with an intravenous 3rd generation cephalosporin and a 4 day course of oral prednisone (60 mg/d) was started on the day of presentation and tapered off between days 10 and 12. Preoperative eletroneurography demonstrated 75% degeneration of the facial nerve. An emergent surgical procedure was scheduled to improve facial nerve paralysis and resolve dizziness. Under general anesthesia, retroauricular incision was performed. We removed a significant amount of granulation tissue with the consistency of cheese from the middle ear and mastoid by canal wall down mastoidectomy. During the operation, dehiscence of the facial fallopian canal and a swollen facial nerve were identified and facial nerve decompression was performed to resolve the facial nerve paralysis (). Intraoperative finding, all ossicles were surrounded by granulation tissues and incus was partially eroded. After malleus and incus were removed, tympanoplasty was performed using temporalis fascia. The most prominent finding on histopathologic examination was chronic caseating granulomatous inflammation and many bacilli were identified on AFB stain (). The chest X-ray was normal, but",

    "original_text": "A 65-year old man noticed a cutaneous nodule on his left forearm, which had gradually grown. He had a medical history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The cutaneous nodule was resected, and was diagnosed to be malignant melanoma. He was referred to our hospital, and underwent wide resection with left axillar lymph node (LN) dissection. The surgical margin of the primary tumor was negative, and one out of the 11 dissected LNs showed metastases. 1 year after the surgery, computed tomography (CT) revealed a nodule in the right parotid gland. The nodule was resected, and histological analyses revealed multiple cysts of various sizes lined by cuboidal, eosinophilic cells with mild to moderate atypia (). The cyst lumen contained eosinophilic materials, and some of the cuboidal cells showed decapitation secretion (). There were no myoepithelial cells around the luminal cells. In some parts, the tumor cells showed microinvasion. From these findings, a diagnosis of cystadenocarcinoma was made. 4 months after the resection, a nodule with cystadenocarcinoma recurred in the right parotid gland, and right superficial parotidectomy was performed.

Nasotracheal intubation was ruled out due to the presence of nasal fractures. Oral intubation was also ruled out due to the need to establish occlusion by intermaxillary fixation (IMF). Initially, a tracheostomy was planned, but in the operation theatre itself it was decided to intubate this patient through the sub-mental route as described by Mac Innis and Baig. After normal oral intubation using a tube (such as a mallinkrodt tube, US), which allows the connector to be removed, an incision measuring 2 cm was marked in the midline of the chin just anterior to the sub-mental crease close to the lower border of the mandible by the maxillofacial surgeon. Local anesthetic was infiltrated, and a 20 mm incision was made, enough to admit a size 8 tube. Blunt dissection was carried out as close as possible to the lingual aspect of the mandible into the floor of the mouth. A longitudinal incision was then made in the floor of the mouth, in the midline between the submandibular ducts at the base of the tongue, just enough to allow the passage of the tube so as to protect the facial nerve, lingual nerve and submandibular duct []. Artery forceps were passed from the extraoral to the intraoral incision and the existing flexometallic orotracheal tube drawn through the incision after grasping with the artery forceps []. This maneuver took approximately, 6 min for the maxillofacial surgeon to do. Correct tube position was confirmed with capnography and lung auscultation by the anesthetist.

She had low-grade fever preceding those features but got settled easily.

He was conscious and without neurological dysfunction when he arrived at the hospital. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed that the dissection was torn from the aortic root to the iliac artery, involving all branches of the arch. In particular, the left CCA was torn into true and false lumens, while a large number of thrombi in the false lumen oppressed the true lumen, resulting in severe stenosis. There was no thrombosis in the false lumen following the tear of the brachiocephalic trunk and right CCA (). A computed tomography scan of the head found no obvious cerebral infarction or cerebral hemorrhage. Echocardiography indicated both aortic root aneurysm and severe aortic valve insufficiency. The patient then underwent Bentall surgery plus total arch replacement and stent elephant trunk surgery. A sternotomy was performed in order to expose the branches of the superior arch. The bilateral CCAs were then fully exposed to its bifurcation along the axis of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Bilateral cerebral perfusion was adopted during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. A perfusion tube was directly inserted into the brachiocephalic trunk on the right side, while the left tube was inserted in the distal typical part of the left CCA. Four branches of vascular prostheses (Maquet, Cardiovascular LLC, NJ, and US) were used for total arch replacement, bilateral CCA replacement, and right subclavian artery reconstruction. The intraoperative stent fenestration technique was utilized for the left subclavian artery in order to establish blood supply[ (). Ten hours after surgery, the patient recovered completely and had no transient neurological dysfunction and no permanent neurological insufficiency.

Upon arrival, the patient had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that responded to benzodiazepines. On examination, vital signs were blood pressure 138/76, P 124, R 23, and O2 Sat 100% RA. The patient was post-ictal, but became arousable and alert during the initial evaluation. Cardiac exam showed an irregularly irregular rhythm. She had an expressive aphasia with significant weakness to the right upper and lower extremity and right facial droop. The patient was unable to name objects or answer yes and no questions. Laboratory tests were unremarkable. A non-contrast CT head revealed lytic lesions of the skull and an abnormality of the brain. MRI of the brain with contrast showed vasogenic edema in the left frontoparietal region, dural thickening, and lytic/blastic lesions in the skull.\nThe approach to the patient with altered mental status includes a broad differential diagnosis including infectious, neurologic, and toxicologic causes. In this case, the presentation and history direct the physician to a neurologic etiology. The CT of the head confirmed the presence of a structural brain abnormality. MRI of the brain confirmed the diagnosis of meningeal carcinomatosis, and the edema finding provided some evidence of a brain tumor as the primary neoplasm.\nIn light of the MRI findings and her seizure activity, she was given an anti-epileptic drug to prevent further seizures and dexamethasone. Dexamethasone has been shown to decrease intracranial pressure and cerebral edema in cases of brain tumors []. Patients may respond to intrathecal chemotherapy and external beam radiation in some cases. Systemic chemotherapy may be an option in some cases.

This showed Mirizzi's syndrome type 1 causing an obstructive jaundice (). A biliary stent was inserted and we recommended open cholecystectomy. However, when she went back to her referring hospital, she underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Few days post surgery, her obstructive jaundice was not relieved and she was sent back for ERCP and stent removal. Upon doing the 2nd ERCP, she was noticed to have three stones impacted in the cystic duct at junction with the common bile duct consistent with Mirizzi\u2019s syndrome type 1. Two subsequent ERCP\u2019S Attempts to extract the stones by two experienced gastroenterologists and with different manipulations were unsuccessful. She underwent open resection of the remaining part of the gallbladder and Hartmann pouch with stone extraction from cystic duct. One month postoperatively, she presented for a follow-up ERCP and stent removal. The ERCP showed dilated CBD and common hepatic duct and a remaining stone in the cystic duct (). Several attempts to extract this stone using trapezoid basket were unsuccessful due to the size and shape of the stone and its impaction into the cystic duct. A 10-French, 10 cm stent was inserted and the plan was to arrange for an ERCP plus Spyglass and laser lithotripsy. This was performed (ERCP, Spyglass and intraductal laser lithotripter) in which the following was seen: Initially attempts to extract the stone in the cystic duct using trapezoid basket were not successful. The Spyglass was inserted () and cholangioscope and cystic ductoscopy showed a large yellowish stone in the cystic duct (). There were no stones in the CBD.

Serial readings of her blood pressure were all in the normal range and there was minimal proteinuria. Workup revealed an elevation of alkaline phosphatase at 2365 U/L (normal range 35\u2013115 U/L). The patient did not have a history of bone, liver, or renal disease. Past pregnancies were remarkable for a spontaneous abortion and therapeutic abortion requiring dilatation and curettage. Prenatal lab work was unremarkable and the patient was Rh negative. She received RhoGAM during her prenatal care and in the postpartum period. An abdominal ultrasound was performed and failed to show any biliary stones or biliary duct dilatation. To identity the cellular source of the alkaline phosphatase, it was fractionated and showed that 97.8% of the alkaline phosphatase was placental in origin.\nDuring workup the patient was also found to have an elevated glucose tolerance test and was confirmed to have gestational diabetes several days later. The patient was closely monitored for the remainder of the pregnancy and noted to have good glycemic control with dietary modification alone with a hemoglobin A1C of 5.5%. Her alkaline phosphatase was serially monitored and noted to rise to a peak of 4053 U/L (35x upper limit of normal) on the day of delivery. The patient was induced at 40 weeks and 2 days of gestation and had an uneventful vaginal delivery of a vigorous baby boy. Shortly after delivery the infant was noted to have significant bruising and petechiae.

He was first diagnosed with renal disease manifesting as chronic glomerulonephritis in 1990 and was initially managed with haemodialysis for 33 months. In 1993, he received his first living unrelated renal transplant, but the graft failed 12 months after transplantation as a result of acute rejection. He was haemodialysed again for 2 years and then switched to PD in 1996. Over the following 6 years, the patient did well, although he had a total of four episodes of bacterial peritonitis (two Staphylococcus epidermis, one Serratia marcescens and one culture-negative). All of the peritonitis episodes were successfully treated with intraperitoneal antibiotics. In November 2002, he had problems with fluid balance and hypertension, and required hypertonic exchanges. He was prescribed icodextrin for ultrafiltration inadequacy without peritoneal equilibrium test. The patient was treated with PD for a total of 95 months.\nIn January 2005, he underwent a cadaveric donor renal transplant and was commenced on tacrolimus, prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). The PD catheter was removed 2 weeks after successful transplantation. At the time of transplantation, the abdominal ultrasound scan did not show any features suggestive of EPS. Seven months after transplantation, the patient developed a gastrointestinal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. At this time, his symptoms were intermittent abdominal discomfort without ascites, weight loss or hypoalbuminaemia. The gastrointestinal CMV disease responded well to intravenous ganciclovir therapy and discontinuation of MMF. After 21 days of intravenous ganciclovir therapy, follow-up endoscopic mucosal biopsy showed that the CMV inclusion bodies had disappeared, and immunohistochemistry staining was negative for CMV. The patient became asymptomatic; he had normal serum albumin levels in the range of 4.3\u20134.7 g/dL, and his body weight remained stable.\nIn November 2006, the patient was admitted with abdominal discomfort and distension over several days, having experienced vague, unexplained abdominal discomfort",

At presentation, she was normotensive on daily doses of amlodipine 5 mg and metoprolol succinate 50 mg without respiratory compromise. She was diagnosed with allergic reaction to an unknown allergen and was empirically treated with hydrocortisone 125 mg intravenously, antihistamines and discharged home. Two hours later, she returns to the emergency department reporting new onset symptoms of chest pressure, heart palpitations, diaphoresis and respiratory distress. She was afebrile, respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, heart rate 155 bpm and blood pressure 220/100 mmHg. Physical examination was notable for diffuse crackles at bilateral lung fields (See ). Arterial blood gas indicated an anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis and lactic acid of 14.9 mmol/L. Chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema with bilateral lobe infiltrates. Nitroglycerin and enalaprilat was started but she became hypotensive and both medications were discontinued. The cessation of these medications did not improve her hemodynamics, and therefore, intravenous noriepinephrine and vasopressin were initiated. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast evaluating for the presence of pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection showed bilateral lower lobe consolidation, 1.5 cm liver hemangioma and a 3.6-cm left adrenal gland enlargement. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST changes. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed global dysfunction with a decreased ejection fraction of 10%.

As a liver donor was unavailable, the patient underwent endovascular stenting of the IVC for palliation.\nAn abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed hepatomegaly and ascites, and gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed esophageal varices. Three main hepatic veins were thrombosed with complete occlusion of the suprahepatic IVC; thus, hepatic venous blood flow was draining into the inferior right hepatic vein through the intrahepatic collaterals and passing through the subcutaneous venous collaterals (). She was placed on the LT waiting list due to progressive liver cirrhosis and deteriorating liver function, but there was little possibility of deceased organ allocation considering the preserved status of liver function, and no living donor was available.\nShe underwent endovascular stenting of the IVC for palliation, rather than LT. A septoplasty needle was passed through the occluded IVC into the internal jugular vein and femoral vein using a snare wire. Severe elastic recoil (>90%) was observed after balloon dilatation; thus, a 28\u00d780-mm stent was inserted across the occluded area, and repeat double ballooning was performed. The final venogram shows restored IVC inflow ().\nShe began to lose body weight 1 day after stenting, and the edema disappeared within the first week. A follow-up CT scan showed that the stented IVC was fully patent () with complete thrombosis of the three main hepatic veins (), but intrahepatic collateral flow was draining through the right inferior hepatic vein with spontaneous closure of subcutaneous collateral veins ().\nLiver function recovered slowly over several weeks.

The patient had a prior history of chronic kidney disease, arteriosclerosis obliterans, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Physical and laboratory examination revealed ulcerative formations in the left lower leg and severe metabolic acidosis (). An intravenous subsequently oral administration of sodium bicarbonate resulted in marked improvement of the acidosis.

She denied breast pain, nipple discharge, or overlying skin changes. With regard to breast cancer risk factors, she was nulliparous, menopausal as she had a hysterectomy for dysfunctional uterine bleeding but ovaries were intact, had no previous history of breast biopsies, and was a nonsmoker. She had no personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Her only medication was a NovoLog insulin pump.\nPhysical exam was remarkable for a dominant 3 \u00d7 1 centimeter hard, irregular, movable, painless mass palpable in the left upper outer quadrant and a smaller less defined lesion in the left lower quadrant of the breast. The differential diagnosis included fibroadenoma, fibrocystic change, malignancy (especially lobular carcinoma), PASH (pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia), and diabetic mastopathy.\nImaging evaluations included a diagnostic mammogram that revealed extremely dense breasts. Ultrasound exam of the palpable area was also negative for abnormality. A bilateral MRI of the breast was performed () and demonstrated multiple regions of enhancement and a small incidental fibroadenoma of the left breast; no abnormality was detected at the area of palpable concern.

There were also two episodes of syncope with body strains. In February 2019, the patient was hospitalized in the cardiology department, where a cardiac cause of the symptoms was excluded despite the increased serum level of NT-proBNP. In March 2019, she was hospitalized at the pulmonology ward, however despite comprehensive diagnostics, no diagnosis was made. At present admission physical examination showed a bilateral reduction of physiological vesicular murmur, ascites and edema of lower extremities. Laboratory tests showed an elevated serum level of NT-pro-BNP (5602 pg/mL) high sensitivity troponin T (81.57 ng/L) and creatinine. Electrophoresis of serum and urine proteins was performed in order to exclude diseases associated with hypergammaglobulinemia among others type AL amyloidosis and multiple myeloma. There was an increase in serum alpha 1 and 2 globulin with a simultaneous decrease in the gamma globulin fractions. Moreover, the albumin to globulin ratio and total protein concentration was normal. Urine electrophoresis did not detect immunoglobulin light chain. According to the results of electrophoresis, bone marrow biopsy was performed, which excluded multiple myeloma and other hematologic malignancies.\nThe ultrasonography showed bilateral pleural effusion. MRI examination of pelvis confirmed massive edema of retroperitoneal and subcutaneous adipose tissue and inguinal lymphadenopathy. The echocardiographic examination () showed small dimensions of hearth cavities, the interventricular septum thickened to 22 mm, with the streaky brightening in the center, without significant valves disorders and right ventricle hypertrophy.

The tattoo had been carried out in the United Kingdom three years prior to the onset of the nodule formation. An initial nodule arose in the central left portion of his chest and this was followed several months later by three more nodules, all-arising within red parts of the multicolour tattoo. The patient was uncertain if there had been a mole on his left chest prior to getting the tattoo. He had no past medical history of any significance and he had worked for 10 years in the merchant navy yet claimed he had little sun exposure.\nExcisional biopsies of these lesions revealed four melanomatous lesions, the maximum of which had a Breslow depth of 11 mm. Pathological assessment of these lesions felt that they consisted of a primary tumour of 11 mm depth and three in-transit metastases. Microscopy of the primary lesion demonstrated sheets of highly atypical cells, which extended into the underlying dermis as atypical spindled and stellate cells with prominent perineural invasion. Focal epidermal ulceration was present along with a junctional component in areas. Tumour cells stained positive with S100, but negative for HMB45, Melan A and AE1/AE3. It was felt that it was a nodular subtype melanoma with a Clark's level of IV with no features of regression. On clinical examination there was no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. A computed tomography (CT) thorax, abdomen and pelvis revealed some subcentimetre lymph nodes in the left axilla and jejunum.

The range of motion (ROM) of the right knee was 140\u00b0 flexion and 0\u00b0 extension.\nDuring the surgery, a thigh tourniquet was applied and the leg was placed on a thigh support with the hip flexed about 30 degree.

She presented to the emergency room with a chief complaint of seeing vivid organisms with tentacles in her food and stool. The patient was well-kept, organized, alert, and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. She provided a very detailed history, stating that the vivid hallucinations started eight weeks ago. She would see them in her eggs when she ate breakfast and when she drank water or juice. She had seen the hallucinations in her stool as well. The patient meticulously collected samples of her food and stool in containers and brought them to an urgent care center for evaluation. From the urgent care center, she was sent directly to the emergency room. During her admission, the patient stated she understands and is fully aware of the fact that the tentacles are visual hallucinations. Her symptoms have been a significant source of worsening stress and anxiety over the past few weeks. Her vitals, labs, blood, and urine cultures were all normal. Her urine toxicology screen was negative. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed no acute intracranial findings and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was negative for any acute changes, as seen in Figure .\nPsychiatry was consulted, and our team determined that her insight was fully intact. Her symptoms could not be attributed to an acute psychotic episode. We then began to discuss the possibility of Charles Bonnet Syndrome and Anton-Babinski Syndrome as potential differential diagnoses. Charles Bonnet Syndrome was confirmed because the patient fit all the relevant diagnostic criteria. This included significant visual impairment, persistent visual hallucinations, fully intact insight, no evidence of acute psychosis, no evidence of stroke or hemorrhage, and no other senses other than her vision were",

Accordingly, we suggested follow-up catheter angiography to screen for vascular remodeling, but the patient refused it.

A review of systems was positive for a 20lb unintentional weight loss over several months. He was a lifetime nonsmoker with no personal history of cancer and only significant family history of a brother with prostate cancer. His original creatinine obtains on admission was 1.0 mg/dL. A non-contrast CT of the head was obtained while in the ED and was negative for any intracranial abnormality. A contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained and demonstrated a 5 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, an irregular soft tissue density within the gallbladder suggestive of cholelithiasis vs a possible mass, and a large mass replacing most of the left kidney measuring 13.8 x 11.9 x 10.3 cm with scattered areas of calcification appearing both solid and cystic. No definite left renal vein extension and a grossly normal-appearing right kidney were appreciated as seen in Figure . An MRI of the abdomen was subsequently obtained which confirmed the absence of renal vein involvement.\nCardiology was initially consulted to evaluate for potential causes of the syncope and an echocardiogram was ordered in addition to placing the patient on telemetry.",

He was under treatment in the outpatient for the past 6 months for a progressive diabetic neuropathy on duloxetine, gabapentin, and nortriptyline. Despite his blood sugar being well controlled (Hb1Ac 7.7) on oral hypoglycemic agents, he continued to have increasing symptoms of weakness and inability to walk due to proximal muscle involvement. He started using a walker at home for the past 2 months and for the past 2 weeks before admission, complained of inability to lie down supine and sleep. He would prop himself up with pillows to avoid breathlessness. He had no history of smoking or substance abuse. He was admitted to the intensive care unit of a tertiary center with respiratory distress in the form accessory use of respiratory muscles, tachypnea, and fall in oxygen saturation. And therefore, put on noninvasive ventilation. On examination, air entry into his lungs was reduced bilaterally with no wheeze or crepitations. He was more comfortable in propped up position compared to supine. His plantar reflexes were absent bilaterally with reduced knee jerks 1+ bilaterally. Power in his lower limb was 3/5 in the proximal and distal muscle groups. The rest of the examination was normal.

Physical exam revealed non-radiating pain localized to the right lower quadrant absent of alleviating or exacerbating factors and without associated symptoms. Computed tomography (CT) Imaging was concerning for ruptured appendicitis and clinical exam was consistent with peritonitis and sepsis. Patient was promptly taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy, ileocecotomy, appendectomy, drainage of abscess and ileostomy. Patient was prepared and positioned for surgery in supine position. During the procedure, mild hyperemia of the appendix was noted. Approximately 7 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve, the terminal ileum was transected using a 55 mm GIA blue load. The proximal part of the cecum was freed from peritoneal attachment. The cecum was transected using a 75 mm GIA blue load. All the mesentery between the two transected points was taken down using the ligature. A few days later, dehiscence of the staple line on the ascending colon occurred. The patient was taken back to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy and repair of the dehiscence. Midway through, another attempt to transect the proximal part of ascending colon using powered Endo-GIA stapler failed (Fig. ). The stapler abruptly froze; a sound went off and it became locked. Repeated attempts to override using the manual handle failed and it took over 10 min to separate the stapler sides. A contour stapler was then used instead of the powered stapler for segmental transection of the ascending colon. His hospital course was complicated by recurrent ileostomy necrosis and futile wound healing, resulting in colonic suture breakdown with recurrent fecal peritonitis and septic shock, acute renal failure requiring dialysis, acute respiratory failure requiring trach and right upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.
