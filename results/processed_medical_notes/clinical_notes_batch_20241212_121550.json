Endobronchial biopsy of the pulmonary nodule revealed the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT) revealed accumulation in the pulmonary nodule, but no other lesion was suggestive of metastasis. The tumor was diagnosed as a primary lung cancer, clinical stage IA1 (T1aN0M0), or metastatic pulmonary tumor, and video-assisted thoracoscopic right lower lobectomy with lymph node dissection was performed. Level 8 and 9 lymph nodes were not enlarged; therefore, lymph node dissection of these nodal station was not performed (Fig. a), while the level 7 lymph nodes were dissected. There was no direct injury of the esophagus, and no apparent esophageal damage was visualized on magnified video endoscopic images (Fig. b). The operation was uneventful. The patient was able to resume oral intake from the day after the surgery.\nThe patient tended to need to make a strong effort to cough, with swallowing and expectoration having become difficult, presumably due to the radiation therapy given to the larynx. Three days after the operation, the patient developed severe sudden pain in the right shoulder with high fever (39.6 \u00b0C). Findings of the chest X-ray obtained with a portable apparatus showed a few infiltrative shadows in the right lung field, and blood examination revealed no findings that were not compatible with the postoperative status of the patient. The patient was started on intravenous antibiotic administration. Absence of air leakage through the chest tube was confirmed, and the chest tube was removed 4 days after the operation.

Subsequent colonoscopy confirmed the presence of a suspicious lesion on the posterior anal canal, extending above up to the anorectic junction. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the regional staging confirmed an infiltrative lesion of the anal canal with a maximum diameter of 3.2 cm, with a high-grade suspicion of sphincter infiltration, and two enlarged lymphadenopathies in the mesorectum and in the right internal iliac region, respectively, both with a maximal diameter of 2 cm, which is suspicious of tumour metastases. Further, an area with a maximal diameter of 2 cm within the left prostate basis having a restricted diffusion with a lower apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) than that in the surrounding healthy prostate tissue, which appeared hypointense on ADC maps but hyperintense on the diffusion-weighted maps, was also described.

In the preceding weeks he had become bed-bound due to progressive weakness, increasingly breathless at rest and described clear orthopnoea. His concentration was poor and in the days immediately before admission family members reported excessive daytime sleepiness and hallucinations. Blood tests were unremarkable and chest radiograph showed small lung volumes with no evidence of consolidation. An arterial blood gas revealed acute on chronic ventilatory failure (pH 7.18, pCO2 16.3 kPa, pO2 10.5 kPa and serum bicarbonate 44 mmol/L). He was established on to NIV acutely and when stable transferred to our regional long-term ventilation service.\nHe had first presented to medical services over 25 years previously due to mild lower limb weakness and moderately elevated serum creatine kinase.

    "original_text": "An 85-year-old man with visual impairment and no psychiatric history presented to the Centre du Cerveau\u00b2 (University Hospital of Li\u00e8ge, Belgium). The patient suffered from retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease characterized by progressive degeneration of the rod photoreceptors in the retina, which typically leads to severe vision impairments []. He was three when he began experiencing a progressive loss of vision. Some years later, during the teenage years, he experienced a progressive development of \u201ctunnel vision\u201d, i.e., his peripheral field of vision progressively narrowed. Concurrently, the patient developed hemeralopia, a night vision deterioration caused by the abolition of rod cells. At the age of 70 years, he lost his central vision, causing complete blindness at the age of 80 years. He also reported a positive family history of CBS.\nThe patient described a five-year history of increasing frequency of visual hallucinations. His visual hallucinatory experiences started at the age of 80, together with the occurrence of his complete blindness. Overall, he was able to report a coherent and very detailed description of his hallucinations, as well as its occurrence context. The patient reported that his visual hallucinations gradually became more frequent and could occur many times during the day.

His past medical history was significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, partial gastric outlet obstruction, alcohol abuse and a 50 pack/year smoking history. He was initially brought to the operating room 4 days later for soft tissue debridement and diverting end sigmoid colostomy.\nAfter a midline laparotomy incision was made. The distal sigmoid colon was identified and divided with a GIA 75 stapler leaving a distal rectosigmoid pouch. An incision was made in the left lower quadrant. The proximal end of sigmoid colon was then brought through the cruciate facial defect which had been dilated to three finger widths. The distal end was stapled and left as a distal sigmoid stump. The stoma was matured in Brooke fashion using 3-0 vicryl sutures. Sutures were placed at the level of the skin and not placed at the level of the fascia. The patient was then transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) in stable condition.\nOn postoperative Day 1, the patient\u2032s perianal wound was found to have purulent discharge and swabs revealed gram-positive cocci in chains.

One year earlier, he had undergone open reduction and internal fixation on his right ankle for fracture at another hospital. A tibia diaphysis spiral fracture was fixed by the anterograde intramedullary nail with infra-patellar approach. An ankle malleolar fracture was fixed by the locking plate and cannulated cancellous screws with direct lateral and medial approach. He had finally consulted us because of worsening ankle pain while walking. On physical examination, there was tenderness in the anteromedial joint space of the right ankle. Slight ankle swelling was noted. Dorsiflexion of the right ankle was 10\u00b0, similar to that of the left ankle, but plantarflexion was restricted to 38\u00b0, compared with 60\u00b0 on the left, but the ankle instability test was negative.\nThe first three months, even though we performed intra-articular injections, arthroscopic synovectomy for osteoarthritis, and the fixation implant removal in order to release implant irritation, his ankle pain persisted.\nThe AOFAS ankle score at that point in time was 50 . Radiographs showed moderate narrowing of the ankle joint and forward displacement of the talus (-A, B). Computed tomography of the right ankle showed an osteochondral defect on the anterolateral surface of the distal tibial plafond (). This was diagnosed as progressive osteoarthritis caused by an osteochondral defect on the anterolateral surface of the distal tibial plafond, and surgical repair of the osteochondral defect was recommended. Three months later, the osteochondral graft was performed on the patient's right ankle. The patient was placed in the supine position under general anesthesia.

Abdominal ultrasound showed gallstones with no evidence of cholecystitis or biliary obstruction. The patient was diagnosed with biliary colic and discharged home with a plan to perform an elective cholecystectomy. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was performed as an outpatient as part of the preoperative workup which showed evidence of gallstones, small bilateral pleural effusions, and moderate pericardial effusion with high density suggestive of hemorrhage (). Consequently, the patient was referred to the emergency department for further workup. Upon arrival, the patient was asymptomatic, his vital signs were normal, and his physical examination was unremarkable. An electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed a nonspecific interventricular conduction delay. Chest x-ray showed a mildly enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette with prominent perihilar opacities suggestive of a prominent vasculature (). Complete blood count and basic metabolic profile were within normal limits. Further laboratory workup showed normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, complement level, and procalcitonin with negative serology for antinuclear antibodies and double-stranded DNA antibodies. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a large pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade, moderate aortic regurgitation, and normal left ventricular ejection fraction and size. Given the large volume of pericardial effusion, a pericardial window was attempted. A total of one liter of hemorrhagic fluid was drained. Pericardial tissue biopsy showed acute and chronic inflammatory cells with thickened pericardium, and no malignant cells were detected ().

His left kidney was normal in size and both kidneys showed normal corticomedullary pattern. His renal function was normal.\nWhile waiting for lithotripsy he developed chest pain which turned out to be extensive anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography showed a complete occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). He underwent primary angioplasty to the proximal LAD, 150 mL of iodixanol contrast agent was used for this intervention. His haemodynamic parameters remained stable throughout. He was normotensive. His jugular venous pressure was not elevated and the lung bases were clear. From the onset of chest pain he did not pass any urine. Anuria persisted despite adequate fluid resuscitation. He was treated with 80 mg of intravenous furosemide without any response.\nHis full blood count was normal and there was no eosinophilia. Urine full report was normal without any urine eosinophils. Serum complement (C3 and C4) level was normal. However his creatinine continued to rise steadily, and reached 6.2 mg/dl at 48 hours after the stenting. Urine electrolyte value and fractional excretion of sodium were not consistent with a pre-renal pathology. Repeatedly abdominal ultrasound scan with Doppler showed right ureteric calculus and failed to reveal any abnormalities in renal arterial or venous flow. 2D echo cardiogram showed anterior wall hypokinesia with preserved ejection fraction. Since his renal function deteriorated, he was supported with haemodyalysis. Total anuria persisted for three days. On day four he passed 30 ml of urine.

Bilateral papilledema was found at the ophthalmic examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displayed a mass with homogenous contrast enhancement in the left brain hemisphere and brainstem (). On the operation, a subtotal excision was performed. Histopathological examination of the excisional piece revealed a malignant tumor that had anaplasia, marked cellularity, necrotic areas, and a remarkable neoangiogenesis with proliferation of endothelium of the capillaries. The tumor was histopathologically diagnosed as a glioblastoma multiforme. The subtotal excisional surgery was followed by cranial radiotherapy with a total dose of 60 Gy. Then we applied temozolomide (200 mg/m2/day peroral for 5 days; every 4 weeks for 10 cycles) and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg IV; every 2 weeks for 6 cycles) plus irinotecan (125 mg/m2 IV; every 2 weeks for 6 cycles) as first and second-line treatments. However, in the control magnetic resonance imaging, the tumor showed progression despite these treatments. Therefore, we began to use nivolumab as a third-line treatment.\nNivolumab therapy was started at a dose of 3 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks. Two days after the second dose, the patient was admitted to the hospital with a rapidly progressive decline in visual acuity of the eyes. On ophthalmic examination, the visual acuity of the right eye was counting fingers at 1 m and was very low on his left eye (limited to light perception). At the posterior segment examination, there was an optic disc swelling bilaterally. Other vital findings, such as blood electrolyte levels and neurological examination, were normal. An urgent MRI showed bilateral thickening of the optic nerves suggestive of optic neuritis, with normal intracranial pressure ().

With development of renal failure, secondary hyperparathyroidism was noted. Due to her obesity, she was not eligible for a renal transplant or a SPK.

Due to his history of minimal response to standard-dose monotherapies, the patient was started on high-dose, combination nicotine replacement (two 21 mg patches plus 4 mg nicotine lozenges).\nThree weeks later, the patient returned for a follow-up visit; he reported adherence to his combination nicotine replacement but no significant reduction in cigarettes per day or smoking urges. The patient was then transitioned to standard varenicline dosing (1 mg twice per day), plus 4 mg nicotine lozenges. Two weeks later, the patient returned for third visit and was found to be compliant with this new medication regimen; he stated that he tolerated it well but had no reduction in smoking or smoking urges. The patient wanted to make a quit attempt and was given a quit day in 3 weeks.\nThe patient returned for a fourth visit on his quit day. He had not quit and had no reduction in urges.

Approximately three cups worth of vomit was produced, some redness in coloration, but was attributed to red wine consumed at lunch. Her chest pain was of band distribution around the chest, came on after vomiting, was six out of ten in severity and settled after resting for a few hours. Relevant negatives included no shortness of breath, calf-swelling, altered sense of taste, or change to exercise tolerance. Of note, the patient reported a similar episode of pain three months prior, with the family practitioner concluding this was musculoskeletal pain. Her past medical history was significant for rheumatic fever aged six, and an un-repaired hiatus hernia. She was on no regular medications, with no known drug allergies. Her family history was significant for diabetes mellitus on the paternal side, and ischemic stroke on the maternal side. Generally, she maintains activities of daily living well, with a normal walking tolerance of over two miles. On examination, there was a collapsing pulse, with no other significant findings.\nBased on this initial history and presentation the following differential diagnoses were considered. Firstly, MI due to chest pain and vomiting present in history, rendering it vital to exclude. Stable angina due to chest pain on exertion, which was relieved after rest. Pulmonary embolism due to sudden onset of chest pain, however, no association of shortness of breath. Rheumatic heart fever due to the past medical history of rheumatic fever as a child.

Clinical impression was of LE Coats' disease. Ultrasonography of the LE revealed total retinal detachment with subretinal fluid (SRF) having mild to moderate echoes with normal globe contour and no evidence of mass or calcification. Computed tomography scan of the orbit and brain was done to rule out retinoblastoma.

After cessation of SRF passage, the remnant can be aspirated actively using vitrectomy platform along with balanced salt solution infusion cannula to maintain the intraocular pressure and help in expelling the SRF []. Drainage of SRF has to be done under constant visualization of the retina to detect any incarceration.

On admission, CT and MRI of the head revealed lesions in the right thalamus and third ventricle and subsequent hydrocephalus (Fig. a\u2013f). Clinical diagnosis: Right thalamic glioma, obstructive hydrocephalus.\nAccording to the CT and MRI scans, the tumour originated from the right thalamus and grew medially and anteriorly, with the main body located in the body of the lateral ventricle. The anterior boundary of the tumour adhered to the interventricular foramen, the posterior boundary of the tumour closed the junction between the body of the lateral ventricle and the atrium and the medial part of the tumour wrapped around the midline structure.

Tumour resection followed the sequence of the dorsal wall, lateral wall, anterior pole, posterior pole, ventral wall and medial wall.

He has been exclusively breastfed and his mother has not introduced solid foods as of yet to his diet.\nHe was a full term, spontaneous vaginal delivery without complications during the pregnancy or labor. He was in the 50th percentile for both height and weight at his 2 month visit, but has fallen to below the 3rd percentile for weight and is at the 3rd percentile for height.

He suffered from productive cough for weeks and was referred to our center because of the worsening symptoms of dyspnea and lower leg edema noted over the past few days. On presentation, his consciousness was alert. Body temperature was 37.8 \u00b0C. Pulse was 136 per minute regular. Blood pressure was 164/90 mmHg. Oxygen saturation was 88%. Auscultation revealed decreased breathing sounds at left lung field and sonorous rhonchus at right lung field. X-ray of the chest showed left pneumothorax with collapse of left lung, and ground glass opacities in right lung field (), more in favor of inflammatory process at that time. He was admitted under the impression of right lung pneumonia with left pneumothorax and received chest tube insertion and empiric antibiotics treatment. However persistent air leak noted, he then received a chest CT for further survey. A chest CT showed nodular lesions over bilateral lung, with diffuse bone, left lower neck (), left suparclavicular, mediastinum, as well as right hilar () and lower abdominal lymph nodes metastases. Unknown primary malignancy with bilateral lung metastases, diffuse bony metastases with left supraclavicular and left neck lymph node metastases was impressed and further tissue proof for possible underlying malignancy was recommended. For this reason, an echo guided biopsy with left neck lymph node biopsy was arranged for further study because the surgical intervention was not recommended for the patient due to poor lung function while patient declined bronchoscopy biopsy either.

The patient expressed substantial memory impairment making it difficult to establish precise details of her medical and psychiatric history. No psychotic symptoms or suicidal or homicidal ideations were reported.\nHer symptoms began approximately at the age of 25 alongside a chronic course of apathy, low energy, depressed mood, interpersonal rejection sensitivity, poor self-esteem, crying spells, and hopelessness. Prior to the onset of these symptoms, she recalled frequent headaches since her teenage years which persisted during this time period. Routine evaluation at the time did not reveal any underlying organic cause and she was given a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder. The patient sought medical treatment at the age of 30 after experiencing dizziness, amenorrhea, and visual disturbances for one year in addition to her symptoms of depressed mood. The patient also expressed impaired memory, leaden paralysis, increased appetite, and hypersomnia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) conducted at this time revealed a benign macropituitary adenoma. The patient was initially managed conservatively with hormone replacement therapy Estradiol/Progesterone 1 mg/100 mg and serial MRIs throughout the following decade. The hormone replacement therapy had little effect on her mood or cognitive dysfunction as she continued to demonstrate a depressed mood and poor cognitive functioning.

    "original_text": "A 25-year-old female patient presented suffering from pain in the left upper arm over two months. The patient had been diagnosed with CCD at another hospital based on clinical features, radiographic findings, and genetic testing. The clinical characteristics included hypoplasia of the clavicles, narrow pelvis, short stature, and craniofacial malformations (). Physical examination of the left upper arm revealed no findings of redness, swelling, or tenderness. Radiographic examination revealed radiolucent lesions without any periosteal reaction in the humerus (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a low-signal-intensity lesion on T1-weighted images and a high-signal-intensity lesion on short-tau inversion recovery (Figures and ). In addition, a remarkable signal enhancement in the segment was found on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI. A plain computed tomography (CT) showed calcification in the whole diaphysis of the left humerus (). Bone scintigraphy demonstrated increased focal uptake in the lesion (). For definitive diagnosis, we performed an open biopsy of the lesion. Based on histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen, we diagnosed the patient with conventional chondrosarcoma in the left humerus (). On the other hand, we could not find any positive immunostaining cell for Runx2 in the lesion () and excluded metastasis of pulmonary or other lesion based on the findings of radiographs, CT, and bone scintigraphy. Thereafter, we performed wide resection of the lesion in the proximal humerus and sling procedure using free VFG for reconstruction of the large bone defect (). The distal end of the grafted bone was fixed to the proximal stump of the humerus with a locking plate.

Most laboratory test results revealed normal limits except for elevated white blood count (11,170/\u03bcL) and serum C-reactive protein level (1.6 mg/dL). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (Fig. ) revealed intussusception at the ileocecal region, which appeared as a \u201ctarget\u201d sign with a tumorous oval mass of 56 \u00d7 41 mm as a leading point of intussusception.

At laparotomy, the bowels had already spontaneously reduced, and a mass was palpable in the ileocecal region. We performed an ileocecal resection, aiming to avoid the potential of relapse of intussusception due to the residual mass. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on day 16 postoperatively.

He complained of pain in the left elbow and shoulder. The proximal part of the left arm and elbow had swelling and crepitus. His neurovascular examination was normal. Plain radiographs showed a displaced fracture at the proximal metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction of the left humerus and ipsilateral displaced extension type supracondylar humerus fracture (Figure ). His left upper extremity was splinted and the patient was taken to the operating room on the same day.\nUnder general anesthesia, closed reduction of the supracondylar humerus fracture was initially attempted under fluoroscopic control. However, it could not be achieved with manipulation because it was difficult to perform closed reduction on the severely swollen upper limb. A 3 mm temporary Kirschner wire was inserted to the humeral shaft from the lateral to medial direction. With the assistance of this \"joystick\" Kirschner wire, the humeral shaft was manipulated easily and closed reduction and percutaneous fixation with three Kirschner wires were performed. Once the supracondylar humerus fracture was stabilized, the management of the proximal humerus fracture was relatively straightforward. Closed reduction with gentle manipulation and percutaneous fixation with two Kirschner wires were applied to the proximal humerus fracture (Figure ). After the operation, we used a plaster of Paris splint to immobilize the left upper extremity.\nWe removed the Kirschner wires from both the elbow and the shoulder and the splint as an outpatient procedure after 4 weeks of radiographic healing and a range of motion exercises were begun. During the final follow-up 6 months after the surgery, plain radiographs showed adequate healing without any angular deformity on the elbow and shoulder (Figure ).

On the operation, a subtotal excision was performed. Histopathological examination of the excisional piece revealed a malignant tumor that had anaplasia, marked cellularity, necrotic areas, and a remarkable neoangiogenesis with proliferation of endothelium of the capillaries. The tumor was histopathologically diagnosed as a glioblastoma multiforme. The subtotal excisional surgery was followed by cranial radiotherapy with a total dose of 60 Gy.

The periapical and panoramic radiographic analysis showed a radiolucency image on the related teeth which were previously applied endodontic treatment []. The clinical and radiographic diagnosis showed that the severe inflammation on the teeth 23, 24, and 26 in the left maxillary region occurred due to the endodontic-periodontal lesion. The teeth with lesion were extracted after the antibiotic treatment, and the infected area was curetted. Implant indication was placed on this region upon the patient's approval. A treatment protocol including implant rehabilitation and peri-implant plastic surgeries was prepared based on the patient's clinical and radiographic measurements. According to the protocol, this region was decided to be suitable for peri-implant plastic surgical approaches since it had a shallow vestibule due to heavy inflammation and a vertical bone defect before the implant placement. Upon the patient's approval, it was decided that the peri-implant plastic surgery procedures were carried out in multiple stages to minimize the possible complications in this complicated case. Peri-implant plastic surgeries were applied pre and during implantation.\nSurgical procedures were carried out in two stages:First, the vestibule sulcus depth and the keratinized mucosa width (KMW) were increased through free gingival graft (FGG) on the area with shallow vestibule, and then, sinus augmentation was applied for the vertical ridge augmentation.\nThe FGG technique was used to increase the shallow vestibule and to simplify the primer closure of the flap after the augmentations. Thus, the implant site was prepared for the augmentations. The site to which the bone augmentations and implants would be applied was prepared by a horizontal incision from the mucogingival junction",

CT scan of his head at that time showed multiple brain parenchymal haemorrhagic contusions involving the corpus callosum, bilateral frontal, and temporal lobes. He suffered right-sided hemiparesis since then. Seven years later he started to develop gradual worsening of the unilateral hemiparesis along with new onset of rigidity and hyperreflexia, symptoms which are indicative of extrapyramidal syndrome and had worsened along the course of 2 years. He was thus investigated for the possibility of idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease. MRI of his head was done and showed encephalomalacia changes involving bilateral superior frontal gyri. The lesion within the left frontal lobe involves the supplementary motor cortex (area 6) which explains the post-traumatic right-sided hemiparesis that he had suffered from for years. No abnormality was seen within the basal ganglia or midbrain to explain the extrapyramidal symptoms. No susceptibility-weighted imaging was obtained at that time. The DaT scan showed complete absence of the radioligand uptake within the right striatum with normal uptake on the left (). Whilst asymmetric onset is a clinical hallmark of idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease, the marked asymmetry where one side is normal is not a feature of idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease and suggests a structural cause. Furthermore, a repeat DaT scan of our patient two years later showed no change in the unilateral right striatum absent uptake.

    "original_text": "The patient was a 40-year-old primiparous woman. She was diagnosed with submucosal fibroids by her previous gynecologist 5 years prior, based on chief complaints of atypical genital bleeding and hypermenorrhea. She underwent hysteroscopic myomectomy for one 1 cm sized and one 3 cm sized submucosal fibroid located between 2 and 3 o'clock in the uterine fundus. Asherman's syndrome was suspected after the patient exhibited secondary hypomenorrhea 10 months after surgery. Therefore, hysterosalpingography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. Intrauterine adhesions were suspected based on hysterosalpingography findings, while uterine cavity narrowing was identified using MRI. Hysteroscopy revealed filmy adhesions consistent with myomatous tissue at the excision site, and the patient was diagnosed with Asherman's syndrome.\nEight months after diagnosis, the patient underwent hysteroscopic adhesiolysis. The filmy adhesions observed on the left side of the fundus were easily separated with Hegar cervical dilators, and an intrauterine device was inserted after dilation.

She was described as a very anxious child; past medical history was notable for a history of frequent stomach pains of no known medial cause, and school refusal, though no eating or growth problems. Susan developed repeat episodes of viral gastroenteritis over a two week period which left her convinced that resuming eating had caused her gastro-intestinal symptoms. As a result, over the next few months she progressively ate less and lost weight. She underwent a full medical work-up but no pathology was identified. Her parents progressively eliminated foods that could potentially exacerbate her symptoms of abdominal pain and nausea, but with limited effect. She was admitted to the pediatric ward weighing 75.8% of TGW (BMI 11.8 kg/m2). Given her refusal to eat, she was initially re-nourished with liquid nutrition (Ensure) via nasogastric (NG) tube, but weight gain was very slow and difficult. She refused to eat or drink, would kick and scream and become hysterical whenever food was presented, and screamed throughout the duration of her NG feeds. One month after admission there had been minimal progress, so the ED team was consulted and family therapy was initiated. Her case history was felt to be in keeping with ARFID-aversive subtype.\nIn addition to family therapy, Susan was treated with olanzapine over the course of her admission to help with her severe agitation and anxiety; she was started on 2.5 mg at night and the dose was gradually increased to a maximum of 2.5 mg in the morning and 5 mg at night.\nBoth parents were convinced that this must be a medical problem. The therapist worked to empower and educate parents, lift guilt and blame, and also to raise anxiety about the need for parents to take control of the nutrition and help their daughter to eat",

She was sent to the Forensic Psychiatric Observation Department of the Council of Forensic Medicine for evaluation of criminal responsibility. She was caught in the camera system of a hospital while she was closing her 3-month-old daughter's nose and mouth.\nAccording to her testimony, she got married without the permission of her family and moved to a different city with her husband, lived there with her husband's family, and had three children. Her husband had epilepsy disease. Their first child was a girl and the doctors had informed the mother that her daughter had developmental dysplasia of the hip and could not walk. However, her daughter survived with the condition until she was 30 months old. One day, the mother desired to exclude her child's disease and closed her daughter's mouth and nose with her hand for about 5 min; however, when her daughter's condition became worse, she called her husband. Her husband poured a glass of water on the child's face after which she recovered. After her husband had gone back to work, she again closed her daughter's nose and mouth; unfortunately, this time the child could not recover and died at the hospital and they buried her.\nTheir second daughter aged 6 months had frequent complaints of fever, cough, and empurpling.

Her dyspnoea had increased in the previous two weeks, as had her generalised body oedema.\nOn physical examination, she was found to have blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg with a regular heart rate of 66 beats per min. Her jugular vein distention was raised about 15 cm above the sternal angle with a prominent A wave. She had central and peripheral cyanosis (). The pericardial examination was significant for the visible apex beat pulsations in the fifth intercostal space in the mid-axillary line and there were also visible pulsations along the parasternal border and second intercostal space. The apex beat was palpable in the fifth intercostal space with ill-sustained heave. The second heart sound was palpable in the second intercostal space.\nAuscaltation of the heart revealed S1, S2 and S4 along with a systolic murmur of grade 4/6 with maximum intensity in the left second intercostal space. Lung auscultation revealed bilateral crackles up to one-third of the chest bilaterally. The abdominal examination was significant for tender hepatomegaly, which was four fingers below the costal margins, and the total hepatic span was measured to be 19 cm. She had bilateral pedal oedema extending up to the lower abdomen and involving the external genitalia (, ).
