Of note, this man was resident overseas and throughout the course of his frame treatment made several flights of over 3 h between the UK and his home.\nOther than surgical time (Fig. ), 47 individuals had one risk factor, six had two, and three patients had three. Risk factors are summarised in Table .\nOf the procedures for which records were obtained, patients received post-operative prophylactic dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for 71 procedures. Forty of those who received LMWH had identifiable risk factors on review of case notes. Of the 31 without an identified risk factor, we have postulated the potential reason for the use of chemical thromboprophylaxis which is summarised in Table . If the first dose of chemical prophylaxis was more than 36 h post-operatively, the use of LMWH was thought to be due to prolonged immobility. For those with insufficient data to calculate a BMI, it was surmised that this was the risk factor for which LMWH was used. One individual had polio and another who underwent simultaneous application of an ipsilateral femoral and tibial frame may have been considered to be risks of thromboembolism.\nTwenty patients were found to have risk factors for thrombosis but were not treated with chemical thromboprophylaxis, summarised in Table . Of 12 adults with high BMI, only three had a BMI over 40; four whose only risk factor was age > 60 were aged between 62 and 66.

This was identified during a descriptive-prospective cross sectional study of the morphological characteristics of the extra-hepatic biliary system in humans.\nThe anterior abdominal wall was opened longitudinally along the midline. The abdominal wall was separated on to the right side along the central margin up to the mid axillary line. Then the abdominal wall was divided from the right side of the pubic bone up to the anterior superior iliac spine. The anterior abdominal wall flap was reflected laterally. The stomach was retracted to the left side and the second part of the duodenum, free margin of the lesser omentum, epiploic foramen and gall bladder identified. Dissection was done to demonstrate the extra-hepatic biliary system and its vascular pattern.\nThe right and left hepatic ducts were not seen extra-hepatically and the common hepatic duct drained directly into the gall bladder neck, with absence of the common bile duct. Further drainage of the bile away from the gallbladder and into the duodenum was provided by the cystic duct. The gall bladder was lying in the gall bladder fossa in the right lobe of the liver in a transverse plane. The width and the length of the gall bladder were 2.5 cm and 4.5 cm respectively. The length of the common hepatic duct was 2.6 cm and the cystic duct that drained the gall bladder to the duodenum was 6.9 cm (Figure ).\nApart from the anomalous extra-hepatic biliary morphology, a rare abnormal arterial pattern was observed. The cystic artery was anterior to the common hepatic duct and it was originating from the right hepatic artery. The division of anterior and posterior branches of the cystic artery was not noted.

    "original_text": "A 61-year-old man who was diagnosed with bulbar ALS was admitted to our hospital for evaluation and management of blood backflow through a gastrostomy tube. He had been diagnosed with ALS 26 months before admission and had undergone gastrostomy 6 months before admission. Additionally, 1 month before admission, he started full tube feeding and maintained a stable diet of 500 mL per meal. At the time of admission, he was 176 cm tall and weighed 43 kg (body mass index [BMI]: 13.88 kg/m2); his weight was similar to that measured 6 months before admission. He was using the home ventilator via tracheostomy tube full-time for 24 hours and all his limb muscles were generally measured as trace grade on the manual muscle test. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, and an acute gastric ulcer with recent bleeding was identified. The gastrostomy tube was removed because irritation by the tube was thought to be the cause of bleeding. The patient underwent therapeutic fasting for 5 days, and a high-dose proton pump inhibitor was administered intravenously.\nAfter 5 days of fasting, the patient resumed enteral feeding through a nasogastric tube. Considering the healing process of the gastric ulcer, 100 cc of meal was fed through the nasogastric tube; this was increased to 200 cc per meal after 2 days. Since the patient had consumed about 1500 cc of meal per day before admission, the remaining nutrients were supplied via parenteral nutrition. A follow-up endoscopic examination confirmed a healing state of the gastric ulcer, and we re-inserted the gastrostomy tube 7 days after resuming the meal through the nasogastric tube (or 12 days after previous gastrostomy tube removal). The volume of diet administered through the gastrostomy tube was also initiated at 100 cc per meal and gradually increased.

In physical examination neither motor/sensory deficit nor cranial nerve dysfunction was detected, but bilateral small pale optic disks with sharp margins were evident in direct ophthalmoscopy.

She presented with a 3 day history of right iliac fossa pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Vaginal examination and her fetal fibronectin test was negative. However, transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound examination revealed a 6.0 \u00d7 5.5 \u00d7 5.9 cm vascular mass within the right pelvis with a clear arterial feeder and turbulent swirling intraluminal flow, leading to the diagnosis of a pseudoaneurysm (Fig. ). The diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig. ). The patient was discussed in our multidisciplinary team meeting with interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons, and anaesthetists. The risk of imminent rupture was assessed as high due to the severity of her symptoms and a 5\u201310 mm overall increase in the size of the pseudoaneurysm documented by sequential MRI 14 days apart. Surgery was considered high risk and so selective embolization of the pseudoaneurysm was performed. This was performed under local anaesthetic in the Interventional Radiology suite with full preparation for emergency delivery by the obstetric and anaesthetic team in case of fetal distress. The right uterine artery was identified angiographically from a contralateral femoral arterial puncture and selectively catheterised using a microcatheter. The artery was small but extravasation into the presumed pseudoaneurysm was identified near its proximal portion. The artery was embolised with a series of microcoils across the neck of the pseudoaneurysm to block flow. The procedure was uneventful and the fetus showed a continuous reactive heart rate pattern. Follow up ultrasound showed a completely thrombosed pseudoaneurysm with no flow. She had regular follow ups in the antenatal clinic with no sign of recurrence.

After admission, echocardiography was performed. The findings on this examination were nonspecific. The operation was performed after disinfection of the right arm and left leg. A longitudinal incision was made on the prior surgical incision scar and adhesiolysis was performed. The saphenous vein graft which is anastomosed during the previous surgery was intact, but the distal part of the anastomotic site showed aneurysmal change.

The resected aneurysm revealed a true aneurysmal sac filled with internal thrombus (). After anastomosis of the saphenous vein graft at both the proximal and distal part of the brachial artery, the distal radial artery showed good patency on intraoperative Doppler examination. The histopathologic examination revealed elastic fiber disruption of the brachial artery and saccular dilatation of aneurysm (). There was an organized fibrin clot on the aneurysm wall.

Clinical and radiological examination identified a 7.1 cm right temple mass with extensive invasion of underlying tissues including the lateral orbit. The patient experienced diplopia and diminished mobility of the right eye. A head CT revealed a mass continuous with the lacrimal gland, lateral rectus muscle and globe with extension into the lateral orbital wall and roof.\nThe tumor resection resulted in a large orbital and temporal defect.

The dural defect was repaired successfully with layered temporalis fascia and titanium mesh that was cantilevered off the frontal bone and rigidly fixed. A submental island flap (20 cm transverse and 6 cm vertical) was utilized for reconstruction. The flap was harvested in conventional fashion with preservation of the facial vessels and marginal mandibular nerves. The lower border of the mandible was harvested with incorporation of the right mylohyoid muscle and anterior belly of the digastric muscle into the soft tissue component of the flap to protect both skin and bone perforators. The flap was delivered via a subcutaneous tunnel in the posterior cheek to reconstruct the facial defect and the mandibular component was used to reconstruct the right lateral orbit through rigid fixation (Fig. ). The proximal skin of the SIF was deepithelialized to prevent burying of the epidermis subcutaneously and used as a full-thickness skin graft for a residual defect on the upper forehead.\nThe post-operative pathology confirmed clear resection margins. Although the flap was completely viable, radical adjuvant radiation therapy led to loss of overlying soft tissue over time (Fig. ). It is important to note that the bony segment remained healthy and well-integrated with the zygomatic and orbital remnants well after radiation.

The patient had some prior neurological concerns which began with difficulty achieving major developmental milestones. He did not learn to walk until 17 months of age and required speech therapy at the age of two. Whether these details were relevant to his future diagnosis of Rasmussen\u2019s encephalitis is unclear but it does show that he had neurological impairment from an early age, and additionally the patient had a maternal aunt with a past medical history of seizures. At age 11, he first noticed signs of right hemilateral weakness beginning in the upper extremity. By age 14, his neurological symptoms continued to progress leading to complete right hemilateral weakness causing him to hold his arm in a \u201cdrawn-up\u201d fashion and walking with a limp, prompting the need to obtain an MRI at age 14. This MRI was read as a cerebral vascular accident and the patient was told that he would probably have residual hemilateral weakness and was diagnosed with cerebral palsy.\nA week before our patient arrived at the ED he had his first seizure around 0230 in the morning. Our patient was in the kitchen and found by his parents complaining that he could no longer feel or move his right upper and lower extremities.

However, transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound examination revealed a 6.0 \u00d7 5.5 \u00d7 5.9 cm vascular mass within the right pelvis with a clear arterial feeder and turbulent swirling intraluminal flow, leading to the diagnosis of a pseudoaneurysm (Fig. ).

The risk of imminent rupture was assessed as high due to the severity of her symptoms and a 5\u201310 mm overall increase in the size of the pseudoaneurysm documented by sequential MRI 14 days apart. Surgery was considered high risk and so selective embolization of the pseudoaneurysm was performed. This was performed under local anaesthetic in the Interventional Radiology suite with full preparation for emergency delivery by the obstetric and anaesthetic team in case of fetal distress. The right uterine artery was identified angiographically from a contralateral femoral arterial puncture and selectively catheterised using a microcatheter. The artery was small but extravasation into the presumed pseudoaneurysm was identified near its proximal portion. The artery was embolised with a series of microcoils across the neck of the pseudoaneurysm to block flow. The procedure was uneventful and the fetus showed a continuous reactive heart rate pattern. Follow up ultrasound showed a completely thrombosed pseudoaneurysm with no flow. She had regular follow ups in the antenatal clinic with no sign of recurrence.

    "original_text": "We report the case of a seventy four year old man who presented to the Emergency Department complaining of back pain of two months duration. This was a dull mid- thoracic back pain with radiation to the chest and upper abdomen. It was initially intermittent associated with exertion, but now was increasing in frequency and severity to the extent that it was interfering with his daily living activities. There was no history of trauma. His family history was unremarkable.\nHis only significant past medical history was that of hypercholesterolaemia for which he was prescribed a statin by his general practitioner. He underwent surgery for varicose veins in his right leg 7 years previously. His regular medications also included aspirin. He had no known drug allergies and smoked 10 cigarettes per day. He was a retired farmer who lived with his wife and was in good physical condition from an anaesthetic point of view (ASA grade I). On examination of his back the overlying skin was unremarkable although a mild thoracic kyphosis was present. Physical examination revealed conspicuous tenderness and percussion pain in the thoracic region. The straight leg raising test was negative on both sides. His neurological system was intact on examination. Systemic examination was also unremarkable.\nLaboratory studies including total blood count, sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, electrolyte values, and alkaline phosphate levels were within the normal ranges. Chest radiography showed widening of the right paratracheal stripe, of concern for lymphadenopathy. There were also calcified left hilar lymph nodes. Plain radiographs of the thoracic spine showed mid thoracic kyphosis with loss of distinction of the posterior cortices of T7 and T8.\nAn MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine was carried out [,].

He had undergone surgery on his left lower limb twice (25 and 55 years beforehand). The patient had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. A biopsy performed at the orthopedic department showed calcification of the soft tissue. X-rays of the left lower extremity showed extensive calcification, which included the anterior and lateral compartments and a portion of the posterior compartment ().\nThe patient presented to the hospital again with swelling and tenderness at the biopsy site. On examination, an open wound was observed on the anterolateral side of the proximal left lower leg, and a cavity had formed from which a discharge emerged. The turbid secretion contained calcium debris. The cavity extended to just above the ankle. An incision was made extending to the ankle, and debridement and irrigation were performed, after which a betadine-soaked gauze dressing was applied (). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was identified in the wound culture, and vancomycin was intravenously administered. Osteomyelitis was not confirmed in the threephase bone scan test.\nAfter continuous dressings were applied, the discharge and debris started to reduce. The patient had an open wound on the left lower leg measuring 17 \u00d7 4 cm2. The tibia was exposed inside the wound, and focal granulation tissue had formed on the bony surface. Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) was applied to reduce the size of the wound. However, primary closure was not possible due to the large defect site and the slow growth of granulation tissue.

The initial surgery had been performed for advanced sigmoid colon cancer 3 years previously and the anastomotic leakage was remedied by diverging ileostomy performed 10 days after the initial surgery. Fluoroscopy conducted 1 week after the redo surgery showed good passage through the colorectal anastomosis and no anastomotic leakage. Ileostomy takedown was planned 6 months after the redo surgery for social reasons of the patient.

Abdominal computed tomography confirmed that the colon oral to the anastomotic site and the rectum anal to the anastomotic site were connected at the anastomosis but a thick membranous structure was observed in the circular staple line (Figure ). These findings suggested that patency of the anastomosis was discontinued by the thick membranous web composed in the circular stapler ring.

The pure tone audiogram showed an 80-dB mixed hearing loss with an increased threshold of bone conduction in the high tone frequency range. The patient experienced no dizziness or facial palsy. The tympanum and mastoid were filled with an isodensity shadow indicating bone erosion, and the wall of the carotid artery canal and the jugular bulb appeared to be thick and erosive on CT (). The mass was close to the carotid artery and jugular bulb through the tympanum, and the mastoid space was enhanced in the early and late phases of the dynamic MRI. The enhanced mass also appeared on the underside of the promontory of the middle ear (). The patient had experienced a tympanomastoidectomy for tumors in the tympanum 7 years previously and the pathological diagnosis was adenoma of the middle ear.\nThe surgical findings revealed that a grayish-red tumor with a slight yellowish hue filled the mastoid. The upper construction of the stapes was conservative, although it was covered with granulation. We performed a canal wall-down mastoidectomy to expose the sigmoid sinus, which revealed the tumor mass close to the jugular bulb. The tumor had originated from the mucous membrane of the hypotympanum and progressed to destroy the bony portions of the posterior wall of the extra meatus through the underside of the cochlear promontory with communication between the hypotympanum and mastoid.

He was first diagnosed as leg liposarcoma 5 years before and underwent complete resection. Despite of history of liposarcoma in his leg, he never developed any abdominal symptoms. Laboratory tests were unremarkable including carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) within their normal limits. Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated slightly enhanced 4-cm tumor located at gallbladder fundus (). On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the tumor had high signal in both of T2 and diffusion weighed image and low signal in both of T1 and apparent diffusion coefficient (). Based on these findings in imaging studies, our working differential diagnosis included liposarcoma and hemangioma rather than adenocarcinoma, and we recommended laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In the exploration, the tumor in the fundus appeared without serosal invasion (). Intraoperative ultrasonography revealed the tumor was contained in the gallbladder without infiltration into the liver, and in fact there was a distance between the liver bed and the tumor. Sonazoid enhanced ultrasonography ruled out liver metastasis and thus, we proceeded to laparoscopic cholecystectomy as planned. When the gallbladder was opened, yellowish white tumor was confirmed in the submucosal layer with the overlying mucosa intact (). Histopathological examination revealed, this tumor as myxoid liposarcoma consisting of lipoblasts and round cells. There was no necrosis and proliferations of spindle and round cell component were identified in the background of myxoid stroma (). These histological features were similar to the ones for the sarcoma in his leg that was resected before. The patient\u2019s postoperative course was uncomplicated and was discharged home on Day 3.

The gums around permanent maxillary right and left incisors were compromised, including a purulent discharge and severe tooth mobility (). During anamnesis, there was no mentioning or suspicion of systemic and/or hereditary diseases, deleterious habits, or local injury.\nRadiography revealed severe vertical bone loss in both upper incisors (), which did not respond to electric or thermal pulp vitality tests. The diagnosis of an odontogenic abscess was ruled out due to the absence of trauma or caries in the teeth involved. However, the single location of the condition, its absence in posterior quadrants of the maxilla and/or mandible, its exudative appearance, and the radiographic demonstration of bone destruction were similar to the findings seen in Langerhans cell disease.\nTo our surprise, an elastic band involving the midportion of the roots of the two central incisors was found during biopsy (). When asked about the presence of the elastic band, the patient responded that she had obtained the band from the hair of her doll and had placed it around her teeth because a dentist had treated a friend with diastema in the same region using an elastic band.\nThe debris was removed and a metal wire was placed in permanent maxillary right and left incisors (). In addition, exfoliative cytology was performed which demonstrated a large number of neutrophils, macrophages, and red blood cells, few lymphocytes, sparse pavement epithelial cells with inflammatory alterations, filamentous mucus, and cell remnants. There were no signs of malignancy. The cytological diagnosis was class II Papanicolaou compatible with an acute inflammatory process.\nThe patient was followed up by clinical and radiographic examination, but no improvement in tooth mobility was observed.

There was significant right atrial and ventricular dilatation with estimated high pulmonary arterial pressure (estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 90 mmHg) with preserved right ventricular function. Presence of high pulmonary arterial pressures which was initially attributed to late closure of patent ductus arteriosus could be contributed by the presence of high-flow extrahepatic portosystemic shunt, so he underwent CT of the abdomen to determine the type of shunt.

The pain was started in the periumbilical region then shifted to the right iliac fossa. Her pain started gradually and has increased in severity. She described it as a constant pain that was not relieved by oral simple analgesic medications. The pain was exacerbated by movement and was not related to posture or meals. She scored the pain as 7 out of 10 in severity. The pain was associated with nausea and few episodes of vomiting that had food content with no blood. One day after the onset of pain, the patient developed a low-grade fever that measured 37.9\u2103 and was relieved by antipyretics. The parents reported that her daughter had decreased appetite and activity since the onset of pain. However, there was no change in her urinary or bowel habits.\nThe past medical history of the patient was significant for poorly controlled asthma. She required three admissions in the past year due to asthma exacerbation. She was on an inhaled corticosteroid therapy and short-acting inhaled salbutamol. The patient did not have any surgical history. She attained normal growth and development milestones at an appropriate normal age. The gynecologic history was not obtained from the patient. The patient was a primary school student. There was no history of diseases running in their family and the parents were not consanguineous.\nUpon examination, the patient appeared tired and sick. She was not in respiratory distress. She did not appear pale, jaundice, or cyanosed.

The patient felt weak and lethargic over the last 2 weeks and it worsened before the admission so he took his blood pressure at home and found his pulse to be very low on the blood pressure machine so he called the ambulance to go to the hospital. There were no symptoms of volume overload like dyspnea on exertion, leg edema, or other symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient had a history of a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (SVA) as well as coronary artery aneurysms; so in the past he had a Bentall procedure, which included placement of a mechanical aortic valve (#23 St. Jude prosthesis) and a conduit replacing the ascending aorta (aortic reconstruction). At that time, there was also a single-vessel bypass using a vein graft to the right coronary artery due to right coronary aneurysm. This was in 1997. He was following up with his cardiologist who did periodic CT/MRI of the chest with contrast to follow the previously diagnosed aneurysms. The repeated chest imaging was showing an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm as well as the sinus of Valsalva and coronary artery aneurysms and was controlled with medical therapy and follow-up. Warfarin was given for anticoagulation for the metallic aortic valve. The size of thrombosed SVA was gradually increasing over time with 6 cm in diameter in 1999 and then progressed to 7.5 in 2000 and then to 7.3 \u00d7 6.5 cm by 2003. By 2004, size went up to 8.5 \u00d7 6.4 cm. The size remained stable on the subsequent CT scans that were done regularly. In 2009, the size went up to 8.1 \u00d7 7.2 cm.

There were no records available on the thromboembolic prophylaxis employed during the surgery, and the procedure was uneventful.

The patient was immediately transferred to our emergency department and opioid analgesics were administered intravenously for pain relief. A thorough examination of the patient revealed a stable medical status and maintenance of vital parameters. On auscultation, there were no signs of adventitious sounds such as crepitus or rhonchi. Local examination revealed swelling over the entire right lower limb with painful restriction of motion of the right knee. In addition, we also noted swelling over the popliteal region, which was non pulsatile and without any signs of auscultation bruit. The postoperative status of the wound was good with no fresh discharge.

Two weeks prior to referral, he was brought to an orthopedist for a suspected bone disorder characterized by worsening lumps on his left hand and ankle, which was noticed by his mother about 1 year before presentation. However, she had assumed that the swelling to his left hand was due to biting. In addition, swelling to his left ankle occurred after several leg strengthening exercises conducted by a physiotherapist. The orthopedist later recommended magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). On MRI preparation, the patient was found to have a high urea level and was thus referred to a pediatric nephrologist who subsequently initiated dialysis. His mother also claimed that the urine volume of her son had decreased within the last few weeks. On the second day of hospitalization, the swelling in his left ankle burst and thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystalized materials were observed.\nThe patient was born to healthy non-consanguineous parents with no family history of HPRT deficiency (). At the age of 1 day, the patient developed stiffness in both hands. When he was 2 months old, he was diagnosed with severe psychomotor retardation and could only lie down. A pediatric neurologist diagnosed the patient with cerebral palsy at the age of 7 months based on computed tomography results showing cerebral atrophy. The patient has a habit of biting his lower lip, buccal mucosa, and left hand, which was evident since the age of 6 years, for which an occlusal bite guard was once used years before to protect his teeth.

    "cleaned_text": "a 15-year-old male with renal failure was referred to our center for dialysis treatment. two weeks prior to referral, he was brought to an orthopedist for a suspected bone disorder characterized by worsening lumps on his left hand and ankle, which was noticed by his mother about 1 year before presentation. however, she had assumed that the swelling to his left hand was due to biting. in addition, swelling to his left ankle occurred after several leg strengthening exercises conducted by a physiotherapist. the orthopedist later recommended magnetic resonance imaging (mri). on mri preparation, the patient was found to have a high urea level and was thus referred to a pediatric nephrologist who subsequently initiated dialysis. his mother also claimed that the urine volume of her son had decreased within the last few weeks. on the second day of hospitalization, the swelling in his left ankle burst and thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystalized materials were observed.\nthe patient was born to healthy non-consanguineous parents with no family history of hprt deficiency (). at the age of 1 day, the patient developed stiffness in both hands. when he was 2 months old, he was diagnosed with severe psychomotor retardation and could only lie down. a pediatric neurologist diagnosed the patient with cerebral palsy at the age of 7 months based on computed tomography results showing cerebral atrophy. the patient has a habit of biting his lower lip, buccal mucosa, and left hand, which was evident since the age of 6 years, for which an occlusal bite guard was once used years before to protect his teeth. however, he refused to use it, which resulted in the extraction of some of his upper teeth. at present, he is unable to talk or communicate normally, but can express anger through agitating behavior. moreover, his parents remarked about the occasional presence of orange sand-like sediments found in his diaper, which first occurred at the age of 3 years. however, a local pediatrician",

She presented with a 3 day history of right iliac fossa pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Vaginal examination and her fetal fibronectin test was negative. However, transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound examination revealed a 6.0 \u00d7 5.5 \u00d7 5.9 cm vascular mass within the right pelvis with a clear arterial feeder and turbulent swirling intraluminal flow, leading to the diagnosis of a pseudoaneurysm (Fig. ). The diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig. ). The patient was discussed in our multidisciplinary team meeting with interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons, and anaesthetists. The risk of imminent rupture was assessed as high due to the severity of her symptoms and a 5\u201310 mm overall increase in the size of the pseudoaneurysm documented by sequential MRI 14 days apart. Surgery was considered high risk and so selective embolization of the pseudoaneurysm was performed. This was performed under local anaesthetic in the Interventional Radiology suite with full preparation for emergency delivery by the obstetric and anaesthetic team in case of fetal distress. The right uterine artery was identified angiographically from a contralateral femoral arterial puncture and selectively catheterised using a microcatheter. The artery was small but extravasation into the presumed pseudoaneurysm was identified near its proximal portion. The artery was embolised with a series of microcoils across the neck of the pseudoaneurysm to block flow. The procedure was uneventful and the fetus showed a continuous reactive heart rate pattern. Follow up ultrasound showed a completely thrombosed pseudoaneurysm with no flow. She had regular follow ups in the antenatal clinic with no sign of recurrence. A planned caesarean section was performed at 38 weeks gestation. A healthy baby boy was born weighing 2696 g with a blood loss of 1100mls.
