    "original_text": "A 72-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department from the outpatient oncology office with a week of mild abdominal pain, which was not life-threatening. His past medical history was notable for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which had been diagnosed one year earlier, from endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) brushings when he presented with obstructive jaundice and required biliary and duodenal stent placement at the time. He had undergone a routine CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis for disease progression two days prior to admission, which revealed a massive pneumoperitoneum (Figures , ). The ominous imaging prompted his admission to the hospital. On presentation to the emergency department, he was in no distress with a blood pressure of 126/85 mm Hg, pulse rate of 93 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 36.9\u00b0 C. Physical examination was significant for marked abdominal distension with a benign non-peritonitic exam and mild tenderness on palpation. Laboratory tests were unremarkable, except for a white blood cell count of 10.5 x 103/uL with neutrophil predominance (83%). A repeat CT scan showed patent biliary and duodenal stents without a definite source of perforation; however, three suspicious locations were noted by the radiologist containing small foci of free air adjacent to the bowel.\nGiven the initial concern for perforated viscus, the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals. He was managed conservatively with intravenous hydration and strict bowel rest. He remained hemodynamically stable and non-septic throughout his hospitalization and continued to have flatus and intact gastrointestinal function. General surgery recommended no acute surgical intervention. In a few days, he was started on a clear liquid diet which he tolerated well. His abdominal distension gradually improved without any surgical intervention, and he was discharged home a week after admission. Two months later, he underwent a repeat CT scan that showed resolution of the pneumoperitoneum (Figure ).",

A postoperative echocardiogram demonstrated a large membranous VSD and a long segment coarctation of the aorta. Three months after repair of the coarctation the infant was in congestive heart failure and was brought to the operating room for VSD repair. Preoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated a large membranous VSD that extended into the inlet septum and a widely patent left ventricular outflow tract ().\nVSD repair was performed using aortobicaval cannulation with mild hypothermia and antegrade cardioplegeic arrest. The echocardiographic findings were confirmed at surgery, and the VSD was closed in the standard manner using a Dacron patch and 5\u20130 Prolene pledgeted suture.

She developed cardiogenic shock and was emergently transferred to the University of Maryland's Cardiac Surgery Division for biventricular assist device placement. Her hospital course became complicated by VAD infection requiring long-term antibiotics and adrenal insufficiency necessitating chronic steroid therapy. Once stabilized, she was listed for heart transplantation, which she received 1 year after initial presentation. During her transplantation, the donor heart was found to be significantly larger than the patient's own heart, resulting in difficulty placing it within her relatively shallow pericardial sac. After implantation, the donor heart projected 8 cm above the bony chest wall and herniated nearly completely from the mediastinum with each ventilator inspiration (Fig , ). The patient with the sternal retractor left in place and a silo of GoreTex placed over the implanted heart was transferred back to the cardiac ICU. One day after transplantation, the patient developed right-sided heart failure necessitating placement of a right ventricle assist device (RVAD). Once she stabilized, the Division of Plastic Surgery was consulted for chest wall reconstruction.\nFour days after transplantation, the patient was taken to the operating room. The objective was to protect the heart until reexploration of her mediastinum for RVAD removal. Thus, resection of the entire sternum along with partial resection of 5 ribs bilaterally was performed. Nevertheless, the heart still protruded above skin level. Bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps were raised and transferred to the midline. Attempts to mechanically close pectoralis flaps resulted in elevated pulmonary artery and central venous pressures. Therefore, a sheet of DualMesh Plus (GoreTex) was sutured to the chest wall to cover the heart followed by superior and inferior closure of the pectoralis flaps.

Her antenatal course had no significant history with any history of antepartum low-back pain, trauma, drug use, or any physical exertion. On examination, she was conscious, well oriented, and afebrile. Neurological examination showed complete paraplegia (power 0/5 with decreased tone), associated bowel bladder involvement, and absent deep tendon reflexes at knee and ankle joint with complete sensory deficit below the level of L1. All necessary blood investigations including coagulation profile came out to be normal. Patient was planned for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of dorsolumbar spine with screening whole spine, which revealed extradural broad based ellipsoid lesion, measuring 50 \u00d7 9 mm along T12 to L2 vertebra displacing the dura anteriorly and T1 hyperintensity (\n), T2 hypointensity with minimal postcontrast enhancement suggestive of early subacute bleed causing mass effect on adjacent cord with areas of altered signal intensity at the level of lesion.\nOn the basis of clinical evaluation and MRI report, the patient was planned for urgent decompression in emergency operation theater.

He was seen at a local hospital before being referred to us as they lacked the facilities and expertise to perform neurosurgical intervention. At the local hospital, proper radiological surveillance was performed for him that showed a sellar-suprasellar lesion with optic chiasm compression and hemorrhagic foci. On physical examination, the patient was conscious, alert, and oriented to time, person, and place with a Glasgow coma score (GCS) of 15. He had bilateral light perception but denied any noticeable visual loss prior to the event as he was able to see and drive his own car.

Probing examination revealed pockets of 6 mm on the buccal and palatal mesial aspect and pockets of 5 mm on the buccal and palatal distal aspect. Radiograph showed an advanced vertical bone loss on the mesial and distal aspects of the tooth with an apical lesion and mild root resorption. Thermal pulp tests indicated necrotic pulp. Occlusion was checked, and there was an occlusal trauma. A diagnosis of a periodontal-endodontic lesion in the tooth #2 was then confirmed. After oral hygiene instructions, the patient received mechanical therapy (scaling and root planing) associated with antimicrobial drugs (amoxicillin 500 mg+metronidazole 250 mg 3 times a day during 7 days).

The transvaginal ultrasonography confirmed the pregnancy at 6 weeks 5 days. The laboratory results on presentation were significant for high calcium at 14.1 mg/dL and high PTH at 622 ng/L. Her neck ultrasound revealed homogenous echotexture of thyroid glands and a complex cystic nodule in the posterior inferior part of right lobe. FNA of that nodule was performed, and the patient was transferred to our facility for better management. The surgical removal of the tumor was done during the 1st trimester at the 7th week. According to the operation note, the tumor was a 5 cm rock hard mass, adherent to the surrounding strap muscles. The PTH level dropped significantly from 807 ng/L to 35 ng/L after parathyroidectomy. The parathyroid specimen was received in a fresh state at the frozen section room. The size of the tumor was 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 cm and the weight was 37 grams. It was a relatively circumscribed, reddish brown, soft, and partially cystic tumor. Serial sectioning revealed that the tumor had an irregular thick capsule and it was adherent to the surrounding strap muscles.\nThe tumor had both solid and cystic areas filled with thin blood-tinged fluid (). Representative sections of the tumor and the whole capsule were submitted for histological examination. Microscopically, the tumor was surrounded by the thick capsule, demonstrated with a blue arrow (). The tumor cells were arranged in nests and cords and were composed of multiple cell types, predominantly chief cells.\nBizarre atypical cells were frequent with nucleomegaly and hyperchromasia ().

    "original_text": "A 29-year-old female patient presented to the emergency room with nausea and vomiting. Her past medical history included chronic kidney failure due to bilateral ureterovesical reflux for which she had a cadaveric kidney transplant at the age of 17 with chronic immunosuppressive medication. She presented with acute renal failure 9 years after the transplant, due to postinfectious glomerulonephritis, from which renal function did not fully recover.\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms were accompanied by vague abdominal discomfort. Although no urinary symptoms were reported, a potential graft infection was suspected due to an abnormal urinalysis. The patient was discharged with a 7-day regimen of ciprofloxacin. The patient was rapidly readmitted due to cytopenias, arterial hypertension and acute kidney failure.\nA renal biopsy was performed and showed atypical glomerulopathy with immune complexes. An autoimmune panel was negative. Investigations were performed to assess the presence of an inflammatory or infectious process. An abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a hyperdense mass in the small bowel (Fig. ). CT enterography further showed a 2 cm homogeneous jejunal lesion with no extraluminal extension (Fig. ). Positron emission tomography scan displayed no hypermetabolism in the small bowel or in the renal allograft. Differential diagnosis included gastrointestinal stromal tumor and leiomyoma, but due to the transplant immunosuppression and the Epstein-Barr viral load of 16 596 copy/mL, a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) was highly suspected.\nSurgical exploration was required to determine if immunosuppressive treatments could be safely resumed. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a jejunal inflammatory lesion 10 cm distal to the Treitz ligament. Small bowel resection and anastomosis were performed. Histopathological examination revealed the presence of ectopic pancreatic tissue with chronic pancreatitis, located between the bowel mucosa and serosa.

The patient was referred and admitted to our department for suspected pathological fracture associated with a metastatic bone tumor on February 20. Swelling and local heat were present in the proximal region of the right forearm, and tenderness and pain during motion were also present. No spontaneous pain was observed. The range of motion of the right shoulder joint could not be measured because of pain. On admission, alkalinephosphatase, at 442 and C-reactive protein at 1.05, were both markedly elevated. All tumor markers were negative, and there were no abnormal findings on other tests.\nOn radiographs obtained at the first examination, a pathological fracture was noted in the proximal humerus, showing hypertranslucency of bone, mainly involving osteolytic changes (Figure ). On computed tomography (CT), the bone cortex was thinned, and showed a relatively homogenous structure. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a low intensity was observed on T1-weighted imaging, while the fractured region was mainly enhanced on T1 gadolinium contrast imaging, and high intensity was observed on T2-weighted imaging (Figure ). Bone scintigraphy showed signal accumulation in the proximal humerus. Based on these findings, pathological fracture associated with a metastatic bone tumor or primary malignant bone tumor in the right proximal humerus was diagnosed, and incisional biopsy and open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) were performed on February 25, 2002. The treatment consisted of three Ender's pins inserted at the posterior aspect of the elbow joint. Swelling of the right proximal upper arm became more severe after treatment.

He was not a known case of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, thyroid disorder, or any other chronic disease.\nVisual acuity of both eyes was 20/20. There was right face turn with left exotropia. Extraocular movements in left eye revealed complete limitation of adduction and mild limitation of depression []. There were no signs of thyroid ophthalmopathy. Rest of the anterior and posterior segment examination were within normal limits. A differential diagnosis of thyroid eye disease and ocular myasthenia gravis was considered and a thyroid function test (serum free T3, serum free T4, and serum thyroid stimulating hormone assay) and serum acetylcholine receptor antibody were ordered.\nThyroid function test was within normal limits and serum acetylcholine receptor antibody was negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbit showed hyperintensity in the belly of left medial and inferior rectus. There was no enlargement of the muscles and orbital fat content was normal [ and ]. The features on MRI were neither suggestive of thyroid eye disease nor idiopathic orbital inflammation.\nOn further inquiry, the patient gave history of isotretinoin intake for 3 months (1 mg/kg/day) for cystic acne just before the symptoms started and continued the drug for next 5 months. A provisional diagnosis of isotretinoin-induced myopathy was made and the patient was asked to stop isotretinoin. The patient was also started on a course of oral steroid in tapering fashion to take care of any associated inflammatory pathology.

She also complained of one episode of vomiting. Ectopic pregnancy was ruled out by urine pregnancy test. Abdominal examination did not reveal any mass and no abnormality was detected on per speculum examination. Bimanual examination revealed a normal-sized uterus and a cystic mass felt laterally near the posterior fornix that was approximately 4 cm in diameter. An ultrasound examination and CA-125 were requested. Ultrasonography revealed normal uterus with enlarged right ovary with a cyst measuring 46 mm \u00d7 36 mm \u00d7 55 mm showing internal echoes with volume of 50 cc, the left ovary was also enlarged with multiple well-defined cysts measuring 34 mm \u00d7 44 mm \u00d7 69 mm with volume of 55 cc and the largest cyst measured 37 mm [].

On the same day, the patient visited the department of gastroenterology at a university hospital for endoscopy including biopsy. The tests revealed advanced gastric cancer in the distal antrum (). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans subsequently confirmed the presence of cancer and metastasis. The results showed invasion of the entire wall of the antrum with regional lymph node metastasis (). He was diagnosed with stage IIIB gastric cancer (T4N2M0). On December 6, 2016, the patient underwent subtotal gastrectomy with Billroth I anastomosis and cholecystectomy, and was started on chemotherapy.

Apart from having received treatment for chronic hepatitis B, the patient had never been diagnosed with any disease of the GI tract prior to the gastric cancer diagnosis. During the endoscopy performed on November 15, 2016, he was not tested for H. pylori infection; in addition, he never underwent any tests for H. pylori infection.

Delivery was through Cesarean section, at term. Her birth weight was 2,900 g (10th centile) and her length was 45 cm (third centile). A right cleft lip-palate and limb anomalies were noted at birth. On examination, her length, weight and head circumference were below the third centile; she had delayed motor and mental development and she had the scar of repair of her right cleft lip, which was done at the age of two months. An examination of her mouth revealed the presence of a cleft palate. Her scalp hair was sparse and hypopigmented and her skin was dry and rough. Both hands showed a classic lobster claw deformity: her middle digit was absent and the remaining four fingers were parted, two on either side, the cleft almost dividing the palm into two (Figure ). The second and third toes of both her feet were missing and the remaining three toes were divided by a cleft into two parts, the big toe on one side and the other two toes on the other side (Figure ). Her external genitalia were female. Laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, electrolytes and liver tests and kidney, thyroid, anterior and posterior pituitary functions tests, showed no abnormalities. A chest radiography, abdominal ultrasound, echocardiography, ophthalmologic examination, fundus examination, cerebrospinal fluid pressure and hearing tests were normal. Skeletal X-rays (with the exception of the described limb anomalies) were all normal. Her karyotype was 46, XX and a genetic study demonstrated no mutations in any of the coding regions of TP63.

A core biopsy of his axillary mass revealed metastatic malignant melanoma. He had no prior history of a primary melanoma. A staging PET/CT revealed abnormal FDG uptake in his left axilla and small bowel. A left axillary lymph node dissection was performed and revealed 2 of 19 lymph nodes involved with metastatic melanoma, BRAF wild type, the largest of which measured 10.1 cm. His medical history was significant for oligodendroglioma, which was surgically resected eight years prior to presentation, followed by radiation therapy for recurrence five years prior to presentation. He received four doses of systemic ipilimumab for his metastatic melanoma without incident. Post-treatment imaging revealed disease progression with new diffuse subcutaneous, lung, liver and bilateral axillary lymph node metastases.\nHe subsequently enrolled on a genetically engineered T-cell trial, targeting tyrosinase. He received fludarabine and cyclophosphamide as a conditioning regimen, then his engineered T-cells were infused, followed by one week of low dose IL-2, (72,000 U/kg IV q8 hours). Per the treatment protocol, unfractionated creatinine kinase (CK) levels were obtained just prior to and for two weeks after infusion of the genetically engineered T-cells. The CK levels were within normal limits during the course of this treatment. He initially experienced disease response, however, four months after his T-cell therapy, he again developed diffuse progression with new hilar lymphadenopathy and progression of his lung and axillary lymph node metastases.\nHe was next treated with three doses of pembrolizumab but post-treatment imaging again revealed disease progression in his lungs.

    "original_text": "A 67-year-old male presented with a gastric mass incidentally found on the abdominal computed tomography (CT) for routine medical examination. Abdominal CT showed a fungating tumor at the gastric cardia and several lymph node enlargements at the left gastric and celiac axis. Gastric endoscopic examination revealed a huge fungating mass at the cardia, and subsequently mucosal biopsy was performed. Microscopically the biopsy specimen showed proliferations of bland looking hyperplastic foveolar epithelia with basally located small nuclei and fine nuclear chromatin in the heavy inflammatory background (Figure ). Some glands were destructed by inflammatory cell invasion and revealed mild epithelial atypia with mildly increased nuclei and loss of nuclear polarity reminiscent of reactive cellular atypia (Figure ). This biopsy specimen was diagnosed as foveolar epithelial hyperplasia. However, the clinical and endoscopic features of this patient were strongly suggestive of malignancy.

The patient was maintained on tacrolimus 4 mg twice daily, prednisone 5 mg daily, and mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg daily. She presented four years after transplant with intermittent diarrhea for 4 months duration and significant weight loss. On presentation, her creatinine was 3.4 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.2 mg/dL on prior studies. The patient was found to have a positive stool infectious panel PCR for norovirus during an inpatient hospital evaluation. Clostridium difficile study was negative, and fecal fat content was within normal limits. Mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued due to concern that her symptoms may be a result of medication side effect. She was subsequently started on azathioprine 50 mg daily for immunosuppression. With no real improvement in symptoms, she was treated with a 3-day course of 500 mg PO nitazoxanide twice daily with modest improvement. Two months later, the patient's symptoms reoccurred, and she received a second, longer course of nitazoxanide for 3 weeks. Her symptoms resolved within a week of treatment but again relapsed over the subsequent 3 months. Stool biofire PCRs were persistently positive for norovirus when checked monthly over the following 5-month time period. Finally, she was started on a 3-week course of nitazoxanide high dose (500 mg PO every eight hours). Initially, this was difficult to tolerate due to gastrointestinal distress, and the frequency of administration was decreased to twice daily. The patient completed the three weeks of nitazoxanide with resolution of her gastrointestinal symptoms.

She became aware of her condition ten years ago when she needed emergency surgery due to pain in her upper left abdomen; cholecystitis was detected, and she was successfully treated. During these last years, her weight has become a problem that has made it difficult to exercise or even walk. Therefore, she was admitted to our bariatric clinic. The patient had a BMI of 49.1 kg/m2, and fortunately, she didn't have any metabolic problems like diabetes, hypertension, or reflux. In addition, she did not suffer from other issues like bronchiectasis or sinusitis. Complementary exams (hematocrit and blood chemistry) were requested and came back normal; thus, she entered our bariatric program, and a gastric sleeve was planned. A preoperative CT scan of the abdomen confirmed the reversed position of the organs, and several adjustments were made to perform this unusual surgery (A and B). The surgical team handled the operation using a mirror image of the usual laparoscopic technique with the patient's reversed anatomy knowledge. The monitor was placed on the patient's right side, the surgeon stood on the left side, and the assistant on the right. We set a 10mm supraumbilical port for the staples and three 5 mm ports, one on the midclavicular line on the left side of the abdomen, one on the midclavicular line on the right side of the abdomen for the camera, and the last 5mm port on the right anterior axillary line for the traction of the omentum.

He reported adherence to his aseptic technique and had no previous history of peritonitis.\nIn March 2012, he presented with abdominal pain and turbid peritoneal fluid. Upon admission, the patient had a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and showed no signs of fever. Physical examination revealed soft abdomen with crust formation and erythema surrounding the exit site and no signs of catheter tunnel infection. Analyses of the peritoneal fluid demonstrated 740 white blood cells (WBC)/mm3 (predominantly polymorphonuclear neutrophils) (). The peritoneal effluent cultures were negative and the exit site swab culture grew Staphylococcus capitis. The patient was empirically treated with intraperitoneal vancomycin and gentamicin. According to the bacterial sensitivity of S. capitis, gentamicin was stopped after 5 days and the patient was discharged from the hospital on intermittent intraperitoneal vancomycin treatment ().\nFew days later, the patient was readmitted for persisting abdominal pain. He had fever; his arterial blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg with a heart rate of 85 beats/minute. Physical examination revealed mild abdominal distension with right iliac fossa tenderness to palpation; bowel sounds were present. Tenckhoff catheter exit site showed mild erythema. Abdominal CT scan demonstrated the PD catheter tip resting against the pelvic wall and the colon with inflamed fat and bowel wall thickening (). The peritoneal fluid remained turbid (2200 WBC/mm3). The peripheral leukocyte count was 10.700/mm3, with a normal differential. The patient was put on ceftazidime and metronidazole in addition to vancomycin (i.p.).

His carcinoembryonic antigen level was 4.65 ng/mL (reference value, <5.0), and the results of a complete blood count, plasma electrolyte analysis, coagulation analysis, kidney and liver function tests, and urinalysis were normal. A physical examination revealed no other significant findings. Abdominal CT showed a large irregular mass at the transverse colon, which had extended to and invaded the duodenum to form a fistula (). A colonoscopic examination revealed poorly circumscribed infiltrating masses with ulceration in the transverse colon (). The mass occupied nearly the entire lumen, which the colonoscope could not access. An upper endoscopic examination revealed a 2-cm fistula tract covered with yellowish exudate (). A multidisciplinary team decided to treat this patient with pre-operative CRT and subsequent surgery. The chemotherapy regimen was FOLFOX4, and radiation treatment was administered at a total dose of 3,000 cGy divided into 10 fractions (5 times per week). After the completion of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, an abdominal CT and upper endoscopic examination were performed to assess resectability. Abdominal CT revealed that the enhancing lobulated mass in the transverse colon had decreased in size and that the invasion of the adjacent anterior abdominal wall and duodenum had also improved (). The upper endoscopic examination showed that a whitish scar had replaced the fistula opening, which was now closed (). The patient suddenly developed abdominal pain while waiting for the scheduled operation, and chest X-ray revealed free air. The patient then underwent an emergency operation; our surgical team, which was aware of his disease status, confirmed that the perforation had occurred in the cancer lesion and performed a transverse colon segmental resection.
