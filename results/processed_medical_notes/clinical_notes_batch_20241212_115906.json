Informed consent was obtained from patients included in the study. All procedures performed were in accordance with the ethical standards of our institutional research committee. She underwent a colonoscopy that showed a 4 cm stenosis of the sigmoid colon, covered with pale mucosa that could not be passed by a conventional colonscope (13.2 mm) but could be passed with an enteroscope (9.2 mm) with which the cecum could be reached; the mucosa of the other colonic tract, as well as the mucosa of the terminal ileum, were unremarkable. Random ileal and colonic biopsies were obtained, which were unremarkable as well. Histology of the stenosis showed mild inflammation, mild stromal fibrosis, and architectural disruption. Subsequently, she underwent a computed tomography scan, which showed a mild thickening of the terminal ileum and sigmoid colon. The finding of thickened terminal ileum was further confirmed by a subsequent magnetic resonance imaging enterography, suggestive for Crohn disease (CD) localized at the terminal ileum. Due to the discrepancy of the radiological findings with the initial endoscopic examination, a further colonscopy with retrograde ileoscopy was performed, showing no visible endoscopic signs of inflammation and confirming the sigmoid stenosis. The repeated ileal and colonic biopsy sampling was again not diagnostic, showing a nonspecific pattern of inflammation affecting the sigmoid colonic specimens.\nThe physician in charge of the patient, in view of her clinical history and the radiologic finding of intestinal thickening, reckoned that the patient was affected by CD with terminal ileum and sigmoid colon localization and proposed a therapy immunomodulators: corticosteroids 1 mg/kg for 12 weeks together with antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) infliximab 5 mg at weeks 0, 2, and 6, followed by infliximab alone.

Initial complete blood count (CBC) revealed a hemoglobin of 7 g/dL and he was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells prior to transfer to our institution. On arrival, CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis showed multiple dense, heterogeneous masses throughout the liver with associated perihepatic and intraperitoneal hemorrhage and areas of tumor blush were noted but no extravasation was seen to suggest active hemorrhage. There was also multiple enlarged periportal and upper mesenteric lymph nodes, likely representing metastatic adenopathy. There were no lesions present on the pancreas. CT chest was obtained and showed no evidence of intrathoracic metastatic disease. Initial blood work revealed normal liver function tests, appropriate response in hemoglobin to transfusion and negative viral hepatitis panel. Tumor markers revealed AFP elevation to 8705 ng/mL, normal Carcinoembryonic Antigen and Cancer Antigen 19-9. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis showed multiple lesions throughout the liver with targetoid appearance. There was no evidence of cirrhosis and these lesions did not have imaging characteristics of typical HCC (Figure ). It was suspected the multifocal liver lesions were HCC given the elevated AFP. However, the MRI was not consistent with HCC and a liver biopsy was obtained. Pathology results were consistent with poorly differentiated, large cell-type neuroendocrine carcinoma with metastatic disease to the liver (Figure ).

Further on examination it was noted that he had a lesion on his right breast and nipple that he reported had been present for approximately one year, with occasional enlargement, bleeding, and purulent discharge. He had no lymphadenopathy on examination.

Prior to that, he underwent embolotherapy of the maxillary branch of the left ECA under sedation and local anaesthesia. The indication for embolization was intractable epistaxis and to reduce intraoperative bleeding during tumour excision. Intermittent Embozene\u00ae Microspheres 250 \u03bcm injection under fluoroscopy guidance was done before deployment of a 2 mm \u00d7 5 mm coil. He was not given heparin or anticoagulant during or after the procedure.\nApproximately 2 h after the procedure, the patient complained of sudden painless profound visual loss in the left eye (LE).

    "original_text": "A 76-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a mass occurring on the skin of her right chest wall. She had been diagnosed with right breast cancer (T1N0M0, stage I) 9 years previously and had received breast-conserving surgery, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy for the residual whole right breast at a previous hospital. She then developed pigmented skin on her right breast 6 years after surgery, and this lesion was diagnosed as an angiosarcoma. The patient underwent a breast mastectomy to treat for RAAS. Following this, however, the angiosarcoma on her chest wall recurred three times within 2 years. The angiosarcoma was resected each time, and she received radiation therapy to her chest wall after the third operation. Four years after the first occurrence of RAAS, we observed light pigmentation and a dark red tumor (gross diameter of 5 mm) on her right chest wall (Fig. ). Clinically, recurrence of RAAS was suspected, and recurrence of angiosarcoma was diagnosed by biopsy. We considered that it was necessary to remove the irradiated skin as much as possible in order to cure the RAAS. After extensive resection of the irradiated skin and tumor, new skin collected from her right thigh was grafted to the site (Fig. ). Pathologically, the tumor size was 6 mm and the surgical margin was negative. Histologically, there were many spindle cells and dilated vascular channels. Immunostaining showed that the tumor was CD31-positive and mildly positive for CD34 (Fig. ). Ki-67 index was also high. It was revealed that there is no inconsistency as recurrence of RAAS is pathological. After the operation, the patient was hospitalized for 30 days and did not experience any complications.

    "cleaned_text": "a 76-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a mass occurring on the skin of her right chest wall. she had been diagnosed with right breast cancer (t1n0m0, stage i) 9 years previously and had received breast-conserving surgery, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy for the residual whole right breast at a previous hospital. she then developed pigmented skin on her right breast 6 years after surgery, and this lesion was diagnosed as an angiosarcoma. the patient underwent a breast mastectomy to treat for raas. following this, however, the angiosarcoma on her chest wall recurred three times within 2 years. the angiosarcoma was resected each time, and she received radiation therapy to her chest wall after the third operation. four years after the first occurrence of raas, we observed light pigmentation and a dark red tumor (gross diameter of 5 mm) on her right chest wall (fig. ). clinically, recurrence of raas was suspected, and recurrence of angiosarcoma was diagnosed by biopsy. we considered that it was necessary to remove the irradiated skin as much as possible in order to cure the raas. after extensive resection of the irradiated skin and tumor, new skin collected from her right thigh was grafted to the site (fig. ). pathologically, the tumor size was 6 mm and the surgical margin was negative. histologically, there were many spindle cells and dilated vascular channels. immunostaining showed that the tumor was cd31-positive and mildly positive for cd34 (fig. ). ki-67 index was also high. it was revealed that there is no inconsistency as recurrence of raas is pathological. after the operation, the patient was hospitalized for 30 days and did not experience any complications. although some reports suggest chemotherapy can be used to treat raas, we considered that this option would offer little benefit in this case, because the patient was elderly and had a history of cerebral infarction. indeed, the patient has remained angi",

After a series of pre-operation examinations, he was scheduled for a selective operation of inner fixation 6 days after his trauma. During the preanesthesia assessment, we found him not on any drugs but some kind of Chinese medication occasionally for scleroderma for about a year because of the side effects of the Chinese medications. There was no history of any surgery or anesthesia. Examination of his airway revealed microstomia with mouth opening of 2.5 cm and a Mallampati class III airway. However, there was no problem with motion of his head and neck, as the skin on his neck was not affected by scleroderma. On general physical examination, vital signs were stable, heart sounds were normal and breath sounds were clear bilaterally. His face was smooth and wrinkleless, his forearms had non-pitting edema, and his fingers were shortened and sausage-like, with flexion contractures on both wrists and fingers. Laboratory tests of total blood cell count, arterial blood gas analysis, pulmonary, liver and kidney function, ECG, echocardiography and X-ray were taken, all of which were normal except for mild anemia (Hb 90 g/L), which could be inferred that his viscera were not badly affected by scleroderma. For the reason of his anemia and predicted volume of blood loss he might have during the surgery, 2 U of packed red blood cell was prepared and ready for use on the surgery day.\nIn the operating room, standard monitors were attached, showing heart rate of 72 bpm and blood pressure of 112/65 mmHg.

She had no relevant past family history of any genetic disorders, in addition to no recent foreign travel or contact exposure to tuberculosis. When she initially presented, plain chest radiographs were performed and demonstrated multiple lung lesions suggestive of an infective/inflammatory process.

She had no past history of any gastrointestinal surgery but had undergone lower segment caesarean section 21 years earlier. The caesarean section was uneventful without any iatrogenic injury. On admission, she had bilious vomiting. Physical examination revealed tachycardia, generalized abdominal distension, rebound tenderness and rigidity over left upper quadrant. There was no evidence of organomegaly or free fluid and her external hernia orifices were normal. Her bowel sounds were sluggish. Digital rectal examination revealed an empty rectum. Laboratory investigation on admission revealed a normal full blood count with a white blood cell count of 5000/mm3 and normal renal and liver functions. Her serum potassium on admission was 3.5 mmol/l and she was started in intravenous potassium supplements. An abdominal X-ray supine film showed multiple small bowel loops with air fluid levels without free air under the dome of the diaphragm (Fig. ). Surgical exploration revealed significant amount of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity and ischemic small intestine. On further exploration, we found the DJ flexure in the supracolic compartment and almost all the jejunum and proximal ileum herniating through a small defect about 5 \u00d7 6 cm in the transverse mesocolon. Jejunal loops were contained inside a thick walled hernial sac (Fig. ) which was extending in to the supracolic compartment. The hernia sac with contents was extending into the lesser sac.

    "original_text": "A 28-year-old female was diagnosed in Tunisia with stage IV synovial sarcoma originating from the soft tissue of the left trapezius with lung metastases, after complaining of shoulder swelling and pain back in July 2018. Written reports of the CT imaging obtained in Tunisia revealed that she had a 4 x 2 cm left paravertebral pleural formation, 1 cm left pleural nodule and 10 x 9 x 3.5 cm left posterior dorsal wall mass of muscular origin presumed to be the trapezius, at the time of diagnosis. Outside reports of the biopsy of the intramuscular mass revealed that she was diagnosed with a grade 2 monophasic synovial cell sarcoma. She had no family history of malignancy. She received 6 cycles of adriamycin and ifosfamide with mesna. The size of tumor decreased after the third cycle and continued to be stable afterwards. The plan was to start radiation after completion of chemotherapy, but she relocated to the United States before starting radiation therapy.\nShe established care in our institution in February 2019. A repeat CT revealed a left pleural nodule measuring 3.9 cm, left lower lobe nodule measuring 1.5 cm, and a right upper lobe nodule measuring 3.5 cm (Figures , ). The CT scan also revealed a trapezius mass measuring 8 x 4 cm (Figures , ). She was not a candidate for resection of chest wall tumor due to the extensive nature of the required surgery. Pazopanib 800 mg daily was started due to disease progression, in addition to palliative radiation to the left scapula for pain control. Radiation was completed in May 2019. Clinically, her symptoms improved, and she had stable disease on imaging.

At the age of 11, she received a mechanical aortic valve replacement. Since after the replacement, she has been receiving warfarin orally at a dosage of 4.5 mg/day. She conceived naturally and she was referred to our hospital for perinatal management. Oral administration of warfarin was discontinued at 5 weeks of gestation and she began self-injection of heparin. At 21 weeks and 5 days of gestation, she was admitted to our hospital with a high risk of spontaneous abortion and was put on intravenous ritodrine. This successfully prevented a miscarriage. At 21 weeks and 6 days of gestation, we started a continuous infusion of 25,000 units of heparin daily. On the 22nd week, transesophageal echocardiography showed a movable thrombus in the aortic valve. The size of the biggest thrombus was 26 \u00d7 8 mm (). We increased the dosage of heparin to 28,000 units daily and restarted the administration of warfarin. Following this, the thrombus reduced in size, and at 23 weeks and 5 days transesophageal echocardiography showed no signs of thrombosis in the patient. At 32 weeks and 2 days of gestation, a routine cardiotocography showed a decreased fetal heart rate; thus, an emergency Cesarean section was performed under general anesthesia because of the presence of warfarin in the blood. The baby was delivered, weighing 1,702 g, with an Apgar Score of l at l minute, and 4 at 5 minutes. The total amount of blood loss during the surgery was 1,410 ml. During the surgery, 16 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was transfused; and after surgery, we continued to infuse 20,000 units of heparin daily.

She had been diagnosed as having pulmonary hypertension and multiple liver nodules ten years earlier. She has been treated with diuretics, calcium channel blockers and sildenafil. She had experienced transient aggravation of her dyspnea one week before her recent delivery. Her platelet count was 99,000/mm3. Blood chemistry tests showed normal levels of transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. The serologic markers for hepatitis B and C virus were negative. Chest radiography () showed enlarged pulmonary arteries and cardiomegaly.\nUltrasonography showed numerous hyperechoic and isoechoic nodules of various sizes in the liver. On CT, the liver showed heterogeneous contrast enhancement due to the numerous nodules (). These nodules were heterogeneously hyperattenuating during hepatic arterial phase, and they showed contrast material washout during the portal venous phase. Persistent central scar-like enhancement was found in some of the nodules. The hepatic arteries were hypertrophied. The portal vein was not visualized; however, splenic varix and splenorenal shunt were present.\nThe hepatic nodules had high signal intensity with central portions of low signal intensity on the T1 weighted magnetic resonance images, and the hepatic nodules were of low signal intensity with central portions of high signal intensity on the T2 weighted images (). On the gadolinium enhanced dynamic MR scans, the central hypointense portions of the nodules were filled with contrast media for a length of time and they showed persistent intense enhancement (). On the gradient echo sequence images obtained after superparamagnetic iron oxide enhancement, the nodules showed a drop in signal intensity except at their central portions ().\nThe patient underwent percutaneous ultrasound-guided needle biopsy.

Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a large tumor primarily in the middle mediastinum invading the tracheal carina (Fig ). Furthermore, the left main bronchus and right main pulmonary artery showed severe stenosis from the tumor, restricting pulmonary blood flow to the right lung (Fig ). Due to persistent hypoxemia, the patient was intubated and transferred to the ICU of our hospital (day 1). Upon arrival, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate because of the obstructing malignancy. Since high-pressure ventilation did not improve the patient's respiratory condition, a decision was made to initiate veno-venous ECMO. Under ECMO support, the patient safely underwent bronchoscopic examination. The tumor was observed to be mainly on the tracheal carina, completely occluding the left main bronchus (Fig ). The patient underwent interventional therapy through flexible bronchoscopy using an endoscopic electrocautery device to cut down the tumor (Fig ). The stenosis was temporarily relieved after bronchial intervention but the left main bronchus was easily reoccluded due to necrotic tumor tissue. Therefore, stent implantation was deemed necessary to maintain bronchial patency. This procedure was performed on day 11 under general anesthesia via rigid bronchoscopy. The left main bronchus was dilated with a balloon catheter and the trimmed silicon Y-stent was then inserted (Fig ). After stent implantation, the patient was successfully weaned off ECMO on day 12 and extubated on day 14. The tumor was histologically diagnosed as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (Fig ). Immunohistochemical staining revealed that tumor cells were positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 and diffusely positive for ALK (Fig ). Moreover, ALK gene rearrangement was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. The patient received a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), alectinib, via nasogastric tube from day 16, recovered well and was discharged from the ICU without any adverse events related to the targeted therapy.

    "original_text": "A 37-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for the treatment of a tracheoesophageal fistula. Medical history revealed that she had epilepsy and took anticonvulsant medication continuously from the age of 10 years. When the patient was 29 years old, she had an epileptic seizure when a fire occurred, and she suffered from smoke inhalation. Chronic coughing and breathing difficulties appeared a few months after the fire. The symptoms gradually worsened, and hospital consultation was obtained two years afterward. As a result of a thorough examination, she was diagnosed as having breathing difficulty due to tracheal strangulation. A noncovered, metallic Ultraflex Tracheobronchial Stent (Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, MA) was inserted approximately 2 years after the fire. Since there was no evidence of congenital disease, the cause of tracheal stenosis was attributed to smoke inhalation based on her history. Although her condition improved after stent insertion, repeated bronchoscopic medical treatment was carried out for modification of the stent and granulation formation.\nOne year after stent insertion, the patient experienced postprandial obstruction. Since the airway narrowing had worsened, she returned to the hospital. An attempt was made to remove the stent completely. However, it was possible to extract only part of the stent due to adhesion of the stent and the trachea. The stent had been inserted in the trachea on the proximal side while the tracheotomy was performed. Subsequently, food was discharged from the tracheotomy, and a tracheoesophageal fistula was diagnosed. For this reason, nutrition was provided primarily via the gastrostoma.\nWhen the patient was 37 years old, she was admitted to our hospital for a procedure to remove the stent and close the tracheoesophageal fistula.

A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a right atrial mass close to the RA-IVC junction. A transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed the presence of a pedunculated right atrial mobile bilobular mass measuring 2.1 \u00d7 1.8 cm, not arising from the interatrial septum with extension into the inferior vena cava (Figures \u2013). A secundum atrial septal defect was also identified. The patient was referred to cardiac surgery for resection of a presumed right atrial myxoma given the possibility of embolization. The intraoperative TEE suggested the presence of one bilobulated mass arising low in the right atrium.\nUsing aortic and bicaval cannulation, a right atriotomy was performed and a discrete 2 \u00d7 3 cm mass was removed from the IVC-RA junction near the Eustachian valve. The right atrium was closed and the patient weaned from bypass. The specimen did not appear to be a myxoma, so it was sent for frozen section and interpreted as being ectopic liver tissue. In the interim, a repeat TEE showed an additional discrete 2 \u00d7 2 cm mass in the IVC near the hepatic veins. Femoral venous cannulation was then performed to allow for visualization of the IVC below the pericardial reflection. Through the same right atriotomy and using additional suction directly in the IVC, the IVC mass was visualized and resected. Both specimens were interpreted as showing partially encapsulated liver parenchyma with mild steatosis, fibrosis, ductal proliferation, and periductal chronic inflammation, consistent with ectopic hepatic tissue ().\nDespite a brief period of cardiopulmonary bypass, the patient had persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure ascribed to her morbid obesity and underlying lung disease.

    "original_text": "A 30-year-old male patient presented to the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery with swelling in the right facial region. His anamnesis revealed that the patient had his right first molar tooth extracted owing to infection a year ago and that painless swelling in that region had been present ever since. Clinical examination of the swelling demonstrated a painless, hard, mobile, localized elastic lesion on palpation in the subcutaneous tissues extending in line with mandibular border. The lesion was located approximately between the angle of the mandible and the anterior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (2\u20133 cm below the inferior border of the mandible) [].\nThere was no lymphadenopathy in the region. No specific finding was detected on radiological examination. The lesion was explored at the level of the subplatismal plane via extraoral approach under local anesthesia through an incision made parallel to the mandibular border. The lesion, which appeared of vascular origin because of red-brown color, was capsulated and associated with a small artery on both the anterior and posterior borders [].\nThe borders of the lesion were ligated with polyglycolic acid suture to control bleeding. After total enucleation, subcutaneous tissues were sutured with 3/0 polyglycolic acid and the skin was sutured with 4/0 polyprolene. The excised specimen measuring 1.5 cm was sent to the laboratory for histopathological examination [].\nHistopathological examination revealed a restricted tumoral lesion consisting of vascular configurations of various diameters. Vascular configurations were rich with capillary vessels arranged in a lobular pattern. There was a large blood vessel with patent lumen and thick wall in the middle of the lesion [].\nVascular configurations were lined by epithelioid endothelial cells.

Pathological findings showed that the polyps were adenomas. In August 2001 (aged 39) and August 2003 (aged 41), multiple mesenteric tumors were removed, which were pathologically diagnosed as desmoid tumors characterized by invasive growth of fibroblasts into the surrounding muscle layer.

Around December 2011, 9 months after the operation, a desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall was found immediately above the peritoneum just below the previous operative wound, which grew to 7.3 cm in the longest diameter in 3 months (Fig. ). It was considered surgically unresectable partly because tumor adhesion to the intestinal tract and peritoneum was severe and partly because tumor removal would have resulted in a large defect in the abdominal wall. Among the available treatment options for desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall, chemotherapy, carbon ion radiotherapy, etc. were proposed.

His left ankle and heel bone, along with the soft tissue, were torn off, and the peripheral blood supply and sensation to the toes of the left foot were lost. We amputated his left leg below the knee. The left fibular head was retained after the left foot operation. Two months later, the patient came to our hospital for additional treatment after debridement of necrotic tissue operations twice. There was still approximately a 20 \u00d710-cm area on the right foot and right external ankle exposing the distal fibula fractures. X-ray showed that the right external ankle bony defect and the right medial ankle mortise widened; fortunately, the left fibular head was retained after left foot amputation (Fig. ). We reconstructed the right ankle using vascular anastomosis of the fibular head and a flap taken from the left stump. The Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University approved the study.\nWe used an ultrasonic Doppler instrument (Model: ES-1000SPM Hayashi Denki Co., Ltd, Hong Kong China) to find the perforating branch of the peroneal artery before surgery, and near that location we created a flap approximately 20 \u00d7 10 cm in size according to the right foot wound (Fig. ). Surgery was performed with the patient under general anesthesia. The patient was placed in the supine position on the operating table with the left knee joint slightly bent and the left lower limb stump in internal torsion. The incision began in the popliteal space, swept down to the fibular head, and continued along the lateral peroneus muscles to the stump extremity.

Before admission, she had quarreled with her husband, and under the influence of ethanol, she had tried to commit suicide by cutting her wrist. She had never been hospitalized in a psychiatric unit before. During hospitalization, she was treated with venlafaxine 375 mg, lamotrigine 200 mg, and quetiapine 200 mg with a small improvement of her depressive symptoms but no effect on her suicidal ideations. The patient stayed at the hospital for 10 days, subsequently withdrawing consent for further hospitalization\u2014claiming her mental state had much improved. The next day, she came to our outpatient clinic still presenting active suicidal thoughts and depressive symptoms. She refused to be hospitalized but agreed to take medication at home with the close supervision of her family and frequent ambulatory visits (three times a week). The patient had been diagnosed with BD type I 21 years ago. During her illness, she had three episodes of major depression, two manic episodes, and one mixed episode. The current depressive episode lasted 2 months before admission and was related to a relationship crisis due to her marital relations.

His background included a 3-year history of left internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion with bilateral high-grade vertebral artery stenosis of more than 70%.

Examination demonstrated a 15-cm transverse wound over the medial malleolus and anterior ankle with exposed muscle, tendon, and bone without gross contamination. Her physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. Distal to the wound, there was no Doppler signal in either dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial arteries and the foot appeared cold with delayed cap refill. She was taken to the operating room urgently for debridement and irrigation, open reduction internal fixation of both distal tibia and fibular fractures, and supplemental external fixation application. The foot regained a normal color and capillary refill upon reduction, and biphasic Doppler signals returned.\nThe patient did well postoperatively and was discharged home on postoperative day 6. At her 6-week postoperative visit, the external fixation was removed and she was placed in a well-padded short leg cast. At postoperative week 9, the patient returned to clinic after having fevers and when the cast was removed and a 1.5 \u00d7 2.5 cm area of superficial central wound dehiscence was observed without surrounding erythema or fluctuance. She was prescribed Bactrim and placed in another short leg cast. At postoperative week 10, the cast was removed demonstrating exposed bone and hardware in the central aspect of the wound and the patient was admitted to the hospital for debridement and removal of implants with antibiotic spacer placement. At this time, there was a 10 \u00d7 14 cm wound over the medial malleolus (Fig. ).\nAs part of routine flap planning for open fractures, a formal angiogram was obtained. This demonstrated congenital absence of the posterior tibial artery. A large peroneal artery and a normal anterior tibial artery were noted.

Six months before she sought medical attention, she was complaining of mild upper abdominal pain, however, due to her previous condition she was medicated with proton pump inhibitors assuming that the pain was due to her gastritis. In the last 3 months, she noticed a mass in her upper abdomen and the pain became more severe and started to affect her daily activities, thus she presented to a routine physical exam. No weight loss or other constitutional symptoms were noticed. Also no history of malignancy in her family was mentioned. On clinical examination, a 12 \u00d7 15 cm2 mass was discovered on her upper abdomen, mild pain was found on palpation but no tenderness was present. An abdominal ultrasonography revealed a 15 \u00d7 15 cm2 septate thin-walled giant cystic mass, it was anechoic and had a volume of ~735 ml. The cyst occupied most of the hepatorenal space and it was in intimate contact with the liver, right kidney and pancreas (Fig. A). Due to the size of the mass, CT was requested, it revealed well-defined 19.7 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 10 cm3 giant cyst, the cyst was located within the small bowel mesentery and it was in intimate contact with the liver, gallbladder, pancreas and right kidney (Fig. A). Nevertheless, the tomography could not rule out that the mass had some sort of communication with the bile duct or the pancreas. This is why a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography found that the cyst was attached but had no communication with the bile duct or the pancreas (Fig. A).

The week before the surgery she developed pharyngitis and was treated with azithromycin, which resulted in mucousy diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. She tested negative for C. difficile antigen and toxins at that time.\nA week after surgery, she developed a perirectal abscess that had formed at the site of the sphincterotomy and was prescribed orally administered ciprofloxacin. Despite moderate symptom improvement, in September 2015 she required an abscess incision and drainage procedure and Penrose drain insertion. Prior to the surgery she was given a single dose of clindamycin. An additional 2-week course of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole was then prescribed. In late September 2015 she was admitted to the hospital for two nights due to further complications related to the abscess and was then diagnosed as having a perianal fistula.\nIn November 2015, she was prescribed clindamycin for an episode of group C streptococcal-positive pharyngitis.

He had been lying in a supine position with his head hanging off the bed in a slightly downwards position. The patient was brought to the hospital few hours later. On admission, neurological examination showed a right hemianopia with alexia. His systolic blood pressure was 115 mmHg and the diastolic pressure was 60 mmHg.\nA thorough review of familial and personal clinical histories suggested no other possible cause for this condition. In particular, there were no signs of arterial hypertension or hematological disorders and our patient was not taking anti-coagulants or anti-platelet drugs. He had not experienced any head trauma and had no other risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. He had also not taken sildenafil citrate or any other cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) inhibitors.\nA cerebral CT scan showed a small left cortical temporo-occipital hemorrhage with mild mass effect and hypodense halo (Figure ). A carotid and vertebral duplex scan was normal, as was an arterial trans-cranial Doppler. Neuropsychological testing and a neuropsychiatric interview showed no cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was 29 out of 30).
