On admission, her blood pressure was 69/46 mmHg, which recovered and remained stable after resuscitation. No active bleeding was observed from the two stab wounds, which were observed at zone II with surrounding hematoma to the right of the midline (Fig. A). No extravasation was noted on cervical post-enhanced computed tomography (CT). We undertook local wound exploration under general anesthesia, and found lacerations of the right internal jugular vein and the facial vein, which were repaired with sutures. Intubation care under sedation was continued until the following day. On the next day, 80-row 3-D CT angiogram (CTA) showed occlusion of the right VA at the C3 level (Fig. B). No arteriovenous fistula was noted. A retrospective review of the reconstructed CT the day before also showed occlusion of the right VA. The patient immediately underwent conventional angiography. The right VA angiogram revealed termination of the right VA at the C3 level after muscular branching, and the left VA angiogram revealed anterograde flow in the basilar artery, and retrograde flow across the VA union down to the right VA and posterior inferior cerebellar artery (Fig. A). A high-flow single AVF communicating with the right distal VA and paravertebral veins at the C2\u20133 level was also observed (Fig. B). The right internal carotid artery angiogram revealed no congestion of the intracranial venous drainage. Although the patient had no symptoms, we carried out elective endovascular obliteration within a week, but the patient\u2019s consent for the treatment could not be obtained due to psychological anxiety. Magnetic resonance (MR) angiogram 3 days later showed no apparent VVF (Fig. C). Eventually, after 10 days, the patient agreed to the treatment.

He had progressively increasing fatigue and had to be brought in on a wheel chair. The abdominal pain was non-colicky and present diffusely over the upper abdomen. It had no association with meals, and was not exacerbated or relieved with changes in body posture. There was no history of cough, breathlessness, hemoptysis, chest pain, headache, altered bowel habits, dysuria or rash. He did not smoke and had no health problems in the past. There was no history of any substance abuse or intake of any immunosuppressive medication.\nHe lived in the outskirts of the city with his parents and sister in a two-room house with poor ventilation.

She underwent colonoscopy and endoscopy that revealed a clean-based duodenal ulcer that was treated with twice daily intravenous pantoprazole. Several days later, she presented with another gastrointestinal bleed requiring repeat upper endoscopy and subsequently angiogram and coil embolization of the gastroduodenal artery. PD treatments were withheld and she received hemodialysis treatments via her arteriovenous fistula during this hospitalization. She had not received prophylactic antibiotics to prevent peritonitis prior to these procedures. In the interim, she was diagnosed with Clostridium difficile diarrhea, which was treated with oral vancomycin.\nFollowing her second endoscopy, she developed diffuse abdominal pain and became febrile to 100.6\u00b0F. Her abdomen was soft but diffusely tender. Peritonitis was suspected and her peritoneal fluid effluent was drawn for analysis (Table ). Gram stain of the peritoneal fluid revealed gram-positive cocci, and cultures grew gram-positive micrococcus and Candida tropicalis. Intravenous vancomycin and oral fluconazole were initiated. Final culture growth revealed the CDC group EO-4 organism, which was susceptible to levofloxacin. She was switched to levofloxacin to complete a total of 2 weeks of antibiotics. She was discharged home on PD and was readmitted 1 day later for hematochezia. She continued to have abdominal cramps unchanged in severity from before, but bleeding scan followed by a third endoscopy remained negative.\nShe was then transferred to our institution for further evaluation and consideration for double-balloon enteroscopy.

There was no weakness of the left arm or hand.\nOn examination, there was a visible and palpable mass near the posterolateral distal humerus, which was firm and somewhat mobile within the triceps muscle. The mass measured approximately 4.5\u00d72.4 cm and was sensitive to the touch; however, there was no warmth or skin discolouration noted. Full range of motion at the left shoulder and elbow was demonstrated without pain, and sensation was grossly intact for the left upper extremity. Radial pulse was 2+ on the left side, with capillary refill less than 1 s, and no epicondylar, axillary, cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy was noted on the left side.\nThe patient underwent an MRI with and without contrast of the left upper arm, revealing a fusiform-shaped, enhancing mass that was in direct contact with the lateral cortex of the mid humerus, followed the course of the radial nerve. The patient also had a preoperative evaluation by neurology whose examination demonstrated cranial nerves 2\u201312 to be intact with 5/5 motor strength throughout. Sensory examination was normal to pinprick, touch and position. The patient demonstrated generalised hyporeflexia. There was no clonus, Babinski sign or Hoffmann sign.

In 2015, the patient had a FNAB reported as benign, BC II. Because of continued growth, he had a second FNA biopsy approximately six months later reported as a H\u00fcrthle cell neoplasm or suspicious for a H\u00fcrthle cell neoplasm, BC IV with Oncocytic / H\u00fcrthle cells dispersed mostly singly and in small fragments in a background of lysed blood. CKAE1/AE3, TTF-1, and thyroglobulin immunostains were positive (). Molecular testing with ThyroSeq\u00ae v2 revealed an absence of gene mutations or fusions but overexpression of the MET gene with an uncertain increased risk of malignancy. After repeat ultrasound imaging, the nodule had grown from 4.9 to 6.0 cm over the course of 1 year. He was euthyroid with negative anti-thyroid antibodies. There was no family history of thyroid cancer or known radiation exposures in his youth. He had no obstructive symptoms despite the size of the mass and denied shortness of breath, dysphagia, neck pain, neck pressure, or recent voice changes. His weight had been stable and appetite good. His past medical history was significant for a retinal detachment, hypertension, and inguinal hernia with a surgical history limited to eye surgery and hernia repair. He denied tobacco or alcohol use. On exam, the patient had an enlarged, firm thyroid gland with the left thyroid lobe causing significant tracheal deviation to the right. A neck CT scan demonstrated a markedly enlarged left thyroid lobe (7.2 cm in sagittal height) causing significant rightward tracheal deviation, minimal tracheal compression, and slight early substernal extension ().

    "original_text": "A 31-year-old male presented for evaluation of right knee pain, muscle spasms, and mechanical snapping. The symptoms had been present for 2 years with no antecedent trauma or injury. The knee pain was associated with a snapping sensation with extension of the right knee joint notably in the posteromedial region. Initial work up at the onset of symptoms included magnetic resonance imaging at an outside facility that revealed mild chondromalacia of the lateral facet of the patella, bone contusions of the femoral condyles, as well medial and lateral tibial plateau consistent with hyperextension injury. An electromyogram was normal. He ultimately underwent arthroscopic lateral retinaculum release, which did not improve his symptoms.\nPhysical examination revealed an antalgic gait with mild atrophy of the right quadriceps and calf musculature compared to the left. The pain was noted with palpation of the medial thigh and pes anserine region. With repetitive flexion and extension, there was visible and audible snapping of the medial, distal hamstring region, reproducing his discomfort. Manipulation of the patella did not cause pain, and there was no joint line tenderness. Hyperextension was not noticeable on examination at full extension. McMurray test was negative. There was no obvious effusion.\nAn updated magnetic resonance imaging revealed mild edema-like signal along the confluence of the pes anserine tendons and a small tear of the medial meniscus. Dynamic ultrasound over the posterior and medial thigh and knee was performed with the patient lying lateral recumbent on the right side. Static sonographic examination revealed no abnormal character or quality to the hamstring muscles and tendons, no osseous abnormality, no meniscal pathology, and no abnormal fluid collections.

The patient suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and therefore he had quitted smoking. Five years ago he underwent dental rehabilitation with the placement of six implants in the maxilla and four in the mandible. In less than 2 months after initial placement, all implants had failed to osseointegrate. A year and a half later the patient underwent guided bone regeneration with bovine-derived xenograft and 7 months after this point, another 10 implants were inserted into both the maxilla and mandible. Two months later, all implants had once again failed to osseointegrate.

    "original_text": "A 19-year-old female presented with facial asymmetry and canting of an occlusal plane due to right-sided condylar hyperplasia that starts developing at her puberty. Preoperative workup included a detailed clinical examination, photography, dental impressions, and cephalometric analysis (Figure ).\nThe MMS started with the face bow registration and transfer followed by upper dental cast mounting on the adjustable platform of the surgical articulator MT, reflecting the orientation of the patient's maxilla in the 3D space of the articulator. The lower cast then mounted according to the registered patient's occlusion in the centric relation (Figure ).\nThe planned correction of the maxillary cant was carried out by rotation of the upper dental cast around the coronal plane, through increasing the posterior height of the upper frame on the right side to the planned extent, while maintaining the anterior height at the incisal pin.

The temperature of the bath was approximately 44\u00b0C, so she tried to cool down the water. However, it was difficult for her to move because of knee osteoarthritis. She called out for help to her neighboring family, but they did not take notice of her. She sat there for 2 hours and eventually suffered scald second-degree burns on both buttocks and plantar regions of the feet. After the emergency call, the family cooled the patient with cold water for 30 minutes. At the time of transport to a treatment facility, erythema was the only clinical sign; therefore, she was diagnosed with a superficial dermal burn (Figure , B). The patient was treated with dimethyl isopropyl azulene ointment every day until she was referred to our hospital. However, on the 7th day after the injury, the burn wound deepened, and she was referred for further medical treatment. The burn surface at the time of consultation was deep with 6% total burn surface area (Figure -E). On the 12th day after the injury, debridement and split-thickness skin grafting were performed under general anesthesia. First, bilateral buttocks and heels were debrided by sequential excision, and dermal bleeding was observed in a small area of the heel; however, adipose tissue was exposed beyond the dermis in most areas (Figure -H). Except for both heels, epithelialization had already occurred at the time of surgery. Skin grafts were subsequently taken from the left thigh at 12/1000 inches, processed into a triple mesh, and split-thickness skin grafting was performed on both buttocks and both heels.

    "original_text": "A 16-year-old female patient developed slight tenderness of the gingiva in the left mandibular premolar region, and her dentist referred her to our clinic in April 1992. Oral examination showed erythematous granular swellings that bled easily on the alveolar gingiva involving the area extending from the right second premolar to the left second molar (Fig. ). The lesion showed extensive, superficial growth but was largely confined to the attached gingiva. Radiographic examination showed notable alveolar bone resorption in the left mandibular premolar region and slight resorption in the right mandibular canine region (Fig. ). The lesion was biopsied, and histopathological examination showed diffuse unencapsulated proliferation of moderately to poorly differentiated squamoid tumor cells with occasional mitotic figures and keratinization as well as tumor nests comprising intermediate and clear cells. Few duct-like structures were observed, but microcysts were occasionally noted (Fig. ). The specimen histologically resembled a mucoepidermoid carcinoma [], but presented as a rare gingival carcinoma of the mandible. Treatment in May 1992 involved resection of the alveolar ridge between the right and left second molar regions, preserving the right inferior alveolar nerve, followed by bilateral upper neck dissection and transplantation of a lateral tongue flap to cover the alveolar ridge defect (Fig. ). Histopathological examination of the surgical specimens showed bilateral submandibular lymph node metastases. Two courses of postoperative chemotherapy were performed to prevent local recurrence and distant metastasis.\nThere was no evidence of recurrence or metastasis at 1 year 3 months after surgery, and an International Team for Implantology (ITI) implant system (Institut Straumann AG, Basel, Switzerland) and prosthetic appliance were provided for cosmetic improvement and recovery of masticatory function.

A CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis showed a large cystic lesion in her right upper abdomen measuring 17.0 \u00d7 17.0 \u00d7 15.0 cm in dimensions. It was pushing the hepatic flexure inferiorly and right kidney posteriorly and abutting the head of her pancreas and the anterior abdominal wall anteriorly. It was abutting the right lateral abdominal wall on the right side and lesser curvature of her stomach on the left side. It demonstrated few enhancing septa. No solid areas or calcification were seen. It was difficult to determine the exact site of origin. However, it seemed to be arising from her liver with exophytic growth in a downward direction. Her intrahepatic ducts were not dilated. The cystic mass was pushing her portal vein upward. Her portal vein was however normal in diameter. The mass was pushing her gallbladder and her right kidney downward (Fig. ). Differential diagnoses of hydatid cyst of the liver and large necrotic abscess were given. She underwent excision of \u201cliver cyst\u201d in November 2012. The specimen was received as a single, flattened, irregular, firm tissue piece, which appeared to be part of a cyst wall. It measured 4.5 \u00d7 3.5 cm in diameter and was 0.4 cm in thickness. The outer surface was gray white and shiny. The inner surface was tan brown with hemorrhagic areas. Solid or nodular areas were not seen. The microscopic sections showed a cyst wall lined by a single layer of mucinous columnar epithelium with subepithelial spindly ovarian-type stroma. There was no dysplasia.

She was diagnosed with telangiectatic granuloma and received treatment with topical antibiotics; however, after two months no improvement was noted.\nWith the suspicion of a malignant umbilical tumor, blood tests were performed and revealed high levels of CA125 (over 500 U/mL). Biopsy was proposed for a definitive diagnosis; however it was not pursued per patient's request. An upper and lower gastroenterological endoscopy was performed and showed no major abnormalities. Gynecology was consulted for further evaluation and a 2 cm ovarian cyst was noted on a transvaginal ultrasound. Imaging by CT and MRI confirmed the diagnosis and showed intra-abdominal and right lung metastatic lesions (Figures and ).\nWith the suspected diagnosis of a metastatic ovarian cancer, an exploratory laparotomy was performed. A cystic lesion of approximately 2-3 cm was seen on the right ovary and a small amount of ascites was noted (). Moreover, intra-abdominal and omentum metastatic lesions as large as 5 cm were observed (). Millet-seed sized lesions were noticed in the anterior and posterior uterine walls and the vesicouterine and Douglas pouches. As not all metastatic lesions were able to be resected, a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and umbilical and omentum tumor resections were performed. The histopathological diagnosis was consistent with an ovarian serous adenocarcinoma, which was also observed in the umbilical and omentum tumor.

After failure of both topical steroids and phototherapy, she began subcutaneous secukinumab 300 mg label dose in May 2017 to treat her psoriasis with an initial good response.

She presented to the clinic in August 2019 with an 8-month history of recurrent oral ulcers and a 1-month history of a deep painful vulvar ulcer (see ). After she failed a course of anti-viral therapy prescribed by her family doctor and had two negative vulvar viral swabs for herpes simplex virus as well as a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for Haemophilus ducreyi, a biopsy was performed, and her family doctor asked her to hold secukinumab. The histopathology showed an ulcerated lesion with a differential diagnosis of either viral infection, aphthous ulcer or Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. A decision was made to discontinue the secukinumab and treat the ulcers symptomatically with a topical steroid and a topical anesthetic, at which point she experienced a flare up of her psoriasis.

The patient remained stable with conservative therapy for approximately 5 years after the tick bite but needed an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in 1999. Finally, he was sent to our department with worsening cardiomyopathy and increasing dyspnea.

Comorbidities included arterial hypertension, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type II, diabetic polyneuropathy, moderate secondary pulmonary hypertension and hepatic steatosis.\nIn 2004, a blood group-, size- and weight-compatible donor organ was offered, and heart transplantation was performed. The patient received a donor heart from a 45-year-old male who died due to spontaneous subarachnoid bleeding. The donor had a history of smoking (less than 5 cigarettes per day).

His high-sensitivity cardiac troponin was 24 ng/L (female reference range\u2005<16 ng/L, male reference range\u2005<26 ng/L). How should he be managed?\nCardiac troponin is released from damaged cardiomyocytes and is one of the most common biomarkers used in the prediction of myocardial infarction. There is considerable debate regarding the use of sex-specific reference ranges for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn), as there is uncertainty whether the use of sex-specific reference limits impact upon clinical management or outcome prediction (). However, as upper reference limits based on sex-specific 99th percentiles for hs-cTn are subtly higher for people recorded as males than those recorded females in population studies (), use of sex-specific cutoffs for hs-cTn assays have been endorsed by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (). The difference has been attributed to people presumed male at birth having a larger cardiac mass as well as subclinical coronary artery disease (). No studies have been performed to examine cardiac mass changes that may occur with masculinizing hormone therapy in people presumed female at birth. There are however data in polycystic ovary syndrome in which high testosterone concentrations are a clinical feature (albeit far lower than testosterone concentrations seen in transgender men). Polycystic ovary syndrome has been associated with higher left ventricular mass index and larger left atrial diameter over 5 years of follow-up, even after adjustment for blood pressure, body mass index, glucose, and lipids (). Large population-based studies have also shown that left ventricular mass correlates with body weight, lean body mass, and fat mass ().

Upon the initiation of fetal monitoring, the tracing demonstrated a rate of 140 to 150 bpm with moderate variability. At 6 cm dilatation, rupture of membranes revealed thin meconium, though thick meconium was observed at the time of vaginal delivery. Throughout the remaining labor, the fetus demonstrated intermittent variable decelerations, though continued periods of minimal and moderate variability. At delivery, an infant female weighing 3685 g had Apgar scores of 1, 5 and 7 at 1, 5 and 10 min, respectively. Chest compressions were initiated for 3 minutes until a spontaneous heart rate over 100 bpm was detected. There were no umbilical cord blood samples drawn. Due to neonatal respiratory compromise, an endotracheal tube placed at one-hour of life though pulse oximeter values were not recorded. At two-hours of life, a capillary blood gas revealed pH 6.75, pCO2 129 mmHg, pO2 41 mmHg and BDblood 21.6 mmol/L, after which ventilator settings were modified. A chest X-ray revealed patchy infiltrates consistent with meconium aspiration syndrome.

In the present case, fetal monitoring through the time of delivery demonstrating continued periods of minimal and moderate heart rate variability (consistent with fetal quiet and active sleep cycles) suggests that this was not an intrapartum hypoxic ischemic injury.

Apgar scores were 4, 5, 5, and 8 at one, five, ten and fifteen minutes respectively. He required mask ventilation at birth for primary apnoea and was intubated at seven minutes of postnatal age for persistent apnoea.

On these settings he had a tachypnoea of 90 breaths per minute with mildly increased respiratory effort and a pre-ductal oxygen saturation of \u226597%. A capillary blood gas excluded respiratory or metabolic acidosis. Empiric antibiotics benzylpenicillin and gentamicin were commenced to cover the risk of sepsis due to the prolonged rupture of membranes. Chest x-rays at 2 and 4 h of life showed crescent shaped homogeneous opacities in both upper lung fields (Fig. ). The Neonatal and Paediatric Emergency Transport Service (NETS) was consulted. Initial paediatric radiological advice via telemedicine was that this appearance could represent bilateral pleural effusions. Accordingly the PEEP was increased to 8cmH2O; lateral decubitus x-ray (not shown) was uninformative. Due to the uncertainty regarding the cause of the respiratory distress the baby was transferred to the local neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) by NETS at 10 h of postnatal life.\nA progress CXR at just under 13 h of age was still inconclusive.

The patient\u2019s chief complaint was a cavity and color change in her maxillary molar on the left side for approximately 2 mo. Her medical history was noncontributory and the patient denied any tooth extractions or orthodontic history. Clinical examination revealed a cavity due to deep caries in the left maxillary molar and exposed pulp cavity without pain. The tooth was sensitive to percussion and the periodontal tissue was swollen. The diagnosis was deep caries with apical periodontitis in tooth 26. Endodontic therapy was proposed and accepted. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.\nA preoperative X-ray image was obtained before surgery (Figure ). It showed obvious low density in the distal area of tooth decay. Isolation of the tooth using a rubber dam was carried out during the entire procedure. The pulp chamber was localized, and the access opening was expanded from the palate distally to the center of the tooth after removal of the decay. When the access opening was completed, an anatomic variation was seen on the pulp chamber floor (Figure and C). Under the DOM visual field, only one buccal canal orifice and one palatal canal orifice were detected. Further inspection of the pulpal floor revealed the absence of other canal orifices. The pulp tissue in the chamber and two root canals were extirpated, and the canals were flooded with 3% sodium hypochlorite (Beyond Technology Corp., Beijing, China). The cavity was temporarily sealed with zinc oxide. As the X-ray did not reveal the condition of the root canal system, the patient underwent CBCT to acquire the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of the tooth.\nWhen the 3D images were obtained, longitudinal and cross-sections of 0.5 mm thickness were analyzed (Figure -E).

Physical exam revealed normal strength, and he was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy. Four days later, he developed worsening joint pain, lower extremity calf pain, and hoarse voice. Examination at this time was notable for 3/5 strength in his lower extremities. He was admitted to the hospital and treated with 50 mg intravenous hydrocortisone every 12 hours for three days and intravenous fluids for a suspected postviral myositis. His symptoms resolved, and he was discharged home.\nFive days afterwards, he was readmitted to a different hospital for dysphagia and concern of aspiration pneumonia. A gastric tube was placed, he was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole, and he was sent to a rehabilitation facility. Of note, he was not treated with a quinolone or aminoglycoside antibiotic. Another four days later, he presented to our hospital with worsening pneumonia. At this time, physical exam revealed decreased proximal muscle and grip strength, weak palate elevation, diplopia upon prolonged upward gaze, and 3/5 strength in lower extremities. He did not exhibit muscle fatigue from repetitive use. Initial evaluation for this patient was unremarkable for brain or cranial nerve lesions, motor neuron disease, neuromuscular junction disorders (NMJ), or other myopathies (). He was treated with stress-dose steroids (50 mg methylprednisolone every six hours) for concern of myositis, antibiotics, and other supportive measures. Four days after this admission, the antiacetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody (Ab) panel revealed elevated ACR binding and modulating antibodies correlating with diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Titers for AChR binding Ab were elevated at 2.15 nmol/L, and AChR modulating Ab was elevated at 45%. He was started on pyridostigmine and plasma exchange (5 exchanges,",

These symptoms spontaneously resolved without any specific diagnosis at that time. At the age of 73, our patient suffered from bilateral optic neuritis and he was diagnosed with MS at an outside hospital. His expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score was at that time 2.5. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the spinal cord revealed a diffuse cord swelling and longitudinally extensive T2 hypertensive lesions extending from C2 to T3 (see Figure depicting a T2-weighted MRI scan, which shows residual longitudinal myelitis with extensive cord atrophy). A cranial MRI scan displayed few periventricular and cerebellar lesions without contrast enhancement and without fulfilling the Barkhof criteria. Moreover, analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) presented oligoclonal bands. At that time, anti-AQP-4 antibody testing was not performed. A therapy with interferon beta 1a was started for six months and was replaced by interferon beta 1b at the discretion of the treating outside neurologist. Our patient developed two further spinal relapses during the treatment with interferon beta preparations. They were treated with corticosteroid pulses without any success and his EDSS score worsened from 2.5 to 4.0. Although a subsequent therapy with natalizumab was initiated at an outside clinic, our patient continued to present another three relapses. The first relapse occurred four months after starting natalizumab, the second after six months and the third relapse after eight months. All relapses repeatedly affected both optic nerves and the spinal cord each with increasing visual and motor impairment. Thus, our patient developed a high-grade spastic tetraparesis as well as impaired visual acuity of both eyes and his EDSS score progressed from 4.0 to 8.0. At that point, NMO was discussed after referral to our hospital and natalizumab therapy was discontinued after nine courses. After repeated cycles of plasma exchange,",
