No neurological side effects are commonly associated with Mitomycin intravesical administration.\nIn May 2015, 2 months after chemotherapy was completed the patient was admitted in the emergency room with confusion, short-term memory loss, anxiety, and aggressiveness in the absence of fever. The initial check-up excluded all organic causes, rendering the patient susceptible for a maniacal episode for which admission to the psychiatry proved reasonable.\nA few days later a second check-up was made. The clinical exam was normal. The brain scan, as well as the EEG, showed no specific abnormalities. The analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed only a mild pleocytosis (18 white cells, predominant lymphocytes), a normal level of glucose and proteins. No intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin was described. Antibodies against NMDAR were positive both in serum and in CSF and Abs against AMPAR (type 2 subunit) were positive in the serum. The classical onconeuronal Abs and the other Abs directed against surface proteins were negative in the serum and CSF. The patient was then transferred to our neurological facility for treatment.

There was no family history of eye disease. At the initial examination, her visual acuity was 20/20, and the intraocular pressure in both eyes was 21 mm Hg. A physical examination showed that she had good general health. Of the three white nodules in the right eye, one was located on the iris, and the others were found on the posterior surface of the cornea (fig. ). A fundus examination revealed that there was no vitreous inflammation, obvious retinal lesions, or other abnormal findings. B-scan ultrasonography did not reveal any nodule calcifications. Anti-toxocara immunoglobulin G antibodies were not detected. The patient was administered topical anti-inflammation treatment for the anterior uveitis and nodules. The nodules gradually decreased in size; however, by November 2014, those on the posterior surface of the cornea had spread horizontally, and AS-OCT showed a shrunken iris (fig. ). These changes could have been a result of tumor migration and invasion. In December 2014, after explaining the risk of metastasis to her parents, we obtained informed consent to collect the aqueous humor to determine the diagnosis.

He had a syncopal episode at home with fall resulting in left pleuritic chest pain. The patient admitted that he had previous syncope episodes that occur with little or no warning signs except for mild dizziness before passing out. The physical examination was significant for chest wall tenderness with a normal cardiorespiratory exam.\nLaboratory findings showed mildly elevated troponin. An echocardiogram demonstrated biventricular dilatation with ejection fraction (EF) of 30% and compelling evidence for the presence of thrombus in the apex of both ventricles and free wall of the right ventricle (as shown in\n\u2013\n). Echocardiogram did not demonstrate any spontaneous echo contrast, suggesting severely diminished ejection fraction and stagnation of blood flow. Orthostatic vitals were normal, and the patient did not experience any arrhythmias on telemetry ruling them out as a cause for syncope. Syncope was later presumed to be likely secondary to a low flow state from reduced EF. The patient denied any prior history of deep vein thrombosis, transient ischemic attack, or stroke.

This incident was associated with an epileptic episode while he was doing routine work in his shop. On detailed history, we discovered that he was a diagnosed case of generalized tonic clonic seizure for 9 years with the past episode 3 years back and was off medication for 2 years. There was no history of diabetes, hypertension, alcohol, and smoking. A history of oral tobacco intake for the past 20 years was present. He had suffered 4 episodes of right shoulder dislocation, the most recent episode being 2 months ago.\nOn examination, diffuse tenderness and swelling were present over bilateral shoulder with bony crepitus. No distal neurovascular deficit was noted. No other injuries were noted during the examination. Immobilization and analgesics were given in an emergency. Plain radiographs followed by computed tomography scans revealed bilateral Neer [] IV part fracture with anterior shoulder dislocation (Figs. , ). The patient was prepared for operative intervention and necessary investigations were done. Both the shoulders were operated in a single sitting. The same deltopectoral approach was used bilaterally and open reduction with Proximal Humerus Interlocking Osteosynthesis (PHILOS) plating was done (). The right side was operated first for no particular reason, taking approximately 3 h followed by the left side in the next 2 h. Re-draping was done and a shot of an intravenous antibiotic was given before starting the left side. Intraoperatively, a bony Bankart lesion in the right shoulder was noticed which led to persistent instability even after fixation of the proximal humerus.

Physical examination showed the mass-occupying oral cavity, protruding from left buccal mucosa, passing the midline of palates. The mass was similar in color as its surrounding tissue with smooth surface and cystic consistency. It was not attached to palates or base of tongue. Tracheostomy was performed immediately to secure her airway. Laboratory examination and chest X-ray were in normal range. Angiography showed neither stenosis nor malformation of blood vessels in carotid, cerebral and vestibulobasilar arteries. At the age of 3 weeks, she underwent surgery to remove the mass. Gross feature of the resected mass was an oval-shaped gray-brown tumor measured 4 cm \u00d7 2 cm \u00d7 1 cm. On the maximum cut surface, the tumor consisted of cystic space. The specimen was carefully sliced and submitted in its entirety to be examined. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of benign looking tissues including skin, glial tissue, cartilage and intestine. No immature component was observed. Histopatological diagnosis was mature cystic teratoma []. The infant was born at term, normally, weighing 3100 g and 49 cm, with no records of abnormal prenatal ultrasound examination.\nFifteen months after surgery, the patient started to have difficulty in feeding. Physical examination showed that a new mass had developed at her buccal mucosa, same site of her previous tumor and palate. This mass was tender on consistency. Computed tomography (CT) scan image showed that the tumor consisted of predominantly lipid component, such that clinical diagnosis was made to be lipoma, with lipoblastoma and teratoma as differential diagnosis.

    "original_text": "A 34 year old woman from the east of Morocco, married and mother of two children, was admitted to the emergency room with intense periumbilical and pelvic abdominal pain associated with acute vomiting without any notion of metrorrhagia. The clinical examination revealed a conscious patient with an irreducible and impulsive painful mass at the umbilical level reminiscent of a strangulated inguinal hernia (). We performed an abdominal ultrasound scan which showed an evolving mono-fetal pregnancy; with an estimated weight of 1 kg, and a normal amount of amniotic fluid; strangulated through an umbilical orifice (). Faced with this exceptional diagnosis, the case was quickly discussed in a multidisciplinary team and the decision was made to perform an MRI. It was done without injection because of the teratogenic nature of the scan (, ).\nOur radiological examination showed a strangulation of a pregnant uterus through an orifice of 6 cm, which resulted in a strangulated hernia of a pregnant uterus at the umbilical level with the right ovary. There was however no intestinal loop.

In view of his age, he underwent open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture with a proximal humeral locking plate []. After an uneventful immediate postoperative recovery, his functional improvement was limited and his range of movement and pain symptoms deteriorated over the subsequent 6 months despite intensive rehabilitation. Serial radiographs revealed a progressive collapse of the articular head part. This lead to protrusion of one of the screws into the articular region 6 weeks postoperatively [], which was promptly removed. Over the subsequent months, his fracture continued to collapse. Radiographs at 9 months showed malunion of the fracture, with a bony spur present at the superior part of the head where the collapse segment went on to malunion []. On examination, the patient had 40\u00b0 forward flexion, 40\u00b0 abduction and 10\u00b0 external rotation, with a painful mechanical block to further movement. His rotator cuff appeared clinically intact, with adequate strength otherwise and no ligamentous laxity or instability. The neurovascular exam was normal.\nWe felt that the bony spur was the main cause of his limited function. Given his high-demand requirement and otherwise normal-appearing articular surface that was not significantly malrotated, we elected to perform a joint-preserving procedure. Excision of the prominent bony region was considered over a restorative osteotomy; the former, however, would leave an exposed area of bone that could go on to cause pain, with the risk of recurrence of the mechanical block due to bony outgrowth.

Upon arrival, the patient was in severe hypovolemic shock mainly from active large volume hemorrhage from the oropharynx. He required nasal and oropharyngeal packing, as well as aggressive fluid resuscitation with over two dozen units of blood products. In addition to numerous noncranial injuries, he suffered multiple skull fractures including bilateral fractures traversing the carotid canals.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the head revealed hemorrhage throughout the basal cisterns, trace hemorrhage within the fourth ventricle, and a thin retroclival hematoma. On CT angiography (CTA), there was suspicion of a focal tear in the cavernous right ICA and faint contrast blush at the left cavernous sinus suspicious for CCF. The angiogram revealed bilateral CCFs, left worse than right. There was no evidence of retrograde venous drainage into the right superior ophthalmic vein (SOV) or the right inferior petrosal sinus at this time []. The left ICA drained into both the cavernous sinus and the bony venous channels within the petrous bone and clivus with retrograde flow into the left SOV. There was no evidence of retrograde cortical venous drainage on either side. There was evidence of vasospasm of the A1 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery (ACA) []. Transarterial coil embolization of the larger left CCF was attempted once the catheter was directed across the tear in the ICA; however, after 3 coils were deployed, subsequent coil deployment resulted in the stretching and herniation of the coil into the carotid artery necessitating retrieval.

There was no regional lymphadenopathy.\nOn physical examination, there was a single 2 cm \u00d7 2 cm soft, well-delineated, nontender mass occupying the right lateral aspect of the tongue.\nThe swelling was sessile, submucosal, and firm in consistency with a smooth surface. Overlying mucosa was normal in appearance and not fixed. Tongue movements and speech were normal. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a medium-sized hyperintense lesion arising from the anterior two-third of the right half of the tongue along the lateral border on T2-weighted images measuring 1.9 cm \u00d7 1.3 cm \u00d7 1.9 cm []. Heterogenous enhancement of the lesion on intravenous administration of Gd-DTPA was observed. The MRI was suggestive of involvement of the intrinsic muscles of the tongue on the right side with no involvement of the lingual neurovascular bundle or the base of the tongue. Level IB and II lymph nodes were enlarged bilaterally.\nAn incisional biopsy was done for the patient under local anesthesia and was submitted for histopathological examination. The lesion was suggestive of AR. The mass was explored under general anesthesia with an intraoral approach. The tumor mass was marked with methylene blue. An elliptical incision was marked around the tumor mass and it was excised from the surrounding musculature of the tongue [].

The patient was a healthy female with a known past medical history of myopia treated with LASIK, and chronic inflammatory acne vulgaris for the past seven years. Apart from that, she had no significant medical or surgical history. Her acne failed to sufficiently respond to topical astringents and keratolytic agents as well as different regimens of topical and oral antibiotics. Four weeks ago, she was prescribed 40 mg or 1.35 mg/kg of oral isotretinoin daily. Before initiating oral retinoid therapy, thorough blood workup including complete blood cell counts, thyroid function test, basic metabolic profile, liver function tests, and lipid panel was performed, revealing no abnormal values. Her annual eye examination also showed visual acuity of 20/20, which is considered the standard visual acuity []. The patient had been diagnosed with myopia during early adolescence. At that time, her vision in the right eye was -2.25 D and -1.75 D in the left eye. Her myopia was managed with corrective eyeglasses till she underwent LASIK treatment in 2014. After LASIK in both right and left eyes, her visual acuity became 20/20 bilaterally. She did not experience any side effects of LASIK and her vision stayed stable throughout, as evident by her successive annual eye examinations.\nNow the patient reported experiencing difficulty in focusing on distant objects. She complained of fuzzy vision as the objects seemed blurry for the first time since undergoing LASIK. She did not exhibit any other signs or symptoms.

The pathological diagnosis was thyroid papillary carcinoma. She developed brain metastasis from the thyroid papillary carcinoma in 2003. The metastatic brain tumor was surgically removed, and the patient underwent whole brain irradiation. Multiple metastases in the lung were also found at the same time.

Most recently, multiple brain metastases were identified and the patient underwent intensity-modulated radiation therapy in 2011.\nAn abdominal ultrasound study was performed in order to determine the cause of hematuria. We were able to detect a protruding mass in the bladder. CT and MRI studies showed the bladder tumor located in the right posterior wall. There was no accompanying hydronephrosis.

The patient had a history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, cerebral embolism and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA) examination upon admission showed an IMH compromising the ascending aorta and aortic arch. The PAU occurred in the aortic arch and had a diameter of 16 mm and a depth of 6 mm (Fig. ), the diameter of ascending aorta was 38 mm. Echocardiography showed no dilated ascending aorta, no aortic valve regurgitation, and normal heart function. He was maintained on an adequate pain control medication (intravenous opiate analgesia), with meticulous blood pressure control (< 120/80 mmHg) and heart rate control (< 60 b.p.m.) after the admission.\nWe explained all treatment options to the patient, including preoperative preparation, the procedure and complications, as aortic arch replacement involves high risk and great trauma. Furthermore, he wanted to avoid the risk of reoperation as the total/hybrid endovascular repair is more complicated. After providing informed consent, the patient agreed to transthoracic minimally invasive closure of the PAU (Fig. ).\nAfter general anaesthesia and intubation, the patient was placed in a supine position. A transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe was inserted to monitor the procedure. The shape, location and maximal diameter of the PAU were measured by TEE (Fig. ). After TEE assessment, the proper device was selected.\nThe incision was made from the superior sternal fossa to the third intercostal space, with a length of approximately 5 cm. The sternum was cut in an inverted \"L\" shape, the surrounding tissues of the aortic arch were separated, and the aortic arch was exposed.

When vomiting, he could feel the mass coming from his throat into his mouth, and when swallowing, the mass would go downward. A barium meal (baM) examination of the esophagus showed that the cervical segment, about 14 cm from the cutting tooth, was broadened to 50 mm, and the broadened segment was 50 mm long (Figures\n).

She has background of ichthyosis, lichen sclerosis, asthma, depression and chronic herpes simplex virus infection. She had hysterectomy due to abnormal smear cells, which was then proven benign on histology. She was initially found to have microcytic anaemia with low ferritin level which did not improve despite oral iron replacement. Both oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and colonoscopy were unremarkable. A subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a splenic mass with a central area of calcification and a calcified 35 mm pleural-based nodule at the right costophrenic angle.\nThe latter was discussed in the lung multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meeting. They concluded that the pleural mass was most likely due to post-inflammatory changes. In absence of concerning features, further monitoring or intervention was deemed unnecessary. The splenic mass was then discussed in the hepatobiliary MDT meeting. They recommended obtaining tissue biopsy to aid diagnosis. However, it only showed fibrotic tissue with possible granulomas. The indeterminate histology prompted a repeat CT scan and further magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the mass further and exclude the possibility of lymphoma. These scans showed stable appearance of the splenic lesion at 6 cm ( and ). The CT scan also picked up numerous small calcifications scattered throughout the peritoneal cavity.\nShe then had a diagnostic laparoscopy with a view of performing a splenectomy. However, widespread nodules were found in the peritoneum and throughout the abdomen as shown in . There was no evidence of malignancy found on laparoscopy.

He had a complete avulsion of the thumb and near-complete amputation of the index finger at the metacarpophalangeal joint. The zone of injury extended proximally to the radius, and severe damage was sustained by the trapezium and scaphoid bones. There was significant soft tissue injury of the radial and dorsoradial aspect of the hand, but his third, fourth and fifth digits were not involved. He had intact sensory and motor function to the ulnar three digits. The amputated thumb was placed on ice and transported with the patient to the hospital.\nThe patient was taken emergently to the operating room for possible replantation. Careful examination revealed bony amputation of the entire thumb, through the first metacarpal and trapezium. There was multilevel soft tissue injury of the thumb, and hence, it was not suitable for replantation. The second finger had multilevel injuries, with no appreciable blood supply. The index proximal phalanx and the second metacarpal had severely comminuted fractures rendering it nonsalvageable (Figure ). A revision amputation of the second finger was performed, and a temporary negative pressure therapy was applied to the damaged radial aspect of the hand.\nMultiple reconstructive options were discussed with the patient, including simple soft tissue coverage with a skin graft, osteoplastic reconstruction with a toe-to-thumb transplant, and a single-stage pollicization of the middle finger to reconstruct the thumb. The patient had a significant medical and social history including his active tobacco and cocaine use, in combination with poor glycemic control, which put him at increased risk of wound complications with any surgical intervention.

    "original_text": "A 56-year-old gentleman was referred to our service with a long-standing history of primary lymphoedema affecting his left leg and despite being compliant, conservative management had failed to reduce the limb significantly (). In 2010, he underwent a below-knee Charles procedure at a remote unit. Whilst this had reduced the volume of the lower leg, he was left with multiple areas of unstable skin graft and worsening swelling in his foot and thigh. The thigh swelling had become so large that he found it extremely difficult to mobilise resulting in him being house bound. He also found it difficult to pass urine due to the large mass of tissue medially, contributing to a total thigh circumference of 150 cm and the leg being 219% larger than the right with an excess volume of 25,306 millilitres (mls). His comorbidities included right-sided heart failure, sleep apnoea and atrial fibrillation. As part of his assessment an MRI scan was performed which demonstrated diffusely oedematous subcutaneous fat but no discrete cystic lesions.\nAfter discussion at the lymphoedema MDT meeting consisting of surgeons, lymphoedema therapists and physiotherapy, the decision was made to undertake a two-stage debulking procedure of the left thigh. He was subsequently counselled carefully on the high risks that general anaesthetics presented due to his complex medical history, however, despite this, owing to the significant impact on his quality of life, he was keen to proceed with surgical intervention. An anaesthetic review was sought preoperatively.\nThe first procedure consisted of placing the patient in the right lateral position. Following infiltration of the area with tumescent solution, an anteriorly based fasciocutaneous flap was raised over the area of maximal thigh bulk through a medially placed incision ().

Blood, urine, and peritoneal fluid cultures were obtained because of febrile episodes. Intravenous (IV) antibiotherapy with tazobactam-ampicillin was initiated. Growth of Candida spp. in his peritoneal culture necessitated the inclusion of liposomal amphotericin B in his treatment, and the peritoneal dialysis catheter was removed.

Although IVIG was administered three times after IVIG and methylprednisolone pulse therapy, the inflammatory responses persisted, and bilateral coronary artery aneurysms were found 1 week after admission. The patient was transferred to our hospital on disease day 17. After admission to the intensive care unit, the patient was intubated to maintain sedation, and the heart rate and blood pressure were suppressed using nicardipine and sedatives. Despite those therapies, large aneurysms were detected at all three coronary arteries. At 3 months of age, 1 month from disease onset, there were no symptoms, but deepQ wave in lead III on ECG suggested ischemic changes and the troponin and CK-MB levels were elevated on blood test. We diagnosed the patient with AMI, and CAG was performed.

On the left side, the aneurysmal size on LAD was 9.2 mm and that on LCX was 3.3 mm.\nEmergency ICT using t-PA was performed for the RCA thrombus. The thrombus disappeared on the echocardiogram; however, the fever persisted, and infliximab was administered on day 18. The body temperature began to decline on the next day, and the heart rate stabilized. One week later, the patient was extubated, and sedation was discontinued.

Laboratory examinations, including other pituitary hormones, did not reveal other abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a space-occupying mass within the SS, which partially enhanced by gadolinium.

However, he continued to present sexual dysfunction and his serum PRL level did not decrease sufficiently. Thus, bromocriptine was changed to cabergoline administered at a dose of 0.25 mg twice a week and then it was increased gradually until reaching a dose of 1.5 mg three times a week. Three months later, the patient still had sexual dysfunction and his serum PRL value was 195 ng/ml. Thereupon, he was referred to the neurosurgical department. Surgical treatment was proposed because of three reasons. First, dopamine agonist treatment administered thus far had failed in lowering the serum PRL level. Second, clinical manifestations due to hyperprolactinemia persisted in spite of medical treatment; and third, he told the physicians that he wanted to get his wife pregnant, as they had been planning for a long time. So, he underwent surgical treatment. A transsphenoidal approach without opening the sellar floor was performed using an operating microscope and the lesion within the SS was completely removed.

Serology revealed a white blood cell count of 16.1g/dL, and plain abdominal radiographs revealed no obvious perforation or obstruction. A differential diagnosis of appendicitis and cecal carcinoma was considered, and the decision to operate was made. At laparotomy through a lower midline incision, palpation of the small bowel revealed that a large impacted gallstone in the mid-ileum was causing patchy mesenteric necrosis. There was free fluid in the right iliac fossa but no perforation. A 12cm length of ileum was resected, and a primary stapled anastomosis was performed. The gallbladder was found to be packed with stones. No fistula was identified, but the dissection was limited by dense fibrosis.\nAfter initial signs of recovery, our patient developed worsening abdominal pain on the fourth post-operative day, and abdominal CT was undertaken (Figure ). The scan revealed a low-grade small bowel obstruction due to a laminated ileal gallstone, a fistula between the gallbladder and duodenum, and a further stone in the gallbladder. After a trial of conservative management, a second laparotomy on day nine revealed a gallstone impaction in the distal small bowel and a contained leak in the original ileal anastomosis. The stone was removed through a transverse enterotomy, and the anastomosis was refashioned with sutures. The inflammatory mass in the right upper quadrant, with the residual gallbladder stone, was palpable but not disturbed. The post-operative recovery was complicated by a Clostridium difficile infection, but our patient returned home to independent living four weeks after the second procedure.\nTwelve months later, she presented with a further episode of central abdominal pain associated with vomiting and distension.

The patient consulted a neurologist, and blood analysis, biochemical analyses, and an MRI investigation of the brain were performed. These tests revealed a mass in the right temporal lobe (Figures and ). The surgical removal of the hemangioblastoma went well, and there were no complications during the postoperative period. The clinical findings were confirmed histologically (hemangioblastoma), and the patient was diagnosed with suspected VHL syndrome. She was discharged in June, 2008.\nThe patient was admitted to the university hospital emergency department for the second time in April 2012. This time, she presented with weakness, palpitations, and nausea, and an abdominal CT was performed both with and without contrast (Figures and ). While the right adrenal gland did not show any pathological changes in the noncontrast images, a round, well-demarcated mass was observed in the left adrenal gland, which was about 36.3 mm in diameter. However, administration of the contrast reagent showed the mass to be hypervascular. The vascularization was homogeneous. In addition, the density of the mass increased up to 170 Hounsfield Units (HU). The contrast was leached in 15 minutes and the density decreased to 70 HU. There were no other pathological findings in the abdomen. The conclusion was that there was a mass in the left adrenal gland that was probably benign in nature (the leaching of the contrast exceeded 50%). However, these findings, along with the clinical signs of VHL disease, meant that it was still possible that the mass was a pheochromocytoma, which could have been dormant at that time but could, upon being triggered, release massive amounts of catecholamine.\nTo exclude the possibility of lesions in other locations, MRI of the brain and a chest CT were performed.
