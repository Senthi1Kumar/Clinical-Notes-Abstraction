I tore my left anterior cruciate ligament while playing hockey and had reconstruction surgery done more than ten years ago. The surgery was uneventful but unfortunately my knee became unstable again one year later which I attributed to poor rehabilitation on my part. Despite this, I continued with regular swimming practice although I never played hockey again. I developed an interest in hiking a few years ago and during the winter months I would go hiking every week for three to six hours. The instability in the left knee was not troublesome as long as I remained careful. Last year I climbed to the top of Mount Kinabalu (4095 m) and had no problem with my knees at all.\nThis year to challenge myself, I took part in a 50 km charity hiking event. It was the longest hike I had ever done, having completed the whole trail uneventfully within twelve hours. My knees felt fine until the following evening when the right knee, the 'good' one, started to hurt, particularly around the patella and yet there was no problem with my operated knee. There was no effusion and the range of movement was full. I thought it was patellar tendonitis, so I took diclofenic sodium 75 mg daily for five days. Yet the pain persisted and even got worse. I switched to acetaminophen 1 gm four times daily for two days, but again it did not help. The pain occurred not only when I walked on level ground but also while I was at rest.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a tumor occupying the PPS with a size of 43 \u00d7 38 \u00d7 35 mm, which had the characteristics of a trigeminal nerve sheath tumor (), and the nearby hospital referred the patient to our hospital. Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the tumor revealed spindle or pleomorphic sarcoma. The patient underwent resection of the PPS tumor along with part of the middle constrictor muscle, internal pterygoid muscle, and palatine tonsil because of tumor invasion (), using a median mandibular osteotomy approach. The resected tumor had a size of 80 \u00d7 65 \u00d7 45 mm. A free rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap, with a size of 35 \u00d7 50 mm after trimming, was transferred to cover the internal carotid artery and to compensate for the oropharyngeal defect (). The lingual artery and the external jugular vein were used as the recipient vessels, and one artery end-to-end anastomosis and one venous end-to-end anastomosis were performed. The transfer of a sufficient tissue volume and the use of the Gehanno method were important for the achievement of optimum velopharyngeal and oropharyngeal function. Total surgical time was 653 minutes and total blood loss was 410 ml. The histopathological examination revealed that the tumor was a carcinosarcoma that arose from the minor salivary gland. A postoperative lower mental gingival fistula occurred after surgery, but with conservative treatment, this complication healed in 3 weeks. Therefore, oral ingestion was started 30 days after surgery. About 9 months after surgery, solitary neck lymph node metastasis and lung metastatic recurrence appeared, even though the patient had received postoperative radiotherapy (60 Gy/30 Fr/51 days), which was the only adjuvant therapy that was used. The neck and lung metastatic recurrences required additional surgery. At present, 21 months after the first surgery, the patient is being followed up on an outpatient basis and has shown no further evidence of disease.",

The deficiency was diagnosed a few days after she was born, following administration of antibiotics to address a urinary infection which triggered mild gastric hemorrhages. Although her hemogram was normal with a normal platelet count, clotting tests showed abnormal values for both coagulation pathways. A determination of coagulation factor levels revealed a severe deficiency of FVa (<1%). The other clotting factors exhibited normal levels. Screening of the patient\u2019s parents showed that both were FVa deficient (mild phenotype). The patient did not experience significant hemorrhagic episodes until she was 8 months old, when she developed a hematoma in her right upper gingiva. As this occurred precisely when her teeth were erupting, she required administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), which resolved the hematoma within 24 h. At the age of one, two further bleeding episodes required a FFP transfusion, which immediately resolved the hematoma. Subsequently the patient was diagnosed with an atrial septal defect and was referred to the pediatric cardiology department. Corrective surgery was indicated at the age of two. Prophylactic FFP was administered preoperatively and one week after surgery. No intraoperative complications occurred, and correction of the cardiac defect was achieved. In the next few years, the patient presented only with mild episodes of epistaxis, which coexisted with upper airway infections. Local and oral administration of tranexamic acid resolved the hemorrhage in all but one of the cases, in which FFP had to be administered to address the epistaxis. At the age of six she presented with left hip pain of 12 hours\u2019 evolution. A diagnostic ultrasonogram revealed hemarthrosis in the left hip and no other previous trauma. Administration of FFP every 12 h during the first 24 h and every 24 h thereafter over 5 days resulted in progressive improvement. At age seven, she was admitted with vomiting, abdominal pain",

Medical history included multiple episodes of acute diverticulitis and dementia. She had no abdominal pain or fever. Upon admission, her laboratory tests were within the normal range. Pelvic examination revealed an atrophied vagina and malodorous yellowish vaginal discharge. A colovaginal fistula, secondary to diverticular disease, was suspected as it is the most common type of fistula between the gastrointestinal and female reproductive system. Cultures of the vaginal discharge were sent. Nil per os, total parenteral nutrition, and intravenous antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were applied to the patient until a definitive diagnosis would be made. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed multiple diverticula and findings indicative of chronic diverticulitis, such as thickening of the wall of the sigmoid colon and pericolic fat stranding (Figures and ). A colonoscopy was performed, revealing diverticula of the sigmoid colon. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a fistula between the sigmoid colon and the uterine fundus and air bubbles in the uterine cavity and the vagina (). Surgical management was decided. Intraoperative findings included a colouterine fistula side to side to a jejunouterine fistula as well (). Inflammatory adhesions of the sigmoid colon and the jejunum to the wall of the uterus, as a result of the repeated episodes of diverticulitis, were found, explaining the presence of the fistulae, as well as adhesive lesions between the urinary bladder and uterus. Taking in mind the age of the patient and the intraoperative findings, we performed a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy and en bloc resection of the defective part of the sigmoid colon and jejunum (Figures and ). Primary jejunojejunal and colocolonic anastomoses were performed. During surgery, a bladder injury was recognized and repaired immediately. Postoperatively, the patient had a fever because of an urinary tract infection which was treated with antibiotics. Rest of the postoperative course was uneventful",

There was no cutaneous scar on the lateral side of the left hip or on the ipsilateral buttock. There was a good trophicity of the abductors. Lateral rotation and abduction were markedly diminished.

Her incision gave rise to a whitish, thick color, looks a little oily collection (), resembling a purulent collection (). A sample for bacteriological investigation in a lab was carried out.

Ten years prior, she was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer with invasion of the tracheal tissue, which was treated palliatively with a total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy. Despite the RAI therapy, the thyroid cancer remained in the trachea, and the patient required further supportive treatment.\nSix months prior, she was admitted to our hospital and underwent endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Computed tomography (CT) following intubation revealed an endotracheal mass filling the tracheal lumen. We recommended a palliative tracheostomy to wean the patient off the ventilator, but her family refused this procedure. Therefore, we decided to extubate and perform an endoscopic de-bulking procedure. During the bronchoscope-guided extubation, we found that the endotracheal mass was sufficiently compressed so as not to interfere with airway patency. Thus, we did not perform the bronchoscopic de-bulking intervention, and she was discharged with improvement.\nTo evaluate her current tracheal stenosis, a CT scan was performed. The results showed near-complete obstruction of the upper trachea by a cancerous invasion (). We contacted the interventional radiologist to insert a tracheal stent under balloon dilatation, but he refused to perform the procedure due to the proximity of the mass to the vocal cords. We then recommended two procedures to the patient: a rigid bronchoscopy or a palliative tracheostomy under general anesthesia. The patient refused both recommended procedures, and a subsequent recommendation was made for an intervention employing a flexible bronchoscope.

In February of 2018, an upper GI endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed which showed a right colon cancer. CEA was 40.4. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was obtained in February of 2018. This showed a mass 7 cm in greatest diameter that was immediately adjacent to the undersurface of the right liver and contiguous with numerous loops small bowel and the lowest part of the second portion of the duodenum (). There were mildly prominent mesenteric lymph nodes but no evidence of distant metastatic disease.\nIn February of 2018, the patient underwent a single port laparoscopic right colon resection.

She began to speak and walk independently at the age of 19 months and had a normal head circumference. The seizures occurred at the age of 8 months and 1 year, respectively, presenting with eyes rolling involuntarily and lips cyanosis, but there were no seizures in the next 2 years. Until the age of 4 years, her symptoms evolved into dystonia, majorly with the head backward, stiffness of the right lower limbs, and hallux dorsal flexion. Occasionally, her right arm was rotated inward and could not be flexed, accompanied by crying and shaking of the whole body. At the early stage, these symptoms were mild, with a frequency of three to eight times per month, each lasting about 1 to 2 min. The electroencephalogram (EEG) showed sharp waves and sharp slow waves in the right central temporal and left central region with a normal background during wake and sleep.

These symptoms started about 4 weeks ago and gradually increased in severity until there was no function left in the affected arm. She denied any conflict or stressor prior to the onset of symptoms; further psychiatric evaluation revealed that she had a low mood with loss of pleasure in day to day activities. She had a decreased appetite with initial and middle insomnia, diminished energy and easy fatigability. She expressed ideas of reduced self worth and helplessness but denied having suicidal ideation. She also had severe irritability and increased interpersonal sensitivity. Physical examination including a detailed neurological examinational was completely normal.\nShe was diagnosed as suffering from conversion disorder with comorbid major depressive disorder with mixed features according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, May 2013). Psychopharmacological treatment was started and consisted of escitalopram 10 mg/d, mirtazapine 30 mg/d, and levetiracetam 1,500 mg/d. She was seen regularly on a weekly basis and supportive psychotherapy and physiotherapy sessions were also included.

However, in the next 4 weeks the patient had anxiety and restlessness with mood lability and her progress stalled.

Abdominal exam was normal aside from a reducible nontender 3 cm umbilical hernia.\nAfter the patient's office visit, an MRI was performed for better characterization of the previously identified mass. This showed a 4.4 cm predominantly solid mass in the bulb and second portion of the duodenum with extension into the pancreatoduodenal groove as well as fluid in the right pararenal and paraduodenal spaces (Figures and ). A repeat endoscopy with EUS was performed. Endoscopy showed a nodular, edematous, friable mass in the first portion of the duodenum causing mild stricture of the lumen (). EUS revealed a slightly nodular, ill-defined, hypoechoic and heterogeneous submucosal mass in the medial wall of the first portion of the duodenum extending into the duodenal sweep and causing mild stricture. The duodenal wall was thickened with loss of demarcation between layers (). Repeat biopsy and fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the mass taken at the time of EUS revealed only duodenal mucosa with dilated lymphatic channels and prominent lymphoid follicles.\nGiven the remaining diagnostic uncertainty, the patient was discussed in a multidisciplinary fashion at our GI tumor board",

    "original_text": "A 14-year-old boy, who was initially examined for continuous coughing, was referred to our hospital owing to an anterior mediastinal mass identified on chest X-ray (). Systematic examination revealed a 20 \u00d7 10 cm sized mass at the right anterior mediastinum that involved the right pulmonary vein and elevated levels of alpha fetoprotein (AFP), a tumor marker, at 3825 ng/ml. Needle aspiration was performed, but only necrotic tissue could be collected. We did not analyze the karyotype since the symptoms suggesting the Klinefelter syndrome were not observed. Therefore, a clinical diagnosis of malignant teratoma was made, and three courses of cisplatin-based chemotherapy were administered because AFP levels continuously increased. After chemotherapy, AFP levels decreased, although the size of the tumor did not change, as evident in a computed tomography (CT) scan. Next, tumorectomy and total right lung extraction were performed. The pathological diagnosis of the extracted tumor was malignant teratoma with areas of yolk sac tumor (). No cancer cells were found at the edges of the area where the tumor was removed. Two courses of cisplatin-based postoperative chemotherapy were administered until AFP levels were normal.\nAfter 3 months of follow-up, the patient experienced pain in his right hip joint while AFP was still normal. The 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone scan showed increased tracer uptake at the left forehead and right hip joint (). Head and pelvic MRI also revealed signs of metastasis at the left forehead and right hip joint. Abdominal CT showed a metastatic region in the liver. Bone biopsy was performed at the left forehead. The pathological diagnosis was metastatic malignant melanoma originating from an immature teratoma of mediastinum (). Large heteromorphic cells with melanin were found in the original mediastinal malignant teratoma by retrospective re-examination. This suggested that a section of the malignant melanoma in the original malignant teratoma, which was composed of various components, metastasized.

She complained of difficulty in weight bearing and a gradually diminishing walking distance such that in the four weeks prior to admission she was essentially housebound. Furthermore she reported her hip pain had progressed to an extent that it was present at rest and on occasion woke her up from sleep at night.\nShe had been reviewed six months previously by her local GP who had started her on high dose oral steroids for a provisional diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatic under the guidance of the rheumatologist. There was no history of trauma.\nHer past medical history included osteoarthritis, iron deficiency anemia, and a right cemented Exeter total hip replacement performed three years previously.\nOn examination she appeared generally unwell and frail. She was apyrexial with no evidence of any localized features of erythema, swelling, redness, or skin changes around the affected hip. There was severe tenderness on palpation around the greater trochanter. Her active range of motion of the right hip was limited to 20\u00b0 flexion with all other movements being severely restricted.

These symptoms were sudden in onset and lasted for a few minutes. Symptoms had completely resolved at the time of presentation. She did not have a history of any atherosclerotic risk factor including hypertension, diabetes, or hypercholesterolemia. The initial set of vital signs were normal; routine laboratory tests including complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were unremarkable. A computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast as well as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast did not show any acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction.\nThe patient was diagnosed with TIA, and further investigations were planned to determine the etiology. A magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) of the head and neck with and without contrast did not show any arterial flow limiting stenosis or occlusion. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with bubble study using agitated normal saline contrast was performed and was found to be normal. Patient's heart rhythm was monitored with continuous cardiac monitoring, and no arrhythmias were noted during her stay at the hospital. At this point, the patient was identified as having cryptogenic TIA, having failed to determine the precise etiology from routine workup. Patient was started on aspirin therapy and discharged from the hospital on day 3 with further outpatient workup planned. Outpatient workup for hypercoagulability showed a high factor VIII activity of 153%, which potentially put her at increased risk of venous thromboembolism. However, this test was performed just one week after the thrombotic event and was hence difficult to interpret. Subsequently, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed that revealed a patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunt.

A CT scan obtained in the emergency room showed a small chronic cortical insult of the ipsilateral temporal lobe, which was presumed to be unrelated. MRI of the brain showed no acute ischemia. MRA of the head and neck was then obtained and showed an anomalous anastomosis of the right vertebral artery to the internal carotid artery segment 2.0 cm distal to the right common carotid artery bifurcation (Figure ).

Injection of the right, internal carotid thus demonstrated filling of the entire right hemisphere and posterior circulation (except the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA)) from the right internal carotid. The absence of posterior communicating arterial flow was noted bilaterally. The vertebral arteries terminated at the PICA bilaterally. Just proximal to the ICA-PPHA bifurcation, there was a 1.3 cm length of plaque resulting in greater than 60% diameter stenosis (Figures -). Given the clinical implications of atheroembolic disease affecting the only supply to the patient's brainstem and the technical difficulty of surgical endarterectomy with difficult anatomy, the patient was entered into the treatment arm of the SAMMPRIS trial and underwent endovascular stenting. After placement of a SpiderFx\u2122 embolic protection device into the PPHA, a 7 x 10 x 40 mm Protege stent was deployed successfully across the stenotic segment and resulted in complete restoration of luminal diameter without the need for angioplasty (Figure ).

She stated that she required two pillows to breathe while lying down. She also stated that she could no longer work at her childrens' day care center, as even walking at a relaxed pace for more than two minutes would cause her to be short of breath, although the shortness of breath would improve with rest. She also complained of a nonproductive cough for two days before admission. She denied any trauma, chest pain, palpitations, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or fevers. Review of systems was remarkable for a one month history of bilateral lower extremity edema.\nShe denied any significant past medical history and had not been taking any medication before hospital admission. She remotely recalled that her last physician, whom she had not seen in the previous eight years, had mentioned to her that she might have hypothyroidism, but this was not further investigated. She denied use of tobacco, alcohol, or any other recreational drugs.\nPhysical examination revealed an obese, pale woman in mild distress from shortness of breath, but able to speak in full sentences. Her vital signs on arrival showed an oral temperature of 36.8\u00b0C, heart rate in the range of 81 to 93 beats per minute, blood pressures ranging from 140 to 173 mm Hg systolic and 94 to 121 mm Hg diastolic. Her breathing was 18 to 22 times per minute, with a digital pulse oximetry saturation of 86% while breathing air, which subsequently improved to 92% when she was given oxygen therapy via a face mask.

The baby had a birth weight of 460 grams. The Apgar scores were 1, 1 and 6 at 1, 5 and 10 minutes respectively. She received one dose intra-tracheal surfactant soon after birth and did not require additional doses.

CT showed multiple liver cysts, with the largest cyst in segment eight measuring 13 cm in diameter and compressing the right side of the heart and the right thoracic cavity (Fig. a). The IVC was bilaterally compressed by multiple liver cysts in the caudal lobe (Fig. b), implying blood flow obstruction. The cysts were also present in the hilar region of the liver, compressing the portal bifurcation and causing stenosis of the right branch of the portal vein (Figs. c, a, b). Angiography showed that the IVC was markedly stenotic, with an 11-mmHg pressure gradient on the central and peripheral sides of the IVC stenosis (Fig. a). Furthermore, superior mesenteric artery angiography showed that the portal vein enhanced the antegrade flow; however, left gastric vein\u2013left renal vein shunt developed (Fig. b).

    "original_text": "A 36-year-old male patient with a 6-year history of chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology was brought to the emergency department due to neurological impairment that started during the previous hour characterized by altered mental status while he was walking down the street. On examination he was stuporous, with poor response to external stimuli. The patient was admitted to the hospital and vital signs and capillary glucose were determined. Glucose levels were 20 mg/dl and increased to 42 mg/dl after a 50 ml infusion of 50% dextrose. During his stay his mental status recovered after glucose levels were returned to normal parameters, requiring high doses of intravenous glucose. After his stabilization he was transferred to the internal medicine department. We confirmed that the patient was not taking medications that would cause hypoglycemia. On physical examination he was somnolent and pale, with slight oedema in both legs. A new episode of symptomatic hypoglycemia was observed while he was receiving an infusion of 20% dextrose. The infusion rate at that moment was 10.416 ml/hr. The infusion was not being weaned off or was an acute disruption. It caught our attention that although the patient was on a 20% dextrose infusion, he continued with hypoglycemia. Blood samples were taken and the results were abnormal ().\nAlthough hypoglycemia could be explained by chronic kidney disease, the diagnosis of insulinoma was considered, so a computed axial tomography with double contrast was taken but unfortunately there were no abnormal findings. During the patient's hospital stay he received several treatments that failed to achieve proper glucose control. We used ascending doses of diazoxide up to 600 mg/day with a poor response. In order to reduce episodes of hypoglycemia, we started with low doses of octreotide and found a good response that created tolerance quickly, so we decided to increase the dose by 0.1 mcg/kg/h always observing the same phenomenon. We decided to suspend this treatment when we reached 0.4. mcg/kg/h. Finally, we",

In the emergency department, laboratory data revealed anemia, thrombocytopenia of 10,000 platelets/microliter, and elevated white blood count of 235,500 leukocytes/microliter with 97% blasts concerning for leukemia. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed a new diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). She was subsequently transferred to a major tertiary referral center for management.\nOn further evaluation, she continued to have worsening left lower extremity pain with physical exam notable for cyanosis of all five toes, erythema to the midshin, and decreased sensation to touch but intact posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses detected using a Doppler device. Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound revealed a left popliteal artery occlusion at the level of the popliteal fossa and acute bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). The patient was started on a heparin infusion for acute DVT and given nonopioid adjuvants (scheduled oral acetaminophen, scheduled oral gabapentin, lidocaine patch, and ketamine injection as needed) as well as oral and intravenous opioids to control her pain. Despite escalation of pain regimen up to 200 oral morphine equivalents (OME), she continued to experience 10/10 pain at rest and was unable to sleep at night. Palliative care service was consulted for further management.\ntGiven her worsening pain, a regional anesthetic technique was considered. Due to her critical thrombocytopenia and continuous heparin infusion, she was not a candidate for neuraxial anesthesia. Consideration was given to the patient's multiple risk factors for peripheral nerve block including bleeding, infection due to severe immunocompromised state, and potential for masking a developing compartment syndrome or a worsening of her CLI. After an extensive discussion with the patient and her family regarding the high risk nature of an invasive procedure, the decision was made to proceed with a trial of continuous popliteal nerve catheter for the patient's refractory pain. A left popliteal nerve catheter was placed by the anesthesia acute pain service under ultrasound guidance",
