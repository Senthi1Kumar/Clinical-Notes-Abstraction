Cranial nerves were normal on testing. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large extra-axial tumor in the middle cranial fossa which was hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2 with contrast enhancement [Figures \u2013]. The base of the tumor was on the petrous temporal bone. A diagnosis of meningioma was made preoperatively, and the patient was taken up for surgery.\nThe patient was operated in supine position under general anesthesia. The right side temporal craniotomy was made. The tumor was firm grayish red in color.

At that time, she underwent left radical nephrectomy. One year later, she developed a metastatic lesion in the bony pelvis for which she underwent radiation therapy. She as treated with pazopanib for two years with stable disease but stopped due to gastro-intestinal toxicity. Therapy was switched to nivolumab, which was discontinued after six months due to grade four pancreatitis and grade two rash. Eight months prior to her current presentation, she underwent radiation treatment to metastatic lesions in the left pubic symphysis and spleen. The patient initiated therapy with cabozantinib, a tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor used to treat renal cell carcinoma, three months prior to her current presentation.\nOn physical examination, she was wheezing in all lung fields and hypoxemic requiring supplemental oxygen. She had prior 12-pack-year smoking history but no formal diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A chest x-ray revealed a small left pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis. Laboratory workup, including complete blood count, renal and hepatic panels, and troponin, was unremarkable. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus tachycardia without signs of ischemia.

At the age of 32, bilateral cataracts were diagnosed and at 44 he was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, currently on oral hypoglycemic agents. Additionally, he has hypothyroidism and hypertriglyceridemia in management and calcification of the Achilles tendon. Patient endorses lack of an early adolescent growth spurt; however, final stature is similar to his other 3 siblings (164 cm). Patient reports he had no child by choice.\nPatient is product of the union of consanguineous parents (second cousins) and has a 49-year-old brother with similar clinical characteristics, including voice changes since the age of 28, bilateral cataracts at age 29 (subsequently presents complications from corneal ulceration and is currently legally blind), and premature graying since age 33, moreover, scleroderma-like skin changes since his 30s and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus at age 35.

The patient described the acute onset of left-sided facial weakness that waxed and waned, recurring several times throughout the day, and lasting 2\u20133 minutes at a time. The left facial weakness was also associated with mild, left-arm weakness and \u201cclumsiness\u201d involving fine motor function of her left hand. She noted lightheadedness but denied leg weakness, headache, visual changes, chest pain or shortness of breath. She also noted that symptoms were brought on by use of her upper extremities and when she changed her body position from lying to sitting. She denied any similar symptoms previously or stroke history. Of note, she noticed a rapid improvement in her symptoms to resolution just prior to ED presentation.\nOn examination, her blood pressure (BP) was 183/86 millimeters of mercury (mmHg). She was awake, alert, oriented, and able to describe a detailed history. Her cranial nerves were intact, motor strength was 5/5 bilaterally, and fine motor movements in both her hands were normal. There was no ataxia, extraocular muscle dysfunction, or indication of posterior circulation involvement.\nJust after her initial asymptomatic presentation to the ED, her symptoms recurred when her systolic BP dropped by 20 mmHg upon standing from a supine position. Emergent computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the head and neck demonstrated a severe flow-limiting lesion of the innominate artery ().

She noticed the lump eight months ago and it was gradually increasing in size. It was painless initially; however, the lump gradually became tender. The patient was otherwise fit and well with no co-existing morbidities. Closer examination of the right thigh revealed a high consistency mass, with reduced mobility. There was no right inguinal lymphadenopathy or lymph nodes enlargement.\nLaboratory blood tests were unremarkable. An MRI scan was requested to further assess the mass, which was irregular but well-defined in the medial compartment of the thigh, measuring 8.2 x 6.6 x 4.3 cm in size. The mass showed an intermediate signal on both T1 and T2-weighted imaging, appearing hyperintense compared to the adjacent muscular tissue, which also persisted on fat-suppressed imaging. The mass invaded the intramuscular fat planes and caused compression and displacement of the adductor muscles. There was no evidence of intra-muscular invasion. Normal cortical outline and medullary signal intensity of the femur were seen in the right thigh. There was no evidence of bone contusion, marrow oedema, fracture line, or cortical discontinuity. Other muscles of the thigh had a normal outline and signal intensity with no evidence of focal or diffuse oedema. Neurovascular structures were unremarkable. Overall, MRI findings were suggestive of soft tissue neoplasm, with a possibility of a neurogenic tumour. A wide excisional biopsy was then performed to further assess the tissue histologically by the pathologist and confirm the diagnosis. The removed mass measuring 8.5 x 6.5 x 5.4 cm and is shown in Figure . The mass had a smooth outer surface and a soft consistency.

The maximum diameters of the abdominal aortic aneurysm and the common iliac artery aneurysm were 35 and 27 mm, respectively. Because he had several comorbidities, including a cerebral arterial aneurysm and a history of cerebral infarction, EVAR was selected as the treatment approach. After embolizing the right internal iliac artery and the inferior mesenteric artery with coils, we placed an Excluder leg (W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc., Newark, DE, USA) spanning from the right common iliac artery to the right external iliac artery as the initial step. Because of a narrow and long proximal neck (diameter, 17 mm; length, 60 mm), it was assumed that the use of a modular device could cause compression and stenosis of the ipsilateral leg at the proximal neck. Therefore, we decided to use an AFX2 device as the main endograft. On completion aortography performed after deployment of the main AFX2 endograft, an endoleak was noted in the middle of the endograft. As it was considered to be a type Ia endoleak, we added two Excluder cuffs to the proximal neck. However, the endoleak persisted, and angiography with the tip of a Berenstein catheter (Merit Medical Inc., South Jordan, UT, USA) placed at the assumed endoleak point revealed that the endoleak originated from a graft hole, indicating a type IIIb endoleak (). Because no main endograft with an appropriate dimension was available and the reliability of the AFX2 device was unclear, we decided to perform parallel placement of Excluder legs.

Her symptoms were classic for acute pancreatitis: abdominal pain with radiation to the back, elevated lipase level, and radiologic findings of acute pancreatitis involving the tail of the pancreas. She was treated conservatively following these events and recovered uneventfully, except for the persistence of intermittent left upper quadrant abdominal pain. The diagnosis was considered idiopathic, as she reported no significant alcohol consumption, trauma, new culprit medications, laboratory test result abnormalities, or imaging findings to suggest gallstone pancreatitis, hypercalcemia, or hypertriglyceridemia. On her second admission (approximately 8 weeks since the first admission), imaging revealed new peripancreatic (tail) fluid collection abutting the spleen and gastric fundus (). On the third admission (approximately 6 weeks since the second admission), imaging revealed new acute splenic vein thrombosis, gastric varices, and splenomegaly in addition to the known peripancreatic fluid collection (). The patient was started on anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin bridged to a direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) after hematologist consultation. The international normalized ratio on DOACs ranged from 2.1 to 3.4.

The chest CT images revealed spotted and slightly high-density shadows scattered on the lateral side of the right lower lobe (Fig. a). Except for lower abdominal pain, the pregnant woman had no signs or symptoms related to COVID-19 infection, and she reported normal fetal movement. None of her family members were diagnosed with COVID-19 or developed any respiratory symptoms. Since the woman developed cervical dilation of 0.5 cm and her CT result was abnormal, she was given a surgical mask instead of her original one. She was then transferred to a designated isolation delivery room by designated medical staff with specialized infection control preparation and strict infection protection equipment, including disposable work caps, medical protective masks, protective goggles, work clothes, disposable protective suit, disposable latex gloves, and disposable shoe covers.\nThe physical examination revealed a body temperature of 37 \u00b0C, pulse of 100 beats per minute, blood pressure of 135/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% while breathing ambient air. Considering that the pregnant woman and her family hoped that she would deliver vaginally and that there was no surgical indication for her, we decided to help her give birth naturally in the isolation delivery room.

    "original_text": "A 28-year-old Asian woman (G3P1) who had undergone emergency cesarean delivery owing to a compound presentation at full term was referred to our institution with a suspicion of abnormally located gestational sac. She had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy and open appendectomy previously. She did not have any medical, family, or psychosocial history. She had missed her menstrual period without any other symptom and visited a private obstetrical clinic to confirm the pregnancy. However, she was diagnosed as having an abnormal pregnancy such as cervical or CSP by USG.\nAt our institution, she reported that her last menstrual period was just 5 to 6 weeks prior. However, USG revealed a gestational sac in the anterior lower uterine segment with a fetus measuring 4.83 cm crown-rump length (CRL) with positive cardiac activity, corresponding to 11 weeks and 6 days of gestation. Color/power Doppler images depicted a hyperechoic rim of a choriodecidual reaction with excessive vascularity (Fig. ). Although we could observe a definitive abnormally located gestational sac, our patient did not have any pain during the physical examination. She admitted that her last menstrual period was different from her usual menstrual periods.

She received six cycles of docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab, followed by maintenance adjuvant trastuzumab and tamoxifen. One year after completion of adjuvant trastuzumab, she developed liver metastases. She was started on capecitabine and lapatinib, on which she had a progression-free interval of 6 months. At this time, she was given six cycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide. At the end of this regimen, she presented with headache and vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord showed patchy leptomeningeal enhancement suggestive of LC.

Chest CT revealed a prominent, slightly rounded consolidation of the inferior right upper lobe with adjacent ground glass and interstitial opacities likely representing pneumonia (). The patient was admitted and initially treated for community acquired pneumonia. However, an interval chest radiograph done one month later revealed a persistent and enlarging right upper lobe infiltrate ( &). The patient subsequently underwent bronchoscopy, which revealed a protruding endobronchial lesion almost completely obstructing the right upper lobe bronchus limiting any further visualization of the RUL segments. Initial pathologic analysis of specimens biopsied during bronchoscopy revealed non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Subsequently, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed and showed a hypermetabolic RUL pulmonary mass with obstruction of RUL bronchus compatible with malignancy in addition to low level uptakes in the adrenal and thyroid glands. A MRI of the abdomen was done to better examine the adrenal gland, however, no masses were observed, only mild thickening. It was determined by the tumor board that the patient would best benefit from tumor excision and adjuvant chemotherapy. Subsequently, a definitive diagnosis was established by way of a RUL lobectomy. The resected specimen consisted of multiple fragments of tan/black soft tissue measuring 0.3 \u00d7 0.3 \u00d7 0.2 cm in aggregate. Pathologic analysis of the resected specimen showed sarcomatoid giant cell carcinoma, tumor size 9.5 cm with invasion of the visceral pleura and 1/13 hilar lymph node involvement. The pathological stage was pT3N1Mx based on the tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging system.

The dental occlusion demonstrated a cross-bite with all the posterior teeth in contact and a mandibular asymmetry with the chin significantly deviated to the left side. Radiographic investigations (orthopantomogram (OPG) and postero-anterior (PA) mandible images) were performed but confirmation of the dislocation could not be determined on these views (Fig. ). Consequently, a computerized tomography (CT) scan was performed that confirmed significant displacement of the condyle anteriorly and superiorly into the infratemporal fossa (Fig. ). In addition calcification of the lateral and medial pterygoid muscles was noted on the affected side indicating chronic nature of the condition. Discussion with the patient\u2019s general dental practitioner (GDP) revealed that the patient had a pre-existing dental malocclusion comprising of a cross-bite and mandibular asymmetry and this was also corroborated by a photograph taken well before the scooter accident. On this evidence it was therefore presumed that the condyle had been dislocated for many months or years and the scooter accident had only highlighted this. There were no other traumatic events of note in the history. The TMJ could not be convincingly reduced via a Hippocratic manoeuvre under a short general anaesthetic despite several attempts. In order to re-image the TMJ a magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed to prevent additional irradiation. This scan confirmed that the TMJ was still dislocated and had not been reduced. Due to the unsuccessful closed reduction, it was decided to perform an open reduction via a Risdon incision. When reduction with traction wires at the mandibular angle failed a bone hook was placed into the sigmoid notch and the dislocation was reduced using a fair degree of force.",

She had neutrophil leukocytosis (18 \u00d7 109/ml), but her liver and renal function tests were normal. The radiographs of her kidney, ureter, and bladder showed a large bladder stone with three limbs and an imprint of a typical Copper T380A IUCD (Pregna International Ltd., Mumbai, India) in the middle of the stone (Fig. ). An ultrasound scan of her kidney, ureter, and bladder confirmed the intravesical location of the stone and left-side pyelonephritis. Urine culture yielded a mixed growth of coliform and Proteus. She was managed with intravenously administered cefotaxime according to the antibacterial sensitivity report for 1 week and was continued on the nitrofurantoin until she underwent surgery.\nOn further inquiry, our patient indicated that she had an IUCD inserted 15 years previously, after the delivery of her third child.

She had a history of multiple subcutaneous abscesses in a year, all occurring after surgeries of the shoulder and forearms performed for bone fracture and impingement syndrome. For 3 months before admission she had repeated episodes of subcutaneous abscess on her left forearm, which was the site of blood collection and arterial line puncture.

In order to retrieve the IVC filter, the patient was referred to our department. He had a history of testicular cancer with para-aorta lymph node metastasis. Left renal vein thrombosis developed because of neoadjuvant chemotherapy before RPLND, and anticoagulants were administered before RPLND. Three years previously, he had undergone left orchiectomy, retro-mediastinal lymph node dissection, and RPLND at the previous hospital. The left common iliac vein was intraoperatively damaged during RPLND. Because the previous surgeon was worried about the high incidence of postoperative DVT and PTE, anticoagulant therapy was continued after RPLND. However, because DVT developed in the left common iliac vein after the initial surgery, a retrievable IVC filter (ALN, France) was placed in the IVC caudal to the renal vein to prevent PTE, and the patient had been receiving anticoagulant therapy. Because follow-up CT after IVC filter placement showed that DVT persisted at the left common iliac vein despite anticoagulant therapy, the IVC filter could not be retrieved at the previous hospital.\nEnhanced CT also revealed that DVT remained in the left common iliac vein. Because ultrasound examination showed organized DVT, an IVC filter was considered unnecessary. An endovascular approach was considered unfeasible for retrieval because two of the filter struts had penetrated the duodenal wall. An extensive discussion with an internal medicine specialist was performed. Because DVT remained with no remarkable changes in CT images for 3 years and the incidence of PTE caused by DVT in the left common iliac vein would be low, we chose surgical treatment for this patient in order to prevent bleeding at the duodenum.\nThe IVC filter was retrieved",

Although laboratory tests showed acute kidney injury, he was discharged without any further investigation.\nLaboratory tests were marked by severe hypouricemia. The elevated fractional excretion of urate (119%; N < 10%) suggested a highly increased urinary excretion of uric acid with tubular secretion. Blood and urinary tests showed no argument for Fanconi syndrome or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. Interesting enough, severe hypouricemia was also found in the laboratory tests of his mother and one of his maternal aunts. The occurrence of two episodes of acute kidney injury following intense exercise with the presence of hereditary severe hypouricemia highly suggested exercise-induced acute kidney injury due to familial renal hypouricemia.\nThis index patient (V6) is a member of a highly consanguineous Pakistani family with cousin marriages over two successive generations ().

The patient was being treated with leuprolide and denosumab at the time of admission, and his previous treatment regimen included leuprolide, bicalutamide, abiraterone, and prednisone. During the patient's hospital course, consent for discussion and report of findings related to his care was obtained from family members.\nThe patient suffered from diarrhea for two weeks prior which resolved after seven days of metronidazole; however, his diarrheal condition resurfaced and worsened when he was given additional antibiotics for suspected UTI. The family reported that in the week prior to admission the patient's mental status had slowly worsened, his lower extremities became increasingly weak which rendered him unable to walk independently, and his overall functional status deteriorated. The family reported that these represented significant decline when compared to his previous condition. Of note, at time of presentation, his measured serum PSA was 5.82 ng/mL.\nIn order to further evaluate his AMS, a CT scan of the head without contrast and a follow-up MRI scan were ordered. Although the CT scan was negative, the follow-up MRI of the brain revealed a diffuse enhancement of the meninges which was highly suggestive of LC (Fig. , ).
