However, there was a wound of approximately 20 cm on the lateral aspect of the right hip at the level of the greater trochanter, exposing the entire proximal end of the femur (Figure ).\nAfter a clinical evaluation and imaging tests that excluded cranial or abdominal disorders, we prioritized the neurovascular examination of the affected limb, which did not present complications, and the protection of the femoral head with the use of moistened gauze and saline solution. Radiographs in the anteroposterior view of the right hip showed a hip dislocation with a greater trochanter fracture (Figure ).\nAn exhaustive irrigation of the acetabular cavity and the exposed femur was performed, using 10 liters of saline solution at 9% when the patient was in the surgical room. The procedure happened under sedation and spinal anesthesia. A large debridement of muscle, fascia, and bone tissues was required to remove all the devitalized tissue, considered viable only when active bleeding and the clean appearance of the open wound was observed through direct vision by the surgeons.\nThe fractured fragment of the greater trochanter was fixed with two 6.5 mm cancellous screws and washers at the proximal end of the femur (Figure ). After a revision of the debridement sites and radioscopic control of the hip reduction and fixation, the wound was closed (Figure ).\nAfter the first 48 hours of surgery, the wound was releasing a significant amount of secretion, bloody and serum like, and a strong odor was observed, with no laboratory exams indicating infection.

The patient complained for vague postprandial abdominal pain. Physical examination was not contributory. Ultrasonography (US) revealed a 4.5 \u00d7 4 cm hypoechoic lesion in the tail of the pancreas as well as cholelithiasis.

In addition, computed tomography-angiography (CTA) showed that the tumor distorted and compressed the splenic vessels (). The level of serum CEA and CA19-9 were within the normal range. Preoperative evaluation led to the possible diagnosis of mucinous cystic neoplasm of the pancreas. The patient was subjected to laparoscopy. Intraoperatively a cystic mass of approximately 4.5 cm in diameter was found in the tail of the pancreas in addition to atrophy of the adjacent parenchyma. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and distal splenopancreatectomy was performed. Postoperative recovery of the patient was uneventful, while the drainage was removed and the patient stepped out on the second and fourth postoperative day respectively.\nDespite the preoperative diagnosis of mucinous cystadenoma the histology was consistent with a pancreatic pseudocyst, which was subsequenced to moderately differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma. Resection margins were negative, as well as perineural invasion was not present and no metastasis was found in eight peripancreatic resected lymph nodes.\nPatient underwent adjuvant chemotherapy, with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks followed by a rest week, and for 6 cycles.

Computed tomography (CT) showed hydrocephalus. He was treated with left sided ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. Rt VA shunt was left in situ. He improved and discharged.\nHe was asymptomatic until 2010, then he developed diplopia, ataxia, clubbing and CSF leak through neck wound. Examination revealed a fistulous track posterior to sternomastoid with CSF leaking on the right side.

The distal end of the proximal ventricular catheter was disconnected from the shunt chamber and connected externally to a sterile reservoir to serve as an external ventricular drainage, as we suspected shunt infection. Fistula healed promptly. Exploration was done on the right side to remove the ventricular catheter and revise the shunt. However, we found it was adherent to brain matter, and so the intracranial part was retained in situ. Distal end was not addressed due to its right atrial location, and distal end was tethered to the jugular vein. A left VP shunt revision was done. CT scan showed a reduction of ventricular size to normal following revision of left sided VP shunt.\nOn the postoperative day seven, he developed a high fever that lasted for 2 weeks, with an erythematous rash. Blood picture showed leukocytosis and elevated ESR. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed splenomegaly. CSF culture was sterile. Blood culture revealed enterococci sensitive to Vancomycin. An echocardiogram was done which showed multiple vegetations with shunt tube in right ventricle with tricuspid regurgitation [Figure \u2013]. Thus",

    "original_text": "We report the case of a 21-year-old female patient who was involved in a road traffic accident. She complained about a feeling of pressure at the inlet of the thorax and a local pressure pain projecting towards the sternoclavicular joint on the left side. Clinical examination indicated a malalignment of the left sternoclavicular joint when compared to the contralateral side with tenderness to pressure and percussion. There was no open injury, dysphagia, dyspnea or numbness of the left upper extremity and the blood pressure was normal. Radiological examination indicated a dislocation of the sternoclavicular joint. Axial CT at the clavicular level demonstrated a medial and posterior displacement of the medial end of the left clavicle and revealed a medial fracture of the clavicle [Figure and ]; plain X-ray films did not pinpoint to the fracture.\nDue to gross dislocation of the fracture, no attempt of closed reduction was made.

    "original_text": "An 18-year-old male patient presented with a history of mass and pain in the thigh. After the imaging, a biopsy was taken confirming the final diagnosis of a high-grade chondroblastic/osteoblastic osteosarcoma of the distal femur stage IIB (Figure ).\nThe patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with MAP (methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatinum), and limb salvage surgery was subsequently performed in October 2000. For the reconstruction, an osteochondral allograft fixed with a rigid stainless steel plate was selected. In the postoperative period, the extremity was immobilized with an articulated brace until some signs of union in the imaging were observed. The patient successfully completed the adjuvant chemotherapy course without evidence of recurrence or metastasis. The allograft unfortunately progressed to non-union, and after one year of the fixation (November 2001) a fracture in the plate was identified. The case was discussed and the decision was to revise the osteosynthesis. In the subsequent follow-up, weight-bearing was restricted until consolidation was achieved. During the rehabilitation process, an articulated brace in the knee was prescribed, with the association of progressive gain in quadriceps strength.\nOne year after the last surgery (November 2002), the dislocation of the extensor mechanism and posteromedial femorotibial subluxation was identified. The range of movement at this time was acceptable (10\u00b0 to 90\u00b0), and the pain was manageable; therefore, no further intervention was performed until January 2004, when the patient presented with pain. At this time, several osteoarthritic changes were observed, and for that reason the knee joint was replaced with a constrained revision implant. The results were satisfactory with early recovery in the range of movement (0\u00b0-100\u00b0), without leg length discrepancy and adequate strength to achieve gait without external aids.

    "cleaned_text": "an 18-year-old male patient presented with a history of mass and pain in the thigh. after the imaging, a biopsy was taken confirming the final diagnosis of a high-grade chondroblastic/osteoblastic osteosarcoma of the distal femur stage iib (figure ).\nthe patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with map (methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatinum), and limb salvage surgery was subsequently performed in october 2000. for the reconstruction, an osteochondral allograft fixed with a rigid stainless steel plate was selected. in the postoperative period, the extremity was immobilized with an articulated brace until some signs of union in the imaging were observed. the patient successfully completed the adjuvant chemotherapy course without evidence of recurrence or metastasis. the allograft unfortunately progressed to non-union, and after one year of the fixation (november 2001) a fracture in the plate was identified. the case was discussed and the decision was to revise the osteosynthesis. in the subsequent follow-up, weight-bearing was restricted until consolidation was achieved. during the rehabilitation process, an articulated brace in the knee was prescribed, with the association of progressive gain in quadriceps strength.\none year after the last surgery (november 2002), the dislocation of the extensor mechanism and posteromedial femorotibial subluxation was identified. the range of movement at this time was acceptable (10\u00b0 to 90\u00b0), and the pain was manageable; therefore, no further intervention was performed until january 2004, when the patient presented with pain. at this time, several osteoarthritic changes were observed, and for that reason the knee joint was replaced with a constrained revision implant. the results were satisfactory with early recovery in the range of movement (0\u00b0-100\u00b0), without leg length discrepancy and adequate strength to achieve gait without external aids. in november 2006 (two years after the last intervention), the patient presented to the clinic with sudden loss in the range of movement and with pain. new imaging identified a supracondylar fracture in the allograft",

Laboratory results were within normal limits. During an ultrasound examination of her abdomen, an anechoic lesion in her upper left abdomen was revealed. In a further investigation with computed tomography (CT), a well-defined hypodense cystic 7.08 \u00d7 6.05 cm mass with mild enhancement was noted (Fig. ).

A cystic lesion sized 7.08 \u00d7 6.05 cm appeared between the layers of small bowel mesentery (Fig. ). The cystic lesion was excised within healthy borders and sent for further pathologic examination (Fig. ). On macroscopic examination, the cyst sized 7.08 \u00d7 6.05 cm was unilocular and contained a white, milk-like viscous fluid (chylous), which was drained out by incision.

How should he be managed?\nCardiac troponin is released from damaged cardiomyocytes and is one of the most common biomarkers used in the prediction of myocardial infarction. There is considerable debate regarding the use of sex-specific reference ranges for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn), as there is uncertainty whether the use of sex-specific reference limits impact upon clinical management or outcome prediction (). However, as upper reference limits based on sex-specific 99th percentiles for hs-cTn are subtly higher for people recorded as males than those recorded females in population studies (), use of sex-specific cutoffs for hs-cTn assays have been endorsed by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (). The difference has been attributed to people presumed male at birth having a larger cardiac mass as well as subclinical coronary artery disease (). No studies have been performed to examine cardiac mass changes that may occur with masculinizing hormone therapy in people presumed female at birth. There are however data in polycystic ovary syndrome in which high testosterone concentrations are a clinical feature (albeit far lower than testosterone concentrations seen in transgender men).

Large population-based studies have also shown that left ventricular mass correlates with body weight, lean body mass, and fat mass ().

When the dry cough developed, she saw her family physician and was prescribed dihydrocodeine. Her symptoms did not improve, and she took the following medications sequentially: clarithromycin, pranlukast, and one-month rabeprazole, all of which did not alleviate her cough.

She had a chief complaint of restoring her oral function and esthetics after series of plastic skin graft procedure done. During the extra oral examination it was noted that the elasticity of muscle and skin tissue around oral angular area was lost due to scars from burns and tissue grafting, which resulted in limited maximum mouth opening of 20 mm. Therefore, proper prosthodontic treatment was impossible on the right quadrants of the mouth (). The intraoral examination showed that all of maxillary teeth were missing except tooth number #25 and splinted gold crowns on #34 and #35, whereas fixed partial denture on #33 to #43 were present on the mandible.\nIn order to restore the patient's masticatory function, prosthodontic treatment plan of using 4 implants on the left quadrants was established. Each of two implants were placed on upper and lower posterior left jaws, however no implant on anterior ridge were possible due to severe atrophy of the maxilla. Anterior cantilever type removable partial denture was planned to meet patient's esthetic demand, which consists of a telescopic crown abutment on #25 and two implant supported abutments on area of #26 and #27 in the maxillary area (). On the mandible, Implant-supported fixed partial denture on area of #36 and #37 was planned.\nThe implants (Strauman\u00ae Basel, Switzerland) (\u03d54.8\u00d710 mm) were placed on predetermined area accompanied with sinus lift ridge augmentation procedure and proper follow up was performed during the 6 month healing period of time.

An urgent computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain had been arranged, and a massive pituitary adenoma with hemorrhage was observed, and admission to the neurosurgical department immediately followed. When arriving at the hospital the hemodynamic parameters were stable (BP 130/90, 65 BPM); Glasgow coma score was 14/15. Her medical history included chronic renal failure (III\u00b0) as well as cardiovascular disease with hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, coronary heart disease with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and stent. Therefore, dual oral anticoagulation with clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid was administered. Multiple electrode aggregometry did not detect effects of both anticoagulants. The neuro-ophthalmic examination revealed no perception of light in both eyes. Fundoscopy was normal without pallor of the optic nerves, no meningeal signs, and no overt clinical signs of hormone imbalance, but the measured pituitary hormone profile had a slight elevated prolactin level and suppression of sex hormones and thyroid profile (Table ). The blood tests revealed normal electrolytes and infection parameters. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a large 22 mm x 18 mm x 15 mm enhancing hemorrhagic pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension and compression of the optic chiasm (Figure ). Emergency surgery was indicated. A transsphenoidal approach was carried out under general anesthesia. The pituitary tumor was identified, though it was not characteristic of a hemorrhagic pituitary macroadenoma. The tumor was tough and yellow colored, and debulking with a sharp curettage was difficult. Acute hemorrhage ceased after resection of tumor. Dopamine agonist was not used due to the patient experiencing complete blindness. After decompression, the surgery was concluded.

During the operation she received a blood transfusion and was infected with hepatits C. Today she has cirrhosis with liver failure (Child-Pugh classification C). Without any trauma she felt a sudden pain in her lower back with paraesthesis in both her legs but no other neurological symptoms. A computed tomography (CT) scan (Figure ) and X-ray (Figures , ) showed a bilateral pedicle fracture of L3. We first performed a dorsal instrumentation L1-5 and a posterolateral spondylodesis. She had massive intraoperative bleeding and a very bad quality of the bone. Due to the bad quality of the bone we were not able to place the pedicle screws in L1 bilaterally. She needed a perioperative mass transfusion of fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), PPSB and erythrocyte concentrates which is why we were not able to perform a ventral augmentation in one session as originally planed. Postoperatively the liver function decompensated and the patient needed to stay in the intensive care unit for ten days and had a notably extended rehabilitation. Although she was carefully mobilized with a corset she developed a progressive thoracolumbar kyphosis with a looming cutting-out of the pedicle screw in L1 (Figures , ). We needed to perform an additional ventral augmentation T11-L3 with the same problems that occurred during the first operation with another mass transfusion of blood products. After the second operation the patient developed a hepatorenal syndrome and needed to stay in the intensive care unit for 28 days and another month in the rehabilitation unit.

She described chest tightness while exercising on a bicycle after 10 minutes. The next day she developed a severe hacking cough at work during a conference call. The cough was associated with disorientation and severe chest tightness. This prompted her to present to the emergency department in February 2018. The patient is a pharmacist, nonsmoker, and denies illicit drug use or recent travel. She had endometrial laser ablation with myomectomy in 2006. Hormonal contraceptives have been used since 2004 and were stopped three months before presentation in hopes of conception. Her last menstrual period was four days before the onset of symptoms. On physical examination, she had chest tightness localizing to the right side and decreased right sided breath sounds. All the routine laboratory work and vital signs were normal.

At the age of 65 he was diagnosed with a cancer in the sigmoid-rectum (pT3 pN1a adenocarcinoma) and underwent laparoscopic left hemicolectomy. Two days after the intervention, stump dehiscence required further laparotomic surgery. The clinical course was then complicated by bowel obstruction and sclerosing peritonitis which had to be surgically treated 20 and 32 days after the first surgery. During the latter procedure, the microbiological analysis of the surgical wound indicated the presence of a MRSA, and intravenous meropenem 3g/day was started. On day 35 since the first intervention, another surgery was needed because of the development of hemoperitoneum. The patient received repeated transfusions because of the worsening anemia.

Prior to this, he was usually independently mobile. He had been commenced on 20 mg atorvastatin 1 year prior to his admission and this was stopped 10 months later. Despite this, there was no improvement in his symptoms. The patient reported having difficulty standing from sitting. Initial assessment revealed 4/5 muscle strength proximally in all four limbs on the Medical Research Council scale for muscle strength. Power elsewhere and remaining physical examination was unremarkable. Initial investigations revealed an elevated CK at 8223 IU/L (normal 30-200) in the context of normal renal function. Subsequent electromyography (EMG) demonstrated features suggestive of proximal and distal myopathy with evidence of active denervation. MRI thighs confirmed active inflammation in the proximal muscle groups. A CT thorax, abdomen, and pelvis (requested as part of a screen for any neoplastic cause driving the myopathy) showed only a nonspecific thickening of the gastric fundus with a subsequent OGD identifying a benign lipoma with normal histology.\nTo investigate the nature of the patient's apparent myopathy, a muscle biopsy was arranged and confirmed features of a necrotizing myositis (Figure ). Meanwhile, a myositis-specific antibody panel was normal except for strongly positive HMGCoA antibodies 150.7 CU (normal 0-20). Altogether, this confirmed the diagnosis of statin-induced autoimmune necrotizing myositis (SIANM).\nThe patient was commenced IV methylprednisolone 1 gm over 3 consecutive days and then 60 mg oral prednisolone. Despite this, he deteriorated rapidly over the subsequent days with progressive weakness now involving distal muscle groups and dysphonia.

Her previous two pregnancies were uncomplicated. The fetal sonogram showed a 10 by 8 cm mass on the right side of the neck, which was not present in detailed scans taken at 14 and 22 weeks. The mass was composed of a cystic portion and a solid portion containing blood vessels and was growing rapidly in subsequent ultrasound studies. A significant polyhydramnios with amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 50 suggested an upper gastrointestinal obstruction and a highly possible airway obstruction as well. Findings were confirmed by fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In anticipation of the difficulty in establishing a secured airway at birth and the potential complicated resection of the giant tumor after birth, the mother was referred to our hospital for consultation.\nThe parents were in consultation with the maternal fetal team, neonatologist, anesthesiologist, pediatric surgeon, and otolaryngologist.

Her medical history was notable for childbirth three months earlier via vaginal delivery without immediate complications. Epidural anesthesia was used for pain control during labor. Of note, no accidental dural puncture was suspected at the time of procedure, and cerebrospinal fluid leak was not observed at the procedure site. Six weeks following delivery, she began to experience intermittent occipital headaches. The headaches did not appear to be postural in nature, and she had no similar episodes in the past. After developing dizziness and diplopia, she was evaluated by a neuro-ophthalmologist and an MRI was obtained. She was diagnosed with a Chiari I malformation and CN VI palsy. Additionally, MRV did not demonstrate any evidence of venous sinus thrombosis. An eye patch provided temporary relief of diplopia, and she was referred to a general neurosurgery clinic for further evaluation. One week later, her neurologic exam was significant for the progression of her symptoms, a left CN VI palsy, and near-complete ptosis of the left eye which suggested a new CN III injury. She demonstrated no overt pupillary dysfunction, did not demonstrate papilledema, her remaining cranial nerves were intact, and her strength and sensory function were not affected.\nHer MRI revealed a Chiari type I malformation with approximately 5-6 mm of tonsillar herniation and no upper cervical syrinx (Figure ). The post-contrast MRI sequences revealed enhancement of the convexity dura, which can signify negative intracranial pressure, but did not demonstrate evidence of pituitary hyperemia, generalized brain sag, or subdural effusions (Figure ).

Because of renal colic at that age, he had an ultrasound scan in which bilateral moderate hydronephrosis and thickening of the bladder walls were observed. However, no further investigation or treatment of these symptoms was performed. Five years ago, the patient was urgently admitted because of urinary retention. Severe bilateral ureterohydronephrosis appeared on the ultrasound scan.

Although he had a strong voiding sensation with 500 mL, there was no increase in detrusor pressure suggesting urination, and the patient was unable to void and thus undergo a uroflowmetry test.

The patient reported to be operated for anal fistula 10 years ago with satisfactory clinical evolution. His family history was unremarkable and no smoking or chronic alcoholism were noticed. In the proctologic (knee-chest) position, physical examination revealed a 4\u20135 cm, soft and painless mass in the left perineal area. This mass seemed freely mobile with lower edge extending to the pectinate line but the upper limit was not perceived. No inflammatory signs, fistulous tracts or postanal skin dimple were observed. The mucosa was normal on digital rectal examination and exterior pressure was detected in the posterior region.\nAbdominal ultrasound detected a hypoechoic solid pelvic mass with regular contours and heterogeneous echostructure, but relationship with the surrounding structures was not clear. On computed tomography (CT) scan the lesion appeared as a large heterogeneous mass measuring approximately 7 cm in diameter. This mass, developed in the latero-rectal space, extended to the left side of the pelvis causing displacement and compression of the rectum and urinary bladder. There was no pelvic effusion, deep lymph nodes or bone destruction (Fig. ). Additionally, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of a 7 cm \u00d7 7 cm well-limited lesion in continuity with the left rectal wall and extending from the fourth sacral vertebra (S4) level to the coccygeal region. The lesion had low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and heterogeneous high signal intensity on T2-weighted images without any signs of bladder invasion or any evident communication with the lumen of the rectum (Fig. ).

She had only a history of hypertension and took medication regularly. Preoperative examinations, including white blood cell count, platelet count, coagulation system and electrocardiogram (ECG), were all normal. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) showed a 3.1 \u00d7 3.5 cm hypoechoic, well-defined mass at the junction of the antrum and body of the stomach on the greater curvature, originating in the muscularis propria layer. The pathology of biopsy specimens included a large number of red blood cells, a small number of spindle cells and proliferative epithelial cells, which did not rule out the possibility of neurogenic cells; severe chronic inflammation of the mucosa with a lymphoproliferative aspect was also detected. After discussion with the patient and her relatives, endoscopic resection was conducted, and written informed consent was obtained from the patient before the operation.\nBefore the procedure, the patient\u2019s vital signs were normal. Mechanical ventilation (volume controlled and FiO2 was 50%) was performed after induction of general anesthesia; anesthesia was maintained with propofol and remifentanil. Based on gastroscopy, there was a protuberant lesion with a size of approximately 3.1 \u00d7 3.5 cm, with a central depression and soft touch (Fig. a). A lesion mass was seen after mucosal incision with a dual knife. When the submucosal mass was stripped, it was found to be closely adhered to the muscular layer and serosa layer, and a full-thickness incision was performed. The gastric perforation is shown in Fig. b. The abdominal cavity was gradually filled with carbon dioxide gas, and the peak airway pressure gradually increased to 30\u201335 cm H2O.

She initially complained of epigastric pain and nausea; she also reported substernal chest discomfort that became progressively more prominent. She had no coronary atherosclerotic risk factors and did not use oral contraceptives. She had stable vital signs; physical examination was notable only for abrasions of the chest wall. An ECG revealed sinus bradycardia at 56 beats/min with ST segment elevation in leads V1, V2, and aVL and ST segment depressions in leads II, III, aVF, V5, and V6 (). CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis disclosed a small left pneumothorax, focal myocardial hypoattenuation suggesting the possibility of cardiac contusion, and soft tissue attenuation of the subhepatic porta hepatis indicating hemorrhage. An echocardiogram demonstrated severe hypokinesis of the mid and distal anteroseptal segments and the apex, with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%. The aortic root was without evidence of dissection; there was no pericardial fluid or aortic valvular insufficiency. Because of the ECG and echo findings, emergent cardiac catheterization was performed. Coronary angiography via the right radial artery disclosed a total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery 2 mm from its origin (). All other epicardial vessels appeared to be normal. Antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapies with aspirin, clopidogrel, and bivalirudin were administered. A coronary wire was passed to the distal LAD, and balloon dilation with an undersized 2.5 mm balloon was performed, restoring normal antegrade flow. IVUS was then performed.

The patient had a 6-month history of a mass over the right posteromedial aspect of the proximal tibia. Physical examination revealed a 3 cm\u00d71 cm, soft, non-tender mass at the posteromedial aspect of the right proximal tibia, and the mass was freely mobile and easily compressed. Another mass was found at the posterior aspect of the right proximal tibia. He had pulmonary tuberculosis when he was 30 years old, for which he was treated and believed to have been cured. He also had the history of lobectomy because of a lung cancer in the left lower lobe at the age of 47 years and received a total gastrectomy due to an advanced gastric cancer at the age of 71 years.\nRoutine laboratory test results were unremarkable, and no eosinophilia was noted. Plain radiographs of the right leg revealed multiple calcifications extending from the medial part of the knee to the calf. Ultrasonography revealed a heterogeneous, hyperechoic mass with a hypoechoic tubular lesion in the gastrocnemius muscle (), and MRI revealed multiple tubular and cystic lesions in the gastrocnemius muscle.

Past medical history was significant for hyperlipidemia and osteoarthritis. Baseline metabolic equivalents were greater than four. Aside from a cataract extraction, the patient had no other operations. He denied any allergies. Prior to presentation, the patient was on Aspirin 81 mg daily for cardiovascular disease prevention and Atorvastatin 20 mg daily for hyperlipidemia. Computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed an acute, comminuted, and displaced fracture of the right acetabulum involving both posterior and anterior acetabular walls. The right femoral head was superiorly and laterally displaced with impaction fracture to its inferior and medial aspects. There were bone fragments within the right gluteus musculature, and the high attenuation in tissue density represented blood product within. Prior to surgery, the orthopedic team made an effort to reduce the patient's right acetabulum fracture with tibial traction pin under conscious sedation with midazolam, fentanyl, and ketamine in the emergency department. During the closed reduction, the patient experienced a brief period of respiratory depression. For approximately two minutes, his oxygen saturation was 85-86%, which improved to 95% with Narcan reversal. The emergency department record also noted that the patient had premature ventricular contractions on the electrocardiogram (EKG) at this time. After the closed reduction, the orthopedic team opted to monitor the patient on continuous telemetry for 24 hours and take the patient for open reduction and internal fixation of the right acetabulum the next day. He was not on prophylactic anticoagulation for this preoperative period.\nPrior to entering the operating room, the patient's vital signs were stable: blood pressure 120/64, heart rate 73 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 per minute, oxygen saturation 95%, and temperature 98.6 Fahrenheit.

The pain was gradual in onset and associated with nausea and one episode of vomiting. She had no urinary symptoms, and her last menstrual period had finished the previous day. She had no surgical history, and her medical history was significant only for viral meningitis two years previously. She denied any history of sexually transmitted disease or recent urinary tract infection. She was not taking regular medications and had no allergies. On examination, her vital signs were normal except for mild pyrexia of 37.4 \u00b0C. Examination of the abdomen revealed a tender mass in the right iliac fossa.\nLaboratory investigations included a white cell count of 10,500 cells/mm, hemoglobin of 13.3 g/dl, and platelets of 212,000/mm. Urea and electrolytes were within normal ranges. Urine analysis was negative for leucocytes and urinary \u03b2HCG was negative.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was requested and showed a 10.4 \u00d7 4.5 \u00d7 3.8 cm loculated cystic mass in the right pelvis that appeared to contain the tip of the appendix (Figure ). The patient remained febrile. Clinically, we made a working diagnosis of an appendix mass but considered a tubo-ovarian abscess as a differential. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics, and radiological drainage of the abscess was arranged. An ultrasound-guided drain was placed in the largest locule via the right iliac fossa. Unusually, 30 ml of serous fluid but no pus was aspirated. The drain was removed after three days with no further output. Drained fluid was sent for culture, and peripheral blood cultures showed no growth after 72 hours of incubation. After five days, intravenous antibiotics the patient was clinically well.

Three years ago, the patient was found to have a mass on the left femur. Biopsy revealed poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of unknown primary. He had undergone surgical resection of the left femoral tumor and above-knee amputation with adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin and etoposide) and radiation therapy. Routine surveillance imaging showed no evidence of malignancy. Chest computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen/pelvis with contrast were performed at three-month intervals for the first year followed by six-month intervals. The patient was in clinical remission for the last two years.\nOn physical exam, his blood pressure was 119/76 mmHg, heart rate was 104 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and jugular venous pressure was elevated. Grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur was present at the left sternal border and rales at the lung bases. Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large mass measuring 8.10 X 6.54 cm within the right ventricle causing right ventricular outflow obstruction, and the left ventricular ejection fraction was 60-65% (Figure ). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the mass extending from the right ventricular free wall with compression of the left ventricle and dilated right atrium (Figure ). A positron emission tomographic/computed tomographic scan showed increased standardized uptake value activity of 9.3 in the right ventricular mass (Figure ). Cardiac biopsy of the right ventricular mass was consistent with metastatic neuroendocrine tumor (Figure ). The tumor cells were negative for synaptophysin and chromogranin A but positive for CDX2, a marker for neuroendocrine tumor of unknown primary []. In view of the tumor that caused impairment in the right ventricular filling and congestive heart failure (CHF), the patient received chemotherapy (doxorubicin and",
