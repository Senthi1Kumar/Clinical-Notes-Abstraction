He was treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt and postoperative radiotherapy. In February 2011, he enrolled in our hospital due to dysfunction of the lower extremities. Contrast-enhanced MRI examination showed two large cysts in the bilateral cerebellum. Visible nodules with enhanced signals were found in the one cyst with a smaller size. Additionally, multiple nodular abnormalities were also found in the left cerebellum. Adjacent brain sulci were changed or disappeared due to enhanced pressure. The fourth ventricle showed unclear borders from the surrounding structures. Cerebellar tumour resection was performed, and pathologic analysis showed hemangioblastoma in the cerebellum (Fig. ). On October 30, 2014, an enhanced CT examination showed that multiple renal cysts occurred in both kidneys with unclear borders, and the arterial phase was significantly enhanced with uneven density. The largest cyst was located in the left kidney, and its size was approximately 5.8 cm \u00d7 7.9 cm. Both kidneys showed low signal density due to multiple cystic lesions but partial calcification (Fig. ). Multiple round water-like density shadows were observed in liver cirrhosis, with sharp edges but no enhancements. Considering the complications of kidney cancer, polycystic kidney disease and multiple liver cysts, the subject did not undergo further examination but underwent symptomatic treatments after discharge. In August 2017, the subject was enrolled in our hospital again due to dizziness and severe weight loss.

His past medical history was noteworthy for a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy for which he underwent a heart transplant ten years prior to presentation. He had a history of osteoarthritis for which he had undergone bilateral hip replacements complicated by a left prosthetic hip infection with Cutibacterium acnes. His past history was also positive for rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes.\nThe first stage of his left hip revision after his first episode of prosthetic joint infection with C. acnes occurred pre-heart transplantation and he was treated with 6 weeks of vancomycin following hardware explantation. His second-stage hip revision occurred over a year later, following his heart transplant. His post-transplant course was otherwise uncomplicated, without any episodes of graft dysfunction, rejection, or infectious complications over the previous nine years. He was maintained on tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil since his transplant without recent corticosteroid exposure.\nWith regard to his present symptoms, along with the pain, he noted occasional night sweats. He reported receiving 2 hip injections for the pain (one into his hip joint and another into his trochanteric bursa, both on his left side) by his outpatient orthopedic doctor about 2 weeks prior to presentation that provided temporary relief. Sterile precautions were reportedly observed during in-clinic procedures. Following the injections, the patient noticed a progressive fluctuant area swelling of his left lateral thigh and hip. Aspiration of that area 4 days prior by his outpatient orthopedist yielded purulent-appearing fluid that was Gram stain negative for organisms, with no growth seen either on aerobic or anaerobic cultures. Three days prior to admission, he underwent hip arthrocentesis that showed cloudy fluid with 65,000 white blood cells per microliter and a differential of 95% polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Gram stain was negative, and no crystals were seen. Culture of the synovial fluid was later finalized as no growth. However, prosthetic joint infection was suspected",

After the swelling subsided, he underwent right tibia fracture intramedullary internal fixation. Two weeks after the operation, the patient was able to walk with double crutches without load, and was able to walk without crutches and with some load 3 months after the operation. However, the patient complained of pain in his right lower extremity, especially when moving downhill or down stairs, and experienced a limping gait and obvious tenderness at the fracture end. Three years after originally presenting at Lhasa Hospital, the patient was experiencing persistent pain in the right lower extremity, and his daily activities were severely affected. Thus, he was re-diagnosed with nonunion of the right tibial fracture after internal fixation (Fig. ). The main causes of the nonunion of the fracture were considered to be the excessively thin intramedullary nails and unstable fixation of the fracture. The operation was repeated with replacement of the crude intramedullary nails and grafting of iliac bone (Fig. ). Three months after the operation, the tibial fracture had failed to heal, and further surgical treatment was performed. The proximal locking screw of the intramedullary nail was removed with an expectation to eliminate the stress shielding effect and to promote fracture healing by increasing the microdynamic force while retaining the static interlocking nail. Five months after the operation, the patient abandoned the crutches and was able to walk with a heavy load. Nevertheless, 2 years after the operation, active pain of the right leg persisted with some tenderness around the fracture, especially when moving downhill or down stairs.

He was also a heavy smoker and had a history of stroke. He was initially sent to the local medical department where a computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed pulmonary embolism with a massive thrombus straddling both the pulmonary arteries and aortoiliac artery occlusion with poor collateral recanalization to the lower limb arteries (Fig. ). He was immediately transferred to our center with symptoms of mild orthopnea and resting pain. In addition, cyanosis of the affected limbs was noted, and muscle strength in both the limbs regressed to grade 1. Since enoxaparin was given before transfer and echocardiography did not reveal right ventricle failure, he underwent an emergency thrombectomy for the aortoiliac artery occlusion. After the first operation to salvage the limbs, he was admitted to the intensive care unit for further treatment. On postoperative day 5, the general condition of both the legs improved, with the muscle strength improving to grade 4. He was then transferred to the general ward, and DAPT and enoxaparin were continued to be administered. Owing to the persistence of orthopnea and complaint of chest tightness with intermittent tachycardia, a CTA was performed again to further evaluate the pulmonary embolism on postoperative day 8 (Fig. ). The CTA results revealed that the thrombus was still lodged in the bilateral main pulmonary arteries. Fearing the possibility of a myocardial infarction, cardiac catheterization was performed, which did not reveal any intrastent restenosis or specific lesions in the coronary arteries.

She was initially treated conservatively with rest and analgesics over the course of several months. However, her symptoms gradually worsened and began to include nonspecific mental status changes such as forgetfulness, daytime somnolence and postural imbalance. She eventually sought care at a local emergency department where her review of symptoms at the time was negative for any cardiac or respiratory involvement. Physical examination revealed no abnormal findings in the chest on auscultation. During the course of her evaluation a magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed two brain lesions, one in the right frontal lobe measuring 2\u00d71.7 cm with extensive edema and another in the left parietal lobe measuring 0.8\u00d70.6 cm on the axial T1-weighted images (, yellow and red arrow, respectively). She underwent a stereotactic biopsy of the right frontal lobe lesion that revealed a spindle cell sarcoma with highgrade features of necrosis, increased mitoses, and nuclear pleomorphism.\nSubsequent staging computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were not able to identify a primary tumor site. However, a PET scan revealed a FDG-avid in the left atrium. Further evaluation with a transesophageal echocardiogram showed a 2.5\u00d71.8 cm left atrial mass at the base of the posterior mitral valve leaflet with mobile fronds (, yellow circle). An MRI of the chest further demonstrated that this mass was irregular and extended into the appendage and down the anterolateral mitral annulus without interfering with mitral valve function. Shortly thereafter, she underwent stereotactic radiosurgery for the two cerebral metastases present that was later followed by an excision of the left atrial mass with a pericardial patch reconstruction of the atrium and pulmonary veins.

When paramedics arrived, it appeared he had been in that position for some time, as he had been incontinent of both bowel and bladder. He was found to be non-verbal, responsive only to painful stimuli, and was able to move all extremities, giving him a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of eight. Medical history obtained from the friend who called emergency services was largely incomplete but was positive for diabetes mellitus. The patient had no reported history of stroke. Upon arrival to the emergency department, the patient began to seize with right gaze deviation. Lorazepam was administered to control the seizure and an emergent intubation was performed to protect his airway. The patient was afebrile, and vital signs were within normal limits throughout the course of presentation and treatment. On physical exam, there was a mild left facial droop with 3 mm pupils that were equal and reactive to light. The rest of his exam was non-focal. Laboratory results demonstrated a leukocytosis of 20,720 per cubic millimeter of blood and mild electrolyte disturbances.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan performed in the emergency department showed a crescent-shaped hemorrhage with midline shift consistent with a subdural hemorrhage (Figure ). The CT was read by the radiologist as, \u201cSubacute left subdural hematoma, 1.4 cm in width with midline shift from left to right of 0.7 cm.

He reported having perceived lower abdominal pain 7 months before the initial examination, but it spontaneously remitted. The patient had no fever nor any history of conditions such as hypertension. A blood test revealed that he did not have anemia, thrombocytopenia, or coagulation abnormalities. The patient demonstrated slightly elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (4.7 ng/ml) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (603 U/ml), tumor markers that are elevated in gastrointestinal cancers and malignant lymphoma. Contrast-enhanced CT showed a 33\u00d7 31 mm abdominal aortic aneurysm and a 106 \u00d7 81 mm mass peripheral to the abdominal aorta. The mass did not feature a contrast effect, and its margin was enhanced in the venous phase (Fig. ). Sigmoid wall thickening and inferior vena cava thrombosis were also observed (Fig. ). We suspected the patient had a neoplastic disease, such as a malignant lymphoma or sigmoid colon cancer. Detailed examinations were consequently performed, and direct oral anticoagulant therapy was initiated to treat the inferior vena cava thrombosis.\nThe FDG-PET revealed an abnormal accumulation of FDG in the margin of the mass and the sigmoid colon, but not in any other organs. Colonoscopy showed only mild inflammation in the sigmoid colon, and a sigmoid colon biopsy revealed no significant findings. Chronic inflamed fibrous connective tissue was harvested from the periaortic mass using CT-guided biopsy. There were no findings indicative of infection or neoplastic disease, thus precluding a pathological diagnosis.\nAt 1 month after the initial examination, intermittent claudication occurred, prompting the performance of follow-up contrast-enhanced CT scanning.

Physical examination was unremarkable.\nIn the past month before admission, she had received 3 courses of oral antibiotics with no resolution of fever. She was worked up extensively for pyrexia of unknown origin. Blood, urine, fungal, sputum AFB cultures, autoimmune and hepatitis viral screens were negative. Syphillic markers were negative. There was no evidence of a malignancy. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis were normal.\nA transthoracic echocardiogram showed a severely dilated ascending aorta with an end diastolic diameter of 5.8 cm. There were no valvular vegetations. A contrast enhanced computed tomography aortogram revealed a large eccentric, cresenteric thrombus at the anterior aspect of the ascending aorta with two large ulcerations in its anterolateral aspects as a result of a chronic type A aortic dissection (Figures and ).\nIntra-operative findings showed a chronic Type A dissection with a large 3 cm tear involving the anterior and anterolateral aspects of the ascending aorta. There were large amounts of intramural thrombus extending from the aortic root to the origin of the innominate artery. The aortic valve and coronary ostia were not involved.

His family doctor prescribed paracetamol, but there was no relief of the pain. Therefore, he visited the emergency department where shoulder and upper arm radiographs show no fractures. However, an orthopedist recommended dressing and immobilization of the arm for 2 weeks. Ten days later, because of constant and persistent pain, the family doctor requested some laboratory tests. A blood cell count, levels of C-reactive protein, creatine-phosphokinase, and lactate dehydrogenase, urinalysis, and culture of a pharyngeal sample were normal. When the orthopedist removed the dressing, the boy presented with considerable weakness in the upper arm. The family doctor then recommended a pediatric rheumatological examination. There was pain to acupressure in the low cervical area with insertion and along the ridge of the right biceps with strength deficit of this muscle. This specialist doctor prescribed ex-juvantibus therapy with gabapentin 300 mg three times a day for 3 weeks as a neuroprotective action.

The patient was undergoing a hypercoagulation workup at the time for a renal transplant, and his warfarin had been discontinued six days earlier. The patient also reported a new left shoulder pain radiating down his left upper extremity beginning the evening preceding the acute testicular pain. Scrotal ultrasound with color Doppler showed poor blood flow within the left testicle, and bowel or fat was noted superior to the left testicle; see . The patient was taken to surgery for a scrotal exploration which revealed an ischemic left testicle and no evidence of testicular torsion. The left testicle was wrapped in a warm saline soaked laparotomy pad, while the contralateral side was explored. The right testicle and cord structures were normal, and a 3-point orchidopexy was performed. Attention was returned to the left testicle, and a small incision of the tunica albuginea revealed protrusion of hemorrhagic seminiferous tubules.

She reported concerns regarding her weight gain of 70 pounds over the last six months. She stated that she is an active person and believed her weight gain was primarily due to fluid retention. She received laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding in 2003, followed by an abdominoplasty in 2016. She reported she was doing well and lost a significant amount of weight after her surgeries until six months prior to presentation. She consulted her surgeon and endocrinologist, both of whom reassured her that her gastric band was intact without any complications. Since August of 2018, she has been taking furosemide 20 mg by mouth, once daily along with spironolactone 25 mg by mouth once daily. The patient has not found any significant improvement with these medications and reported oliguria. She denied any prior history of diabetes, hypertension, or kidney stones.\nHer past medical history was significant for chronic idiopathic abdominal pain, varicose veins, and edema. Her surgical history begins in 1978 for a tonsillectomy, laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and cholecystectomy in 2003, a bariatric bypass in 2009, a colonoscopy in 2013 followed by an abdominoplasty in 2016, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy in 2018. Her family history is only significant for unspecified cancer in her father. The patient reports an allergy to latex and denies alcohol or tobacco use. She admits to smoking cannabis on rare social occasions. Her laboratory results and vital signs were unremarkable. However, her BMI was 33.39 kg/m2 as she was 68 inches tall and weighed 219 pounds.\nShe was referred to the Hypertension and Nephrology Clinic to assess whether her edema was due to any renal abnormalities or conditions.

The tumor, about 3 cm in diameter, was located on the right side of the lower rectum 3 cm above the anal verge. The pathological analysis of the biopsy sample revealed that the tumor was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that the rectal cancer invaded into the muscularis propria without distant metastases and that lateral pelvic lymph node (LPLN) was not enlarged with a maximum long-axis diameter <3 mm. The most important problem was that the patient had a huge benign prostatic hypertrophy, the size of which was 85 \u00d7 80 \u00d7 70 mm (Fig. a\u2013c). To achieve complete TME with negative CRM, a hybrid transabdominal-transanal approach for ISR was conducted.\nFirst, vascular division and mobilization of the left colon were performed laparoscopically. The transabdominal approach was continued until the anterior dissection of the rectum became difficult due to a huge prostatic hypertrophy. Next, the circumferential rectal incision and subsequent intersphincteric dissection were performed under direct vision to enable attachment of a single port device (GelPoint Mini; Applied Medical). After closure of the anal orifice, the GelPoint Mini was placed to start the transanal approach. Posterior side of the rectum was first dissected until the transanal approach was connected to the dissection layer made by the transabdominal approach. The dissection procedure was extended to the lateral side. Bilateral pelvic splanchnic nerves were identified at the 5 and 7 o\u2019clock positions. At the anterior side, the proper dissection layer cannot be easily identified because of the perineal body and the enlarged prostate. Once the dissection plane between the rectum and the prostate could be identified, it was relatively easy to continue along the same plane. The assistance provided by the laparoscopic approach was useful to determine the appropriate dissection line in the transanal approach.",

The patient was receiving warfarin as an anticoagulative measure, having previously suffered a stroke. An examination of the nasal cavity was not possible at the emergency room due to the severity of bleeding. Nasal packing was applied to staunch the bleeding. Two days later, when the nasal packing was removed and endoscopic examination performed, a mass in the middle meatus and bulging of the medial wall of the maxillary sinus were observed ().

In addition, the skin and soft tissues adjacent to the areas invaded by PAAG became harder and formed numerous hard lumps, especially in the breasts. However, she reported no fever, pain or discomfort. Due to shame and fear, she did not seek medical advice for 15 years. In 2015, she learnt through the Internet of the dangers associated with PAAG and sought medical advice from a physician in November, 2015. She was then hospitalized in the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Plastic Surgery Hospital. Chest and abdomen MRI T2-weighted sequence images showed the presence of PAAG gel in many places, including the chest and abdomen wall (Fig. ). In the chest, it was present in subcutaneous tissue and breast gland. Needle biopsy requested by her excluded the possibility of malignant lesions, scleroderma or granuloma. The patient refused to be operated because of high surgical cost, and complications, especially delayed wound healing.\nDuring the subsequent four years, she experienced gradual deterioration of breast contracture and chest tightness accompanied with mild breathing difficulties.

There were no other injuries, and the distal neurovascular function was intact.\nAfter stabilization of the patient, he was taken up for surgery after 24 hours of admission (46 hours of injury). Through a lateral surgical approach (incorporating the existing wounds), the wounds were debrided, intercondylar fracture was stabilized with K wires and lag screws, and the distal femur fracture was stabilized with a locking plate.

Wound was closed on a negative suction drain. The patient was put on gentamicin and cefoperazone/sulbactum. One week later, the wound was apparently healthy, so the patient underwent bone grafting at the fracture site. Intraoperatively, fluid and tissue from the fracture site were sent for culture, which came out to be sterile.\nOn the third day of the second surgery, the wound showed seropurulent discharge which on culture/sensitivity yielded pure growth of multidrug resistant K. pneumoniae. Since the organism was highly resistant, the patient was put on amikacin (1 g once daily), high-dose imipenem (1 g 8-hourly as infusion in normal saline over 2 h), and rifampicin (600 mg once daily). A repeat pus culture after 2 days again revealed the same organism. A decision for wound debridement and removal of bone graft was made and performed which resulted in healing of the wound.

A contrast enhanced CT abdomen and pelvis was obtained, demonstrating multiple fluid-filled, dilated small bowel loops in the right abdomen, which were predominantly anterolateral to the ascending colon and cecum ().

    "original_text": "A healthy 36-year-old man sustained a close-range, low-velocity gunshot wound during an assault. The bullet length was 1.5 cm []. The patient was initially examined by the trauma team in the emergency room for a gunshot wound to the lower abdomen. The patient was hemodynamically unstable. The entrance wound was located in the left lower quadrant area but no identifiable exit wound was seen. Initial radiologic studies showed that the bullet was embedded in the acetabulum and possibly also intra-articularly []. The patient had a tense abdomen and there was a frank blood from the Foly catheter. He was immediately taken to the operating room and subsequently underwent a trauma laparotomy with small bowel repair, large bowel resection, primary anastomosis, and bladder repair with insertion of a suprapubic catheter. The major bullet fragment was not visible during pelvic exploration. Post-operatively, intravenous antibiotics were administered. The Department of Orthopedics was consulted for a retained intra-articular bullet fragment shown on a computed tomography (CT) scan [], which was done because of ongoing low hemoglobin despite frequent blood transfusion. Physical examination revealed an intact soft tissue envelope around the hip and pelvis with an entrance wound as noted in the left suprapubic area. Neurologic status was intact. The patient did have some moderate hip pain with a range of motion but was able to perform a straight leg raise with the involved extremity, with only slight discomfort.

On admittance, physical examination revealed no irregularities apart from a solid palpable mass in the cervix. A pre-operative imaging was performed, in this case an ultrasound examination, using a transvaginal probe, that confirmed the presence of a 5.5 cm polyp that expanded the cervix. Moreover, the patient suffered from stage 2 arterial hypertension and class 3 obesity (BMI = 40), and had undergone a single surgery in the past, an open appendectomy. Her mother suffered from a neoplasm (most likely pancreatic cancer); there were no other diseases in the family history.\nThe patient underwent a surgical procedure of excising the polyp at its peduncle using a LEEP loop electrode.

She was referred for bilateral mammograms and sonograms which revealed a 4.2 \u00d7 2.2 \u00d7 3.2 cm irregular right breast mass and 1.3 \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 0.8 cm left breast mass, highly suspicious for malignancy. She underwent ultrasound-guided core biopsies of both lesions which showed infiltrative, poorly differentiated carcinoma (). Immunohistochemistry performed for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 were negative and Ki67 proliferative index was approximately 70%. At this time, the patient was referred to the oncology clinic. The patient underwent bilateral breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which revealed multiple suspicious enhancing masses in all four quadrants of the right breast, a possible right pleural based enhancing mass and multiple suspicious masses in the left breast (). She was sent for Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest with intravenous contrast to evaluate the pleural mass and was discovered to have multiple pulmonary nodules. A CT-guided fine needle aspiration of a 1.9 \u00d7 1.2 cm right lower lobe lung nodule showed malignant cells similar to those from the breast biopsies. Subsequent bone scan revealed multifocal osseous disease involving the thoracic, lumbar spine and right ischium, acetabulum and superior ramus. Options for systemic chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic triple negative breast carcinoma were discussed at this time.\nPrior to treatment, she underwent contrast enhanced staging CT of the abdomen and pelvis which revealed a 6.7 \u00d7 6.9 cm mass arising from the lower pole of the right kidney (, ). Given the patient\u2019s young age, history of sickle cell trait, radiologic findings of a large renal mass, multiple lung and breast nodules as well as the histological picture, the diagnosis of metastatic renal medullary carcinoma was considered.

He had been taking metformin for diabetes mellitus, but no anticoagulants. His medical history included an endoscopic mucosal resection for early gastric cancer 6 years before presentation. Lower back pain also preceded his current symptoms and had been treated conservatively with intravenous ketamine and midazolam.\nOn physical examination, motor strength was 4 out of 5 for left knee extension and foot dorsiflexion, with no measurable atrophy. The patient had severe radiating pain and hyperesthesia in the 4th and 5th lumbar dermatomes. His straight leg raising test and deep tendon reflex were negative. Coagulation parameters were within the normal range. Plain radiographs of the lumbar spine revealed spondylotic changes, but no instability. Computed tomography (CT) showed bony erosion and a punched-out lesion at the left 5th lumbar facet joint and an extradural mass. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a sharp-margined mass with mixed signal intensity eroding the adjacent vertebral body. The mass severely compressed the thecal sac and root (). The patient underwent surgery in the prone position. The lesion was accessed via a paramedian intermuscular approach, and a transforaminal corridor was formed with a facetectomy of the 4th inferior lumbar facet and medial part of the 5th superior lumbar facet. The articular surface of the facet joint was discolored by a hematoma with a dark brown color. We identified an extensive hematoma between the two layers of ligamentum flavum which extended to the epidural space (). The old form of hematoma has more elasticity than usual spinal epidural hematoma. The tough capsule containing the hematoma was connected with the facet joint between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebra. After removing a large amount of the hematoma and capsule, we could identify the adjacent root and thecal sac. The entire procedure was performed while preserving",
