The girl complained of gradually reducing urinary frequency to twice per day and prolonged hesitancy. The micturition stream was initially weak and slow before becoming interrupted. Straining did not produce stronger urinary stream. She had never suffered from urinary tract infections (UTIs) or constipation and opened her bowels daily.\nFollowing an episode of acute cystitis 2 months later, she completely lost her ability to void. She was put on indwelling Foley urinary catheter, and her cystitis was successfully treated with antibiotics. After every attempt to remove the urinary catheter, she had to be catheterized again with 300 to 1200 mL of urine volume registered. She noted loss of urge to urinate and felt only dull pain in suprapubic region and right iliac fossa on extreme bladder distention. The girl was kept on indwelling urethral urinary catheter and referred to a tertiary center to determine the etiology of her urinary retention.\nShe was examined with normal clinical findings and no obvious pathology on abdominal and pelvic ultrasound scan (USS). A pediatric neurologist found nothing abnormal, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine, electromyography (EMG) of the lower extremity, somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP) of tibial nerve, electroencephalogram (EEG), and lumbar puncture were with no pathology. On USS, the gynecologist described multiple follicular cysts on ovaries bilaterally and found no pathology explaining her urinary retention.\nOur pediatric urologist performed an examination under general anesthesia including a free calibration of the urethra up to 26F followed by normal findings on cystoscopy.

    "original_text": "In a 19-year-old, mentally disabled male, chest radiography was done because of a sudden episode of cough. Metallic, hook-shaped foreign bodies were identified in both the main bronchi.\nThe right-sided FB was removed by fiber-optic bronchoscopy in the regional hospital, whilst the left-sided extraction failed with the left-sided FB persisting in the left main bronchus ().\nUpon urgent admission in a tertiary institution, extraction was attempted by rigid bronchoscope under general anesthesia. Bronchoscopic extraction failed, associated with some bleeding and subcutaneous emphysema immediately after the intervention. The increasing mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema raised suspicion about an iatrogenic airway lesion, so surgery was indicated. Esophageal injury was previously ruled out by esophagoscopy, revealing many metallic FBs in the stomach. At thoracotomy, a significant mediastinal emphysema (), together with diffuse adhesions, was noticed.

Radical mastectomy was then performed, due to pectoralis major muscle infiltration, consisting in removal of the breast along with the major and minor pectoralis muscles. Biopsy of the sentinel lymph node was performed. Gross examination revealed a solid tumor measuring 3.7 \u00d7 3.5 cm with a yellowish-tan cut surface and local foci of hemorrhage. Histopathology showed intravascular papillary proliferation of endothelial cells, spindle cell areas and necrosis, atypia and prominent mitotic figures, consistent with the diagnosis of high-grade angiosarcoma with areas of infiltration of the pectoralis major muscle (HE staining, magnification of 400\u00d7) (Fig. ). Histopathology also demonstrated a surgical specimen with clear margins, absence of angiolymphatic and perineural invasion, in addition to sentinel lymph node free of metastasis. Immunohistochemical study revealed a tumor positive for CD31 marker (Fig. ), confirming the vascular nature of the tumor.

    "original_text": "A 36-year-old woman (height, 147 cm; weight, 50 kg) with CIPA was scheduled for revision of left total hip arthroplasty. She was diagnosed as having CIPA because of recurrent episodes of unexplained fever, anhidrosis, burns, and bone fractures after birth. She had previously undergone 7 operations for spinal deformity and 1 operation of total hip arthroplasty in both the left and right sides. Although lack of general diaphoresis and thermal nociception were observed, the patient performed body surface cooling at her own discretion when she felt she was at a risk of hyperthermia, and her body temperature was kept approximately 36\u00b0C. No signs of mental retardation or orthostatic hypotension were observed. No abnormality was detected on chest radiographs and electrocardiograms. Blood biochemistry revealed no abnormality except mild anemia indicated by a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dl.\nNo premedication was administered. After the patient was brought into the operating room, routine monitoring and measurement of the bispectral index (BIS) were started. Body temperature was measured at 3 different sites (urinary bladder, esophagus, and precordial skin) and controlled by a hot-air-type heater. Propofol was administered at an effect-site concentration of 4 \u03bcg/ml by target-controlled infusion. After muscle relaxation had been achieved by administration of 50 mg of rocuronium, the trachea was intubated. Immediately after endotracheal intubation, systolic blood pressure increased from 130 to 145 mmHg, and heart rate increased from 60 to 95 beats per minute (bpm).

Moreover, the ulcer caused arterial bleeding, thus traditional endoscopic hemostasis was difficult to achieve; thus, effective hemostasis was not attained. Due to the large amount of bleeding, poor endoscopic field of vision, and small operating space, the ulcer could not be treated. Thus, the patient was immediately transferred to surgery, and a gastroenterostomy (Billroth II) + Bancroft operation was performed. During the operation, ulcers with scabs were observed near the descending part of the duodenal bulb and the ulcerated area was deep. After determining the area for surgical excision, it was still difficult to fully expose the intestinal tubes of the duodenal ulcer from the outside; therefore, the surgeon at the local hospital selected the Billroth II + Bancroft operation.

Her urine culture study demonstrated Escherichia coli of more than 100,000 colony forming units/mL. During evaluation, renal ultrasonography showed normal findings, but VCUG was performed to detect VUR by a skilled pediatric radiologist and pediatrician on the seventh day of her hospital stay. A 5-Fr. foley catheter with a balloon was inserted into the urethra, and residual urine was removed. An 80 mL - a mixture of saline and contrast media, was instilled using a 50-mL syringe, under a fluoroscopic guide until the dome of the bladder completely distended. The bladder was normal in contour, and a grade II VUR within the right ureter and a grade III VUR within the left ureter were noted (). Afterwards, the 5-Fr. foley catheter was removed. During the voiding time, she voided spontaneously. However, in just a few seconds, intraperitoneal contrast media was observed (). On physical examination, the patient was found tachypneic with a distended and tender abdomen. Her vital sign was checked as respiratory rate was 32 per minute, and blood pressure was 103/67. The patient was transferred to the urology department. She was immediately sent to the operating room and underwent exploration. Urine, blood clots and contrast media were evacuated from the peritoneum.

On presentation, radiologic assessment of the left hand and arm showed tongue-like lucencies projecting into the metaphyses consistent with childhood HPP. She did not have any clinical features of skeletal involvement of the lower limbs and no motor developmental delay except for a mild waddling gait as a younger child.

On extra oral examination, a firm swelling extending 1 cm from ala of the nose on the left side anteriorly up to 3 cm from the tragus of the left ear posteriorly was noted. On intraoral examination, a massive, solitary proliferative growth measuring 2.5 cm \u00d7 3 cm with irregular margins, extending from the left maxillary canine region up to the posterior part of the hard palate, was evident. The lesion was crossing the midline at the midpalatal region. Mucosa over the swelling was erythematous in appearance and the labial, buccal, and palatal sulci were obliterated due to buccopalatal expansion. It appeared that, at this stage, the swelling had increased in size from its initial description.

Laterally, an erosion of alveolar process of maxilla on left side and involvement of levator anguli oris muscle were seen, with no evidence of neovascularity. The H&E section (provided by the previous hospital of consultation) did not reveal a concrete picture of Hemangioendothelioma.

He had suffered from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis since early childhood. Because the patient had initially been admitted with end-stage renal disease, his primary renal diagnosis was unknown, but secondary amyloidosis due to rheumatic disease was suspected.\nThe patient received induction therapy with basiliximab followed by an immunosuppressive regimen consisting of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and prednisolone. Because of CMV mismatch he also received valganciclovir prophylaxis. He was discharged ten days after transplantation with serum creatinine of 83 \u03bcmol/L. On day 11 after transplantation pronounced proteinuria with a protein-creatinine ratio of 3.34 g/g was noted. An allograft biopsy showed ten normal glomeruli with negative immunohistology, and early recurrent primary FSGS was deemed to be the most likely diagnosis. Despite nine PE sessions with exchange of one plasma volume each (5% human albumin as substitution fluid) over a period of three weeks, proteinuria remained significantly elevated after an initial decline from 5.5 g/g to around 3.5 g/g. Treatment with rituximab was not considered a therapeutic option because of severe immunoglobulin deficiency (IgG 370 mg/dL). Instead, after extensive discussion with the patient, a single dose of abatacept 10 mg per kg body weight was given. In order to avoid overimmunosuppression the MMF dose was reduced from 1000 mg to 500 mg daily. Within the next three weeks, proteinuria decreased to 1.5 g/g creatinine but over another three weeks began to rise again until it peaked at 4.5 g/g. The patient's serum creatinine increased to 151 \u03bcmol/L. A second allograft biopsy showed progressive disease with diffuse mesangial expansion ().\nElectron microscopy revealed dystrophic podocytes with flattened foot processes ().\nThe patient was treated with further eight PEs, which reduced proteinuria to around 3.0 g",

The initial emergency physician started treatment according to standard protocols. Her cervical spine was immobilized with a stiff collar and a pelvic compression belt was applied anticipating a pelvic injury. With a Glasgow Coma Scale of 14 at that time, there was no need for an emergency intubation. Her vital signs were documented; she had an arterial blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg and a heart rate of 86 beats per minute, indicating a negative shock index.\nDuring transport she received 2\u00d7500 ml of crystalloid fluids (Sterofundin; B. Braun Melsungen, Germany). At our emergency department a multidisciplinary team of trauma surgeons, anesthesiologists, a neurosurgeon, a visceral surgeon, and a radiologist was awaiting the patient.

A physical examination according to the guidelines of Advanced Trauma Life Support showed no signs for an airway, breathing, or circulation problem (ABC-problem). Her thorax was stable and there were no indications for deterioration in gas-exchange. The pelvic splint applied by the emergency physician was left in place. An abdominal examination by a trained visceral surgeon showed no signs of tension or muscular defense. There were no visible abdominal contusion marks. Numerous fractures of her extremities were suspected, which were immediately repositioned and splinted. A focused assessment with sonography for trauma indicated no pleural effusion or pericardial effusion, and no free abdominal fluid, air, or hints for organ lacerations.

She had a previous medical history of left-sided ductal breast cancer with lymph node involvement in 1999, which was treated chronologically with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, partial mastectomy, axillary lymph node dissection, and radiation therapy. In addition, in 2001, a right-sided localised ductal breast cancer in situ was identified and was treated surgically with a partial mastectomy. Secondary to her lymph node dissection, she developed lymphoedema of her left arm, which had been continuously treated with compression stockings. The patient was on treatment with an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker due to hypertension, and in addition, she had a known systolic murmur, characterized as physiological, as transthoracic echocardiographs in 2011 and 2017 were normal. Since her surgery in 1999, on a total of six occasions prior to her last and seventh visit, of which the first episode occurred in 2008, she had been treated for erysipelas in her left upper arm.

She was suffering from multiple comorbidities like hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, bronchial asthma, major depression, and vertigo. She also had a history of stroke 15 years back. Preoperatively, she was on nifedipine 10 mg twice daily, acarbose 50 mg twice daily, aspirin 75 mg once daily, and atorvastatin 20 mg once daily. She was using inhalational bronchodilators on and off for asthmatic exacerbations. She was also being treated for depression and was on dosulepin 75 mg once daily and quetiapine 25 mg once daily. For vertigo, she was on betahistine 20 mg twice daily, along with flunarizine 10 mg once daily. On reviewing her medical chart, she was found to be suffering from restless leg syndrome, for which she was taking pramipexole 0.25 mg twice daily. There was no history of any drug allergies, and she denied any addiction or drug abuse. There was no previous anesthesia exposure.\nShe was scheduled for a modular bipolar hemiarthroplasty surgery. The preoperative blood investigations, chest X-ray, and electrocardiogram (ECG) were within normal limits, except for anemia with hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dl. The patient was classified as an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification III, and the surgery was planned under subarachnoid block.

The right inferior phrenic artery had a normal origin from the abdominal aorta, and it followed its usual course. The celiac artery then gave a hepatogastric trunk at a distance of 2.5 cm from its origin.

Further, from the celiac trunk arose the splenic artery and a common hepatic artery. The common hepatic artery trifurcated into three terminal branches: a middle hepatic artery, the right gastric artery, and the gastroduodenal artery []. The gastroduodenal artery traversed behind the first part of duodenum and bifurcated into the right gastroepiploic artery and the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery.\nThe right hepatic artery arose as a branch of the superior mesenteric artery at a distance of 3 cm from the origin of superior mesenteric artery.

She had no significant medical or surgical history and no history suggestive of thromboembolism. She had never used any oral contraceptives or other hormonal preparations. Upon arrival, her vital signs were stable without fever (BP 120/78 mmHg, pulse rate 88/min, respiratory rate 19/min, and body temperature 37.1\u00b0C). The hematologic examination revealed marked leukocytosis (WBC 24,200/CMM) and relative intravascular depletion (hematocrit 44.5%). Coagulation profile and biological tests were within normal limits. Obstetric ultrasound showed a normal male fetus compatible with his gestational age. In addition, a mild fatty change in the liver and a moderate amount of ascites were also noted. The fetal monitor showed that the uterus contracts every 10 minutes. She was initially kept for conservative treatment (fasting, nasogastric suction) and absolute bed rest under the suspicion of acute gastroenteritis and preterm labor. However, signs of acute peritonitis gradually developed within 6 hours after admission. Thus, an emergency exploration was performed to find a segmental gangrene of the small intestine with 1,500 mL of serosanguineous peritoneal fluid, but no frank obstruction and perforation was identified (). The premature baby, at 1,850 grams, was then delivered via cesarean section, with an Apgar score of 4 at one minute and 6 at five minutes. The gangrenous small intestine was resected, and a primary anastomosis was performed. Her postoperative course was uncomplicated, and she was discharged one week after surgery. The outcome of the baby was also excellent without any sequela after intensive care.

Asymptomatic renal insufficiency was detected at the age of 28 years when a cirrhosis of the left kidney and mild hydronephrosis of the right kidney were found. Serum creatinine was 3.2 mg/dl (normal range 0.6\u20131.2 mg/dl), proteinuria was 2.5 g/d. He reported no increased susceptibility to infections, and his chronic renal insufficiency caused only mild clinical symptoms (development of fatigue and tachycardia upon physical strain).\nThe mRNAs encoding the membrane-bound and secreted immunoglobulin heavy chains are produced from identical primary transcripts, which are differently processed at their 3\u2032 ends. Regulation of membrane-bound vs. secreted forms of the immunoglobulin heavy chains depends on the competition of 2 mutual cleavage polyadenylation sites (pAs/pAm) (). In mice targeted deletion of the mu heavy chain cleavage polyadenylation site pAs leads to deficiency of secreted IgM with intact expression of surface IgM and normal secretion of other immunoglobulin isotypes (). Therefore, we sequenced mu heavy chain gene including the polyadenylation sites in both patients with sIgMD and found no alterations (data not shown). Both patients' B cells were able to express precursor, secreted and membrane IgM mRNA (Figure ). Furthermore protein expression of monomeric and native pentameric IgM (Figure ) and surface expression of IgM on the B cell membrane (data not shown) was comparable to healthy controls.\nTo elucidate the genetic basis of the patients' selective IgM deficiency we used a targeted resequencing approach to sequence potential candidate genes.

Radical cystectomy was conducted. Only carcinoma in situ (CIS) was found in the surgical specimen, and the surgical margin was negative. There was no cancer cell infiltration in the resected uterus or anterior wall of the vagina, and no lymph node involvement was detected. The patient developed continuous pain and bleeding from the residual vagina in 2010, and a tumor was found in the residual vagina; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed it to be located on the anterior wall (). A biopsy of the tumor revealed a pathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma (). Computed tomography (CT) and bone scintigraphy revealed no metastasis. Based on a preoperative diagnosis of a primary adenocarcinoma occurring on the residual vagina, tumor resection was performed (). The sigmoid colon was partially resected as it was strongly adherent to the tumor. On pathological examination, adenocarcinoma and SCC were detected (); on immunohistochemistry, sections of the tumor were positive for the SCC markers CD56, chromogranin A, and synaptophysin and were negative for the urothelial carcinoma markers GATA-3, p63, uroplakin, thrombomodulin, and 34\u03b2E12. We then reexamined the original TURBT specimen and confirmed the presence of SCC (). Adenocarcinoma and SCC were mostly present in the superficial layer of the TURBT specimen, while high-grade UC was found in the deeper layers where muscle invasion was present. Based on these findings, the tumor was diagnosed as a recurring bladder tumor. Local recurrence and pelvic bone metastasis were detected via MRI 3 months after the patient underwent surgical resection of the vaginal recurrence, whereupon she underwent radiation therapy (52 Gy, 26 fractions).

He had no habit of drinking alcohol or smoking tobacco. He was diagnosed as having a right renal tumor and underwent right nephrectomy laparoscopically. The pathological diagnosis was right renal cell carcinoma (RCC), clear cell carcinoma, pT1bN0M0, v1 (Fig. ). One and half years later, lymph node swelling was detected at hepatic portal region and he underwent lymphadenectomy. The pathological diagnosis was a metastasis from RCC. Two years after diagnosis, he was suspected of lung metastases and started treatment with interferon \u03b1. Three years later, the multiple lung metastases grew larger and were determined as progression despite interferon \u03b1 therapy. At this point, he was referred to our hospital in October 2016. There were no abnormalities on physical examination and his vital signs were normal. He started treatment with sunitinib 50 mg/day on a schedule of 4 weeks on treatment and 2 weeks off; however, adverse events including grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 49,000/\u03bcL), gum swelling, and hoarseness became intolerable 2 weeks after starting sunitinib. Four weeks after cessation of sunitinib 50 mg/day, he was started on a dose of sunitinib 25 mg/day on a schedule of 2 weeks on and 1 week off. Computed tomography (CT) findings in January 2017 revealed that his lung metastases had shrunk; however, he continued to experience the same adverse events. Therefore, the dose of sunitinib was further reduced to 12.5 mg/day on a schedule of 2 weeks on and 1 week off. CT findings in May 2017 revealed new metastases in the pleura, diaphragm, and the right paracolic gutter (Fig. a, b). As a result, the treatment was changed from sunitinib to axitinib and he started treatment with axitinib at 10 mg/day; however, adverse events including gum swelling",

The mass was not tender, but it was associated with symptoms of tingling sensation and paresthesia in the left ring and little fingers that had lasted for 4 years. Preoperative image studies revealed an encapsulated and multilobulated mass compatible with a lipoma, which measured 8 cm \u00d7 5 cm \u00d7 2 cm (Fig. ).\nUnder general anesthesia, the mass was operated by a T-shaped skin incision (Fig. ). The mass was mainly located in the subcutaneous layer, however, deep extensions were seen reaching into the carpal tunnel, the hypothenar muscles, and intertendinous spaces between the left index and little fingers. The palmar digital branches of the ulnar nerve for the ring and little fingers passed through the mass and the branch for the little finger was firmly attached to it (Fig. ). To enable a complete excision of the mass, the branch for the little finger was temporarily transected.

She was discharged home on oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and asked to follow up with ophthalmology as an outpatient. Despite compliance with the prescribed oral antibiotics, her symptoms worsened significantly, thus prompting presentation to our institution.\nOn evaluation, visual acuity was 20/25 OD and no light perception OS. The left pupil was 4 mm and nonreactive with a left relative afferent pupillary defect. She had left proptosis with complete ophthalmoplegia. She also had left upper and lower eyelid edema and erythema and significant resistance to retropulsion of the left globe (). Intraocular pressure was 80 mm Hg OS.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the orbits with contrast showed an enlarged left lacrimal sac, a large complex fluid collection in the inferomedial left orbit, and severe tenting of the posterior globe (). There was an interval decrease in the size of the left lacrimal sac compared to prior CT, suggestive of posterior rupture into the orbit with subsequent decompression of the sac.\nThe patient was started promptly on intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam and taken emergently to the operating room.

Given their diagnostic uncertainty, the authors performed a bedside ultrasound of the knee using a 13-6 MHz linear transducer (Sono-Site M-Turbo, Bothell, WA).

Following the IVC insertion, he had been treated with warfarin for one year and had been on anti-platelet therapy since.\nHe had been admitted to the hospital three days prior to transfer after presenting with progressive bilateral lower extremity pain and decreased sensation in his gluteal region. Acute bilateral DVTs involving the common femoral and popliteal veins were diagnosed. Over 48 h, despite receiving unfractionated heparin, he developed anuric renal failure and shock. Placement of a right internal jugular dialysis catheter was complicated by airway compromise due to a retropharyngeal haematoma necessitating endotracheal intubation. The heparin infusion was discontinued and the patient was transferred to our hospital.\nOn arrival, his mean arterial pressure was 71 (104/53) mmHg while on norepinephrine, vasopressin, and phenylephrine. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.06, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 28 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 312 mmHg, and a lactate of 16 mmol/L. The platelet count was 31 K/\u03bcL. Examination was notable for tense bilateral lower extremity oedema. Dorsalis pedis pulses were detectable with Doppler ultrasound. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed dilation of the distal IVC suggesting thrombosis (Fig. A). Transthoracic echocardiography showed a 25% ejection fraction with no right ventricular dilation or strain. The IVC was collapsible proximal to the hepatic veins. Lower extremity ultrasound confirmed acute bilateral DVTs involving the external iliac and femoral veins. Laboratory evaluations excluded thrombophilia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Infusion of 5 L of isotonic fluid and continuous renal replacement therapy led to a reduction in the vasopressor requirement, a reduction in lactate to 2.",
