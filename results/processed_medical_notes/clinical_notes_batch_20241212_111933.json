The pain persisted in spite of taking rest, wearing a boot, use of insole, and corticosteroid injection. An X-ray was done, and it revealed a Freiberg infraction of the second right metatarsal, which is a type of avascular necrosis. At the age of 15, she developed a gradually progressive erythematous rash on the trunk and proximal upper and lower extremities. She also developed intermittent headaches consistent with migraine at the same time. During a routine sports physical examination, she was noted to have a grade I/VI systolic murmur. Ultimately, she was diagnosed with a patent foramen ovale by a bubble study. Otherwise, her echocardiogram at that time revealed a structurally normal heart, and her electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal except a shortened PR interval (106ms) without any evidence of preexcitation syndrome.\nAt the age of 18 years, she presented to the emergency department due to acute-onset speech difficulty and headache while she was driving her car. In the emergency department, she was given a presumptive diagnosis of complicated migraine and received clonidine, lorazepam, midazolam, and prochlorperazine. She was hypertensive but thought to be secondary to pain response. She was sedated after receiving these medications and was discharged home after normalization of her blood pressure. On awakening from sleep, she was noted to have persistent speech difficulty. As the speech disturbance was persistent for more than 24h, her parents decided to bring her to our emergency department. On arrival to our hospital, her blood pressure was again elevated at 190/112mm Hg, and she had a marked tachycardia. She was given nifedipine, and a stroke code was activated due to her speech difficulty. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale score was three at 28h from the onset of symptoms. She had significant expressive aphasia",

Cervical spine CT scan showed a bilateral facet dislocation on C5-6 and anterior displacement of the C5 vertebral body (a). Cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also showed an anterior displacement of C5 on C6, a complete discoligamentous complex (DLC) injury, which was causing cord compression with extensive edematous cord signal change, and an intramedullary hemorrhage (b).\nDuring the examination, she was conscious with a Glasgow coma scale score of 15 out of 15. The patient\u2019s body weight and height were recorded as 76 kg and 163 cm, respectively, with a BMI of 28.6. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations showed hypotension with desaturation, which was considered to be caused by spinal shock and high-level cord injury. The emergency team applied inotropic agents and mechanical ventilator care. Her lower limbs were flaccid with a power grade of 0, while upper limbs showed a power grade of 3 on the shoulder, elbow, and wrist; however, her fingers were also flaccid with a power grade of 0. Knee and ankle reflexes were diminished with all sensory modalities below the neurological level of injury decreased. Anal tone was flaccid, with sensory function preserved yet hyposensitized.

The digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed the presence of right carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) (). After the temporary occlusion of the right ICA by compression, the anterior communicating artery was not immediately visualized (), and the posterior communicating artery was also not visualized during the vertebral artery angiography (). In addition, the patient could not tolerate the temporary right internal carotid compression test (<2 min) and suffered syncope. If Onyx was used for embolization, a filling balloon needs to be used to temporally occlude the fistula, which would prevent the Onyx from filtrating into the internal artery. However, the filling balloon would block the blood flow of the internal artery, and the blocking time would last for more than 2 min, which may lead to cerebral ischemia. Therefore, Onyx embolization was not suitable for this patient due to lack of good compensation. Simple coil embolization was chosen, because the patient could not afford the high cost. Larger coils were preferred to reduce the number of coil usage. During the operation, double microcatheters were placed, and the first five coils were smoothly filled (). When the 6th coil was filled, the fistula could not be completely filled, although the attempt to adjust the coil was made. Hence, the 6th coil was withdrawn. Due to the withdrawal of the 6th coil, the originally filled five coils were filled closely toward the fistula. The right ICA showed complete occlusion of the fistula and patency of the parent artery (). After 6 months, the DSA revealed no recanalization of the fistula (). After 7 years of follow-up, no symptoms of recanalization occurred. Therefore, the good outcome of this patient suggests that this procedure is feasible for treating the dCCF by simple coil embolization of the fistula.",

For the symptoms, the patient had visited a local otolaryngologist occasionally and had received symptomatic treatments only. She visited our emergency room due to the sudden development of epistaxis. At the time, her systolic blood pressure was measured to be 190 mmHg, but no other specific findings were noted. She was discharged after epistaxis treatment with the recommendation to visit the outpatient clinic. Her blood pressure was again high at 170/120 mmHg, and admission to the department of cardiology was proposed to the patient. After admission, the blood pressures measured on both upper and lower extremities differed by more than 30 mmHg, and chest computed tomography (CT) was taken. On the CT, both lungs showed multiple centrilobular nodules. The patient was again referred to the pulmonary division for additional examinations. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial lung biopsy were performed. Histologically, multinucleated giant cells were observed, coinciding with the findings of HP, and the pathology suggested dental technician\u2019s pneumoconiosis. Thus, the pulmonologist referred the patient to the Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine to evaluate any specific relationship of the disease with her occupation.\nThe patient had suffered from cough, sputum, and dyspnea when walking upstairs for 1 year.

Although he had begun to notice those symptoms 10 years previously, the condition had been followed up conservatively. He had noticed worsening of the swallowing difficulty, had also developed vomiting, and therefore visited a hospital near his home. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed two lower esophageal diverticula on the right and left walls, and he was finally referred to our hospital in December 2014. His medical history included hypertension and bronchial asthma; there was no history of smoking or drinking.\nUpon admission, physical examination of the patient was completely normal. Laboratory findings, including complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and biochemical tests, were all within normal limits. An upper gastrointestinal contrast study revealed two diverticula with diameters of 7.5 \u00d7 5.5 cm and 3 \u00d7 3 cm on the right and left walls, respectively. The entrances of the diverticula were located in the lower esophagus, and the lower esophagus was sigmoid-shaped, and pooling of barium in the diverticulum, delayed passage into the stomach, and dilation of the esophagus were seen (Fig. ). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed the inlet of the diverticulum on the right wall of the lower esophagus at a distance of 34 cm from the incisors and another diverticulum immediately above the esophagogastric junction at a distance of 40 cm from the incisors (Fig. ). The esophagogastric junction was not well opened by air supply (Fig. ). A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed food debris and fluid collection within the diverticula (Fig. , ).

He had been treated previously at a vascular surgery clinic. Surgical resection was performed under general anesthesia during the plastic surgery on January 5, 1996. An excisional biopsy was performed, and the diagnosis of a venous malformation was made. Between 1997 and 2005, ethanol sclerotherapy was performed over ten times. However, the effect of sclerotherapy was unsatisfactory, and the patient continued to experience discomfort in eating because of the large tongue. He exhibited a severe open-bite and mandible prognathism due to the large tongue, at his first visit to our department (Fig. , , ). In addition, a large amount of phleboliths were observed scattered around the mandible (Fig. , ). Cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed lesions on the mouth floor, the glottis, and the supraglottic area, in addition to the entire tongue. There was no significant interval change in the massive venous malformation in the face and neck since August 11, 2005. Partial glossectomy was performed using the keyhole technique, under general anesthesia, on December 29, 2011 (Fig. , , ).

The mother of the patient gave a history that he had no pain or other difficulties. Craniofacial trauma, medication use, environmental allergies or previous surgeries were not reported. His medical history was not significant.\nApproximately 2 years ago, the patient had a history of painless, firm, nontender, well-defined swelling on the right side of the mandible with a duration of 4 weeks. Intraoral examination revealed poor oral hygiene with calculus deposition. 75 was grade II mobile with gingival recession. Bleeding on probing was noted in relation to 55, 16, 75, 36, 85 and 46. Complete blood routine examination was normal. Peripheral smear showed mild hypochromia and eosinophilia. Periodontal therapy was done and oral hygiene instructions were given. On review after 1 week, there was no improvement for fragile gingiva and bleeding on probing. Pus discharge and ulceration were present in 85.46 regions.

He was recently admitted with similar complaints to another hospital where he was found to have a right sided pneumonia and was being treated with intravenous ceftriaxone. Later, suspecting infective endocarditis, gentamicin was added but as the patient was still having persistent fevers of 40\u00b0C, he was referred to our hospital. On examination, the patient was of lean built with grade IV clubbing without cyanosis, and there were no peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis. He had a loud pansystolic murmur on the left sternal edge and had tenderness on palpation of the left upper abdomen. His initial investigations showed a high white blood cell count and C-reactive protein (CRP) (). A chest X-ray showed left mid and right lower lung zone infiltrates, and an ultrasound of the upper abdomen showed an ill-defined splenic lesion without internal vascularity suggesting either an abscess or infarct. Three sets of blood cultures were subsequently negative. Echocardiogram showed vegetation on the VSD patch along with dehiscence, a large VSD, and moderate right ventricular outflow obstruction. A CT abdomen with contrast was done which showed multiple liver, splenic, and lung abscesses with infarcted left kidney and thrombus at the bifurcation of the aorta secondary to the septic embolic phenomenon. Cardiothoracic surgery consultation was sought, and the patient underwent a redo-sternotomy and removal of vegetations from right ventricular outflow tract site, removal of Dacron Patch, and complete repair of TOF. Postoperative echocardiogram did not show any residual VSD or vegetation, only mild left ventricular dysfunction and moderately reduced right ventricle function was seen.

The perpendicular plates were palpable, with prominent screws. At the time, all upper limb pulses were present with no signs of embolic disease. Neurological examination was also unremarkable. A recent Doppler ultrasound suggested that a plate fixation screw was impinging on the subclavian artery wall, causing increased wall thickness. Computer tomographic angiography (CTA) depicted a left subclavian artery pseudoaneurysm, yet there was significant metalware artefact. Thus, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was booked (Figures and ). Yet, prior to undergoing this, he was admitted with sudden worsening of left arm pain and paraesthesia associated with movement despite a viable arm with present distal pulses.\nDigital subtraction angiography via the right common femoral artery (CFA) was performed depicting fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of the mid left subclavian artery posterior to the clavicular plates and screws. Further, a focal area of irregularity was noted along the inferior aspect of the artery at the distal aspect of the aneurysm. On the dynamic study with arm in abduction there was significant compression of the artery by prominent clavicular screws at the site of the pseudoaneurysm.\nThe patient subsequently underwent open surgical repair of the pseudoaneurysm, with orthopaedic surgical assistance for removal of plate fixation screws.

The clavicular head of sternocleidomastoid was divided and the phrenic nerve was distinguished and preserved after retraction of scalenus anterior.

An ultrasound examination at that time revealed the baby to be in a transverse position, and a cesarean section was performed. A female infant was delivered at 26 weeks gestational age with a birth weight of 630 g. She showed some signs of spontaneous respiration but was unable to oxygenate, requiring orotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, and surfactant administration. Her APGAR scores were 6 and 7 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Her hospital course was complicated by a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), for which she treated with ibuprofen. However, although it reduced in size, the patency remained small to moderate with a left to right shunt. Apart from her PDA, the infant remained stable until the thirteenth day, when she experienced respiratory decompensation and decreasing hematocrit. After obtaining blood culture, due to the clinical suspicion of sepsis, she was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, cefotaxime, and vancomycin. Her small volume of enteral feeding was discontinued, and she was given only parenteral nutrition. Blood-stained aspirates from her endotracheal tube raised the concern for pulmonary hemorrhage. There was also evidence of thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy for which she received multiple blood products, including platelets, red cells, and frozen plasma. Over eight hours, she continued to require increased ventilatory settings, and the antibiotic, cefotaxime was changed to meropenem.

The patient then underwent circumferential decompression and fixation, which involved a corpectomy of C6 and total laminectomies of C3 to C7 with anterior instrumentation of plate and screws and posterior lateral mass screws at C5 and C7 (Figure ). The surgery went smoothly and the hospitalization was uneventful. There was a significant improvement in muscle power, and he was able to ambulate at discharge. The patient had been kept in a neck collar postoperation.\nThree weeks postoperation, there was a sudden onset of right hand weakness, the opposite side of his initial presentation. The CT scan demonstrated plate and cage dislodgement that was anteriorly dislocated over the C7 vertebral body (Figures -). There was no dysphagia so we decided to treat him conservatively. He was then put into a halo-vest for immobilization, and his muscle power gradually improved to that of postoperation in a few days. Thus, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility with a halo-vest. At three months postoperation, the patient opted to undergo revision surgery due to the discomfort caused by the halo-vest.

The symptoms had started during a soccer game. After kicking the ball with his right foot, he felt an acute pain in the groin and proximal thigh. At the same time he experienced some sort of \u201cpopping/cracking sensation\u201d in the upper thigh. Following the injury, he was unable to continue playing. He had no history of groin pain or adductor problems before this injury. Intensive physiotherapy after the incident gave no relief of his complaints. When the patient presented to our clinic he still complained of pain and weakness of the right leg.\nAt the physical examination there was no swelling or hematoma. Range of motion of both hip joints was normal and without pain. During contraction of the adductors against resistance there was a palpable mass at the inner proximal thigh with a dimple being more distal. Testing of the hamstrings showed no abnormalities.\nConventional radiographs of the pelvis and the right hip showed no osseous abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an intramuscular hyperintense region in the right adductor longus, with a craniocaudal length of 4.2 centimetres. There was no retraction of the muscle. On the basis of the clinical findings and MRI examination the diagnosis was made: an intramuscular adductor longus rupture ().\nConservative treatment was started, consisting of a physiotherapy focused on stretching of the muscle followed by strength training. After eight weeks, the complaints had resolved and the patient had resumed playing soccer.\nFour years later, the patient presented with a persistent swelling on the inner side of his thigh without pain.\nAdditional MRI examination showed subtle higher signal on T1-weighted images in the previous adductor longus rupture, without any structural abnormalities (). The findings were discussed with the patient and no further treatment was initiated.",

The pro-brain natriuretic peptide level was 3311 pg/mL (normal <300 pg/mL). The results of the thyroid functional tests, autoimmune antibodies parameters, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody tests were within the normal range. The transthoracic echocardiography showed right atrial enlargement, mild tricuspid regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension with the right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) 62 mm Hg. The chest computed tomography (CT) scan images showed bilateral pleural effusion and pulmonary artery widened (Fig. ). The computer CT pulmonary angiography result was negative for pulmonary embolism. Right heart catheter showed pulmonary hypertension with a mean pulmonary artery pressure at 41 mm Hg and pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 16 mm Hg.\nThe initial diagnosis was idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Because of carbon dioxide retention, the patient was treated with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. In terms of drug therapies, he was received digoxin, furosemide, and an injection of vasodilator (Treprostinil), which is a stable, long-acting prostacyclin analog, and has been shown to improve clinical state, functional class, exercise capacity, and quality of life in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.[ After treatment, blood gas analysis indicated the partial pressure of carbon dioxide improved",

Despite a positive family history of angioedema attacks, a long history of recurrent peripheral and abdominal attacks, and more than 100 laryngeal attacks, the patient was only diagnosed with HAE at age 50 (). Typical symptoms included mild peripheral edema of the limbs typically lasting 3 days. Over time skin swelling extended to the abdominal and thoracic walls and head. Some of face edema was followed by aphonia and suffocation. Hours before the onset of an HAE attack, she was always progressively adynamic and these symptoms resolved gradually when the edema became evident. Initially, painful abdominal attacks were rare; however, the patient began to experience weekly abdominal attacks preceded or followed by peripheral edema. The patient repeatedly received hydrocortisone, antihistamines, and epinephrine for the treatment of attacks, all of which were ineffective. Specific treatment with C1-INH concentrate, icatibant, or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was never received in the ED. Following some of these attacks, the gallbladder, appendix, and left ovarium were surgically removed.\nThe fatal attack, occurring at age 52, started with dysphagia, quickly followed by dysphonia and dyspnea. The patient was admitted to a small regional hospital and 6 hours after symptom onset underwent respiratory arrest whilst waiting to receive FFP. Resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful and the autopsy revealed laryngeal edema.\nEvaluation of the case reveals several failings in the patient's treatment: firstly the severity and type of angioedema attack were not correctly recognized or assessed by the emergency physician. Secondly, the ED did not contact the HAE reference center upon admission of the patient to gather details of any previous history of attacks. Finally, the airway was not secured and emergency measures, such as cricothyrotomy, were not prepared in advance nor performed. As a consequence, life-saving measures and effective drug therapy were not provided early enough to prevent the patient's death.",

Evaluation in the ER, which included a hip X-ray and MRI of the lumbar spine (seen in ), revealed only mild lumbar facet arthropathy and moderate left neural foraminal stenosis at L3-L4 without any concomitant hip or spine fracture.\nFollowing discharge, the patient reported worsening low back pain and bilateral lower extremity weakness in both L5 and S1 distributions. Several weeks after the initial fall, the patient was referred to pain management where he was evaluated and eventually underwent a radionuclide bone scan. This revealed mildly increased uptake at L5/S1 but was suspected to be a result of facet osteoarthritis. The patient denied any fever at this time, constitutional symptoms, or recent illness. Review of symptoms and physical exam were unremarkable aside from mild paraspinal tenderness and lumbosacral radiculopathy. The rest of the patient's neurologic exam was normal.

There were hypoesthesia for tactile and vibration distally from C6 on ipsilateral side of the injury site, and sensory disturbance for nociceptive pain and temperature sensation distally from C7 on contralateral side. There was a single laceration of 3 cm in length on the lower-right area of the posterior neck (level of 6th cervical spinous process) (). Magnetic resonance imaging presented a high signal change of the cervical cord and the tract of the stab wound through the right side of the posterior neck at C6-7 on T2-weighted images. The knife injured the cervical cord, passing through the inter-laminar space of C6-7 and avoiding the destruction of bony structures ().\nBased on their clinical and radiological features, the patient was diagnosed with BSS of the C6 neurologic level (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale C) on the right side. There was no acute hemorrhagic lesion or cervical instability requiring surgical treatment, and primary closure of the laceration was performed after massive irrigation. The patient then underwent conservative treatment with systemic steroids, antibiotics, and analgesics. The motor deficits were improved, and the patient was able to walk 7 days after the accident. On 6-month follow-up, the patient returned to the workplace and resumed their normal daily life with only some remaining hypoesthesia and hyperalgesia on the left side without motor weakness.",

In August 2015, she presented at the Department of Oral Surgery of another hospital with a purulent discharge from the pocket of tooth #47. Intraoral radiography showed insufficient root canal filling in the distal root and a foreign body, suspected to be extruded gutta-percha, outside the apex of the mesial root of tooth #47, accompanied by bone absorption around both roots (Fig. ). Two months later, she underwent extraction of tooth #47, removal of the foreign body, and curettage of the periapical lesion, resulting in the disappearance of the pain. However, she noted expansion of the right posterior mandibular bone in March 2016 and was thus referred in May 2016 to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan. Her health and nutritional status were good in spite of a low body mass index (17.0). Both a blood test and a chest X-ray showed normal findings. She had neither lymphadenopathy nor paralysis of the mental/lingual nerve. The right inferior border of the mandibular bone slightly bulged. The socket of tooth #47 was epithelialized, and tooth #46 was vital, with a pocket depth of 3 mm. There was no sinus tract. Panoramic radiography revealed new bone formation at the equivalent sites of teeth #48 and #47 and a radiolucent region around the distal root of tooth #46 (Fig. ). Computed tomography showed continuous absorption from the alveolar bone of the distal root of tooth #46 to the lingual cortical bone at the equivalent of tooth #47 and six granulated hard tissues (Fig. , ).

His medical history reported renal transplantation at the age of 32 for renal failure following paint fixative exposure. Splenectomy was performed during transplantation and his immunosuppressive regimen included corticosteroids and azathioprine. Three days after transplantation, the patient experienced an episode of acute cellular rejection, which was treated with corticosteroid pulses, graft irradiation and antilymphocytic serum. Afterwards, the graft always showed an excellent function (creatinine clearance > 60 mL/min, proteinuria absent, no further rejection episodes in the follow-up). On admission, as the faecal occult blood test was positive, a gastroscopic examination was performed which revealed diffuse redness of the gastric mucosa. Multiple endoscopic biopsies were taken and a diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma from the gastric body was established. The patient was transferred to our centre for staging and surgery. Computerized tomography scan showed diffuse thickening of the posterior wall of the gastric body and fundus, without metastases in other organs. Total gastrectomy and regional lymphadenectomy were performed. EBV DNAemia was < 300 genomes/100 000 lymphocytes. Unfortunately, no information was available about any EBV/CMV mismatch as the patient had been transplanted outside Italy many years before.

She gave a history of a fall from standing height, with onset of low back pain. Around a month later, her left leg pain became a prominent feature, with a symptom duration of approximately five months at the time of injury. She did not experience lumbar epidural or intrathecal injections. She reported no history of fever and no difficulty passing urine. Significant medical history included mild hypertension, of note, and there was no history of malignancy and no history of use of anticoagulant drugs. Both platelet count and prothrombin time were in the normal range. On examination, there was full power and symmetrical reflexes in both lower extremities. Patchy reduction in sensation to the left lower limb was noted. She was given a left L5 nerve root block which was only effective for 3 days. The patient and/or her families were informed that data from the case would be submitted for publication and gave their consent.\nA lumbar MRI without gadolinium (Gd) had been performed prior to evaluation (4 months after symptom onset) in a previous hospital ().

His initial anti-rejection medications included tacrolimus (4 mg daily), mycophenolate (2 g daily) and prednisone (10 mg daily). From a transplantation perspective, he tolerated this regimen well. In 2009, however, he developed a small area of cSCC just above his right eyebrow. This was locally excised with clear margins.

His second recurrence was characterized as well-differentiated cSCC, resected with clear margins but associated with perineural invasion. He received targeted radiation of 5000cg to the surgical site. In Aug 2017, cSCC recurred in the skin along the supraorbital rim, again with perineural invasion.

Her past medical history and familial history were unremarkable. From about two years previously, she had noticed the mass, but it had been left untreated because of being painless and not showing rapid enlargement. However, it also showed no tendency to improve, and then its swelling gradually worsened.\nAt the time of her consultation at a primary care clinic for otorhinolaryngology, a cartilage-like elastic hard mass was palpable in the right buccal mucosa, so incisional biopsy was performed. The histopathological diagnosis suggested the inclusion of malignant tumor derived from the minor salivary glands, such as adenoid cystic carcinoma or mucoepidermoid carcinoma, in the differential diagnosis. A month later, she first visited our department.

The overlying mucosal surface had no erosion or ulceration ().

She also complained of pain behind the right ear. Apparently, the handle of the bicycle hit her right mastoid process during the fall. There was no history of ear or nose bleeding or discharge. There was no loss of consciousness or other neurological symptoms.\nOn examination, the child was conscious and well oriented. There was bruising and ecchymosis over the right mastoid process and abrasions over the left cheek. Her best-corrected visual acuity for distance and near was 6/6 and N6, respectively, in both eyes. Anterior segment examination and indirect fundoscopy were unremarkable in both eyes. Pupils were round, regular, and reacting briskly to both direct and consensual light in both eyes. Extraocular movement examination showed abduction limitation of \u22125 in the right eye []. There was a compensatory face turn of 15\u00b0 to the right side. The Prism cover test showed manifest esotropia of 35 prism diopters (PD) for distance 25 PD for near. Saccade assessment showed floating saccades during attempted abduction of the right eye. Clinical evaluation of other cranial nerves was unremarkable. A diagnosis of acute right abducens nerve palsy secondary to closed head trauma was made. The child had been examined by a physician before presentation where she was found to be neurologically stable. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain had been done, which did not reveal any hemorrhage or fractures. Due to the presence of ecchymosis behind the ear (Battle's sign), possible fracture of the temporal bone was suspected, and a high-resolution CT scan of the temporal bone was ordered.

He was then admitted, and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain showed cystic astrocytoma in the right parietal lobe without midline shifting. A craniotomy was performed, and the pathology showed astrocytoma (World Health Organization (WHO) grade III). After operation, he received 2-dimensional conformal RT with a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the whole brain. Mild skin erythematous change was noted after the completion of RT.\nDuring a regular follow-up of 14 years after postoperative adjuvant RT, a small red nodule was noted at the patient's right scalp. The size of the nodule increased overtime and the color eventually turned to black within a year. This gray-colored skin papule with a diameter of 2.5 cm has an ulcerative center. He received skin tumor excision at the age of 42. The skin tumor was totally removed with an adequate margin. The pathology revealed BCC. The morphology of the tumor featured basaloid cells which extended into the dermis with elongated nuclei and little cytoplasm. The peripheral cell layer of the tumor masses showed a palisade arrangement of the nuclei (Fig. ). No skin tumor recurrence has been noted to date.\nTwo years later, the patient developed headache, left side weakness with unsteady gait at the age of 44. His brain MRI revealed a huge cystic lesion with fluid-fluid level in the patient's right frontal lobe. There were hemorrhage, perifocal edema, mass effect causing mild midline shift. Second craniotomy was performed, and there was presence of microvascular of festoons gliosis, microcalcification and tiny foci of necrosis in the specimen, which favored the diagnosis of glioblastoma (WHO grade IV).",
